Retrieved on 2009-11-05.</ref>) is an American [[writer]] of [[romance novel]]s, including 19 [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestsellers]]. She has also been published under the pen names '''Bonnie Drake''' and '''Billie Douglass'''.\n\n==Biography==\nDelinsky was born on August 9, 1945 near [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  Her mother died when she was only eight.\n\nIn 1963, she graduated from Newton High School, in [[Newton, Massachusetts]].  She then went on to earn a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Psychology]] from [[Tufts University]] and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[Sociology]] at [[Boston College]].\n\nDelinsky married Steve Delinsky, a law student, when she was very young. During the first years of her marriage, she worked for the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  After the birth of her first child, she took a job as a photographer and reporter for the ''[[Belmont Herald]]'' newspaper.  She also filled her time doing volunteer work at hospitals, and serving on the Board of Directors of the Friends of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and their Women's Cancer Advisory Board.\n\nIn 1980, after having twins, Delinsky read an article about three female writers, and decided to try putting her imagination on paper.  After three months of researching, plotting, and writing, she sold her first book. She began publishing for [[Dell Publishing|Dell Publishing Company]] (Candlelight Ecstasy Romance) as Billie Douglass, for [[Harlequin Enterprises|Silhouette Books]] (S. Intimate Moments and S. Desire) as Billie Douglass, and for [[Harlequin Enterprises]] as Barbara Delinsky. Now, she only uses her married name Barbara Delinsky, and some of her novels published under the other pseudonyms, are being published under this name. Since then, over 30 million copies of her books are in print, and they have been published in 25 languages.  One of her novels, ''A Woman's Place'', was made into a [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] movie starring [[Lorraine Bracco]].\n\nIn 2001, Delinsky branched out into nonfiction with the book ''Uplift: Secrets from the Sisterhood of Breast Cancer Survivors.''   A [[breast cancer]] survivor herself, Barbara donates the proceeds of that book and her second nonfiction work to charity.  With those funds she has been able to fund an [[oncology]] fellowship at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] that trains breast surgeons.\n\nThe Delinsky family resides in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]. Steve Delinsky has become a reputed lawyer of the city, while she writes daily in her office above the garage at her home.\n\n==Awards==\n*''Twilight Whispers'': 1987 Golden Medallion - Single Title Release winner & 1988 Rita Awards - Best Novel winner\n*''Commitments'': 1988 RT Reviewers' Choice - Contemporary Novel winner\n*''Heart of the Night'': 1989 RT Reviewers' Choice - Contemporary Romantic Suspense winner\n*''A Woman's Place'': A TRR 5 Heart Keeper\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===As Bonnie Drake===\n\n====Single novels====\n*''The Passionate Touch'' (1981)\n*''Surrender by Moonlight'' (1981)\n*''Sweet Ember'' (1981)\n*''Sensuous Burgundy'' (1981)\n*''The Ardent Protector'' (1982)\n*''Whispered Promise'' (1982)\n*''Lilac Awakening'' (1982)\n*''Amber Enchantment'' (1982)\n*''Lover From the Sea'' (1983)\n*''The Silver Fox'' (1983)\n*''Passion and Illusion'' (1983)\n*''Gemstone'' (1983)\n*''Moment to Moment'' (1984)\n\n===As Billie Douglass===\n\n====Single novels====\n*''Search for a New Dawn'' (1982)\n*''A Time to Love'' (1982)\n*''Knightly Love'' (1982)\n*''Sweet Serenity'' (1982)\n*''The Carpenter's Lady'' (1983)\n*''Fast Courting'' (1983)\n*''Flip Side of Yesterday'' (1983)\n*''Beyond Fantasy'' (1983)\n*''An Irresistible Impulse'' (1983)\n*''Variation on a Theme'' (1984)\n\n===As Barbara Delinsky===\nSome of her novels published under the other pseudonyms, are being published under her real name.\n\n====Single novels====\n*''Bronze Mystique'' (1984)\n*''Finger Prints'' (1984)\n*''Secret of the Stone'' (1985)\n*''Chances Are'' (1985)\n*''First Things First'' (1985)\n*''Threats and Promises'' (1986)\n*''Straight from the Heart'' (1986)\n*''Within Reach'' (1986)\n*''First, Best and Only'' (1986)\n*''Jasmine Sorcery'' (1986)\n*''Twilight Whispers'' (1987)\n*''Cardinal Rules'' (1987)\n*''Heat Wave'' (1987)\n*''Commitments'' (1988)\n*''T.L.C.

The title was spoofed yet again for Freleng's 1956 cartoon ''Two Crows from Tacos''.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film earned $2,350,000 in rentals in the US according to ''Variety''.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/variety173-1949-01#page/n45/mode/1up \"Top Grossers of 1948\", ''Variety'' 5 January 1949 p 46]</ref>\n\nAccording to Warner Bros records, the film earned $2,566,000 domestically and $397,000 foreign.<ref name=\"warners\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0040910}}\n* {{tcmdb title|959}}\n* {{amg title|114804}}\n* {{AFI film|25787}}\n\n{{Looney Tunes movies}}\n{{David Butler}}\n\n[[Category:1948 films]]\n[[Category:1940s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:1940s Western (genre) comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films featuring Bugs Bunny]]\n[[Category:Films directed by David Butler]]\n[[Category:Films shot in California]]\n[[Category:Films set in Texas]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by I.

{"title_page": "Scots property law", "text_new": "'''Scots property law''' governs the rules relating to [[property]] found in the legal jurisdiction of [[Scotland]].  As a hybrid legal system with both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] heritage, Scots property law is similar, but not identical, to property law in [[South African property law|South Africa]] and the American state of [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]].The law of property defines and classifies proprietary rights (for instance, as either real or personal), and determines the methods whereby they are acquired, lost and protected, as well as the consequences of their exercise and the limitations imposed.   \n\n== Legal Sources of Scots Property Law ==\nPrior to the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England & Wales]] reconstitution as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], Scots Property law was largely governed by [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]] and common law decisions by the [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scottish judiciary]]. Its roots predominantly lay in Roman law and the ''[[Jus commune|ius commune]]'', however feudalism was also introduced into Scots property law as a result of the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century.  By the 17th and 18th century, a group of academics, now called the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law, including property law, which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. \n\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]], continued to operate as a separate legal system under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]] and the jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[Parliament of Great Britain|1800]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]]. However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999. so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Real Rights in Scots Property Law  ==\n\n=== '''Personal Rights and Real Rights''' ===\nA fundamental distinction in Scots law is that of '''personal rights''' and '''real rights,''' which follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which the works of Barry Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref> \n\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of the defender committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care), with the result is the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') brings to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>See Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref>\n\n=== ''Numerus Clausus''''':''' ===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights which follows the legal principle, shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''numerus clausus'' is explained in a Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B. Edgeworth, 'The Numerus Clausus Principle in Contemporary Australian Property Law' (2006) 32 Monash U L Rev 387, 387.</ref> \n\nIn Scots property law, the real rights falling within the ''numerus clausus'' have never been formally codified, but it is considered that the primary real right is [[Ownership in Scots Law|ownership]] and subordinate to ownership are the lesser real rights<ref>''Erskine'' II,1,1, 'inferior real rights'.

There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides between property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property, ('''eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.''');''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property, which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult, such as where moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to land. In this situation, the rules of [[Accession (property law)|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland. \n\nAll property in Scots law belongs to one of each class, the result is four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own unique [[Transfer of property in Scots law|rules of transfer]], these are:\n\n* Corporeal heritable property\n* Corporeal moveable property\n* Incorporeal moveable property and Incorporeal heritable property.

As a hybrid legal system with both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] heritage, Scots property law is similar, but not identical, to property law in [[South African property law|South Africa]] and the American state of [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]].The law of property defines and classifies proprietary rights (for instance, as either real or personal), and determines the methods whereby they are acquired, lost and protected, as well as the consequences of their exercise and the limitations imposed.   \n\n== Legal Sources of Scots Property Law ==\nPrior to the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England & Wales]] reconstitution as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], Scots Property law was largely governed by [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]] and common law decisions by the [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scottish judiciary]]. Its roots predominantly lay in Roman law and the ''[[Jus commune|ius commune]]'', however feudalism was also introduced into Scots property law as a result of the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century.  By the 17th and 18th century, a group of academics, now called the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law, including property law, which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. \n\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]], continued to operate as a separate legal system under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]] and the jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[Parliament of Great Britain|1800]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]]. However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999. so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Real Rights in Scots Property Law  ==\n\n=== '''Personal Rights and Real Rights''' ===\nA fundamental distinction in Scots law is that of '''personal rights''' and '''real rights,''' which follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which the works of Barry Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref> \n\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of the defender committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care), with the result is the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') brings to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> Accordingly, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property''' within Scots Private law.<ref>See Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref>\n\n=== ''Numerus Clausus''''':''' ===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights which follows the legal principle, shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''numerus clausus'' is explained in a Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B. Edgeworth, 'The Numerus Clausus Principle in Contemporary Australian Property Law' (2006) 32 Monash U L Rev 387, 387.</ref> \n\nIn Scots property law, the real rights falling within the ''numerus clausus'' have never been formally codified, but it is considered that the primary real right is [[Ownership in Scots Law|ownership]] and subordinate to ownership are the lesser real rights<ref>''Erskine'' II,1,1, 'inferior real rights'.

There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\nAll property in Scots law belongs to one of each class, the result is four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own unique [[Transfer of property in Scots law|rules of transfer]], these are:  \n\n* Corporeal heritable property  \n* Corporeal moveable property  \n* Incorporeal moveable property and Incorporeal heritable property. These are usually discussed together as 'incorporeal property', although the distinction between personal rights and real rights is important to remember. \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides between property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property, ('''eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.''');''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable,''' property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult, such as where moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to land. In this situation, the rules of [[Accession (property law)|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland. \n\n== Corporeal Property ==\n[Section in Edit]\n\n===  Corporeal Heritable Property ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\n=== Corporeal Moveable Property ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\n== Incorporeal Property ==\n[Section in Edit]\n\n=== '''Incorporeal Moveables property''' ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\nIntellectual property{{main|Scots intellectual property law}}\n[[Intellectual property]] (IP) in Scotland is governed mostly by [[statute]] and is governed on a UK wide level.

The arrival of the railroad in 1854 and, three decades later, local attorney Samuel H. Hawkins' construction of the only privately financed railroad in state history, made Americus the eighth largest city in Georgia into the 20th century. It was known as the \"Metropolis of Southwest Georgia,\" a reflection of its status as a cotton distribution center. In 1890, Georgia's first chartered [[electric street car]] system went into operation in Americus. One of its restored cars is on permanent display at the Lake Blackshear Regional Library, a gift from the Robert T. Crabb family who acquired the street car in the 1940s.\n\nThe town was already graced with an abundance of [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] and [[Victorian architecture]] when local capitalists opened the [[Windsor Hotel (Americus)|Windsor Hotel]] in 1892. A five-story Queen Anne edifice, it was designed by a Swedish architect, [[Gottfried L. Norrman]], in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Vice-President Thomas R. Marshall gave a speech from the balcony in 1917 and soon to be New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke in the dining room in 1928.\n\nOn January 1, 1976, the city center was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the ''Americus Historic District.''  The district boundaries were extended in 1979.<ref name=nris/>\n\n===Into the 20th century===\nFor the local minority community, Rev. Dr. Major W. Reddick established the Americus Institute (1897\u20131932). [[Booker T. Washington]] was a guest speaker there in May 1908. Rev. Alfred S. Staley was responsible for locating the state Masonic Orphanage in Americus, which served its function from 1898 to 1940. Both men engineered the unification of the General Missionary Baptist Convention of Georgia in 1915, the former as president and the latter as recording secretary. The public school named in honor of A.S. Staley was designated a National School of Excellence in 1990.\n\nTwo other institutions of higher learning were also established in Americus, the Third District Agricultural and Mechanical School in 1906 (now [[Georgia Southwestern State University]]), and the South Georgia Trade and Vocational School in 1948 (now [[South Georgia Technical College]]). South Georgia Technical College is located on the original site of [http://www.souther-field.com/ Souther Field].\n\nIn [[World War I]], an [[United States Army Air Service|Army Air Service]] training facility, [http://www.souther-field.com/ Souther Field] (now [[Jimmy Carter Regional Airport]]), was commissioned northeast of the city limits. [[Charles A. Lindbergh]], the \"Lone Eagle,\" bought his first airplane and made his first solo flight there during a two-week stay in May 1923. Recommissioned for [[World War II]], [http://www.souther-field.com/ Souther Field] was used for [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilot training (1941\u20131942)<ref>Gilbert S. Guinn, ''The Arnold Scheme: British Pilots, The American South and the Allies Daring Plan'', History Press, 2007</ref> as well as US pilot training before ending the war as a German [[prisoner-of-war]] camp. The town was incorporated in 1832, and the name Americus was picked out of a hat.<ref>{{cite book|title=Weird, Wacky, and Wild Georgia Trivia|last=Watson|first=Stephanie|author2=Lisa Wojna|year=2008|publisher=Blue Bike Books|isbn=978-1-897278-44-4|page=59}}</ref>\n\n*[[Shoeless Joe Jackson]] served as the field manager for the local baseball team after his banishment from professional baseball. A plaque at Thomas Bell Stadium commemorates his contribution to the local baseball program.\n\n===Americus and the Civil Rights Movement===\n[[Koinonia Farm]], an interracial Christian community, was organized near Americus in 1942. Founder [[Clarence Jordan]] was a mentor to [[Millard Fuller|Millard]] and Linda Fuller, who founded [[Habitat for Humanity International]] at Koinonia in 1976 before moving into Americus the following year. In 2005, they founded [[The Fuller Center for Housing]], also in Americus. [[Koinonia Farm]] is currently located southwest of Americus on Hwy. 49.\n\nThe Civil Rights Era in Americus was a time of great turmoil; violent opposition to Koinonia by racist elements led to the bombing of a store uptown in 1957. Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] spent a weekend in the courthouse jail in 1961, after an arrest in Albany. The \"Sumter Movement\" to end [[racial segregation]] was organized and led by Rev. Joseph R. Campbell in 1963. As a direct result, two Georgia laws were subsequently declared unconstitutional by a federal tribunal meeting in Americus. Color barriers were first removed in 1965 when J.W. Jones and Henry L. Williams joined the Americus police force. Lewis M. Lowe was elected as the first black city councilman ten years later. With their election in 1995, Eloise R. Paschal and Eddie Rhea Walker broke the gender barrier on the city's governing body.\n\nIn 1971, the city was featured in a [[Marshall Frady]] article, \"Discovering One Another in a Georgia Town\", in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. The portrayal of the city's school integration was relatively benign, especially considering the community's history of troubled race relations. Americus' nadir in this respect had occurred in 1913, when a young black man named Will Redding was lynched by a white mob. A group of young African Americans were standing on the corner of Cotton Avenue and Lamar street.  One of those men was Will Redding.  Police chief Barrow ordered them to move away from the corner, all complied except Redding.  The chief tried to arrest Redding and a struggle ensued.  Will Redding was then hit with the Chief's gun, afterwards, Redding grabbed the gun and shot the police chief.  Will Redding was then chased down, shot, and put in jail.  An angry mob went into the jail and tore down the door to Redding's cell.  When the door was completely torn down, the mob dragged Will Redding out onto Forsyth street and beat him to death using crow bars and hammers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Alan|title=Remembering Americus Georgia: Essays on Southern Life|date=July 30, 2006|publisher=History Press (SC)|isbn=9781596291317|pages=73\u201374https://books.google.com/books?id=svf_7DV9i6UC&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=remembering+americus+georgia+essays&source=bl&ots=8fJVoP2Xbf&sig=Z4YA9QeYHCJoQkww6tZLuGRoLv4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=J64cVLmbAoGZyAS8lIHYDg&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=remembering%20americus%20georgia%20essays&f=false }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 3259\n|1880= 3635\n|1890= 6398\n|1900= 7674\n|1910= 8063\n|1920= 9010\n|1930= 8760\n|1940= 9281\n|1950= 11389\n|1960= 13472\n|1970= 16091\n|1980= 16120\n|1990= 16512\n|2000= 17013\n|2010= 17041\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=15309\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 17,013 people, 6,374 households, and 4,149 families residing in the city.

The arrival of the railroad in 1854 and, three decades later, local attorney Samuel H. Hawkins' construction of the only privately financed railroad in state history, made Americus the eighth largest city in Georgia into the 20th century. It was known as the \"Metropolis of Southwest Georgia,\" a reflection of its status as a cotton distribution center. In 1890, Georgia's first chartered [[electric street car]] system went into operation in Americus. One of its restored cars is on permanent display at the Lake Blackshear Regional Library, a gift from the Robert T. Crabb family who acquired the street car in the 1940s.\n\nThe town was already graced with an abundance of [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] and [[Victorian architecture]] when local capitalists opened the [[Windsor Hotel (Americus)|Windsor Hotel]] in 1892. A five-story Queen Anne edifice, it was designed by a Swedish architect, [[Gottfried L. Norrman]], in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Vice-President Thomas R. Marshall gave a speech from the balcony in 1917 and soon to be New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke in the dining room in 1928.\n\nOn January 1, 1976, the city center was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the ''Americus Historic District.''  The district boundaries were extended in 1979.<ref name=nris/>\n\n===Into the 20th century===\nFor the local minority community, Rev. Dr. Major W. Reddick established the Americus Institute (1897\u20131932). [[Booker T. Washington]] was a guest speaker there in May 1908. Rev. Alfred S. Staley was responsible for locating the state Masonic Orphanage in Americus, which served its function from 1898 to 1940. Both men engineered the unification of the General Missionary Baptist Convention of Georgia in 1915, the former as president and the latter as recording secretary. The public school named in honor of A.S. Staley was designated a National School of Excellence in 1990.\n\nTwo other institutions of higher learning were also established in Americus, the Third District Agricultural and Mechanical School in 1906 (now [[Georgia Southwestern State University]]), and the South Georgia Trade and Vocational School in 1948 (now [[South Georgia Technical College]]). South Georgia Technical College is located on the original site of [http://www.souther-field.com/ Souther Field].\n\nIn [[World War I]], an [[United States Army Air Service|Army Air Service]] training facility, [http://www.souther-field.com/ Souther Field] (now [[Jimmy Carter Regional Airport]]), was commissioned northeast of the city limits. [[Charles A. Lindbergh]], the \"Lone Eagle,\" bought his first airplane and made his first solo flight there during a two-week stay in May 1923. Recommissioned for [[World War II]], [http://www.souther-field.com/ Souther Field] was used for [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilot training (1941\u20131942)<ref>Gilbert S. Guinn, ''The Arnold Scheme: British Pilots, The American South and the Allies Daring Plan'', History Press, 2007</ref> as well as US pilot training before ending the war as a German [[prisoner-of-war]] camp. The town was incorporated in 1832, and the name Americus was picked out of a hat.<ref>{{cite book|title=Weird, Wacky, and Wild Georgia Trivia|last=Watson|first=Stephanie|author2=Lisa Wojna|year=2008|publisher=Blue Bike Books|isbn=978-1-897278-44-4|page=59}}</ref>\n\n*[[Shoeless Joe Jackson]] served as the field manager for the local baseball team after his banishment from professional baseball. A plaque at Thomas Bell Stadium commemorates his contribution to the local baseball program.\n\n===Americus and the Civil Rights Movement===\n[[Koinonia Farm]], an interracial Christian community, was organized near Americus in 1942. Founder [[Clarence Jordan]] was a mentor to [[Millard Fuller|Millard]] and Linda Fuller, who founded [[Habitat for Humanity International]] at Koinonia in 1976 before moving into Americus the following year. In 2005, they founded [[The Fuller Center for Housing]], also in Americus. [[Koinonia Farm]] is currently located southwest of Americus on Hwy. 49.\n\nThe Civil Rights Era in Americus was a time of great turmoil; violent opposition to Koinonia by racist elements led to the bombing of a store uptown in 1957. Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] spent a weekend in the courthouse jail in 1961, after an arrest in Albany. The \"Sumter Movement\" to end [[racial segregation]] was organized and led by Rev. Joseph R. Campbell in 1963. As a direct result, two Georgia laws were subsequently declared unconstitutional by a federal tribunal meeting in Americus. Color barriers were first removed in 1965 when J.W. Jones and Henry L. Williams joined the Americus police force. Lewis M. Lowe was elected as the first black city councilman ten years later. With their election in 1995, Eloise R. Paschal and Eddie Rhea Walker broke the gender barrier on the city's governing body.\n\nIn 1971, the city was featured in a [[Marshall Frady]] article, \"Discovering One Another in a Georgia Town\", in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. The portrayal of the city's school integration was relatively benign, especially considering the community's history of troubled race relations. Americus' nadir in this respect had occurred in 1913, when a young black man named Will Redding was lynched by a white mob. A group of young African Americans were standing on the corner of Cotton Avenue and Lamar street.  One of those men was Will Redding.  Police chief Barrow ordered them to move away from the corner, all complied except Redding.  The chief tried to arrest Redding and a struggle ensued.  Will Redding was then hit with the Chief's gun, afterwards, Redding grabbed the gun and shot the police chief.  Will Redding was then chased down, shot, and put in jail.  An angry mob went into the jail and tore down the door to Redding's cell.  When the door was completely torn down, the mob dragged Will Redding out onto Forsyth street and beat him to death using crow bars and hammers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Alan|title=Remembering Americus Georgia: Essays on Southern Life|date=July 30, 2006|publisher=History Press (SC)|isbn=9781596291317|pages=73\u201374https://books.google.com/books?id=svf_7DV9i6UC&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=remembering+americus+georgia+essays&source=bl&ots=8fJVoP2Xbf&sig=Z4YA9QeYHCJoQkww6tZLuGRoLv4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=J64cVLmbAoGZyAS8lIHYDg&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=remembering%20americus%20georgia%20essays&f=false }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1870= 3259\n|1880= 3635\n|1890= 6398\n|1900= 7674\n|1910= 8063\n|1920= 9010\n|1930= 8760\n|1940= 9281\n|1950= 11389\n|1960= 13472\n|1970= 16091\n|1980= 16120\n|1990= 16512\n|2000= 17013\n|2010= 17041\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=15309\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 17,013 people, 6,374 households, and 4,149 families residing in the city.

The problems were all unsolved at the time, and several of them were very influential for 20th-century mathematics. Hilbert presented ten of the problems (1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 19, 21, and 22) at the [[Paris]] conference of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], speaking on August&nbsp;8 in the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. The complete list of 23&nbsp;problems was published later, most notably in English translation in 1902 by [[Mary Frances Winston Newson]] in the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]''.<ref name=Hilbert_1902>{{cite journal |last=Hilbert |first=David |title=Mathematical Problems |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1902-08-10/home.html |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=8 |issue=10 |year=1902 |pages=437\u2013479|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3 }} Earlier publications (in the original German) appeared in {{cite journal |last=Hilbert |first=David |title=Mathematische Probleme | url=https://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PID=GDZPPN002498863&physid=phys271#navi |journal=G\u00f6ttinger Nachrichten |year=1900 |pages=253\u2013297}} and {{cite journal |last=Hilbert |first=David |title=[no title cited] |journal=Archiv der Mathematik und Physik |series=3 |volume=1 |year=1901 |pages=44\u201363, 213\u2013237}}</ref>\n\n==Nature and influence of the problems==\nHilbert's problems ranged greatly in topic and precision.  Some of them are propounded precisely enough to enable a clear affirmative or negative answer, like the 3rd problem, which was the first to be solved, or the 8th problem (the [[Riemann hypothesis]]). For other problems, such as the 5th, experts have traditionally agreed on a single interpretation, and a solution to the accepted interpretation has been given, but closely related unsolved problems exist.  Sometimes Hilbert's statements were not precise enough to specify a particular problem but were suggestive enough so that certain problems of more contemporary origin seem to apply; for example, most modern [[number theorists]] would probably see the 9th problem as referring to the conjectural Langlands correspondence on representations of the absolute [[Galois group]] of a [[number field]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  Still other problems, such as the 11th and the 16th, concern what are now flourishing mathematical subdisciplines, like the theories of [[quadratic form]]s and [[real algebraic curve]]s.\n\nThere are two problems that are not only unresolved but may in fact be unresolvable by modern standards. The 6th problem concerns the axiomatization of [[physics]], a goal that twentieth-century developments of physics (including its recognition as a discipline independent from mathematics) seem to render both more remote and less important than in Hilbert's time.  Also, the 4th problem concerns the foundations of geometry, in a manner that is now generally judged to be too vague to enable a definitive answer.\n\nThe other twenty-one problems have all received significant attention, and late into the twentieth century work on these problems was still considered to be of the greatest importance.  [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] received the [[Fields Medal]] during 1966 for his work on the first problem, and the negative solution of the tenth problem during 1970 by [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] (completing work of [[Martin Davis (mathematician)|Martin Davis]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[Julia Robinson]]) generated similar acclaim. Aspects of these problems are still of great interest today.\n\n==Ignorabimus==\nFollowing [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], Hilbert sought to define mathematics logically using the method of [[formal system]]s, i.e., [[finitism|finitistic]] proofs from an agreed-upon set of axioms.<ref>{{cite book |pages=464ff |editor-first=Jean |editor-last=van Heijenoort |year=1976 |orig-year=1966 |title=From Frege to G\u00f6del: A source book in aathematical logic, 1879\u20131931 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge MA |isbn=978-0-674-32449-7 |edition=(pbk.)}}<br />''A reliable source of Hilbert's axiomatic system, his comments on them and on the foundational \"crisis\" that was on-going at the time (translated into English), appears as Hilbert's'' \u2018The Foundations of Mathematics\u2019 (1927).</ref> One of the main goals of [[Hilbert's program]] was a finitistic proof of the consistency of the axioms of arithmetic: that is his second problem.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|See Nagel and Newman revised by Hofstadter (2001, p.&nbsp;107),<ref name=Hofstadter_2001>{{cite book |author1=Nagel, Ernest |author2=Newman, James R. |editor=Hofstadter, Douglas R. |editor-link=Douglas Hofstadter |year=2001 |title=G\u00f6del's Proof |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-8147-5816-8}}</ref> footnote&nbsp;37: \"Moreover, although most specialists in mathematical logic do not question the cogency of [Gentzen's] proof, it is not finitistic in the sense of Hilbert's original stipulations for an absolute proof of consistency.\" Also see next page: \"But these proofs [Gentzen's et al.] cannot be mirrored inside the systems that they concern, and, since they are not finitistic, they do not achieve the proclaimed objectives of Hilbert's original program.\" Hofstadter rewrote the original (1958) footnote slightly, changing the word \"students\" to \"specialists in mathematical logic\". And this point is discussed again on page&nbsp;109<ref name=Hofstadter_2001/> and was not modified there by Hofstadter (p.&nbsp;108).<ref name=Hofstadter_2001/>}}\n\nHowever, [[G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem]] gives a precise sense in which such a finitistic proof of the consistency of arithmetic is provably impossible.  Hilbert lived for 12&nbsp;years after [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] published his theorem, but does not seem to have written any formal response to G\u00f6del's work.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Reid reports that upon hearing about \"G\u00f6del's work from Bernays, he was 'somewhat angry'. ...

Observe the use of present tense \u2013 she reports that G\u00f6del and Bernays among others \"answered my questions about Hilbert's work in logic and foundations\" (p.&nbsp;vii).<ref name=Reid_1996/>}}\n\nHilbert's tenth problem does not ask whether there exists an [[algorithm]] for deciding the solvability of [[Diophantine equations]], but rather asks for the ''construction'' of such an algorithm: \"to devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.\" That this problem was solved by showing that there cannot be any such algorithm contradicted Hilbert's philosophy of mathematics.\n\nIn discussing his opinion that every mathematical problem should have a solution, Hilbert allows for the possibility that the solution could be a proof that the original problem is impossible.<ref group=lower-alpha>This issue that finds its beginnings in the \"foundational crisis\" of the early 20th&nbsp;century, in particular the controversy about under what circumstances could the [[Law of Excluded Middle]] be employed in proofs. See much more at [[Brouwer\u2013Hilbert controversy]].</ref> He stated that the point is to know one way or the other what the solution is, and he believed that we always can know this, that in mathematics there is not any \"[[ignorabimus]]\" (statement whose truth can never be known).<ref group=lower-alpha>\"This conviction of the solvability of every mathematical problem is a powerful incentive to the worker. We hear within us the perpetual call: There is the problem. Seek its solution. You can find it by pure reason, for in mathematics there is no ''ignorabimus.''\" (Hilbert, 1902, p.&nbsp;445.)</ref>  It seems unclear whether he would have regarded the solution of the tenth problem as an instance of ignorabimus: what is proved not to exist is not the integer solution, but (in a certain sense) the ability to discern in a specific way whether a solution exists.\n\nOn the other hand, the status of the first and second problems is even more complicated: there is not any clear mathematical consensus as to whether the results of G\u00f6del (in the case of the second problem), or G\u00f6del and Cohen (in the case of the first problem) give definitive negative solutions or not, since these solutions apply to a certain formalization of the problems, which is not necessarily the only possible one.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Nagel, Newman and Hofstadter discuss this issue: \"The possibility of constructing a finitistic absolute proof of consistency for a formal system such as ''Principia Mathematica'' is not excluded by G\u00f6del's results. ... His argument does not eliminate the possibility ... But no one today appears to have a clear idea of what a finitistic proof would be like that is ''not'' capable of being mirrored inside ''Principia Mathematica'' (footnote&nbsp;39, page&nbsp;109). The authors conclude that the prospect \"is most unlikely.\"<ref name=Hofstadter_2001/>}}\n\n==The 24th problem==\n{{Main article|Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem}}\nHilbert originally included 24 problems on his list, but decided against including one of them in the published list. The \"24th problem\" (in [[proof theory]], on a criterion for [[simplicity]] and general methods) was rediscovered in Hilbert's original manuscript notes by German historian {{Interlanguage link multi|R\u00fcdiger Thiele|de|3=R\u00fcdiger Thiele (Mathematiker)}} in 2000.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.maa.org/news/Thiele.pdf |title=Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem |first=R\u00fcdiger |last=Thiele |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |date=January 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Sequels==\nSince 1900, mathematicians and mathematical organizations have announced problem lists, but, with few exceptions, these collections have not had nearly as much influence nor generated as much work as Hilbert's problems.\n\nOne of the exceptions is furnished by three conjectures made by [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]] during the late 1940s (the [[Weil conjectures]]). In the fields of [[algebraic geometry]], number theory and the links between the two, the Weil conjectures were very important {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. The first of the Weil conjectures was proved by [[Bernard Dwork]], and a completely different proof of the first two conjectures via [[\u00c9tale cohomology|\u2113-adic cohomology]] was given by [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. The last and deepest of the Weil conjectures (an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis) was proven by [[Pierre Deligne]]. Both Grothendieck and Deligne were awarded the [[Fields medal]]. However, the Weil conjectures in their scope are more like a single Hilbert problem, and Weil never intended them as a programme for all mathematics. This is somewhat ironic, since arguably Weil was the mathematician of the 1940s and 1950s who best played the Hilbert role, being conversant with nearly all areas of (theoretical) mathematics and having figured importantly in the development of many of them.\n\n[[Paul Erd\u0151s]] posed hundreds, if not thousands, of mathematical [[Paul Erd\u0151s#Erd\u0151s problems|problems]], many of them profound. Erd\u0151s often offered monetary rewards; the size of the reward depended on the perceived difficulty of the problem.\n\nThe end of the millennium, being also the centennial of Hilbert's announcement of his problems, was a natural occasion to propose \"a new set of Hilbert problems.\"  Several mathematicians accepted the challenge, notably Fields Medalist [[Steve Smale]], who responded to a request of [[Vladimir Arnold]] by proposing a list of 18&nbsp;problems. [[Smale's problems]] have thus far not received much attention from the media, and it is unclear how much serious attention they are getting from the mathematical community.\n\nAt least in the mainstream media, the ''de facto'' 21st&nbsp;century analogue of Hilbert's problems is the list of seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]] chosen during 2000 by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]]. Unlike the Hilbert problems, where the primary award was the admiration of Hilbert in particular and mathematicians in general, each prize problem includes a million dollar bounty.  As with the Hilbert problems, one of the prize problems (the [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]]) was solved relatively soon after the problems were announced.\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis is noteworthy for its appearance on the list of Hilbert problems, Smale's list, the list of Millennium Prize Problems, and even in the Weil conjectures, in its geometric guise. Notwithstanding some famous recent assaults from major mathematicians of our day, many experts{{who|date=March 2019}} believe that the [[Riemann hypothesis]] will be included in problem lists for many centuries. Hilbert himself declared: \"If I were to awaken after having slept for a thousand years, my first question would be: Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Mathematical Mysteries: The beauty and magic of numbers\n|first=Calvin C. |last=Clawson |page=258}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, [[DARPA]] announced its own list of 23&nbsp;problems that it hoped could cause major mathematical breakthroughs, \"thereby strengthening the scientific and technological capabilities of [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/33361 |title=The world's 23&nbsp;toughest math questions |date=2008-09-29 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=c120bc7171c203aa5f4b3903aa08e558&tab=core&_cview=0 |title=DARPA Mathematics Challenge solicitation |date=2008-09-26 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nOf the cleanly formulated Hilbert problems, problems 3, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 19, 20, and 21 have a resolution that is accepted by consensus of the mathematical community.

The problems were all unsolved at the time, and several of them were very influential for 20th-century mathematics. Hilbert presented ten of the problems (1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 19, 21, and 22) at the [[Paris]] conference of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], speaking on August&nbsp;8 in the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. The complete list of 23&nbsp;problems was published later, most notably in English translation in 1902 by [[Mary Frances Winston Newson]] in the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]''.<ref name=Hilbert_1902>{{cite journal |last=Hilbert |first=David |title=Mathematical Problems |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1902-08-10/home.html |journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=8 |issue=10 |year=1902 |pages=437\u2013479|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3 }} Earlier publications (in the original German) appeared in {{cite journal |last=Hilbert |first=David |title=Mathematische Probleme | url=https://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PID=GDZPPN002498863&physid=phys271#navi |journal=G\u00f6ttinger Nachrichten |year=1900 |pages=253\u2013297}} and {{cite journal |last=Hilbert |first=David |title=[no title cited] |journal=Archiv der Mathematik und Physik |series=3 |volume=1 |year=1901 |pages=44\u201363, 213\u2013237}}</ref>\n\n==Nature and influence of the problems==\nHilbert's problems ranged greatly in topic and precision.  Some of them are propounded precisely enough to enable a clear affirmative or negative answer, like the 3rd problem, which was the first to be solved, or the 8th problem (the [[Riemann hypothesis]]). For other problems, such as the 5th, experts have traditionally agreed on a single interpretation, and a solution to the accepted interpretation has been given, but closely related unsolved problems exist.  Sometimes Hilbert's statements were not precise enough to specify a particular problem but were suggestive enough so that certain problems of more contemporary origin seem to apply; for example, most modern [[number theorists]] would probably see the 9th problem as referring to the conjectural Langlands correspondence on representations of the absolute [[Galois group]] of a [[number field]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  Still other problems, such as the 11th and the 16th, concern what are now flourishing mathematical subdisciplines, like the theories of [[quadratic form]]s and [[real algebraic curve]]s.\n\nThere are two problems that are not only unresolved but may in fact be unresolvable by modern standards. The 6th problem concerns the axiomatization of [[physics]], a goal that twentieth-century developments of physics (including its recognition as a discipline independent from mathematics) seem to render both more remote and less important than in Hilbert's time.  Also, the 4th problem concerns the foundations of geometry, in a manner that is now generally judged to be too vague to enable a definitive answer.\n\nThe other twenty-one problems have all received significant attention, and late into the twentieth century work on these problems was still considered to be of the greatest importance.  [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] received the [[Fields Medal]] during 1966 for his work on the first problem, and the negative solution of the tenth problem during 1970 by [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] (completing work of [[Martin Davis (mathematician)|Martin Davis]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[Julia Robinson]]) generated similar acclaim. Aspects of these problems are still of great interest today.\n\n==Ignorabimus==\nFollowing [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], Hilbert sought to define mathematics logically using the method of [[formal system]]s, i.e., [[finitism|finitistic]] proofs from an agreed-upon set of axioms.<ref>{{cite book |pages=464ff |editor-first=Jean |editor-last=van Heijenoort |year=1976 |orig-year=1966 |title=From Frege to G\u00f6del: A source book in mathematical logic, 1879\u20131931 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge MA |isbn=978-0-674-32449-7 |edition=(pbk.)}}<br />''A reliable source of Hilbert's axiomatic system, his comments on them and on the foundational \"crisis\" that was on-going at the time (translated into English), appears as Hilbert's'' \u2018The Foundations of Mathematics\u2019 (1927).</ref> One of the main goals of [[Hilbert's program]] was a finitistic proof of the consistency of the axioms of arithmetic: that is his second problem.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|See Nagel and Newman revised by Hofstadter (2001, p.&nbsp;107),<ref name=Hofstadter_2001>{{cite book |author1=Nagel, Ernest |author2=Newman, James R. |editor=Hofstadter, Douglas R. |editor-link=Douglas Hofstadter |year=2001 |title=G\u00f6del's Proof |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-8147-5816-8}}</ref> footnote&nbsp;37: \"Moreover, although most specialists in mathematical logic do not question the cogency of [Gentzen's] proof, it is not finitistic in the sense of Hilbert's original stipulations for an absolute proof of consistency.\" Also see next page: \"But these proofs [Gentzen's et al.] cannot be mirrored inside the systems that they concern, and, since they are not finitistic, they do not achieve the proclaimed objectives of Hilbert's original program.\" Hofstadter rewrote the original (1958) footnote slightly, changing the word \"students\" to \"specialists in mathematical logic\". And this point is discussed again on page&nbsp;109<ref name=Hofstadter_2001/> and was not modified there by Hofstadter (p.&nbsp;108).<ref name=Hofstadter_2001/>}}\n\nHowever, [[G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem]] gives a precise sense in which such a finitistic proof of the consistency of arithmetic is provably impossible.  Hilbert lived for 12&nbsp;years after [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] published his theorem, but does not seem to have written any formal response to G\u00f6del's work.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Reid reports that upon hearing about \"G\u00f6del's work from Bernays, he was 'somewhat angry'. ...

Observe the use of present tense \u2013 she reports that G\u00f6del and Bernays among others \"answered my questions about Hilbert's work in logic and foundations\" (p.&nbsp;vii).<ref name=Reid_1996/>}}\n\nHilbert's tenth problem does not ask whether there exists an [[algorithm]] for deciding the solvability of [[Diophantine equations]], but rather asks for the ''construction'' of such an algorithm: \"to devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.\" That this problem was solved by showing that there cannot be any such algorithm contradicted Hilbert's philosophy of mathematics.\n\nIn discussing his opinion that every mathematical problem should have a solution, Hilbert allows for the possibility that the solution could be a proof that the original problem is impossible.<ref group=lower-alpha>This issue that finds its beginnings in the \"foundational crisis\" of the early 20th&nbsp;century, in particular the controversy about under what circumstances could the [[Law of Excluded Middle]] be employed in proofs. See much more at [[Brouwer\u2013Hilbert controversy]].</ref> He stated that the point is to know one way or the other what the solution is, and he believed that we always can know this, that in mathematics there is not any \"[[ignorabimus]]\" (statement whose truth can never be known).<ref group=lower-alpha>\"This conviction of the solvability of every mathematical problem is a powerful incentive to the worker. We hear within us the perpetual call: There is the problem. Seek its solution. You can find it by pure reason, for in mathematics there is no ''ignorabimus.''\" (Hilbert, 1902, p.&nbsp;445.)</ref>  It seems unclear whether he would have regarded the solution of the tenth problem as an instance of ignorabimus: what is proved not to exist is not the integer solution, but (in a certain sense) the ability to discern in a specific way whether a solution exists.\n\nOn the other hand, the status of the first and second problems is even more complicated: there is not any clear mathematical consensus as to whether the results of G\u00f6del (in the case of the second problem), or G\u00f6del and Cohen (in the case of the first problem) give definitive negative solutions or not, since these solutions apply to a certain formalization of the problems, which is not necessarily the only possible one.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Nagel, Newman and Hofstadter discuss this issue: \"The possibility of constructing a finitistic absolute proof of consistency for a formal system such as ''Principia Mathematica'' is not excluded by G\u00f6del's results. ... His argument does not eliminate the possibility ... But no one today appears to have a clear idea of what a finitistic proof would be like that is ''not'' capable of being mirrored inside ''Principia Mathematica'' (footnote&nbsp;39, page&nbsp;109). The authors conclude that the prospect \"is most unlikely.\"<ref name=Hofstadter_2001/>}}\n\n==The 24th problem==\n{{Main article|Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem}}\nHilbert originally included 24 problems on his list, but decided against including one of them in the published list. The \"24th problem\" (in [[proof theory]], on a criterion for [[simplicity]] and general methods) was rediscovered in Hilbert's original manuscript notes by German historian {{Interlanguage link multi|R\u00fcdiger Thiele|de|3=R\u00fcdiger Thiele (Mathematiker)}} in 2000.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.maa.org/news/Thiele.pdf |title=Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem |first=R\u00fcdiger |last=Thiele |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |date=January 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Sequels==\nSince 1900, mathematicians and mathematical organizations have announced problem lists, but, with few exceptions, these collections have not had nearly as much influence nor generated as much work as Hilbert's problems.\n\nOne of the exceptions is furnished by three conjectures made by [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]] during the late 1940s (the [[Weil conjectures]]). In the fields of [[algebraic geometry]], number theory and the links between the two, the Weil conjectures were very important {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. The first of the Weil conjectures was proved by [[Bernard Dwork]], and a completely different proof of the first two conjectures via [[\u00c9tale cohomology|\u2113-adic cohomology]] was given by [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. The last and deepest of the Weil conjectures (an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis) was proven by [[Pierre Deligne]]. Both Grothendieck and Deligne were awarded the [[Fields medal]]. However, the Weil conjectures in their scope are more like a single Hilbert problem, and Weil never intended them as a programme for all mathematics. This is somewhat ironic, since arguably Weil was the mathematician of the 1940s and 1950s who best played the Hilbert role, being conversant with nearly all areas of (theoretical) mathematics and having figured importantly in the development of many of them.\n\n[[Paul Erd\u0151s]] posed hundreds, if not thousands, of mathematical [[Paul Erd\u0151s#Erd\u0151s problems|problems]], many of them profound. Erd\u0151s often offered monetary rewards; the size of the reward depended on the perceived difficulty of the problem.\n\nThe end of the millennium, being also the centennial of Hilbert's announcement of his problems, was a natural occasion to propose \"a new set of Hilbert problems.\"  Several mathematicians accepted the challenge, notably Fields Medalist [[Steve Smale]], who responded to a request of [[Vladimir Arnold]] by proposing a list of 18&nbsp;problems. [[Smale's problems]] have thus far not received much attention from the media, and it is unclear how much serious attention they are getting from the mathematical community.\n\nAt least in the mainstream media, the ''de facto'' 21st&nbsp;century analogue of Hilbert's problems is the list of seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]] chosen during 2000 by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]]. Unlike the Hilbert problems, where the primary award was the admiration of Hilbert in particular and mathematicians in general, each prize problem includes a million dollar bounty.  As with the Hilbert problems, one of the prize problems (the [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]]) was solved relatively soon after the problems were announced.\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis is noteworthy for its appearance on the list of Hilbert problems, Smale's list, the list of Millennium Prize Problems, and even in the Weil conjectures, in its geometric guise. Notwithstanding some famous recent assaults from major mathematicians of our day, many experts{{who|date=March 2019}} believe that the [[Riemann hypothesis]] will be included in problem lists for many centuries. Hilbert himself declared: \"If I were to awaken after having slept for a thousand years, my first question would be: Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Mathematical Mysteries: The beauty and magic of numbers\n|first=Calvin C. |last=Clawson |page=258}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, [[DARPA]] announced its own list of 23&nbsp;problems that it hoped could cause major mathematical breakthroughs, \"thereby strengthening the scientific and technological capabilities of [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/33361 |title=The world's 23&nbsp;toughest math questions |date=2008-09-29 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=c120bc7171c203aa5f4b3903aa08e558&tab=core&_cview=0 |title=DARPA Mathematics Challenge solicitation |date=2008-09-26 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nOf the cleanly formulated Hilbert problems, problems 3, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17, 19, 20, and 21 have a resolution that is accepted by consensus of the mathematical community.

The two tribes original tribes this season were Kanawa and Kumo. Episode one of this saw the first ever double tribal council to occur in the history of Koh-Lanta. The reason for this was because it was discovered that the Kumo tribe had all openly discussed who would be leaving at the first tribal council.

web|url=http://tele.premiere.fr/Koh-Lanta-saison-5|title=}}</ref>, participants had to kill and cook Puffinus pacificus, a species of fully protected bird in New Caledonia. This caused that several spectators demanded explanations to the TF1 channel. TF1 responded that according to the LPO (in English; League for the Protection of Birds), Puffinus pacificus are not a protected species. LPO asked the CSA (broadcasting regulator in France) to take up the case, and the latter also decided to initiate legal action against TF1 and the producer of the Adventure Line Productions program.\n\nThe petition against the production company was accepted, therefore TF1 was ordered to pay the LPO \u20ac 1,000 in damages and \u20ac 2,000 for procedural expenses, while the TF1 channel lawsuit against the LPO was rejected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news-de-stars.com/koh-lanta/koh-lanta-et-les-animaux-la-lpo-attaque-la-cha-ne-tf1_art29923.html|title=Koh-Lanta et les animaux : La LPO attaque la cha\u00eene TF1|last=|first=|date=|website=news-de-stars.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502115444/http://www.news-de-stars.com/koh-lanta/koh-lanta-et-les-animaux-la-lpo-attaque-la-cha-ne-tf1_art29923.html|archive-date=2013-05-02|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050711015515/http://www.tf1.fr/kohlanta/ (Official Site Archive)]\n\n{{Survivor|SURVINT}}\n\n[[Category:Koh-Lanta seasons|05]]\n[[Category:2005 French television seasons]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television season\n| season_number   = \n| image           = \n| image_alt       = \n| caption         = \n| module1         = {{Infobox reality competition season\n  | presenter       = \n  | num_days        = 40\n  | num_survivors   = 17\n  | winner          = [[:fr:Cl\u00e9mence Castel|Cl\u00e9mence Castel]]\n  | runner_up       =\n  | location        = [[New Caledonia]], '''''Isle of Pines''''' \n  | label1          = \n  | data1           = \n}}\n| country         = \n| num_episodes    = 13\n| network         = \n| first_aired     = July 1, 2005\n| last_aired      = September 6, 2005\n| film_start      = \n| film_end        = \n| episode_list    = \n| prev_season     = {{nowrap|[[Koh-Lanta (season 4)]]}}\n| next_season     = {{nowrap|[[Koh-Lanta (season 6)]]}}\n}}\n'''Koh-Lanta: Pacific''' was the fifth season of the [[France|French]] version of [[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]] Koh-Lanta. This season was held in [[New Caledonia]] on the Isle of Pines. It was broadcast on [[TF1]] from Tuesday July 5, 2005 to Tuesday August 31, 2004. The two tribes original tribes this season were Kanawa and Kumo. Episode one of this saw the first ever double tribal council to occur in the history of Koh-Lanta. The reason for this was because it was discovered that the Kumo tribe had all openly discussed who would be leaving at the first tribal council. Due to the voluntary exit of Sylvie, a joker, Caroline entered the game in episode three. This also caused the re-entrance of Francis into the competition.\n\nThe winner of this season of [[Koh-lanta]] was [[:fr:Cl\u00e9mence Castel|Cl\u00e9mence Castel]], who took home the prize of \u20ac100,000.\n\n== Contestants ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

This caused that several spectators demanded explanations to the TF1 channel. TF1 responded that according to the LPO (in English; League for the Protection of Birds), Puffinus pacificus are not a protected species. LPO asked the CSA (broadcasting regulator in France) to take up the case, and the latter also decided to initiate legal action against TF1 and the producer of the Adventure Line Productions program.\n\nThe petition against the production company was accepted, therefore TF1 was ordered to pay the LPO \u20ac 1,000 in damages and \u20ac 2,000 for procedural expenses, while the TF1 channel lawsuit against the LPO was rejected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news-de-stars.com/koh-lanta/koh-lanta-et-les-animaux-la-lpo-attaque-la-cha-ne-tf1_art29923.html|title=Koh-Lanta et les animaux : La LPO attaque la cha\u00eene TF1|last=|first=|date=|website=news-de-stars.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502115444/http://www.news-de-stars.com/koh-lanta/koh-lanta-et-les-animaux-la-lpo-attaque-la-cha-ne-tf1_art29923.html|archive-date=2013-05-02|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050711015515/http://www.tf1.fr/kohlanta/ (Official Site Archive)]\n\n{{Survivor|SURVINT}}\n\n[[Category:Koh-Lanta seasons|05]]\n[[Category:2005 French television seasons]]\n", "name_user": "Nintenga", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eContestants", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koh-Lanta_(season_5)"}

As a producer, he has produced albums by [[Virginia Wolf]], [[Jimmy Nail]], and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor is well known for his [[falsetto]] vocal range. He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor's first school was Rosebury Avenue school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trevor|first1=Heaton|title=Rock Star's Norfolk Childhood|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref> Taylor moved to [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], in south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]] because of the \"great drums sounds\" on the early Who records.<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | title= Roger Taylor Interview | publisher= Queen Zone | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715215326/http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | archivedate= 15 July 2015 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Another key influence on Taylor was drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] of [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], who Taylor stated was his early role model.<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | title= Roger's Drum Master Class (Music Works - BBC World Service, November 28, 1993) | publisher=Queen Online | accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|London Hospital Medical College]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|title=Roger Taylor |website=Queen official website|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref> but he became bored with it and changed to biology obtaining a BSc at [[University of East London|East London Polytechnic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_09-XX-1975_-_Circus|title=Heavy Meddows Kid|last=Rose|first=Frank|date=|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== 1968\u20131970: Smile ===\n{{Main|Smile (band)}}\n\nTaylor met [[Brian May]] and [[Tim Staffell]] in 1968 after a friend saw an advert on a noticeboard at [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] for a drummer. Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=24 September 2011 | accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs \u2013 for which he got a mention in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref>[http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930042840/http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, after nearly twelve years between solo albums, Taylor planned to release a new studio album titled ''[[The Unblinking Eye (Everything Is Broken)|The Unblinking Eye]]''. The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline \u2013 News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release. It was announced in late 2012 that fans would be able to vote on which songs appeared on the new album, with the album itself slated for release that year.\n\nThe album is called ''[[Fun on Earth]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrock.com/news/rock-news/roger-taylor-to-release-solo-album/ |title=Roger Taylor To Release Solo Album &#124; Rock News &#124; News |publisher=Planet Rock |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> and was released on 11 November 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6296827/queen-roger-taylor-solo-record-adam-lambert|title=Queen's Roger Taylor Talks Solo Work, Hopes Band Will Record With Adam Lambert|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== The Cross ===\n{{Main|The Cross (band)}}\n\nThe Cross were a side project of Taylor's that existed from 1987 to 1993 and released three albums. While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded ''Shove It'' before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after he had played in two successful Queen tours. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take on the responsibility for lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\n''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consisted mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America, but never was. The group having seemingly given up on the UK market, the accompanying tour only included dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not complete) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals not from Taylor, but mainly of Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\" (The B-side to Life Changes, penned by Noone). Blue Rock itself was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was however immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 mins.) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them. In the late 1990s, Edney formed the SAS Band (\"Spike's All Stars\"), a group with an ever-changing line-up of popular '80s musicians.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nTaylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/queen |title=Queen: inducted in 2001 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> and the \"[[Party at the Palace]]\" in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenvault.com/patp.html |title=Party at the Palace |publisher=QueenVault.com |date=3 June 2002 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref> In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the [[Helpmann Award]] for Best Music Direction for the musical [[We Will Rock You (musical)|''We Will Rock You'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpmannawards.com.au/2004/past-nominees-and-winners/industry-awards|title=Past nominees and winners Helpmann Awards|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>  At [[Live Earth]] in 2007, Taylor opened the concert with [[Taylor Hawkins]] of [[Foo Fighters]] and [[Chad Smith]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].\n\nTaylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show ''[[American Idol]]''. The first appearance was on 11 April 2006, during which that week's contestants were required to sing a Queen song. Songs performed included \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\", and \"[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]\".

He said: \"I still think listening to Mitch Mitchell, especially the early stuff with Hendrix, is just fantastic. This fusion of jazz technique and wonderful riffs but with this rolling ferocious attack on the whole kit, it had lots of jazz influences I think. In fact for me he played the kit like a song, it was just wonderful. Total integration into the song. Not just marking time\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nTaylor has also expressed great admiration for [[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, \"The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums \u2013 they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/> However, for just sheer technique, Taylor described the jazz and [[big band]] drummer [[Buddy Rich]] as \"the best I've ever seen\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nSpeaking to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' in 1984, Taylor also described [[Keith Moon]], the drummer of [[the Who]], as \"absolutely brilliant...he had a total unique style; he didn't owe anyone anything.\"<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\"/>\n\n== Tributes ==\nIn 2013, a newly-discovered species of the genus ''[[Heteragrion]]'' (Odonata: Zygoptera) from Brazil was named ''Heteragrion rogertaylori'' after Taylor, in honour of his \"powerful sound, wonderful lyrics and raspy voice \"{{spaced ndash}}one of four ''Heteragrion'' flatwing [[Damselfly|damselflies]] named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen's founding.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2013/f/z03685p080f.pdf|title = Diagnoses and discussion of the group 1 and 2 Brazilian species of Heteragrion, with descriptions of four new species (Odonata: Megapodagrionidae).

As a producer, he has produced albums by [[Virginia Wolf]], [[Jimmy Nail]], and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].\n\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor is well known for his [[falsetto]] vocal range. He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', hosted by [[Mike Read]]. In 2014, he appeared in ''[[The Life of Rock with Brian Pern]]'' as himself.\n\n== Early life ==\nRoger Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk & Lynn Hospital in [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]]. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth (the future queen, [[Elizabeth II]]), where she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King's Lynn and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor's first school was Rosebury Avenue school.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trevor|first1=Heaton|title=Rock Star's Norfolk Childhood|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_03-20-1999_-_Eastern_Daily_Press_-_Rock_Star%27s_Norfolk_Childhood|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press}}</ref> Taylor moved to [[Truro]], [[Cornwall]], in south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the [[ukulele]]. He briefly attended [[Truro Cathedral School]]; at the age of 13, he joined [[Truro School]] as a day boy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com/?g=57322673&cr=6|title=Roger|publisher=themarchoftheblackqueen.piczo.com|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by [[Keith Moon]] of [[the Who]] because of the \"great drums sounds\" on the early Who records.<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | title= Roger Taylor Interview | publisher= Queen Zone | accessdate= 10 August 2015 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150715215326/http://www.queenzone.com/articles/roger-taylor-interview.aspx | archivedate= 15 July 2015 | df= dmy-all }}</ref> Another key influence on Taylor was drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] of [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], who Taylor stated was his early role model.<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\">{{cite web | url= http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/roger-taylor-1/drum-master-class/ | title= Roger's Drum Master Class (Music Works - BBC World Service, November 28, 1993) | publisher=Queen Online | accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|London Hospital Medical College]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/members/roger-taylor/|title=Roger Taylor |website=Queen official website|access-date=15 January 2017}}</ref> but he became bored with it and changed to biology obtaining a BSc at [[University of East London|East London Polytechnic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Roger_Taylor_-_09-XX-1975_-_Circus|title=Heavy Meddows Kid|last=Rose|first=Frank|date=|website=Queen Archives|publisher=Eastern Daily Press|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== 1968\u20131970: Smile ===\n{{Main|Smile (band)}}\n\nTaylor met [[Brian May]] and [[Tim Staffell]] in 1968 after a friend saw an advert on a noticeboard at [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] for a drummer. Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join [[Humpy Bong]], leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.\n\nSmile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \"Earth\" and \"If I Were a Carpenter\".<ref>[http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208151834/http://www.queenzone.com/queenzone/article_show.aspx?Q=11 |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s\u2013present: Queen ===\n{{Main|Queen (band)}}\n[[Image:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor performing with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in 1979.]]\n\nIn 1969, Taylor was working with [[Freddie Mercury]] at the Kensington Market (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Freddie Bulsara, was an avid fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], which led to [[Phil Collins]] joining instead.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/8784298/Queen-40th-anniversary-10-things-you-never-knew.html | title= Queen 40th anniversary: 10 things you never knew | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=24 September 2011 | accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bass guitarist [[John Deacon]], before going on to release their [[Queen (Queen album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.\n\n===1977\u2013present: Solo career===\nTaylor has had a productive solo career, releasing five albums. His first single was his 1977 \"I Wanna Testify\". He recorded it during Queen's sessions for the ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song \"Turn on the TV\".\n\nTaylor's first solo album, ''[[Fun in Space]]'', was released in 1981. Taylor performed all vocals and played all instruments aside of about half of the keyboards, which were done by engineer [[David Richards (record producer)|David Richards]]. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, so he appeared on some European TV shows to promote the single, \"Future Management\", including ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The only other single to come from the album was \"My Country\". The only US single released from the album was \"Let's Get Crazy\".\n\nTaylor's next venture, ''[[Strange Frontier]]'', came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, \"Beautiful Dreams\" (in Portugal only) and \"Man on Fire\", the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen toured to promote ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]'', and Taylor did not perform on any TV shows. ''Strange Frontier'' included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on \"Killing Time\", Deacon remixed the B-side \"I Cry For You\" and [[Rick Parfitt]] co-wrote and played on \"It's An Illusion\". David Richards, Queen's engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Racing in the Street]]\" and [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Masters of War]]\".\n\nIn 1986, Taylor co-produced ''[[Vigilante (Magnum album)|Vigilante]]'', the sixth studio album by rock band [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Patrick Lemieux | author2=Adam Unger |title=The Queen Chronology: The Recording & Release History of the Band|year=2013|page=54|publisher=Across the Board Books|isbn=978-0991984046}}</ref>\n\nAfter Queen finished their 1986 [[A Kind of Magic|Magic Tour]], Taylor started a new band, [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the [[Wickham Festival#History|Gosport Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/roger-taylor-21213223|title=Roger Taylor|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Taylor worked with [[Yoshiki (musician)|Yoshiki]], drummer and pianist of [[X Japan]] and released the song \"Foreign Sand\" and a reworking of the Cross's \"Final Destination\". The album ''Happiness?'' was \"Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger \u2013 thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie\". \"Nazis 1994\" from this album became Taylor's first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, \"Happiness\" and \"Foreign Sand\".\n\nIn 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album ''[[Electric Fire]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&pg=PA499&lpg=PA499&dq=In+1998,+Taylor+released+his+fourth+solo+album+Electric+Fire.&source=bl&ots=XBU0kDQe4_&sig=BBO6TCasZB87g_GSrP6vLq5xblE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinuvqOrMvZAhVBmBQKHZAEB34Q6AEIajAI#v=onepage&q=In%201998,%20Taylor%20released%20his%20fourth%20solo%20album%20Electric%20Fire.&f=false|title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002|last=Gregory|first=Andy|date=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781857431612|language=en}}</ref> He supported it with a small tour in the spring of 1999, on which Brian May joined him at the gig in Wolverhampton. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs \u2013 for which he got a mention in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref>[http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930042840/http://www.queencollector.com/Articles/Solo10/roger.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, after nearly twelve years between solo albums, Taylor planned to release a new studio album titled ''[[The Unblinking Eye (Everything Is Broken)|The Unblinking Eye]]''. The first single, of the same name, was released on 23 November 2009 as a digital download, but due to popular demand it was released as a limited edition single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1517/|title=QueenOnline \u2013 News |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Originally leaked to the official Queen fan club's website for members only, it still managed to be on YouTube within hours of the early bird release. It was announced in late 2012 that fans would be able to vote on which songs appeared on the new album, with the album itself slated for release that year.\n\nThe album is called ''[[Fun on Earth]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetrock.com/news/rock-news/roger-taylor-to-release-solo-album/ |title=Roger Taylor To Release Solo Album &#124; Rock News &#124; News |publisher=Planet Rock |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> and was released on 11 November 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6296827/queen-roger-taylor-solo-record-adam-lambert|title=Queen's Roger Taylor Talks Solo Work, Hopes Band Will Record With Adam Lambert|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\n\n=== The Cross ===\n{{Main|The Cross (band)}}\n\nThe Cross were a side project of Taylor's that existed from 1987 to 1993 and released three albums. While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, ''The Cross'' incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums. The band never enjoyed much commercial success, except in Germany.\n\n=== ''Shove It'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 1.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]] in 1990]]\n\nAfter Queen's 1986 Magic Tour, the band members went their separate ways to do various solo work. Taylor decided to form a new band with whom he could tour. He had already written and recorded the album himself before finding a band to play the songs with. He eventually placed an ad for band members in a national newspaper, hinting he was a famous rock musician. The position of keyboard player was duly offered to [[Spike Edney]] after two successful Queen tours in which Edney had played. When the auditions were over, the line-up was completed by Peter Noone on bass, Clayton Moss on guitar and [[Josh Macrae]] on drums. Taylor himself would take the responsibility on lead vocals and rhythm guitar.\n\nThe first album, ''Shove It'', was released in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Cross-Shove-It/release/6351445|title=The Cross (3) - Shove It|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shove-it-mw0000651910|title=Shove It - Cross {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> In Europe, '[[Heaven for Everyone]]\" (later a Queen song) contained Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and Taylor on backing vocals. However, on the single version and American album version the roles were switched. The European CD contained an extra track (compared to cassette and LP) in the 2nd Shelf Mix, the US version having \"Feel the Force\" as its extra track. The band promoted hard (especially in Germany), with many TV performances of singles including an appearance at the Montreux Golden Rose festival in 1988. The tour took in dates in the UK and Germany. Three singles were released from the album: \"Cowboys and Indians\", \"Heaven for Everyone\" and \"Shove It\". Another single, \"Manipulator\", was released in 1988, but it was not included on any album. It was also the only song from the time that had joint writing credits, Taylor sharing them with Edney and Steve Strange.\n\n=== ''Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know'' ===\n[[Image:The Cross 1990 Neu Isenburg 2.jpg|thumb|Taylor performing with the Cross in 1990.]]\n\nAfter finishing Queen's 1989 album ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'', Taylor went into the studio with the rest of the Cross for the first time to record ''[[Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know (The Cross album)|Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know]]''. The band composed the opening track \"On Top of the World Ma\" with a riff bearing a resemblance to the [[Led Zeppelin]] track \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\". The rest of the album consisted mainly of individually written songs, except for \"Power To Love\" which was the result of the combined effort of Macrae, Noone and Moss. Clayton Moss sang lead vocals on his own track \"Better Things\", and Spike Edney played [[mandolin]] on \"Final Destination\", which was written by Taylor. \"Final Destination\" was released as a single, as were \"Liar\" and \"Power To Love\", the latter being the last single to be released in the UK by the band. \"Final Destination\" came with a live rendition of Taylor's song \"Man on Fire\" as a B-side, and \"Liar\" (Noone) had a brand new track, \"In Charge of My Heart\", which was also penned by Taylor. The 12\" single and CD of \"Liar\" also included extended remixes of both \"Liar\" and \"In Charge of My Heart\". The instrumental section at the beginning of \"In Charge of My Heart\" was used as the opening to concerts on the accompanying tour. \"Closer To You\" (Edney) had been planned to be released in America, but never was. The group having seemingly given up on the UK market, the accompanying tour only included dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Ibiza. Unusual for such tours, every song from the new album was played live.\n\n=== ''Blue Rock'' ===\nMade at a time when Taylor's efforts were concentrated on Queen and Mercury himself, ''[[Blue Rock (album)|Blue Rock]]'' gave the other members of the band a chance to take control of the upcoming album. It was in fact mostly written by Edney, who contributed three of his own tracks and contributed to four more. Once again the opening track was penned by the entire band, \"Bad Attitude\" was written (although not complete) by the Christmas fan club party of 1990. The album itself contained a lot of vocals not from Taylor, but mainly of Edney and Noone. Examples of this can be heard in \"Put It All Down To Love\" (Edney), \"Life Changes\" (Moss, Noone, Edney and Macrae) and \"Heartland\" (The B-side to Life Changes, penned by Noone). Blue Rock itself was only released in Germany (although promo copies were released in Italy and Japan), so copies are somewhat rare. \"New Dark Ages\" (Taylor) was released in Germany with another live version of \"Man on Fire\", whilst \"Life Changes\" was released with the B-side \"Heartland\". It was however immediately withdrawn due to Mercury's death. The tour was in support of [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], so the concert lengths were short (45 mins.) and very few bootlegs have survived. The tour pace was rapid, covering 20 dates in one month.\n\n=== Break-up of the Cross ===\nThe band broke up in 1993 after performing a final show. Taylor continued working with Queen and produced solo albums. Drummer Macrae accompanied Taylor on his solo tours and also played percussion at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Both Taylor and keyboardist Edney participated in the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] tours, while Macrae worked behind the scenes as co-producer, sound engineer and Pro Tools engineer for them.

He said: \"I still think listening to Mitch Mitchell, especially the early stuff with Hendrix, is just fantastic.

In fact for me he played the kit like a song, it was just wonderful. Total integration into the song. Not just marking time\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nTaylor has also expressed great admiration for [[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, \"The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums \u2013 they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/> However, for just sheer technique, Taylor described the jazz and [[big band]] drummer [[Buddy Rich]] as \"the best I've ever seen\".<ref name=\"Roger's Drum Master Class\"/>\n\nSpeaking to ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' in 1984, Taylor also described [[Keith Moon]], the drummer of [[the Who]], as \"absolutely brilliant...he had a total unique style; he didn't owe anyone anything.\"<ref name=\"Roger Taylor Interview\"/>\n\n== Tributes ==\nIn 2013, a newly-discovered species of the genus ''[[Heteragrion]]'' (Odonata: Zygoptera) from Brazil was named ''Heteragrion rogertaylori'' after Taylor, in honour of his \"powerful sound, wonderful lyrics and raspy voice \"{{spaced ndash}}one of four ''Heteragrion'' flatwing [[Damselfly|damselflies]] named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen's founding.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2013/f/z03685p080f.pdf|title = Diagnoses and discussion of the group 1 and 2 Brazilian species of Heteragrion, with descriptions of four new species (Odonata: Megapodagrionidae).
