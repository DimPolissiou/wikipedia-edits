The film, a British-Indian [[co-production (media)|co-production]], was [[Screenplay|written]] by [[John Briley]] and produced and directed by [[Richard Attenborough]]. It stars [[Ben Kingsley]] in the title role.\n\nThe film covers Gandhi's life from a [[History of Pietermaritzburg|defining moment in 1893]], as he is thrown off a South African train for being in a [[White people|whites]]-only compartment, and concludes with his [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassination]] and funeral in 1948.

One visitor, [[Nathuram Godse]], shoots him point blank in the chest. Gandhi exclaims, \"Hey Ram!\", and then falls dead.\n\nIn 1893, the 23-year-old Gandhi is thrown off a [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in South Africa|South African]] train for being an Indian sitting in a first-class compartment despite having a first-class ticket.<ref>pp. 21\u201324, Briley (1983).</ref> Realising the laws are biased against Indians, he then decides to start a [[Satyagraha|nonviolent protest campaign]] for the rights of all [[South African Indians|Indians in South Africa]]. After numerous arrests and unwelcome international attention, the government finally relents by recognising some rights for Indians.<ref>Briley (1983), p. 54, represents Gandhi's final victory in South Africa by depicting [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]] as telling Gandhi, \"a Royal Commission to 'investigate' the new legislation.... I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.... You yourself are free from this moment.\".</ref>\n\nIn 1915, as a result of his victory in South Africa, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence, ([[Swaraj]], [[Quit India]]) from the [[British Empire]]. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a [[Satyagraha|nonviolent non-cooperation campaign]] of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. The 1919 [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] is also depicted in the film.\n\nNevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. In 1930, Gandhi protests against the British-imposed salt tax via the highly symbolic [[Salt March]]. He also travels to [[London]] for [[Second Round Table Conference|a conference]] concerning Britain's possible departure from India; this, however, proves fruitless. After the [[Second World War]],<ref>[[Second World War]] is alluded to in three scenes in the film. Briley (1983) first presents Gandhi, soon after his return from London in the early 1930, as saying \"They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger\" (p. 146). Second, after war is underway (as indicated by a newspaper headline), Gandhi is prevented by the British from speaking when he says he will \"speak against war\" (p. 147); Kasturba then tells the British: \"If you take my husband, I intend to speak in his place\" (p. 147), although she too is prevented from speaking. Third, Margaret Bourke-White and Gandhi discuss whether nonviolence could be effective against Hitler (Gandhi says: \"What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler \u2013 or anyone...\", p. 151).</ref> Britain finally grants [[Partition of India|Indian independence]].<ref>The British commitment to support Indian independence is indicated in the first scene set after WWII, in which Mountbatten arrives at Delhi Airport and then, in press conference, announces: \"We have come to crown victory with friendship \u2013 to assist at the birth of an independent India and to welcome her as an equal member in the British Commonwealth of Nations... I am here to see that I am the last British Viceroy\" (Briley, 1983, p. 155).</ref> Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. The country is subsequently divided by religion. It is decided that the northwest area and the eastern part of India (current-day [[Bangladesh]]), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called [[Pakistan]]. It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] to become the first prime minister of India,<ref>Briley (1983), Gandhi to Jinnah: \"I am asking Panditji to stand down. I want you to be the first Prime Minister of India\" (p. 158).</ref> but the [[Partition of India]] is carried out nevertheless. Religious tensions between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslim]]s erupt into nationwide violence. Horrified, Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops.<ref>In Briley (1983), Gandhi mentions he is on a \"fast\" (p. 168), and later says that he wants \"That the fighting will stop \u2013 that you make me believe it will never start again\" (p. 172).</ref> The fighting does stop eventually.\n\nGandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides,<!--- =INTERPOLATION? BEST TO ADD CITATION---> one of whom (Godse) is involved in a conspiracy to assassinate him.<ref>Briley (1983), p. 179.</ref> Gandhi is cremated and his ashes are scattered on the holy [[Ganges|Ganga]].<ref>Briley (1983), p. 180; in the movie/screenplay, the river is not identified.</ref> As this happens, viewers hear Gandhi in another voiceover from earlier in the film.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Mahatma Gandhi]]\n* [[Rohini Hattangadi]] as [[Kasturba Gandhi]]\n* [[Roshan Seth]] as [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]\n* [[Pradeep Kumar]] as [[V.

In 1952, [[Gabriel Pascal]] secured an agreement with the [[Prime Minister of India]] ([[Jawaharlal Nehru]]) to produce a film of Gandhi's life. However, Pascal died in 1954 before preparations were completed.<ref name=pascal70>See {{cite book |title=The disciple and his devil: Gabriel Pascal, Bernard Shaw |last=Pascal |first=Valerie |year=1970 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-595-33772-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjmEM5mjhfMC&pg=PA219&q=isbn%3A9780595337729%20nehru%20gandhi}} Page 219 states that \"[[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] had given his consent, which he confirmed later in a letter to [[Gabriel Pascal|Gabriel]]: 'I feel... that you are the man who can produce something worthwhile.

Kothari insisted that Attenborough meet him to discuss a film about Gandhi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mkgandhi-sarvodaya.org/short/ev43.htm|title=Gandhi's Inspiring Short Stories|author=|date=|website=www.mkgandhi-sarvodaya.org|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref><ref>Wakeman, John. ''World Film Directors'', Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company, 1988, p. 79.</ref> Attenborough agreed, after reading [[Louis Fischer]]'s biography of Gandhi and spent the next 18 years attempting to get the film made. He was able to meet prime minister Nehru and his daughter [[Indira Gandhi]] through a connection with [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], the last Viceroy of India. Nehru approved of the film and promised to help support its production, but his death in 1964 was one of the film's many setbacks. Attenborough would dedicate the film to the memory of Kothari, Mountbatten, and Nehru.\n\n[[David Lean]] and [[Sam Spiegel]] had planned to make a film about Gandhi after completing ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', reportedly with [[Alec Guinness]] as Gandhi. Ultimately, the project was abandoned in favour of ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962).<ref>''Entirely Up To You, Darling'' by Diana Hawkins & Richard Attenborough; paperback; Arrow Books; published 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-099-50304-0}}</ref> Attenborough reluctantly approached Lean with his own Gandhi project in the late 1960s, and Lean agreed to direct the film and offered Attenborough the lead role. Instead Lean began filming ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]'', during which time Motilai Kothari had died and the project fell apart.<ref>Wakeman (1988), p. 81.</ref>\n\nAttenborough again attempted to resurrect the project in 1976 with backing from [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]]. Then prime minister Indira Gandhi declared a [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency in India]] and shooting would be impossible. Co-producer Rani Dube persuaded prime minister Indira Gandhi to provide the first $10 million from the [[National Film Development Corporation of India]], chaired by [[D. V. S. Raju]] at that time, on the back of which the remainder of the funding was finally raised.<ref>Wakeman (1988), p. 82.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article884479.ece|title=Film producer D.V.S.

Sir Richard Attenborough's ''Gandhi'' is one of them.\"<ref name=kroll82/> The movie \"deals with a subject of great importance... with a mixture of high intelligence and immediate emotional impact... [and] Ben Kingsley... gives what is possibly the most astonishing biographical performance in screen history.\" Kroll stated that the screenplay's \"least persuasive characters are Gandhi's Western allies and acolytes\" such as an English cleric and an American journalist, but that \"Attenborough's 'old-fashioned' style is exactly right for the no-tricks, no-phony-psychologizing quality he wants.\"<ref name=kroll82/> Furthermore, Attenborough\n<blockquote>\nmounts a powerful challenge to his audience by presenting Gandhi as the most profound and effective of revolutionaries, creating out of a fierce personal discipline a chain reaction that led to tremendous historical consequences. At a time of deep political unrest, economic dislocation and nuclear anxiety, seeing \"Gandhi\" is an experience that will change many minds and hearts.<ref name=kroll82/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] there was \"a cycle of film and television productions which emerged during the first half of the 1980s, which seemed to indicate Britain's growing preoccupation with India, Empire and a particular aspect of British cultural history\".<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/J/htmlJ/jewelinthe/jewelinthe.htm JEWEL IN THE CROWN], Museum of Broadcast Communication</ref> In addition to ''Gandhi,''  this cycle also included ''[[Heat and Dust (film)|Heat and Dust]]'' (1983), ''[[Octopussy]]'' (1983), ''[[The Jewel in the Crown (TV series)|The Jewel in the Crown]]'' (1984), ''[[The Far Pavilions]]'' (1984) and ''[[A Passage to India (film)|A Passage to India]]'' (1984).\n\n[[Patrick French]] negatively reviewed the film, writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'':\n<blockquote>An important origin of one myth about Gandhi was Richard Attenborough\u2019s 1982 film. Take the episode when the newly arrived Gandhi is ejected from a first-class railway carriage at Pietermaritzburg after a white passenger objects to sharing space with a \u201ccoolie\u201d (an Indian indentured labourer). In fact, Gandhi's demand to be allowed to travel first-class was accepted by the railway company. Rather than marking the start of a campaign against racial oppression, as legend has it, this episode was the start of a campaign to extend racial segregation in South Africa. Gandhi was adamant that \u201crespectable Indians\u201d should not be obliged to use the same facilities as \u201craw Kaffirs\u201d. He petitioned the authorities in the port city of Durban, where he practised law, to end the indignity of making Indians use the same entrance to the post office as blacks, and counted it a victory when three doors were introduced: one for Europeans, one for Asiatics and one for Natives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/11528461/Gandhi-film-review-amazing-epic.html|title=Gandhi, film review: 'amazing epic'|work=Martin Chilton|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Richard Grenier (newspaper columnist)|Richard Grenier]] in his 1983 article, ''The Gandhi Nobody Knows'', which was also the title of the book of the same name and topic, also criticised the film, arguing it misportrayed him as a \"saint\". He also alleged the Indian government admitted to financing about a third of the film's budget.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-gandhi-nobody-knows/|title=The Gandhi Nobody Knows|work=Richard Grenier|publisher=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary magazine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226171138/http://history.eserver.org/ghandi-nobody-knows.txt |archive-date=26 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Grenier's book later became an inspiration for [[G. B. Singh]]'s book ''[[Gandhi: Behind the Mask of Divinity]]''. Parts of the book also discuss the film negatively. Singh, a long term critic of Gandhi, also went on to co-author ''[[Gandhi Under Cross Examination]]'' with Timothy Watson.\n\nIn the DVD edition of the 1998 film ''[[Jinnah (film)|Jinnah]]'', the director's commentary of the film makes mention of the 1982 film. In the commentary, both Sir [[Christopher Lee]], who portrayed the older [[Muhammed Ali Jinnah]], and director [[Jamil Dehlavi]] criticised the film ''Gandhi'' for its portrayal of Jinnah, arguing it to be demonising and historically inaccurate.\n\n[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively collected 59 reviews and judged 85% of them to be positive, with an average rating of 8.15/10.

The film, a British-Indian [[co-production (media)|co-production]], was [[Screenplay|written]] by [[John Briley]] and produced and directed by [[Richard Attenborough]]. It stars [[Ben Kingsley]] in the title role.\n\nThe film covers Gandhi's life from a [[History of Pietermaritzburg|defining moment in 1893]], as he is thrown off a South African train for being in a [[White people|whites]]-only compartment, and concludes with his [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassination]] and funeral in 1948. Although a practising [[Hinduism|Hindu]], Gandhi's embracing of other faiths, particularly Christianity and Islam, is also depicted.\n\n''Gandhi'' was released in India on 30 November 1982, in the United Kingdom on 3 December, and in the United States on 10 December.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=gandhi.htm|title=Gandhi|publisher=Box Office Mojo|language=English|date=10 December 1982|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref> It was nominated for [[Academy Awards]] in eleven categories, winning eight, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Attenborough, [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Ben Kingsley, and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen]] for Briley.

One visitor, [[Nathuram Godse]], shoots him point blank in the chest. Gandhi exclaims, \"Oh, God!\", and then falls dead.\n\nIn 1893, the 23-year-old Gandhi is thrown off a [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in South Africa|South African]] train for being an Indian sitting in a first-class compartment despite having a first-class ticket.<ref>pp. 21\u201324, Briley (1983).</ref> Realising the laws are biased against Indians, he then decides to start a [[Satyagraha|nonviolent protest campaign]] for the rights of all [[South African Indians|Indians in South Africa]]. After numerous arrests and unwelcome international attention, the government finally relents by recognising some rights for Indians.<ref>Briley (1983), p. 54, represents Gandhi's final victory in South Africa by depicting [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]] as telling Gandhi, \"a Royal Commission to 'investigate' the new legislation.... I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.... You yourself are free from this moment.\".</ref>\n\nIn 1915, as a result of his victory in South Africa, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence, ([[Swaraj]], [[Quit India]]) from the [[British Empire]]. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a [[Satyagraha|nonviolent non-cooperation campaign]] of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. The 1919 [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] is also depicted in the film.\n\nNevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. In 1930, Gandhi protests against the British-imposed salt tax via the highly symbolic [[Salt March]]. He also travels to [[London]] for [[Second Round Table Conference|a conference]] concerning Britain's possible departure from India; this, however, proves fruitless. After the [[Second World War]],<ref>[[Second World War]] is alluded to in three scenes in the film. Briley (1983) first presents Gandhi, soon after his return from London in the early 1930, as saying \"They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger\" (p. 146). Second, after war is underway (as indicated by a newspaper headline), Gandhi is prevented by the British from speaking when he says he will \"speak against war\" (p. 147); Kasturba then tells the British: \"If you take my husband, I intend to speak in his place\" (p. 147), although she too is prevented from speaking. Third, Margaret Bourke-White and Gandhi discuss whether nonviolence could be effective against Hitler (Gandhi says: \"What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler \u2013 or anyone...\", p. 151).</ref> Britain finally grants [[Partition of India|Indian independence]].<ref>The British commitment to support Indian independence is indicated in the first scene set after WWII, in which Mountbatten arrives at Delhi Airport and then, in press conference, announces: \"We have come to crown victory with friendship \u2013 to assist at the birth of an independent India and to welcome her as an equal member in the British Commonwealth of Nations... I am here to see that I am the last British Viceroy\" (Briley, 1983, p. 155).</ref> Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. The country is subsequently divided by religion. It is decided that the northwest area and the eastern part of India (current-day [[Bangladesh]]), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called [[Pakistan]]. It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] to become the first prime minister of India,<ref>Briley (1983), Gandhi to Jinnah: \"I am asking Panditji to stand down. I want you to be the first Prime Minister of India\" (p. 158).</ref> but the [[Partition of India]] is carried out nevertheless. Religious tensions between [[Hindus]] and [[Muslim]]s erupt into nationwide violence. Horrified, Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops.<ref>In Briley (1983), Gandhi mentions he is on a \"fast\" (p. 168), and later says that he wants \"That the fighting will stop \u2013 that you make me believe it will never start again\" (p. 172).</ref> The fighting does stop eventually.\n\nGandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides,<!--- =INTERPOLATION? BEST TO ADD CITATION---> one of whom (Godse) is involved in a conspiracy to assassinate him.<ref>Briley (1983), p. 179.</ref> Gandhi is cremated and his ashes are scattered on the holy [[Ganges|Ganga]].<ref>Briley (1983), p. 180; in the movie/screenplay, the river is not identified.</ref> As this happens, viewers hear Gandhi in another voiceover from earlier in the film.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Mahatma Gandhi]]\n* [[Rohini Hattangadi]] as [[Kasturba Gandhi]]\n* [[Roshan Seth]] as [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]\n* [[Pradeep Kumar]] as [[V.

In 1952, [[Gabriel Pascal]] secured an agreement with the [[Prime Minister of India]] ([[Jawaharlal Nehru]]) to produce a film of Gandhi's life. However, Pascal died in 1954 before preparations were completed.<ref name=pascal70>See {{cite book |title=The disciple and his devil: Gabriel Pascal, Bernard Shaw |last=Pascal |first=Valerie |year=1970 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-595-33772-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjmEM5mjhfMC&pg=PA219&q=isbn%3A9780595337729%20nehru%20gandhi}} Page 219 states that \"[[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] had given his consent, which he confirmed later in a letter to [[Gabriel Pascal|Gabriel]]: 'I feel... that you are the man who can produce something worthwhile. I was greatly interested in what you told me about this subject [the Gandhi film] and your whole approach to it.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1962 Attenborough was contacted by Motilal Kothari, an Indian-born civil servant working with the Indian High Commission in London and a devout follower of Gandhi. Kothari insisted that Attenborough meet him to discuss a film about Gandhi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mkgandhi-sarvodaya.org/short/ev43.htm|title=Gandhi's Inspiring Short Stories|author=|date=|website=www.mkgandhi-sarvodaya.org|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref><ref>Wakeman, John. ''World Film Directors'', Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company, 1988, p. 79.</ref> Attenborough agreed, after reading [[Louis Fischer]]'s biography of Gandhi and spent the next 18 years attempting to get the film made. He was able to meet prime minister Nehru and his daughter [[Indira Gandhi]] through a connection with [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], the last Viceroy of India. Nehru approved of the film and promised to help support its production, but his death in 1964 was one of the film's many setbacks. Attenborough would dedicate the film to the memory of Kothari, Mountbatten, and Nehru.\n\n[[David Lean]] and [[Sam Spiegel]] had planned to make a film about Gandhi after completing ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', reportedly with [[Alec Guinness]] as Gandhi. Ultimately, the project was abandoned in favour of ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962).<ref>''Entirely Up To You, Darling'' by Diana Hawkins & Richard Attenborough; paperback; Arrow Books; published 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-099-50304-0}}</ref> Attenborough reluctantly approached Lean with his own Gandhi project in the late 1960s, and Lean agreed to direct the film and offered Attenborough the lead role. Instead Lean began filming ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]'', during which time Motilai Kothari had died and the project fell apart.<ref>Wakeman (1988), p. 81.</ref>\n\nAttenborough again attempted to resurrect the project in 1976 with backing from [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]]. Then prime minister Indira Gandhi declared a [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency in India]] and shooting would be impossible. Co-producer Rani Dube persuaded prime minister Indira Gandhi to provide the first $10 million from the [[National Film Development Corporation of India]], chaired by [[D. V. S. Raju]] at that time, on the back of which the remainder of the funding was finally raised.<ref>Wakeman (1988), p. 82.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article884479.ece|title=Film producer D.V.S. Raju passes away|author=Special Correspondent|work=The Hindu}}</ref> Finally in 1980 Attenborough was able to secure the remainder of the funding needed to make the film. Screenwriter John Briley had introduced him to [[Jake Eberts]], the chief executive at the new Goldcrest production company that raised approximately two-thirds of the film's budget.\n\nShooting began on 26 November 1980 and ended on 10 May 1981.

Retrieved 18 October 2016.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[Jack Kroll]] stated that \"There are very few movies that absolutely must be seen. Sir Richard Attenborough's ''Gandhi'' is one of them.\"<ref name=kroll82/> The movie \"deals with a subject of great importance... with a mixture of high intelligence and immediate emotional impact... [and] Ben Kingsley... gives what is possibly the most astonishing biographical performance in screen history.\" Kroll stated that the screenplay's \"least persuasive characters are Gandhi's Western allies and acolytes\" such as an English cleric and an American journalist, but that \"Attenborough's 'old-fashioned' style is exactly right for the no-tricks, no-phony-psychologizing quality he wants.\"<ref name=kroll82/> Furthermore, Attenborough\n<blockquote>\nmounts a powerful challenge to his audience by presenting Gandhi as the most profound and effective of revolutionaries, creating out of a fierce personal discipline a chain reaction that led to tremendous historical consequences. At a time of deep political unrest, economic dislocation and nuclear anxiety, seeing \"Gandhi\" is an experience that will change many minds and hearts.<ref name=kroll82/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] there was \"a cycle of film and television productions which emerged during the first half of the 1980s, which seemed to indicate Britain's growing preoccupation with India, Empire and a particular aspect of British cultural history\".<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/J/htmlJ/jewelinthe/jewelinthe.htm JEWEL IN THE CROWN], Museum of Broadcast Communication</ref> In addition to ''Gandhi,''  this cycle also included ''[[Heat and Dust (film)|Heat and Dust]]'' (1983), ''[[Octopussy]]'' (1983), ''[[The Jewel in the Crown (TV series)|The Jewel in the Crown]]'' (1984), ''[[The Far Pavilions]]'' (1984) and ''[[A Passage to India (film)|A Passage to India]]'' (1984).\n\n[[Patrick French]] negatively reviewed the film, writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'':\n<blockquote>An important origin of one myth about Gandhi was Richard Attenborough\u2019s 1982 film. Take the episode when the newly arrived Gandhi is ejected from a first-class railway carriage at Pietermaritzburg after a white passenger objects to sharing space with a \u201ccoolie\u201d (an Indian indentured labourer). In fact, Gandhi's demand to be allowed to travel first-class was accepted by the railway company. Rather than marking the start of a campaign against racial oppression, as legend has it, this episode was the start of a campaign to extend racial segregation in South Africa. Gandhi was adamant that \u201crespectable Indians\u201d should not be obliged to use the same facilities as \u201craw Kaffirs\u201d. He petitioned the authorities in the port city of Durban, where he practised law, to end the indignity of making Indians use the same entrance to the post office as blacks, and counted it a victory when three doors were introduced: one for Europeans, one for Asiatics and one for Natives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/11528461/Gandhi-film-review-amazing-epic.html|title=Gandhi, film review: 'amazing epic'|work=Martin Chilton|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Richard Grenier (newspaper columnist)|Richard Grenier]] in his 1983 article, ''The Gandhi Nobody Knows'', which was also the title of the book of the same name and topic, also criticised the film, arguing it misportrayed him as a \"saint\". He also alleged the Indian government admitted to financing about a third of the film's budget.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-gandhi-nobody-knows/|title=The Gandhi Nobody Knows|work=Richard Grenier|publisher=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary magazine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226171138/http://history.eserver.org/ghandi-nobody-knows.txt |archive-date=26 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> Grenier's book later became an inspiration for [[G. B. Singh]]'s book ''[[Gandhi: Behind the Mask of Divinity]]''. Parts of the book also discuss the film negatively. Singh, a long term critic of Gandhi, also went on to co-author ''[[Gandhi Under Cross Examination]]'' with Timothy Watson.\n\nIn the DVD edition of the 1998 film ''[[Jinnah (film)|Jinnah]]'', the director's commentary of the film makes mention of the 1982 film. In the commentary, both Sir [[Christopher Lee]], who portrayed the older [[Muhammed Ali Jinnah]], and director [[Jamil Dehlavi]] criticised the film ''Gandhi'' for its portrayal of Jinnah, arguing it to be demonising and historically inaccurate.\n\n[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] retrospectively collected 59 reviews and judged 85% of them to be positive, with an average rating of 8.15/10.

It was developed as a co-production between [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Universal Studios]], [[20th Century Fox]], and the American network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It premiered on 12 May 1996 on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada (which was owned by [[Western International Communications|WIC]] at the time before being acquired by [[Canwest Global]] in 2000), 15 days before its first showing in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] and two days before being broadcast in the United States on Fox. It was also shown in some countries for a limited time in cinemas.\n\nThe film was the first attempt to revive ''Doctor Who'' following its suspension in 1989. It was intended as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a new American-produced ''Doctor Who'' TV series.  It introduced [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]] in his only televised appearance as the character until \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" in 2013 (though McGann has portrayed the Doctor also in various audio productions).  It also marks the final appearance of [[Sylvester McCoy]] as the [[Seventh Doctor]], the only appearance of [[Daphne Ashbrook]] as [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Grace Holloway]], and the only appearance of [[Eric Roberts]]'s version of [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].  Although a ratings success in the United Kingdom, the film did not fare well on American television and no series was commissioned. The series was later relaunched on the BBC in 2005.<ref name=\"Segal\" /> The only ''Doctor Who'' episodes between the film and the new series were a 1999 spoof, ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', and a 2003 animation, ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nAlthough the film was primarily produced by different people than the 1963\u20131989 series and intended for an American audience, the producers chose not to produce a \"re-imagining\" or \"[[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]\" of the series but rather a continuation of the original narrative. The production was filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], to date the only episode of ''Doctor Who'' filmed in Canada.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{Long plot|episode|date=June 2017}}\n}}\nFollowing [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]'s trial and execution at the hands of the [[Dalek]]s, [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], currently in his [[Seventh Doctor|seventh incarnation]], is transporting the Master's remains to [[Gallifrey]] via his [[TARDIS]]. En route, the box with the remains breaks open and an ooze leaks out, infecting the TARDIS. The Doctor is forced to make an emergency materialisation in San Francisco's [[Chinatown]] on 30 December 1999.\n\nAs he exits and locks the TARDIS, the Doctor is shot by a gang chasing down Chang Lee, a young [[Chinese-American]] man. Lee calls for an ambulance and escorts the unconscious Doctor to a hospital, unaware the ooze from the TARDIS has gotten aboard the ambulance. At the hospital, after the bullets are removed, [[cardiology|cardiologist]] Dr [[Grace Holloway]] attempts surgery to stabilise his unusual heartbeat, but is confused by his strange double-heart anatomy, and accidentally lodges a cardiac probe in the Doctor's body, apparently killing him. The Doctor's body is taken to the morgue, while Lee steals the Doctor's possessions, including the TARDIS key. Meanwhile, the ooze takes over the body of the ambulance driver, Bruce, transforming him into a new body for the Master.\n\nLater, the Doctor's body [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerates]], and the [[Eighth Doctor|new Doctor]], suffering amnesia, gathers clothes from an upcoming fancy dress party. He recognises Holloway, who has resigned from the hospital after the failed operation, and follows her to her car, proving to her he is the same man by pulling out the cardiac probe. Holloway takes him home to recover. Lee returns to the TARDIS where the Master arrives and puts him under his mind control by claiming the Doctor had stolen his body. The Master convinces Lee to open the TARDIS and then to open the [[Eye of Harmony]] within it, which requires a human retinal scan. When the Eye opens, the Doctor is flooded with memories and realises the Master is searching for him, and tries to block the scan. He warns Holloway that while the Eye is opened, the fabric of reality will weaken, and potentially destroy the Earth by midnight on New Year's Eve if they cannot close it. However, he needs an [[atomic clock]] to do so, and Holloway finds one on display at  the San Francisco Institute of Technological Advancement and Research.\n\nOutside, they find the ambulance with the Master and Lee waiting for them, offering them a ride. The Doctor does not immediately recognise the Master, but discovers his true identity en route, and he and Holloway escape, but not before the Master can spit an ooze-like substance on Holloway's wrist. The two continue to the Institute and obtain the clock, returning to the TARDIS. The Doctor installs the clock and successfully closes the Eye, but finds the damage to reality too great and that he must revert time before the Eye was opened to prevent the destruction of Earth. As he connects the proper TARDIS circuits to do this, the Master remotely takes control of Holloway's body, causing her eyes to become inhuman, and she strikes the Doctor unconscious.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|275px|thumbnail|The Doctor and the Master in their climactic battle]]\nThe Doctor wakes to find himself chained above the Eye, the Master poised to take his remaining regenerations while Lee and Holloway watch. The Doctor is able to break the Master's control on Lee, and Lee refuses to open the Eye for the Master. The Master kills him, and then releases his control on Holloway to return her eyes to normal. He forces her to open the Eye and then begins drawing the Doctor's lifeforce. Holloway, under her own control, is able to complete the final circuits to put the TARDIS into a time-holding pattern, preventing Earth's destruction, and then goes to free the Doctor. The Master kills her, but this has given enough time for the Doctor to free himself and attack the Master. The Doctor gains the upper hand and pushes the Master into the Eye. The Eye closes and time reverts a few minutes, undoing Lee and Holloway's deaths.\n\nWith no further risk to Earth, the Doctor prepares to leave. Lee returns his possessions, and the Doctor warns him not to be in San Francisco on the next New Year's Eve. The Doctor offers Holloway the opportunity to travel with him, but she politely refuses, and instead kisses him goodbye. The Doctor departs alone in his TARDIS.\n\n===Continuity===\n\n*At the beginning of the film, the Seventh Doctor uses a brand new version of the [[Sonic Screwdriver]] to seal the Master's remains in a casket. The device was previously destroyed in [[The Visitation (Doctor Who)| \"The Visitation\"]]. The jelly babies, which the [[Fourth Doctor]] had a fondness for, also reappear during the opening scene and then later during the story.\n\n*The [[Seventh Doctor]] wears his trademark panama hat which he wore throughout his tenure in the Classic Series.\n\n*The [[Eighth Doctor]] mentions that he once met [[Leonardo Di Vinci]] when the artist had a cold and had met [[Puccini]] during the last years of the composer's life.\n\n*The [[Eye of Harmony]] in the [[TARDIS|TARDIS' Cloister Room]] was previously on the Doctor's home planet [[Gallifrey]].\n\n*The [[Eighth Doctor]] shows Grace and Chang Lee where [[Gallifrey]] is on the [[TARDIS|TARDIS' Time/Space Visualiser]], remarking that the planet \"a good ten minutes in this old thing.\"\n\n*The Doctor's romantic nature in this story would later be shown with the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors when the series returned in 2005.\n\n===Cast notes===\n* Yee Jee Tso would later return in 2002 to play Major Jal Brant in the [[Seventh Doctor]] audio drama ''[[Excelis Decays]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/3-Doctor-Who-Excelis-Decays|title=Doctor Who \u2013 Excelis Decays|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref> and Doctor Reece Goddard in the [[Sixth Doctor]] webcast ''[[Real Time (Doctor Who)|Real Time]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/Doctor-Who-Real-Time|title=Doctor Who \u2013 Real Time|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref>\n*Daphne Ashbrook would later return in 2004 alongside [[Paul McGann]]'s [[Eighth Doctor]] as Perfection in the audio drama ''[[The Next Life (audio drama)|The Next Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/64-Doctor-Who-The-Next-Life|title=Doctor Who \u2013 The Next Life|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref>\n* Tso and Ashbrook returned to Big Finish together playing Captain Ruth Matheson and Warrant Officer Charlie Sato of UNIT in the audio dramas ''Tales From The Vault''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/releases/v/tales-from-the-vault-501 |title=6.01.

It was hoped that, would the telemovie be successful, Fox might be persuaded to reconsider a series; however, the telemovie's ratings performance in America was not strong enough to hold Fox's interest.\n\nThe production budget for the movie (as revealed in the book ''Doctor Who: Regeneration'') was US$5 million, with the [[Fox Network]] spending $2.5 million, [[BBC Television]] contributing $300,000, and the remaining $2.2 million split between [[BBC Worldwide]] and [[Universal Television]].\n\n===Casting===\nThe producers of the television movie compiled several lists of actors to consider for the part of the Doctor. Among early thoughts were [[Michael Crawford]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Trevor Eve]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], and [[Jonathan Pryce]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} All were uninterested in the project, or unavailable for the intended filming dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nCasting sessions took place in March 1994; actors who actually auditioned for the role include [[Liam Cunningham (actor)|Liam Cunningham]], [[Mark McGann]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Tim McInnerny]], [[Nathaniel Parker]], [[Peter Woodward]], [[John Sessions]], [[Anthony Head]], and [[Tony Slattery]]. Paul McGann was first considered around the time of these auditions, but did not formally audition for the part until later.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite book |last1=Segal |first1=Philip |authorlink1=Philip Segal |first2=Gary |last2=Russell |authorlink2=Gary Russell |title=Doctor Who:Regeneration |year=2000 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=London |isbn=0-00-710591-6}}</ref>\n\nAmong the actors who were invited to audition for the role of the Doctor but declined the opportunity were [[Christopher Eccleston]]<ref name=\"eccleston\">{{cite journal |author=Hickman, Clayton |authorlink=Clayton Hickman |title=Revolution #9 |page=11 |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=343| location=[[Tunbridge Wells]] |publisher=[[Panini UK]] |date=26 May 2004 }}</ref> and [[Peter Capaldi]].<ref name=\"capaldi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |title=Capaldi could\u2019ve been the Eighth Doctor! |last1=Bates |first1=Philip |date=1 August 2014 |website=Kasterborous.com |accessdate=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053048/http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Eccleston and Capaldi would go on to play the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Twelfth Doctor|Twelfth]] incarnations of the Doctor, respectively, in the revived series of ''Doctor Who'' which began in 2005. Eccleston turned down the offer to audition for the TV Movie because at the time he felt he was not yet an established enough actor and did not want to be associated with a \"brand name\" so early in his career.<ref name=\"eccleston\"/> Capaldi declined because he felt it was unlikely that he would be given the part.<ref name=\"capaldi\"/>\n\nOf those actors who originally auditioned for the role of the Doctor, a number would go on to guest star in the series when it returned from 2005:\n*Anthony Head guest starred in the Series 2 episode \"[[School Reunion]]\" as Mr. Finch.\n*Tim McInnerny guest-starred in the Series 4 episode \"[[Planet of the Ood]]\" as Klineman Halpen.\n*Liam Cunningham guest-starred in the Series 7 episode, \"[[Cold War (Doctor Who)|Cold War]]\" as Captain Zhukov. \n*John Sessions guest-starred in the Series 8 episode \"[[Mummy on the Orient Express]]\" as the voice of the homicidal computer GUS.\n\n===Production===\nThe movie was filmed on 35mm film in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], the first time any ''Doctor Who'' story had been filmed in North America.\n\nIn the 2005 ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode \"Weird Science\", and on the DVD commentary, Sylvester McCoy reveals that during the sequence where he locks the casket with his [[sonic screwdriver]], he held the tool pointing the wrong way around (although in the original series, it is seen being used both ways). The sonic screwdriver was blurred in post-production to conceal the error.\n\n===Post-production===\nThe opening pre-credits sequence went through a number of modifications, with several different voice-overs recorded. At one stage the voice-over was to be made by the old Master, played by Gordon Tipple; in the end this was not used. Tipple is still credited as \"The Old Master\", though in the final edit his appearance is very brief, stationary, and mute. Had the original pre-titles voice-over been used, it would have been unclear what incarnation of the Doctor Sylvester McCoy portrays in the movie (as he is simply credited as \"The Old Doctor\"). Only the rewritten narration (as read by Paul McGann) makes his number of regenerations clear. The sequence of the TARDIS flying through the time vortex was briefly reused in the opening of ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', as the Master observes [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s Doctor.\n\nInstead of designing a new ''Doctor Who'' logo for this film, it was decided instead to use a modified version of the logo that was used for the [[Jon Pertwee]] era of the original series (with the exception of the final season). This logo, being the last logo used on an \"official\" Doctor Who broadcast before the 2005 revival, was, until 2018, used by the BBC for most ''Doctor Who'' merchandise relating to the first eight Doctors. In 2018, efforts were made to make the show's merchandise more uniform, and so most items of merchandise began to use the logo designed for Jodie Whittaker's time as the Doctor, abandoning the \"Movie\" logo for the first time in 22 years.\n\n[[John Debney]] was commissioned to write the score for this film, and intended to replace [[Ron Grainer]]'s original theme with a new composition. Ultimately Debney did in fact use an arrangement of Grainer's music for the theme, although Grainer goes uncredited.\n\n=== Alternative titles and labelling ===\nThere is some disagreement over exactly what the movie should be called. The production documentation only referred to the project as ''Doctor Who''{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Segal suggested the unofficial title ''Enemy Within'' as an alternative at Manopticon 5, apparently after being repeatedly asked what the actual title for the movie was{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Both [[DVD]] releases are labelled ''Doctor Who: The Movie''. The [[VHS]] release contains both the name ''Doctor Who'' and the phrase, ''The Sensational Feature Length Film'' (plausibly read as a subtitle). The most common fan usage appears to refer to it as \"The Television Movie\" or \"TVM\", or variations thereof.\n\nUpon translation into French, this film was renamed ''Le Seigneur du Temps'' (literal translation: \"The Lord of Time\").\n\n\"TVM\" is the production code used in the BBC's online episode guide.<ref name=\"movie\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml\n| title = The TV Movie: Details\n| accessdate = 2007-07-26\n| last = Howe\n| first = David J.\n| authorlink = David J.

This marked the first time that footage from the original BBC series had been shown on a major American network. The advertisements also used a different arrangement of the Doctor Who theme music from that heard in the film.\n\nThe movie received disappointing US ratings. It received 5.6 million viewers, a total 9% share of the audience.<ref name=\"DWM 433 page 53\">{{cite journal| author= Bailey, David|date=April 2011 |title=Doctor Who| journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]| publisher=[[Panini Comics]]| issue=#433| page=53}}</ref> However, when shown on [[BBC One]] in the United Kingdom on Monday 27 May at 8.30pm, thirteen days after its American broadcast, it received over 9 million viewers in the UK alone. It received a 75% [[Audience Appreciation]] score.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[Third Doctor]] actor [[Jon Pertwee]] died a few days after the US broadcast of the film, and the UK broadcast included an epitaph to the actor. The UK broadcast was also edited for broadcast in a pre-[[Watershed (television)|Watershed]] timeslot, with around 1 minute of cuts made. The scenes where Chang Lee's friends are fired upon was cut because of the BBC's sensitivity about [[gun violence]] following the [[Dunblane massacre]] three months before.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The operating room scene was also extensively cut, in particular shots involving the cardiac probe and the Seventh Doctor's dying scream,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the shot of the Master breaking Chang Lee's neck was also removed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMaureen Paton in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' praised the movie \"At last we have a grown-up hi-tech Doctor Who in Paul McGann...only a low-tech Luddite would miss the endearing amateurism of the old teatime serial format...the makers would be mad not to pursue the option of a series.\"<ref name=\"th\">{{cite book |first1=David J. |last1=Howe |authorlink1=David J.

It was the first novelisation of a televised ''Doctor Who'' story to not be published by [[Target Books]] (or related companies) since ''[[The Crusade (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who and the Crusaders]]'' in 1966.\n\nBasing the adaptation on an early draft of the script, Russell adjusted some details to make it more consistent with the original series, and the novelisation also contains elements that were cut from the shooting script for timing reasons.\n* The novel begins with the Seventh Doctor receiving a telepathic summons from the Master (similar to ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') to collect his remains from Skaro and a short prologue detailing how the Doctor escapes from the planet with the casket. This was originally intended to be a pre-credits sequence in the movie, and was subsequently contradicted by the ending of the novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', where [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] gives the Seventh Doctor the assignment to retrieve the Master's remains.\n* More detail is given to Chang Lee and Grace's backstory, including his recruitment into the Triads and his seeking a father figure as well as flashbacks to Grace's childhood.\n* The Eighth Doctor finds the Seventh Doctor's clothing in the hospital rather than the Fourth Doctor's scarf. Also, the sequence where Chang Lee and the Master see the Seventh Doctor in the Eye of Harmony features all the previous Doctors as originally drafted.\n* The scene where the Doctor and Grace meet the motorcycle police officer is relocated to a traffic jam on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (impossible to film in the movie since it was shot on location in [[Vancouver]]).\n* When the Doctor first kisses Grace, he immediately pulls back, grins apologetically and murmurs, \"I'm sorry, don't know what came over me there.\" This makes the romantic nature of the kiss more ambiguous. Instead of the second kiss at the end, he gives her the Seventh Doctor's straw hat as a memento.\n* The Doctor is still referred to as half-human, to which the Master comments, \"The Doctor once claimed to be more than just a Time Lord \u2014 He should really have said ''less'' than a Time Lord!\" This was a reference to a line cut from ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''.\n* Instead of dying and being brought back to life, Grace and Lee are merely rendered unconscious, though aware of what is happening around them. Russell also spends some time showing the Doctor and them discussing what a \"temporal orbit\" is.\n\nThe novelisation was the first ''Doctor Who'' novel published by BBC Books. The book was actually published prior to the conclusion of [[Virgin Books]]' contract for publishing original ''Doctor Who'' fiction, so the next release by BBC Books did not occur for about a year when the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] series began with ''[[The Eight Doctors]]''. The novelisation was released as a standalone work and is not considered part of this series. The Eighth Doctor Adventures series ran until 2005 when it was discontinued.\n\nThe novel was also released as an [[Doctor Who audio releases|audio book]] on 2 June 1997, read by Paul McGann. This reading was later included on the 2004 [[MP3 CD]] ''Tales from the TARDIS Volume Two''. A [[Target Books]] edition titled ''The TV Movie'' will be published in paperback 11 March 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1073116/doctor-who--the-tv-movie--target-collection-/9781785945311.html|title=Doctor Who: The TV Movie (Target Collection)|first=Gary|last=Russell|website=www.penguin.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|1990s}}\n{{Wikiquote|The Eighth Doctor}}\n{{TardisIndexFile|Doctor Who (1996)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0116118|title=Doctor Who (1996) (TV)}}\n* {{BBCCDW|id=tvmovie|title=The TV movie}}\n\n===Reviews===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110414090315/http://www.whoniverse.org/reviews/TVM.php The Whoniverse's review on ''Doctor Who: The Enemy Within'' DVD]\n\n===BBC novelisation===\n*{{Isfdb title|id=364011|title=Doctor Who}}\n\n{{Doctor Who episodes|-}}\n{{Regeneration stories}}\n{{Master stories}}\n{{Dalek stories}}\n{{Skaro stories}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation}}\n{{Geoffrey Sax}}\n{{Doctor Who soundtracks|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doctor Who (1996 Film)}}\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Doctor Who]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Eighth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:1996 television films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:British science fiction films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British television films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction television films]]\n[[Category:Television films as pilots]]\n[[Category:Television pilots not picked up as a series]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1999]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2000]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:The Master (Doctor Who) television stories]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Matthew Jacobs]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Geoffrey Sax]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:Films about amnesia]]\n[[Category:New Year films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Debney]]\n[[Category:Television films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Turn of the third millennium]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the character who appeared in two theatrical ''Dr. Who'' films|Dr. Who (Dalek films)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox Doctor Who episode\n| number             = 156\n| serial_name        = Doctor Who: The Television Movie\n| show               = DW\n| type               = television film\n| image              = [[File:Doctor Who 1996 poster.jpg|230px]]\n| caption            = 1996 promotional poster\n| doctors            =\n* [[Paul McGann]] ([[Eighth Doctor]])\n*[[Sylvester McCoy]] ([[Seventh Doctor]])\n| companion          = [[Daphne Ashbrook]] ([[Grace Holloway]])\n| guests             = \n*[[Yee Jee Tso]] \u2013 Chang Lee\n*[[Eric Roberts]] \u2013 [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]]\n*[[John Novak]] \u2013 Salinger\n*Michael David Simms \u2013 Dr. Swift\n*Eliza Roberts \u2013 Miranda\n*Dave Hurtubise \u2013 Professor Wagg\n*Dolores Drake \u2013 Curtis\n*Catherine Lough \u2013 Wheeler\n*[[Will Sasso|William Sasso]] \u2013 Pete\n*Joel Wirkkunen \u2013 Ted\n*Jeremy Radick \u2013 Gareth\n*Bill Croft \u2013 Motorcyclist Policeman\n*[[Mi-Jung Lee]] \u2013 News Anchor\n*Joanna Piros \u2013 News Anchor\n*Dee Jay Jackson \u2013 Security Man\n*Gordon Tipple \u2013 The Master on Trial\n| director           = [[Geoffrey Sax]]\n| writer             = [[Matthew Jacobs]]\n| script_editor      = None\n| producer           = Peter V.

It was developed as a co-production between [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Universal Studios]], [[20th Century Fox]], and the American network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It premiered on 12 May 1996 on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada (which was owned by [[Western International Communications|WIC]] at the time before being acquired by [[Canwest Global]] in 2000), 15 days before its first showing in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] and two days before being broadcast in the United States on Fox. It was also shown in some countries for a limited time in cinemas.\n\nThe film was the first attempt to revive ''Doctor Who'' following its suspension in 1989. It was intended as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a new American-produced ''Doctor Who'' TV series.  It introduced [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]] in his only televised appearance as the character until \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" in 2013 (though McGann has portrayed the Doctor also in various audio productions).  It also marks the final appearance of [[Sylvester McCoy]] as the [[Seventh Doctor]], the only appearance of [[Daphne Ashbrook]] as [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Grace Holloway]], and the only appearance of [[Eric Roberts]]'s version of [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].  Although a ratings success in the United Kingdom, the film did not fare well on American television and no series was commissioned. The series was later relaunched on the BBC in 2005.<ref name=\"Segal\" /> The only ''Doctor Who'' episodes between the film and the new series were a 1999 spoof, ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', and a 2003 animation, ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nAlthough the film was primarily produced by different people than the 1963\u20131989 series and intended for an American audience, the producers chose not to produce a \"re-imagining\" or \"[[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]\" of the series but rather a continuation of the original narrative. The production was filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], to date the only episode of ''Doctor Who'' filmed in Canada.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{Long plot|episode|date=June 2017}}\n}}\nFollowing [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]'s trial and execution at the hands of the [[Dalek]]s, [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], currently in his [[Seventh Doctor|seventh incarnation]], is transporting the Master's remains to [[Gallifrey]] via his [[TARDIS]]. En route, the box with the remains breaks open and an ooze leaks out, infecting the TARDIS. The Doctor is forced to make an emergency materialisation in San Francisco's [[Chinatown]] on 30 December 1999.\n\nAs he exits and locks the TARDIS, the Doctor is shot by a gang chasing down Chang Lee, a young [[Chinese-American]] man. Lee calls for an ambulance and escorts the unconscious Doctor to a hospital, unaware the ooze from the TARDIS has gotten aboard the ambulance. At the hospital, after the bullets are removed, [[cardiology|cardiologist]] Dr [[Grace Holloway]] attempts surgery to stabilise his unusual heartbeat, but is confused by his strange double-heart anatomy, and accidentally lodges a cardiac probe in the Doctor's body, apparently killing him. The Doctor's body is taken to the morgue, while Lee steals the Doctor's possessions, including the TARDIS key. Meanwhile, the ooze takes over the body of the ambulance driver, Bruce, transforming him into a new body for the Master.\n\nLater, the Doctor's body [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerates]], and the [[Eighth Doctor|new Doctor]], suffering amnesia, gathers clothes from an upcoming fancy dress party. He recognises Holloway, who has resigned from the hospital after the failed operation, and follows her to her car, proving to her he is the same man by pulling out the cardiac probe. Holloway takes him home to recover. Lee returns to the TARDIS where the Master arrives and puts him under his mind control by claiming the Doctor had stolen his body. The Master convinces Lee to open the TARDIS and then to open the [[Eye of Harmony]] within it, which requires a human retinal scan. When the Eye opens, the Doctor is flooded with memories and realises the Master is searching for him, and tries to block the scan. He warns Holloway that while the Eye is opened, the fabric of reality will weaken, and potentially destroy the Earth by midnight on New Year's Eve if they cannot close it. However, he needs an [[atomic clock]] to do so, and Holloway finds one on display at  the San Francisco Institute of Technological Advancement and Research.\n\nOutside, they find the ambulance with the Master and Lee waiting for them, offering them a ride. The Doctor does not immediately recognise the Master, but discovers his true identity en route, and he and Holloway escape, but not before the Master can spit an ooze-like substance on Holloway's wrist. The two continue to the Institute and obtain the clock, returning to the TARDIS. The Doctor installs the clock and successfully closes the Eye, but finds the damage to reality too great and that he must revert time before the Eye was opened to prevent the destruction of Earth. As he connects the proper TARDIS circuits to do this, the Master remotely takes control of Holloway's body, causing her eyes to become inhuman, and she strikes the Doctor unconscious.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|275px|thumbnail|The Doctor and the Master in their climactic battle]]\nThe Doctor wakes to find himself chained above the Eye, the Master poised to take his remaining regenerations while Lee and Holloway watch. The Doctor is able to break the Master's control on Lee, and Lee refuses to open the Eye for the Master. The Master kills him, and then releases his control on Holloway to return her eyes to normal. He forces her to open the Eye and then begins drawing the Doctor's lifeforce. Holloway, under her own control, is able to complete the final circuits to put the TARDIS into a time-holding pattern, preventing Earth's destruction, and then goes to free the Doctor. The Master kills her, but this has given enough time for the Doctor to free himself and attack the Master. The Doctor gains the upper hand and pushes the Master into the Eye. The Eye closes and time reverts a few minutes, undoing Lee and Holloway's deaths.\n\nWith no further risk to Earth, the Doctor prepares to leave. Lee returns his possessions, and the Doctor warns him not to be in San Francisco on the next New Year's Eve. The Doctor offers Holloway the opportunity to travel with him, but she politely refuses, and instead kisses him goodbye. The Doctor departs alone in his TARDIS.\n\n===Continuity===\n\n*At the beginning of the film, the Seventh Doctor uses a brand new version of the [[Sonic Screwdriver]] to seal the Master's remains in a casket. The device was previously destroyed in [[The Visitation (Doctor Who)| \"The Visitation\"]]. The jelly babies, which the [[Fourth Doctor]] had a fondness for, also reappear during the opening scene and then later during the story.\n\n*The [[Seventh Doctor]] wears his trademark panama hat which he wore throughout his tenure in the Classic Series.\n\n*The [[Eighth Doctor]] mentions that he once met [[Leonardo Di Vinci]] when the artist had a cold and had met [[Puccini]] during the last years of the composer's life.\n\n*The [[Eye of Harmony]] in the [[TARDIS' Cloister Room]] was previously on the Doctor's home planet [[Gallifrey]].\n\n*The [[Eighth Doctor]] shows Grace and Chang Lee where [[Gallifrey]] is on the [[TARDIS' time visualiser]], remarking that the planet \"a good ten minutes in this old thing.\"\n\n*The Doctor's romantic nature in this story would later be shown with the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors when the series returned in 2005.\n\n===Cast notes===\n* Yee Jee Tso would later return in 2002 to play Major Jal Brant in the [[Seventh Doctor]] audio drama ''[[Excelis Decays]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/3-Doctor-Who-Excelis-Decays|title=Doctor Who \u2013 Excelis Decays|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref> and Doctor Reece Goddard in the [[Sixth Doctor]] webcast ''[[Real Time (Doctor Who)|Real Time]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/Doctor-Who-Real-Time|title=Doctor Who \u2013 Real Time|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref>\n*Daphne Ashbrook would later return in 2004 alongside [[Paul McGann]]'s [[Eighth Doctor]] as Perfection in the audio drama ''[[The Next Life (audio drama)|The Next Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/64-Doctor-Who-The-Next-Life|title=Doctor Who \u2013 The Next Life|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref>\n* Tso and Ashbrook returned to Big Finish together playing Captain Ruth Matheson and Warrant Officer Charlie Sato of UNIT in the audio dramas ''Tales From The Vault''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/releases/v/tales-from-the-vault-501 |title=6.01.

It was hoped that, would the telemovie be successful, Fox might be persuaded to reconsider a series; however, the telemovie's ratings performance in America was not strong enough to hold Fox's interest.\n\nThe production budget for the movie (as revealed in the book ''Doctor Who: Regeneration'') was US$5 million, with the [[Fox Network]] spending $2.5 million, [[BBC Television]] contributing $300,000, and the remaining $2.2 million split between [[BBC Worldwide]] and [[Universal Television]].\n\n===Casting===\nThe producers of the television movie compiled several lists of actors to consider for the part of the Doctor. Among early thoughts were [[Michael Crawford]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Trevor Eve]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], and [[Jonathan Pryce]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} All were uninterested in the project, or unavailable for the intended filming dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nCasting sessions took place in March 1994; actors who actually auditioned for the role include [[Liam Cunningham (actor)|Liam Cunningham]], [[Mark McGann]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Tim McInnerny]], [[Nathaniel Parker]], [[Peter Woodward]], [[John Sessions]], [[Anthony Head]], and [[Tony Slattery]]. Paul McGann was first considered around the time of these auditions, but did not formally audition for the part until later.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite book |last1=Segal |first1=Philip |authorlink1=Philip Segal |first2=Gary |last2=Russell |authorlink2=Gary Russell |title=Doctor Who:Regeneration |year=2000 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=London |isbn=0-00-710591-6}}</ref>\n\nAmong the actors who were invited to audition for the role of the Doctor but declined the opportunity were [[Christopher Eccleston]]<ref name=\"eccleston\">{{cite journal |author=Hickman, Clayton |authorlink=Clayton Hickman |title=Revolution #9 |page=11 |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=343| location=[[Tunbridge Wells]] |publisher=[[Panini UK]] |date=26 May 2004 }}</ref> and [[Peter Capaldi]].<ref name=\"capaldi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |title=Capaldi could\u2019ve been the Eighth Doctor! |last1=Bates |first1=Philip |date=1 August 2014 |website=Kasterborous.com |accessdate=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053048/http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Eccleston and Capaldi would go on to play the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Twelfth Doctor|Twelfth]] incarnations of the Doctor, respectively, in the revived series of ''Doctor Who'' which began in 2005. Eccleston turned down the offer to audition for the TV Movie because at the time he felt he was not yet an established enough actor and did not want to be associated with a \"brand name\" so early in his career.<ref name=\"eccleston\"/> Capaldi declined because he felt it was unlikely that he would be given the part.<ref name=\"capaldi\"/>\n\nOf those actors who originally auditioned for the role of the Doctor, a number would go on to guest star in the series when it returned from 2005:\n*Anthony Head guest starred in the Series 2 episode \"[[School Reunion]]\" as Mr. Finch.\n*Tim McInnerny guest-starred in the Series 4 episode \"[[Planet of the Ood]]\" as Klineman Halpen.\n*Liam Cunningham guest-starred in the Series 7 episode, \"[[Cold War (Doctor Who)|Cold War]]\" as Captain Zhukov. \n*John Sessions guest-starred in the Series 8 episode \"[[Mummy on the Orient Express]]\" as the voice of the homicidal computer GUS.\n\n===Production===\nThe movie was filmed on 35mm film in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], the first time any ''Doctor Who'' story had been filmed in North America.\n\nIn the 2005 ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode \"Weird Science\", and on the DVD commentary, Sylvester McCoy reveals that during the sequence where he locks the casket with his [[sonic screwdriver]], he held the tool pointing the wrong way around (although in the original series, it is seen being used both ways). The sonic screwdriver was blurred in post-production to conceal the error.\n\n===Post-production===\nThe opening pre-credits sequence went through a number of modifications, with several different voice-overs recorded. At one stage the voice-over was to be made by the old Master, played by Gordon Tipple; in the end this was not used. Tipple is still credited as \"The Old Master\", though in the final edit his appearance is very brief, stationary, and mute. Had the original pre-titles voice-over been used, it would have been unclear what incarnation of the Doctor Sylvester McCoy portrays in the movie (as he is simply credited as \"The Old Doctor\"). Only the rewritten narration (as read by Paul McGann) makes his number of regenerations clear. The sequence of the TARDIS flying through the time vortex was briefly reused in the opening of ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', as the Master observes [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s Doctor.\n\nInstead of designing a new ''Doctor Who'' logo for this film, it was decided instead to use a modified version of the logo that was used for the [[Jon Pertwee]] era of the original series (with the exception of the final season). This logo, being the last logo used on an \"official\" Doctor Who broadcast before the 2005 revival, was, until 2018, used by the BBC for most ''Doctor Who'' merchandise relating to the first eight Doctors. In 2018, efforts were made to make the show's merchandise more uniform, and so most items of merchandise began to use the logo designed for Jodie Whittaker's time as the Doctor, abandoning the \"Movie\" logo for the first time in 22 years.\n\n[[John Debney]] was commissioned to write the score for this film, and intended to replace [[Ron Grainer]]'s original theme with a new composition. Ultimately Debney did in fact use an arrangement of Grainer's music for the theme, although Grainer goes uncredited.\n\n=== Alternative titles and labelling ===\nThere is some disagreement over exactly what the movie should be called. The production documentation only referred to the project as ''Doctor Who''{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Segal suggested the unofficial title ''Enemy Within'' as an alternative at Manopticon 5, apparently after being repeatedly asked what the actual title for the movie was{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Both [[DVD]] releases are labelled ''Doctor Who: The Movie''. The [[VHS]] release contains both the name ''Doctor Who'' and the phrase, ''The Sensational Feature Length Film'' (plausibly read as a subtitle). The most common fan usage appears to refer to it as \"The Television Movie\" or \"TVM\", or variations thereof.\n\nUpon translation into French, this film was renamed ''Le Seigneur du Temps'' (literal translation: \"The Lord of Time\").\n\n\"TVM\" is the production code used in the BBC's online episode guide.<ref name=\"movie\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml\n| title = The TV Movie: Details\n| accessdate = 2007-07-26\n| last = Howe\n| first = David J.\n| authorlink = David J.

This marked the first time that footage from the original BBC series had been shown on a major American network. The advertisements also used a different arrangement of the Doctor Who theme music from that heard in the film.\n\nThe movie received disappointing US ratings. It received 5.6 million viewers, a total 9% share of the audience.<ref name=\"DWM 433 page 53\">{{cite journal| author= Bailey, David|date=April 2011 |title=Doctor Who| journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]| publisher=[[Panini Comics]]| issue=#433| page=53}}</ref> However, when shown on [[BBC One]] in the United Kingdom on Monday 27 May at 8.30pm, thirteen days after its American broadcast, it received over 9 million viewers in the UK alone. It received a 75% [[Audience Appreciation]] score.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[Third Doctor]] actor [[Jon Pertwee]] died a few days after the US broadcast of the film, and the UK broadcast included an epitaph to the actor. The UK broadcast was also edited for broadcast in a pre-[[Watershed (television)|Watershed]] timeslot, with around 1 minute of cuts made. The scenes where Chang Lee's friends are fired upon was cut because of the BBC's sensitivity about [[gun violence]] following the [[Dunblane massacre]] three months before.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The operating room scene was also extensively cut, in particular shots involving the cardiac probe and the Seventh Doctor's dying scream,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the shot of the Master breaking Chang Lee's neck was also removed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMaureen Paton in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' praised the movie \"At last we have a grown-up hi-tech Doctor Who in Paul McGann...only a low-tech Luddite would miss the endearing amateurism of the old teatime serial format...the makers would be mad not to pursue the option of a series.\"<ref name=\"th\">{{cite book |first1=David J. |last1=Howe |authorlink1=David J.

It was the first novelisation of a televised ''Doctor Who'' story to not be published by [[Target Books]] (or related companies) since ''[[The Crusade (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who and the Crusaders]]'' in 1966.\n\nBasing the adaptation on an early draft of the script, Russell adjusted some details to make it more consistent with the original series, and the novelisation also contains elements that were cut from the shooting script for timing reasons.\n* The novel begins with the Seventh Doctor receiving a telepathic summons from the Master (similar to ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') to collect his remains from Skaro and a short prologue detailing how the Doctor escapes from the planet with the casket. This was originally intended to be a pre-credits sequence in the movie, and was subsequently contradicted by the ending of the novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', where [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] gives the Seventh Doctor the assignment to retrieve the Master's remains.\n* More detail is given to Chang Lee and Grace's backstory, including his recruitment into the Triads and his seeking a father figure as well as flashbacks to Grace's childhood.\n* The Eighth Doctor finds the Seventh Doctor's clothing in the hospital rather than the Fourth Doctor's scarf. Also, the sequence where Chang Lee and the Master see the Seventh Doctor in the Eye of Harmony features all the previous Doctors as originally drafted.\n* The scene where the Doctor and Grace meet the motorcycle police officer is relocated to a traffic jam on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (impossible to film in the movie since it was shot on location in [[Vancouver]]).\n* When the Doctor first kisses Grace, he immediately pulls back, grins apologetically and murmurs, \"I'm sorry, don't know what came over me there.\" This makes the romantic nature of the kiss more ambiguous. Instead of the second kiss at the end, he gives her the Seventh Doctor's straw hat as a memento.\n* The Doctor is still referred to as half-human, to which the Master comments, \"The Doctor once claimed to be more than just a Time Lord \u2014 He should really have said ''less'' than a Time Lord!\" This was a reference to a line cut from ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''.\n* Instead of dying and being brought back to life, Grace and Lee are merely rendered unconscious, though aware of what is happening around them. Russell also spends some time showing the Doctor and them discussing what a \"temporal orbit\" is.\n\nThe novelisation was the first ''Doctor Who'' novel published by BBC Books. The book was actually published prior to the conclusion of [[Virgin Books]]' contract for publishing original ''Doctor Who'' fiction, so the next release by BBC Books did not occur for about a year when the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] series began with ''[[The Eight Doctors]]''. The novelisation was released as a standalone work and is not considered part of this series. The Eighth Doctor Adventures series ran until 2005 when it was discontinued.\n\nThe novel was also released as an [[Doctor Who audio releases|audio book]] on 2 June 1997, read by Paul McGann. This reading was later included on the 2004 [[MP3 CD]] ''Tales from the TARDIS Volume Two''. A [[Target Books]] edition titled ''The TV Movie'' will be published in paperback 11 March 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1073116/doctor-who--the-tv-movie--target-collection-/9781785945311.html|title=Doctor Who: The TV Movie (Target Collection)|first=Gary|last=Russell|website=www.penguin.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|1990s}}\n{{Wikiquote|The Eighth Doctor}}\n{{TardisIndexFile|Doctor Who (1996)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0116118|title=Doctor Who (1996) (TV)}}\n* {{BBCCDW|id=tvmovie|title=The TV movie}}\n\n===Reviews===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110414090315/http://www.whoniverse.org/reviews/TVM.php The Whoniverse's review on ''Doctor Who: The Enemy Within'' DVD]\n\n===BBC novelisation===\n*{{Isfdb title|id=364011|title=Doctor Who}}\n\n{{Doctor Who episodes|-}}\n{{Regeneration stories}}\n{{Master stories}}\n{{Dalek stories}}\n{{Skaro stories}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation}}\n{{Geoffrey Sax}}\n{{Doctor Who soundtracks|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doctor Who (1996 Film)}}\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Doctor Who]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Eighth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:1996 television films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:British science fiction films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British television films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction television films]]\n[[Category:Television films as pilots]]\n[[Category:Television pilots not picked up as a series]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1999]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2000]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:The Master (Doctor Who) television stories]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Matthew Jacobs]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Geoffrey Sax]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:Films about amnesia]]\n[[Category:New Year films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Debney]]\n[[Category:Television films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Turn of the third millennium]]\n", "name_user": "ArkhamBen17", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eContinuity", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(film)"}
