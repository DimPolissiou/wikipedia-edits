He had learned how to preserve bird specimens from [[John Edmonstone]] while at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and had been keen on shooting, but he had no expertise in [[ornithology]] and by this stage of the voyage concentrated mainly on geology.<ref name=\"GrantEstes09\">{{cite book |author1=Grant, K.

When examining his specimens on the way to [[Tahiti]], Darwin noted that all of the mockingbirds on Charles Island were of one species, those from [[Isabela Island (Ecuador)|Albemarle]] of another, and those from [[Santiago Island (Gal\u00e1pagos)|James]] and Chatham Islands of a third. As they sailed home about nine months later, this, together with other facts, including what he had heard about [[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise]]s, made him wonder about the stability of species.<ref name=fieldnotesGalapagos>{{Citation |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html |title=Darwin's field notes on the Galapagos: 'A little world within itself' |first=Gordon |last=Chancellor |first2=Randal |last2=Keynes |author-link2=Randal Keynes |date=October 2006 |publisher=[[Darwin Online]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qybOGZ?url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html |archivedate=2011-08-22 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his return from the voyage, Darwin presented the finches to the [[Zoological Society of London]] on 4&nbsp;January 1837, along with other mammal and bird specimens that he had collected. The bird specimens, including the finches, were given to [[John Gould]], the famous English [[ornithologist]], for identification. Gould set aside his paying work and at the next meeting, on 10&nbsp;January, reported that the birds from the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]] that Darwin had thought were [[Icterid|blackbirds]], \"[[Grosbeak|gross-beaks]]\" and [[finch]]es were actually \"a series of ground Finches which are so peculiar [as to form] an entirely new group, containing 12&nbsp;species\".

In early March, he met Gould again and for the first time to get a full report on the findings, including the point that his Gal\u00e1pagos \"[[wren]]\" was another closely allied species of finch. The [[mockingbird]]s that Darwin had labelled by island were separate species rather than just varieties. Gould found more species than Darwin had expected,<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=248}}</ref> and concluded that 25 of the 26&nbsp;land birds were new and distinct forms, found nowhere else in the world but closely allied to those found on the [[South America]]n continent.<ref name=s57/> Darwin now saw that, if the finch species were confined to individual islands, like the mockingbirds, this would help to account for the number of species on the islands, and he sought information from others on the expedition. Specimens had also been collected by Captain [[Robert FitzRoy]], FitzRoy's steward Harry Fuller, and Darwin's servant [[Syms Covington|Covington]], who had labelled them by island.<ref name=s2006>{{Harvnb|Sulloway|2006}}</ref> From these, Darwin tried to reconstruct the locations from where he had collected his own specimens. The conclusions supported his idea of the transmutation of species.<ref name=s57/>\n\n=== Text from ''The Voyage of the Beagle'' ===\nAt the time that he rewrote his diary for publication as ''Journal and Remarks'' (later ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]''), he described Gould's findings on the number of birds, noting that \"Although the species are thus peculiar to the archipelago, yet nearly all in their general structure, habits, colour of feathers, and even tone of voice, are strictly American\".<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F10.3&pageseq=480 461\u2013462]}}</ref> In the first edition of ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', Darwin said that<blockquote>It is very remarkable that a nearly perfect gradation of structure in this one group can be traced in the form of the beak, from one exceeding in dimensions that of the largest gros-beak, to another differing but little from that of a warbler\".<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1839|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F10.3&pageseq=481 462].}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the time the first edition was published, the [[development of Darwin's theory]] of [[natural selection]] was in progress. For the 1845 second edition of ''The Voyage'' (now titled ''Journal of Researches''), Darwin added more detail about the beaks of the birds, and two closing sentences which reflected his changed ideas:<blockquote>Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1845|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F14&pageseq=392 379\u2013380]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1887}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n{{quotation|The remaining land-birds form a most singular group of finches, related to each other in the structure of their beaks, short tails, form of body and plumage: There are thirteen species, which Mr.&nbsp;Gould has divided into four subgroups. All these species are peculiar to this archipelago; and so is the whole group, with the exception of one species of the sub-group ''Cactornis'', lately brought from Bow Island, in the Low Archipelago. Of ''Cactornis'', the two species may be often seen climbing about the flowers of the great cactus-trees; but all the other species of this group of finches, mingled together in flocks, feed on the dry and sterile ground of the lower districts. The males of all, or certainly of the greater number, are jet black; and the females (with perhaps one or two exceptions) are brown. The most curious fact is the perfect gradation in the size of the beaks in the different species of ''Geospiza'', from one as large as that of a hawfinch to that of a chaffinch, and (if Mr.&nbsp;Gould is right in including his sub-group, ''Certhidea'', in the main group) even to that of a warbler. The largest beak in the genus ''Geospiza'' is shown in Fig.&nbsp;1, and the smallest in Fig.&nbsp;3; but instead of there being only one intermediate species, with a beak of the size shown in Fig.&nbsp;2, there are no less than six species with insensibly graduated beaks. The beak of the sub-group ''Certhidea'', is shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. The beak of ''Cactornis'' is somewhat like that of a starling, and that of the fourth subgroup, ''Camarhynchus'', is slightly parrot-shaped. Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends. In a like manner it might be fancied that [[Galapagos hawk|a bird originally a buzzard]], had been induced here to undertake the office of the carrion-feeding [[Caracara (subfamily)|Polybori]] of the American continent.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1845|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F14&pageseq=393 380].}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Text from ''On the Origin of Species'' ===\nDarwin discussed the divergence of species of birds in the Gal\u00e1pagos more explicitly in his chapter on geographical distribution in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'':\n\n{{quotation|The most striking and important fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of islands, is their affinity to those of the nearest mainland, without being actually the same species. [In] the Galapagos Archipelago ... almost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakable stamp of the American continent. There are twenty-six land birds, and twenty-five of these are ranked by Mr.&nbsp;Gould as distinct species, supposed to have been created here; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to American species in every character, in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice, was manifest. ... The naturalist, looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the Pacific, distant several hundred miles from the continent, yet feels that he is standing on American land. Why should this be so? Why should the species which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those created in America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in the geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in the proportions in which the several classes are associated together, which resembles closely the conditions of the South American coast: In fact there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. On the other hand, there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the soil, in climate, height, and size of the islands, between the Galapagos and Cape de&nbsp;Verde Archipelagos: But what an entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants! The inhabitants of the Cape de&nbsp;Verde Islands are related to those of Africa, like those of the Galapagos to America. I believe this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation; whereas on the view here maintained, it is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would be likely to receive colonists, whether by occasional means of transport or by formerly continuous land, from America; and the Cape de&nbsp;Verde Islands from Africa; and that such colonists would be liable to modification \u2014 the principle of inheritance still betraying their original birthplace.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=415 397\u2013398].}}</ref>}}\n\n== Polymorphism in Darwin's finches ==\nWhereas Darwin spent just five weeks in the Gal\u00e1pagos, and [[David Lack]] spent three months, [[Peter and Rosemary Grant]] and their colleagues have made research trips to the Gal\u00e1pagos for about 30 years, particularly studying Darwin's finches.\n\nMales are dimorphic in song type: songs A and B are quite distinct. Also, males with song A have shorter bills than B males. This is also a clear difference. With these beaks, males are able to feed differently on their favourite cactus, the prickly pear ''[[Opuntia]]''. Those with long beaks are able to punch holes in the cactus fruit and eat the fleshy [[aril]] pulp, which surrounds the seeds, whereas those with shorter beaks tear apart the cactus base and eat the pulp and any insect larvae and pupae (both groups eat flowers and buds). This dimorphism clearly maximises their feeding opportunities during the non-breeding season when food is scarce.\n\nIf the population is [[Panmixia|panmixic]],<ref>B. Rosemary Grant and Peter R. Grant 1989. ''Evolutionary dynamics of a natural population: the large cactus finch of the Gal\u00e1pagos''. Chicago, p241 first para.</ref><ref>Grant, Peter R. 1999. ''Ecology and evolution of Darwin's finches''. Princeton NJ, p428 in Afterword.</ref> then ''Geospiza conirostris'' exhibits a balanced genetic polymorphism and not, as originally supposed, a case of nascent [[sympatric speciation]]. The selection maintaining the polymorphism maximises the species' [[Ecological niche|niche]] by expanding its feeding opportunity. The genetics of this situation cannot be clarified in the absence of a detailed breeding program, but two loci with [[linkage disequilibrium]]<ref>Maynard Smith J. 1998. ''Evolutionary genetics''. 2nd ed, Chapter 5, Oxford.</ref> is a possibility.\n\nAnother interesting dimorphism is for the bills of young finches, which are either 'pink' or 'yellow'. All species of Darwin's finches exhibit this morphism, which lasts for two months. No interpretation of this phenomenon is known.<ref>Grant, Peter R. 1999. ''Ecology and evolution of Darwin's finches''. Princeton NJ. (see plate 7)</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n=== Family ===\nFor some decades, taxonomists have placed these birds in the family [[Emberizidae]] along with the New World sparrows and Old World buntings (Sulloway 1982). However, the [[Sibley\u2013Ahlquist taxonomy of birds|Sibley\u2013Ahlquist taxonomy]] puts Darwin's finches with the [[tanager]]s (Monroe and Sibley 1993), and at least one recent work follows that example (Burns and Skutch 2003). The [[American Ornithologists' Union]], in its [[North America]]n checklist, places the Cocos finch in the Emberizidae, but with an asterisk indicating that the placement is probably wrong (AOU 1998\u20132006); in its tentative [[South America]]n check-list, the Gal\u00e1pagos species are ''incertae sedis'', of uncertain place (Remsen et al. 2007).\n\n=== Species ===\n[[File:Darwin&#039;s finches.png|thumb|upright=1.6<!--fmt for multiple image-->|Four of Darwin's finches, clockwise (from top left):  ''[[Geospiza magnirostris]]'', ''[[Geospiza fortis]]'', ''[[Certhidea olivacea]]'', ''[[Camarhynchus parvulus]]'']]\n\n* Genus ''[[Geospiza]]''\n** [[Genovesa ground finch]] (''Geospiza acutirostris'')\n** [[Espa\u00f1ola cactus finch]] (''Geospiza conirostris'')\n** [[Sharp-beaked ground finch]] (''Geospiza difficilis'')\n** [[Vampire finch]] (''Geospiza septentrionalis'')\n** [[Medium ground finch]] (''Geospiza fortis'')\n** [[Genovesa cactus finch]] (''Geospiza propinqua'')\n** [[Small ground finch]] (''Geospiza fuliginosa'')\n** [[Large ground finch]] (''Geospiza magnirostris'')\n** [[Common cactus finch]] (''Geospiza scandens'')\n* Genus ''[[Camarhynchus]]''\n** [[Large tree finch]] (''Camarhynchus psittacula'')\n** [[Medium tree finch]] (''Camarhynchus pauper'')\n** [[Small tree finch]] (''Camarhynchus parvulus'')\n** [[Woodpecker finch]] (''Camarhynchus pallidus'') \u2013 sometimes separated in ''Cactospiza''\n** [[Mangrove finch]] (''Camarhynchus heliobates'')\n* Genus ''[[Certhidea]]''\n** [[Green warbler-finch]] (''Certhidea olivacea'')\n** [[Grey warbler-finch]] (''Certhidea fusca'')\n* Genus ''Pinaroloxias''\n** [[Cocos finch]] (''Pinaroloxias inornata'')\n* Genus ''Platyspiza''\n** [[Vegetarian finch]] (''Platyspiza crassirostris'')\n\nIn 1981, a male [[Espa\u00f1ola cactus finch]] arrived at Daphne Major island. Its mating with local Galapagos finches has produced a new population that can exploit previously unexploited food due to its larger size. They do not breed with the other species on the island, as the females do not recognize the songs of the new males. Genetic evidence shows that now, after two generations, it lives in a complete reproductive isolation from the native species. According to professor Leif Andersson of Uppsala University, a taxonomist not aware of its history would consider it a distinct species.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42103058|title=Galapagos finches caught in act of becoming new species|date=23 Nov 2017|publisher=BBC News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130025941/http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42103058|archivedate=2017-11-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sciencealert.com/darwin-s-finches-evolve-into-new-species-in-real-time-two-generations-galapagos|title=A New Bird Species Has Evolved on Galapagos And Scientists Watched It Happen|date=24 Nov 2017|publisher=ScienceAlert|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209152233/https://sciencealert.com/darwin-s-finches-evolve-into-new-species-in-real-time-two-generations-galapagos|archivedate=2017-12-09}}</ref>\n\n== Molecular basis of beak evolution ==\nDevelopmental research in 2004 found that [[bone morphogenetic protein 4]] (BMP4), and its differential expression during development, resulted in variation of beak size and shape among finches.

He had learned how to preserve bird specimens from [[John Edmonstone]] while at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and had been keen on shooting, but he had no expertise in [[ornithology]] and by this stage of the voyage concentrated mainly on geology.<ref name=\"GrantEstes09\">{{cite book |author1=Grant, K.

On [[San Crist\u00f3bal Island|Chatham Island]], he recorded that a [[mockingbird]] was similar to those he had seen in [[Chile]], and after finding a different one on [[Floreana Island|Charles Island]] he carefully noted where mockingbirds had been caught.<ref name=\"GrantEstes09\"/> In contrast, he paid little attention to the finches. When examining his specimens on the way to [[Tahiti]], Darwin noted that all of the mockingbirds on Charles Island were of one species, those from [[Isabela Island (Ecuador)|Albemarle]] of another, and those from [[Santiago Island (Gal\u00e1pagos)|James]] and Chatham Islands of a third. As they sailed home about nine months later, this, together with other facts, including what he had heard about [[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise]]s, made him wonder about the stability of species.<ref name=fieldnotesGalapagos>{{Citation |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html |title=Darwin's field notes on the Galapagos: 'A little world within itself' |first=Gordon |last=Chancellor |first2=Randal |last2=Keynes |author-link2=Randal Keynes |date=October 2006 |publisher=[[Darwin Online]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617qybOGZ?url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html |archivedate=2011-08-22 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his return from the voyage, Darwin presented the finches to the [[Zoological Society of London]] on 4&nbsp;January 1837, along with other mammal and bird specimens that he had collected. The bird specimens, including the finches, were given to [[John Gould]], the famous English [[ornithologist]], for identification. Gould set aside his paying work and at the next meeting, on 10&nbsp;January, reported that the birds from the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]] that Darwin had thought were [[Icterid|blackbirds]], \"[[Grosbeak|gross-beaks]]\" and [[finch]]es were actually \"a series of ground Finches which are so peculiar [as to form] an entirely new group, containing 12&nbsp;species\". This story made the newspapers.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=208\u2013209}}</ref><ref name=s57>{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A86&pageseq=9 57\u201358]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Finchadaptiveradiation.png|right|thumb|200px|Seen here is adapted radiation of finch A.

In early March, he met Gould again and for the first time to get a full report on the findings, including the point that his Gal\u00e1pagos \"[[wren]]\" was another closely allied species of finch. The [[mockingbird]]s that Darwin had labelled by island were separate species rather than just varieties. Gould found more species than Darwin had expected,<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=248}}</ref> and concluded that 25 of the 26&nbsp;land birds were new and distinct forms, found nowhere else in the world but closely allied to those found on the [[South America]]n continent.<ref name=s57/> Darwin now saw that, if the finch species were confined to individual islands, like the mockingbirds, this would help to account for the number of species on the islands, and he sought information from others on the expedition.

The conclusions supported his idea of the transmutation of species.<ref name=s57/>\n\n=== Text from ''The Voyage of the Beagle'' ===\nAt the time that he rewrote his diary for publication as ''Journal and Remarks'' (later ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]''), he described Gould's findings on the number of birds, noting that \"Although the species are thus peculiar to the archipelago, yet nearly all in their general structure, habits, colour of feathers, and even tone of voice, are strictly American\".<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F10.3&pageseq=480 461\u2013462]}}</ref> In the first edition of ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', Darwin said that<blockquote>It is very remarkable that a nearly perfect gradation of structure in this one group can be traced in the form of the beak, from one exceeding in dimensions that of the largest gros-beak, to another differing but little from that of a warbler\".<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1839|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F10.3&pageseq=481 462].}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the time the first edition was published, the [[development of Darwin's theory]] of [[natural selection]] was in progress. For the 1845 second edition of ''The Voyage'' (now titled ''Journal of Researches''), Darwin added more detail about the beaks of the birds, and two closing sentences which reflected his changed ideas:<blockquote>Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1845|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F14&pageseq=392 379\u2013380]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1887}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n{{quotation|The remaining land-birds form a most singular group of finches, related to each other in the structure of their beaks, short tails, form of body and plumage: There are thirteen species, which Mr.&nbsp;Gould has divided into four subgroups. All these species are peculiar to this archipelago; and so is the whole group, with the exception of one species of the sub-group ''Cactornis'', lately brought from Bow Island, in the Low Archipelago. Of ''Cactornis'', the two species may be often seen climbing about the flowers of the great cactus-trees; but all the other species of this group of finches, mingled together in flocks, feed on the dry and sterile ground of the lower districts. The males of all, or certainly of the greater number, are jet black; and the females (with perhaps one or two exceptions) are brown. The most curious fact is the perfect gradation in the size of the beaks in the different species of ''Geospiza'', from one as large as that of a hawfinch to that of a chaffinch, and (if Mr.&nbsp;Gould is right in including his sub-group, ''Certhidea'', in the main group) even to that of a warbler. The largest beak in the genus ''Geospiza'' is shown in Fig.&nbsp;1, and the smallest in Fig.&nbsp;3; but instead of there being only one intermediate species, with a beak of the size shown in Fig.&nbsp;2, there are no less than six species with insensibly graduated beaks. The beak of the sub-group ''Certhidea'', is shown in Fig.&nbsp;4. The beak of ''Cactornis'' is somewhat like that of a starling, and that of the fourth subgroup, ''Camarhynchus'', is slightly parrot-shaped. Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends. In a like manner it might be fancied that [[Galapagos hawk|a bird originally a buzzard]], had been induced here to undertake the office of the carrion-feeding [[Caracara (subfamily)|Polybori]] of the American continent.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1845|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F14&pageseq=393 380].}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Text from ''On the Origin of Species'' ===\nDarwin discussed the divergence of species of birds in the Gal\u00e1pagos more explicitly in his chapter on geographical distribution in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'':\n\n{{quotation|The most striking and important fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of islands, is their affinity to those of the nearest mainland, without being actually the same species. [In] the Galapagos Archipelago ... almost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakable stamp of the American continent. There are twenty-six land birds, and twenty-five of these are ranked by Mr.&nbsp;Gould as distinct species, supposed to have been created here; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to American species in every character, in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice, was manifest. ... The naturalist, looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the Pacific, distant several hundred miles from the continent, yet feels that he is standing on American land. Why should this be so? Why should the species which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those created in America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in the geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in the proportions in which the several classes are associated together, which resembles closely the conditions of the South American coast: In fact there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. On the other hand, there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the soil, in climate, height, and size of the islands, between the Galapagos and Cape de&nbsp;Verde Archipelagos: But what an entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants! The inhabitants of the Cape de&nbsp;Verde Islands are related to those of Africa, like those of the Galapagos to America. I believe this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation; whereas on the view here maintained, it is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would be likely to receive colonists, whether by occasional means of transport or by formerly continuous land, from America; and the Cape de&nbsp;Verde Islands from Africa; and that such colonists would be liable to modification \u2014 the principle of inheritance still betraying their original birthplace.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=415 397\u2013398].}}</ref>}}\n\n== Polymorphism in Darwin's finches ==\nWhereas Darwin spent just five weeks in the Gal\u00e1pagos, and [[David Lack]] spent three months, [[Peter and Rosemary Grant]] and their colleagues have made research trips to the Gal\u00e1pagos for about 30 years, particularly studying Darwin's finches.\n\nMales are dimorphic in song type: songs A and B are quite distinct. Also, males with song A have shorter bills than B males. This is also a clear difference. With these beaks, males are able to feed differently on their favourite cactus, the prickly pear ''[[Opuntia]]''. Those with long beaks are able to punch holes in the cactus fruit and eat the fleshy [[aril]] pulp, which surrounds the seeds, whereas those with shorter beaks tear apart the cactus base and eat the pulp and any insect larvae and pupae (both groups eat flowers and buds). This dimorphism clearly maximises their feeding opportunities during the non-breeding season when food is scarce.\n\nIf the population is [[Panmixia|panmixic]],<ref>B. Rosemary Grant and Peter R. Grant 1989. ''Evolutionary dynamics of a natural population: the large cactus finch of the Gal\u00e1pagos''. Chicago, p241 first para.</ref><ref>Grant, Peter R. 1999. ''Ecology and evolution of Darwin's finches''. Princeton NJ, p428 in Afterword.</ref> then ''Geospiza conirostris'' exhibits a balanced genetic polymorphism and not, as originally supposed, a case of nascent [[sympatric speciation]]. The selection maintaining the polymorphism maximises the species' [[Ecological niche|niche]] by expanding its feeding opportunity. The genetics of this situation cannot be clarified in the absence of a detailed breeding program, but two loci with [[linkage disequilibrium]]<ref>Maynard Smith J. 1998. ''Evolutionary genetics''. 2nd ed, Chapter 5, Oxford.</ref> is a possibility.\n\nAnother interesting dimorphism is for the bills of young finches, which are either 'pink' or 'yellow'. All species of Darwin's finches exhibit this morphism, which lasts for two months. No interpretation of this phenomenon is known.<ref>Grant, Peter R. 1999. ''Ecology and evolution of Darwin's finches''. Princeton NJ. (see plate 7)</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n=== Family ===\nFor some decades, taxonomists have placed these birds in the family [[Emberizidae]] along with the New World sparrows and Old World buntings (Sulloway 1982). However, the [[Sibley\u2013Ahlquist taxonomy of birds|Sibley\u2013Ahlquist taxonomy]] puts Darwin's finches with the [[tanager]]s (Monroe and Sibley 1993), and at least one recent work follows that example (Burns and Skutch 2003). The [[American Ornithologists' Union]], in its [[North America]]n checklist, places the Cocos finch in the Emberizidae, but with an asterisk indicating that the placement is probably wrong (AOU 1998\u20132006); in its tentative [[South America]]n check-list, the Gal\u00e1pagos species are ''incertae sedis'', of uncertain place (Remsen et al. 2007).\n\n=== Species ===\n[[File:Darwin&#039;s finches.png|thumb|upright=1.6<!--fmt for multiple image-->|Four of Darwin's finches, clockwise (from top left):  ''[[Geospiza magnirostris]]'', ''[[Geospiza fortis]]'', ''[[Certhidea olivacea]]'', ''[[Camarhynchus parvulus]]'']]\n\n* Genus ''[[Geospiza]]''\n** [[Genovesa ground finch]] (''Geospiza acutirostris'')\n** [[Espa\u00f1ola cactus finch]] (''Geospiza conirostris'')\n** [[Sharp-beaked ground finch]] (''Geospiza difficilis'')\n** [[Vampire finch]] (''Geospiza septentrionalis'')\n** [[Medium ground finch]] (''Geospiza fortis'')\n** [[Genovesa cactus finch]] (''Geospiza propinqua'')\n** [[Small ground finch]] (''Geospiza fuliginosa'')\n** [[Large ground finch]] (''Geospiza magnirostris'')\n** [[Common cactus finch]] (''Geospiza scandens'')\n* Genus ''[[Camarhynchus]]''\n** [[Large tree finch]] (''Camarhynchus psittacula'')\n** [[Medium tree finch]] (''Camarhynchus pauper'')\n** [[Small tree finch]] (''Camarhynchus parvulus'')\n** [[Woodpecker finch]] (''Camarhynchus pallidus'') \u2013 sometimes separated in ''Cactospiza''\n** [[Mangrove finch]] (''Camarhynchus heliobates'')\n* Genus ''[[Certhidea]]''\n** [[Green warbler-finch]] (''Certhidea olivacea'')\n** [[Grey warbler-finch]] (''Certhidea fusca'')\n* Genus ''Pinaroloxias''\n** [[Cocos finch]] (''Pinaroloxias inornata'')\n* Genus ''Platyspiza''\n** [[Vegetarian finch]] (''Platyspiza crassirostris'')\n\nIn 1981, a male [[Espa\u00f1ola cactus finch]] arrived at Daphne Major island. Its mating with local Galapagos finches has produced a new population that can exploit previously unexploited food due to its larger size. They do not breed with the other species on the island, as the females do not recognize the songs of the new males. Genetic evidence shows that now, after two generations, it lives in a complete reproductive isolation from the native species. According to professor Leif Andersson of Uppsala University, a taxonomist not aware of its history would consider it a distinct species.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42103058|title=Galapagos finches caught in act of becoming new species|date=23 Nov 2017|publisher=BBC News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130025941/http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42103058|archivedate=2017-11-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sciencealert.com/darwin-s-finches-evolve-into-new-species-in-real-time-two-generations-galapagos|title=A New Bird Species Has Evolved on Galapagos And Scientists Watched It Happen|date=24 Nov 2017|publisher=ScienceAlert|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209152233/https://sciencealert.com/darwin-s-finches-evolve-into-new-species-in-real-time-two-generations-galapagos|archivedate=2017-12-09}}</ref>\n\n== Molecular basis of beak evolution ==\nDevelopmental research in 2004 found that [[bone morphogenetic protein 4]] (BMP4), and its differential expression during development, resulted in variation of beak size and shape among finches.
