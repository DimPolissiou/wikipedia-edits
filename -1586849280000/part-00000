Radama's rule, although brief, was a pivotal period in the history of the Kingdom of Madagascar. Under the unyielding and often harsh 33-year rule of his mother, Queen Ranavalona I, Madagascar had successfully preserved its cultural and political independence from French and British designs. Rejecting the queen's policy of isolationism and persecution of Christians, Radama II permitted religious freedom and re-opened Madagascar to European influence. Under the terms of the [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert#Lambert Charter|Lambert Charter]], which Radama secretly contracted in 1855 with French entrepreneur [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert]] while Ranavalona still ruled, the French were awarded exclusive rights to the exploitation of large tracts of valuable land and other lucrative resources and projects. This agreement, which was later revoked by Prime Minister [[Rainilaiarivony]], was key to establishing France's claim over Madagascar as a protectorate and, in 1896, as a colony.\n\nThe dramatic contrast between Ranavalona's isolationism and her son's pro-European stance represented an abrupt reversal of policy that threatened the traditional sociopolitical order. Radama's absolutism in pursuing dramatic reforms in disregard of the advice of his ministers ultimately turned them against him. In a coup led by his Prime Minister, [[Rainivoninahitriniony]], Radama II was strangled on May 12, 1863. His wife Rabodo, who took the throne name [[Rasoherina]], was allowed by the ministers to succeed her husband on the condition that she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally, but rather in concert with the [[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]] (the class of free citizens) as represented by the position of Prime Minister. The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that his body had been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in [[Ilafy]]. However, there soon emerged rumors \u2013 believed by prominent foreigners [[Jean Laborde]] and [[William Ellis (missionary)|William Ellis]] \u2013 that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne. A strong case has since been made on the basis of significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in anonymity near [[Lake Kinkony]] in the northwestern part of the island.\n\n== Upbringing and early years ==\nRadama II was born Prince Rakoto (Rakotosehenondradama) on September 23, 1829 in the Imasoandro building on the compound of the [[Rova of Antananarivo]].<ref name=\"royalarc\">{{cite web | last = Buyers | first = Christopher | title = The Merina (or Hova) Dynasty | url = http://www.royalark.net/Madagascar/madagascar1.htm | accessdate = February 3, 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110106184735/http://www.royalark.net/Madagascar/madagascar1.htm | archivedate = January 6, 2011 | ref = harv | url-status = dead }}</ref>  He was officially recognized as the son of King [[Radama I]] and his widow Queen [[Ranavalona I]], although the king had died more than nine months before the prince's birth. He was likely fathered by a lover of his mother, [[Andriamihaja]], a progressive young officer of the [[Merina]] army who the queen may have been tricked into putting to death by conservative ministers at court.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}\n\nAfter his mother succeeded Radama I on the throne, she instituted an increasingly regressive regime that attempted to restore traditional values and contain or eliminate westernization.{{sfn|Ade Ajayi |1989|p=}} The prince, however, who had been highly influenced by the French adviser to the queen, [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert]], was favorably impressed by European culture, knowledge and its state of economic, political and technological development, and was troubled by some of the socially repressive policies pursued by Ranavalona I.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}  According to a British account, the French played on this sympathy in 1855 by pressuring Prince Rakoto into signing a request for French aid that would have enabled France to establish control over Madagascar had the true nature of the letter and its signing not been uncovered by Rakoto and his British contacts.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}} An alternate explanation was offered by Lambert, who maintained that the prince had knowingly supported the attempt to put an end to his mother's harsh policies, and was a willing collaborator in a [[Ranavalona I#Foreign plots|failed 1857 plot]] to remove her from the throne.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1861|p=}}\n\nPrior to Queen Ranavalona's death, the conservative and progressive factions within the Merina court waged a [[Ranavalona I#Internal divisions at court|tactical power struggle]] to secure a successor favorable to their own political agenda.{{sfn|Ade Ajayi |1989|p=}} The conservative faction favored Ramboasalama, the son of the Queen's sister, while the Queen's Prime Minister, [[Rainivoninahitriniony]] and head of the army, [[Rainilaiarivony]], brothers and progressives, supported Radama II.  The latter successfully obtained key strategic allies within the court that enabled Radama to seize the throne without violence following his mother's death. Ramboasalama was obliged to swear a public oath of allegiance to Radama, and was later sent into exile in the highland village of Ambohimirimo where he died in April 1962.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}\n\n== Reign ==\nPrince Rakoto acceded to the throne on August 16, 1861 upon the natural death of his mother, Queen Ranavalona I, assuming the throne name Radama II. His coronation ceremony was held the following year on September 23, 1862.<ref name=\"royalarc\" /> Once upon the throne, he immediately initiated a rapid and dramatic reversal of many of his mother's traditionalist policies.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}  He reopened the country to foreign powers and concluded treaties of friendship with Britain and France. The [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert#Lambert Charter|Lambert Charter]] opened up business possibilities for French investors. Freedom of religion was declared, persecution of Christians ceased, missionaries returned to the island and their schools were reopened. Radama abolished the traditional trial by ordeal of ''[[Ranavalona I#Tangena ordeal|tangena]]'', in which the guilt or innocence of an accused person was determined based on the outcome of consuming the poison of the ''tangena'' nut, and inhabitants of [[Antananarivo]] were permitted to raise swine within the city walls, a practice previously forbidden by a ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' (taboo) forbidding them from being kept near the royal talismans (''[[sampy]]''). The sampy were dispersed to the [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina|sacred villages]] where they had originated under 16th-century Merina king [[Ralambo]] and other early monarchs.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}} Significantly, Radama freed numerous political prisoners captured under Ranavalona I during provincial wars of subjugation and offered repatriation of confiscated property. This pardon was reciprocated by many of the beneficiary ethnic groups around the island, and good will between the coasts and central administration at Antananarivo improved significantly.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}} These changes, and the king himself, were unequivocally praised by Madagascar's European partners:\n\n{{quote|text=\"It is most remarkable that Radama II should have formed views of policy so large and liberal, so enlightened, humane and patriotic as those which form the foundation of his throne; that the son of such a mother, trained up under a despotism so dark, and restrictive and cruel, should have adopted such principles of religious freedom and political economy, as equal civil liberty and universal free trade principles, which our own nation has been so slow to learn, and which are still repudiated in many lands where civilization is far advanced.\"|sign = Ebenezer Prout |source=Madagascar: Its Mission and Its Martyrs (1863){{sfn|Prout|1863|p=}}}}\n\nThe reaction within [[Imerina]] was less one-sided.  The abrupt and dramatic policy changes pursued by the progressive king both alienated and disfranchised the established conservative factions among the [[andriana]] (nobles) and [[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]] (freemen) at court. Especially controversial were the special privileges accorded to [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert]] and his partners under the Lambert Charter, including the exclusive implementation of public works projects (felling trees, making roads, building canals etc.), control over minting coinage, lucrative mining rights and more as part of the purview of Lambert's proposed ''Compagnie de Madagascar'' (French Madagascar Company).  The citizens' concern stemmed primarily from clauses in the agreement that would have permitted Lambert's company to become permanent owners of Malagasy lands.  Until this point, land in Madagascar, which was viewed by the populace as the sacred ground of the ancestors, could only ever be temporarily possessed by foreigners until their death, at which point the land would revert to the crown. The threat of permanently losing any part of sacred Malagasy soil to foreigners was deeply troubling.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}{{efn|Similarly, the November 2008 agreement to lease large tracts of Malagasy land to the South Korean company [[Daewoo]] was a major factor leading to the [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|2009 ''coup d'etat'']] that brought down the [[Marc Ravalomanana|Ravalomanana]] administration.<ref>{{cite web | author = International Crisis Group | language = French | title = Madagascar: sortir du cycle de crises.

The prime minister prevented the law from being publicly declared at the ''Zoma'' (Friday) market the following day.  Friday afternoon, the prime minister's younger brother, Rainilaiarivony, who was head of the army, called several thousand troops into the city to besiege a number of the ''menamaso'' and members of the royal family at the [[Rova of Antananarivo|Rova palace compound]], and by Saturday morning the decision had been made and carried out to execute eleven of the ''menamaso'' and other key political figures who had counseled Radama to legalize dueling. On Sunday, May 10, Rainivoninahitriniony demanded that Radama hand over the ''menamaso'' he was sheltering in the palace, which he refused to do until the Prime Minister agreed to spare their lives; they were handed over but by Monday morning had all been speared to death.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}\n\nThe drama ended on Tuesday morning, May 12, 1863, when a group of officers and soldiers forced their way into the Rova and seized the king.<ref name=\"royalarc\" /> His wife, Queen Rabodo, pleaded for his life to be spared and attempted to stop them but was forcibly removed. The soldiers threw a [[lamba (garment)|lamba]] over Radama's head and strangled him with a silk sash until he was believed to be dead, thereby avoiding the shedding of royal blood as was the custom for royal executions in Imerina.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}\n\nThe nobles informed Rabodo that she would have their support as queen on the condition that she would accept to abide by certain articles that would form a new contract between rulers and ruled in Madagascar:{{sfn|Prout|1863|p=}}\n\n{{quote|text=\"For the future the word of the sovereign alone was not to be law, but that the sovereign, the nobles and the heads of the people were to unite in making the laws; that the friendship with foreigners was to be maintained; that no one was to be put to death on the word of the sovereign alone, but that the nobles and the heads of the people must concur in the sentence before it could be inflicted; that religion and worship were to be equally free to all \u2013 to natives and foreigners, to Christians and non-Christians \u2013 excepting in [[Ambohimanga]] where there should be no public worship. The ordeal of ''tangena'' was not to be used, but death should be inflicted for great crimes.\"|sign = Ebenezer Prout |source=Madagascar: Its Mission and Its Martyrs (1863){{sfn|Prout|1863|p=}}}}\n\nRabodo agreed to these conditions. The next morning, it was publicly announced in the marketplace that Radama had taken his own life due to grief over the deaths of his compatriots the ''menamaso'' and that Rabodo would succeed him as Queen [[Rasoherina]]. To cement the new power-sharing agreement between the ruler, the nobles and the heads of the people, a political marriage was contracted between the queen and Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, who had been instrumental in her first husband's death.{{sfn|Prout|1863|p=}} Radama's name was struck from the list of kings and it was declared illegal to mourn his death.{{sfn|De La Vaissi\u00e8re|1884|p=}}\n\n== Rumors of survival ==\nFollowing Radama II's apparent death, rumors spread that he had only been rendered unconscious by the attempt on his life and had revived as his body was being transported to [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Ilafy|Ilafy]] for interment in his designated tomb. French historian Delval presents evidence that supports a scenario wherein the group tasked with carrying Radama's body to Ilafy became frightened as the king began to revive, prompting them to abandon the body and then falsely maintain that they had completed their task to place him in the tomb.{{sfn|Delval|1972|p=}} Within months after his reported death, rumors began circulating that Radama was alive, residing on the west coast of the island and was amassing supporters for a political comeback. The rumors persisted to the point of causing political turmoil in Antananarivo.{{sfn|De La Vaissi\u00e8re|1884|p=}} These claims may have had some substance judging by the actions of others. Prominent Christian missionaries outside the capital made extensive efforts to visit and support Radama but seemingly never succeeded. Traditionalist factions within the government were concerned enough by the rumors to have put to death sixteen of his supporters, as well as fining hundreds of others.{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=}} According to evidence in Delval's study, Radama may indeed have survived and, failing to regain the throne, lived to old age as an ordinary citizen in the north of the island.{{sfn|Ade Ajayi |1989|p=}}\n\nWith the apparent murder of Radama II, the power of the Merina monarchs was broken. Subsequent monarchs were controlled by influential Hova, particularly Rainilaiarivony, who became Prime Minister after his brother and successively married all three remaining queens of the monarchy: [[Rasoherina]], [[Ranavalona II]] and [[Ranavalona III]].{{sfn|Ade Ajayi |1989|p=}}\n\n== Issue ==\nRadama had three illegitimate children, none of whom were in the line of succession:<ref name=\"royalarc\" />\n* Johns (or Jons; 1854 \u2013 Rova Palace, 4 May 1863), who died during the \"[[Dancing mania|Ramenenjana]]\" epidemic.\n* A son, who was born on 7 August 1862.\n* Rahamina, who was the daughter of Rasoaray and thus the niece of [[Rainilaiarivony]], whose son, Rajoelina, she married.

Radama's rule, although brief, was a pivotal period in the history of the Kingdom of Madagascar. Under the unyielding and often harsh 33-year rule of his mother, Queen Ranavalona I, Madagascar had successfully preserved its cultural and political independence from French and British designs. Rejecting the queen's policy of isolationism and Christian persecution, Radama II permitted religious freedom and re-opened Madagascar to European influence. Under the terms of the [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert#Lambert Charter|Lambert Charter]], which Radama secretly contracted in 1855 with French entrepreneur [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert]] while Ranavalona still ruled, the French were awarded exclusive rights to the exploitation of large tracts of valuable land and other lucrative resources and projects. This agreement, which was later revoked by Prime Minister [[Rainilaiarivony]], was key to establishing France's claim over Madagascar as a protectorate and, in 1896, as a colony.\n\nThe dramatic contrast between Ranavalona's isolationism and her son's pro-European stance represented an abrupt reversal of policy that threatened the traditional sociopolitical order. Radama's absolutism in pursuing dramatic reforms in disregard of the advice of his ministers ultimately turned them against him. In a coup led by his Prime Minister, [[Rainivoninahitriniony]], Radama II was strangled on May 12, 1863. His wife Rabodo, who took the throne name [[Rasoherina]], was allowed by the ministers to succeed her husband on the condition that she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally, but rather in concert with the [[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]] (the class of free citizens) as represented by the position of Prime Minister. The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that his body had been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in [[Ilafy]]. However, there soon emerged rumors \u2013 believed by prominent foreigners [[Jean Laborde]] and [[William Ellis (missionary)|William Ellis]] \u2013 that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne. A strong case has since been made on the basis of significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in anonymity near [[Lake Kinkony]] in the northwestern part of the island.\n\n== Upbringing and early years ==\nRadama II was born Prince Rakoto (Rakotosehenondradama) on September 23, 1829 in the Imasoandro building on the compound of the [[Rova of Antananarivo]].<ref name=\"royalarc\">{{cite web | last = Buyers | first = Christopher | title = The Merina (or Hova) Dynasty | url = http://www.royalark.net/Madagascar/madagascar1.htm | accessdate = February 3, 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110106184735/http://www.royalark.net/Madagascar/madagascar1.htm | archivedate = January 6, 2011 | ref = harv | url-status = dead }}</ref>  He was officially recognized as the son of King [[Radama I]] and his widow Queen [[Ranavalona I]], although the king had died more than nine months before the prince's birth. He was likely fathered by a lover of his mother, [[Andriamihaja]], a progressive young officer of the [[Merina]] army who the queen may have been tricked into putting to death by conservative ministers at court.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}\n\nAfter his mother succeeded Radama I on the throne, she instituted an increasingly regressive regime that attempted to restore traditional values and contain or eliminate westernization.{{sfn|Ade Ajayi |1989|p=}} The prince, however, who had been highly influenced by the French adviser to the queen, [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert]], was favorably impressed by European culture, knowledge and its state of economic, political and technological development, and was troubled by some of the socially repressive policies pursued by Ranavalona I.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}  According to a British account, the French played on this sympathy in 1855 by pressuring Prince Rakoto into signing a request for French aid that would have enabled France to establish control over Madagascar had the true nature of the letter and its signing not been uncovered by Rakoto and his British contacts.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}} An alternate explanation was offered by Lambert, who maintained that the prince had knowingly supported the attempt to put an end to his mother's harsh policies, and was a willing collaborator in a [[Ranavalona I#Foreign plots|failed 1857 plot]] to remove her from the throne.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|1861|p=}}\n\nPrior to Queen Ranavalona's death, the conservative and progressive factions within the Merina court waged a [[Ranavalona I#Internal divisions at court|tactical power struggle]] to secure a successor favorable to their own political agenda.{{sfn|Ade Ajayi |1989|p=}} The conservative faction favored Ramboasalama, the son of the Queen's sister, while the Queen's Prime Minister, [[Rainivoninahitriniony]] and head of the army, [[Rainilaiarivony]], brothers and progressives, supported Radama II.  The latter successfully obtained key strategic allies within the court that enabled Radama to seize the throne without violence following his mother's death. Ramboasalama was obliged to swear a public oath of allegiance to Radama, and was later sent into exile in the highland village of Ambohimirimo where he died in April 1962.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}\n\n== Reign ==\nPrince Rakoto acceded to the throne on August 16, 1861 upon the natural death of his mother, Queen Ranavalona I, assuming the throne name Radama II. His coronation ceremony was held the following year on September 23, 1862.<ref name=\"royalarc\" /> Once upon the throne, he immediately initiated a rapid and dramatic reversal of many of his mother's traditionalist policies.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}  He reopened the country to foreign powers and concluded treaties of friendship with Britain and France. The [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert#Lambert Charter|Lambert Charter]] opened up business possibilities for French investors. Freedom of religion was declared, persecution of Christians ceased, missionaries returned to the island and their schools were reopened. Radama abolished the traditional trial by ordeal of ''[[Ranavalona I#Tangena ordeal|tangena]]'', in which the guilt or innocence of an accused person was determined based on the outcome of consuming the poison of the ''tangena'' nut, and inhabitants of [[Antananarivo]] were permitted to raise swine within the city walls, a practice previously forbidden by a ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' (taboo) forbidding them from being kept near the royal talismans (''[[sampy]]''). The sampy were dispersed to the [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina|sacred villages]] where they had originated under 16th-century Merina king [[Ralambo]] and other early monarchs.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}} Significantly, Radama freed numerous political prisoners captured under Ranavalona I during provincial wars of subjugation and offered repatriation of confiscated property. This pardon was reciprocated by many of the beneficiary ethnic groups around the island, and good will between the coasts and central administration at Antananarivo improved significantly.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}} These changes, and the king himself, were unequivocally praised by Madagascar's European partners:\n\n{{quote|text=\"It is most remarkable that Radama II should have formed views of policy so large and liberal, so enlightened, humane and patriotic as those which form the foundation of his throne; that the son of such a mother, trained up under a despotism so dark, and restrictive and cruel, should have adopted such principles of religious freedom and political economy, as equal civil liberty and universal free trade principles, which our own nation has been so slow to learn, and which are still repudiated in many lands where civilization is far advanced.\"|sign = Ebenezer Prout |source=Madagascar: Its Mission and Its Martyrs (1863){{sfn|Prout|1863|p=}}}}\n\nThe reaction within [[Imerina]] was less one-sided.  The abrupt and dramatic policy changes pursued by the progressive king both alienated and disfranchised the established conservative factions among the [[andriana]] (nobles) and [[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]] (freemen) at court. Especially controversial were the special privileges accorded to [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert]] and his partners under the Lambert Charter, including the exclusive implementation of public works projects (felling trees, making roads, building canals etc.), control over minting coinage, lucrative mining rights and more as part of the purview of Lambert's proposed ''Compagnie de Madagascar'' (French Madagascar Company).  The citizens' concern stemmed primarily from clauses in the agreement that would have permitted Lambert's company to become permanent owners of Malagasy lands.  Until this point, land in Madagascar, which was viewed by the populace as the sacred ground of the ancestors, could only ever be temporarily possessed by foreigners until their death, at which point the land would revert to the crown. The threat of permanently losing any part of sacred Malagasy soil to foreigners was deeply troubling.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}{{efn|Similarly, the November 2008 agreement to lease large tracts of Malagasy land to the South Korean company [[Daewoo]] was a major factor leading to the [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|2009 ''coup d'etat'']] that brought down the [[Marc Ravalomanana|Ravalomanana]] administration.<ref>{{cite web | author = International Crisis Group | language = French | title = Madagascar: sortir du cycle de crises.

The prime minister prevented the law from being publicly declared at the ''Zoma'' (Friday) market the following day.  Friday afternoon, the prime minister's younger brother, Rainilaiarivony, who was head of the army, called several thousand troops into the city to besiege a number of the ''menamaso'' and members of the royal family at the [[Rova of Antananarivo|Rova palace compound]], and by Saturday morning the decision had been made and carried out to execute eleven of the ''menamaso'' and other key political figures who had counseled Radama to legalize dueling. On Sunday, May 10, Rainivoninahitriniony demanded that Radama hand over the ''menamaso'' he was sheltering in the palace, which he refused to do until the Prime Minister agreed to spare their lives; they were handed over but by Monday morning had all been speared to death.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}\n\nThe drama ended on Tuesday morning, May 12, 1863, when a group of officers and soldiers forced their way into the Rova and seized the king.<ref name=\"royalarc\" /> His wife, Queen Rabodo, pleaded for his life to be spared and attempted to stop them but was forcibly removed. The soldiers threw a [[lamba (garment)|lamba]] over Radama's head and strangled him with a silk sash until he was believed to be dead, thereby avoiding the shedding of royal blood as was the custom for royal executions in Imerina.{{sfn|Oliver|1886|p=}}\n\nThe nobles informed Rabodo that she would have their support as queen on the condition that she would accept to abide by certain articles that would form a new contract between rulers and ruled in Madagascar:{{sfn|Prout|1863|p=}}\n\n{{quote|text=\"For the future the word of the sovereign alone was not to be law, but that the sovereign, the nobles and the heads of the people were to unite in making the laws; that the friendship with foreigners was to be maintained; that no one was to be put to death on the word of the sovereign alone, but that the nobles and the heads of the people must concur in the sentence before it could be inflicted; that religion and worship were to be equally free to all \u2013 to natives and foreigners, to Christians and non-Christians \u2013 excepting in [[Ambohimanga]] where there should be no public worship. The ordeal of ''tangena'' was not to be used, but death should be inflicted for great crimes.\"|sign = Ebenezer Prout |source=Madagascar: Its Mission and Its Martyrs (1863){{sfn|Prout|1863|p=}}}}\n\nRabodo agreed to these conditions. The next morning, it was publicly announced in the marketplace that Radama had taken his own life due to grief over the deaths of his compatriots the ''menamaso'' and that Rabodo would succeed him as Queen [[Rasoherina]]. To cement the new power-sharing agreement between the ruler, the nobles and the heads of the people, a political marriage was contracted between the queen and Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, who had been instrumental in her first husband's death.{{sfn|Prout|1863|p=}} Radama's name was struck from the list of kings and it was declared illegal to mourn his death.{{sfn|De La Vaissi\u00e8re|1884|p=}}\n\n== Rumors of survival ==\nFollowing Radama II's apparent death, rumors spread that he had only been rendered unconscious by the attempt on his life and had revived as his body was being transported to [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Ilafy|Ilafy]] for interment in his designated tomb. French historian Delval presents evidence that supports a scenario wherein the group tasked with carrying Radama's body to Ilafy became frightened as the king began to revive, prompting them to abandon the body and then falsely maintain that they had completed their task to place him in the tomb.{{sfn|Delval|1972|p=}} Within months after his reported death, rumors began circulating that Radama was alive, residing on the west coast of the island and was amassing supporters for a political comeback. The rumors persisted to the point of causing political turmoil in Antananarivo.{{sfn|De La Vaissi\u00e8re|1884|p=}} These claims may have had some substance judging by the actions of others. Prominent Christian missionaries outside the capital made extensive efforts to visit and support Radama but seemingly never succeeded. Traditionalist factions within the government were concerned enough by the rumors to have put to death sixteen of his supporters, as well as fining hundreds of others.{{sfn|Brown|2002|p=}} According to evidence in Delval's study, Radama may indeed have survived and, failing to regain the throne, lived to old age as an ordinary citizen in the north of the island.{{sfn|Ade Ajayi |1989|p=}}\n\nWith the apparent murder of Radama II, the power of the Merina monarchs was broken. Subsequent monarchs were controlled by influential Hova, particularly Rainilaiarivony, who became Prime Minister after his brother and successively married all three remaining queens of the monarchy: [[Rasoherina]], [[Ranavalona II]] and [[Ranavalona III]].{{sfn|Ade Ajayi |1989|p=}}\n\n== Issue ==\nRadama had three illegitimate children, none of whom were in the line of succession:<ref name=\"royalarc\" />\n* Johns (or Jons; 1854 \u2013 Rova Palace, 4 May 1863), who died during the \"[[Dancing mania|Ramenenjana]]\" epidemic.\n* A son, who was born on 7 August 1862.\n* Rahamina, who was the daughter of Rasoaray and thus the niece of [[Rainilaiarivony]], whose son, Rajoelina, she married.

In addition, some weapons\u2014notably anti-personnel explosives, the [[K-50M]] (a [[PPSh-41]] copy), and \"home-made\" versions of the [[RPG-2]]\u2014were manufactured in North Vietnam. By 1969 the US Army had identified 40 rifle/carbine types, 22 machine gun types, 17 types of mortar, 20 recoilless rifle or rocket launcher types, nine types of antitank weapons, and 14 anti-aircraft artillery weapons used by ground troops on all sides. Also in use, primarily by anti-communist forces, were the 24 types of armored vehicles and self-propelled artillery, and 26 types of field artillery and rocket launchers.\n\n==Communist forces and weapons==\n[[File:Captured NVA Weapons.jpg|thumb|Captured PAVN weapons]]\nDuring the early stages of their insurgency, the Viet Cong mainly sustained itself with captured arms (often of American manufacture){{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=813.3}} or crude, self-made weapons (e.g. copies of the US [[Thompson submachine gun]]{{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=187.2}} and [[shotgun]]s made of galvanized pipes).{{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=994.1}} Most arms were captured from poorly defended ARVN militia outposts.{{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=814.4}}\n\nCommunist forces were principally armed with Chinese and Soviet weaponry though some VC guerrilla units were equipped with Western infantry weapons either captured from French stocks during the first Indochina war, such as the [[MAT-49]], or from ARVN units or requisitioned through illicit purchase.\n\nIn the summer and fall of 1967, all Viet Cong battalions were reequipped with arms of Soviet design such as the [[AK-47]] assault rifle and the [[RPG-2]] anti-tank weapon.{{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=1883.5}} Their weapons were principally of Chinese<ref>{{cite web|first=Bob|last=Seals|url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thcentury/articles/chinesesupport.aspx|title=Chinese Support for North Vietnam during the Vietnam War: The Decisive Edge|work=Military History Online|date=23 September 2008}}</ref> or Soviet manufacture.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Albert|last=Parray|magazine=Military Review|url=http://calldp.leavenworth.army.mil/eng_mr/txts/VOL47/00000006/art2.pdf|title=Soviet aid to Vietnam|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110428210157/http://calldp.leavenworth.army.mil/eng_mr/txts/VOL47/00000006/art2.pdf|archive-date=28 April 2011|url-status=dead|date=June 1967}}</ref> The period up to the conventional phase in the 1970, the Viet Cong and NVA were primarily limited to mortars, recoil-less rifles and small-arms and had significantly lighter equipment and firepower in comparison with the US arsenal, relying on ambushes alongside superior stealth, planning, marksmanship and small-unit tactics to face the disproportionate US technological advantage.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=jexmAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT101|title=Indochina and Vietnam: The Thirty-five Year War, 1940\u20131975|last=Miller|first=Robert|last2=Wainstock|first2=Dennis D.|publisher=Enigma Books|year=2013|isbn=978-1936274666|location=|pages=101\u201302|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMany divisions within the NVA would incorporate armoured and mechanised battalions including the [[Type 59 tank]]., [[BTR-60]], [[D-74 122 mm field gun|Type 60 artillery]] and rapidly altered and integrated new war doctrines following the Tet Offensive into a mobile combined-arms force.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/north-vietnams-master-plan.htm|title=North Vietnam's Master Plan|website=HistoryNet|access-date=2018-06-01}}</ref> The North Vietnamese had both [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious tanks]] (such as the [[PT-76]]) and [[light tank]]s (such the [[Type 62]]) used during the conventional phase.

Often the gun suffered from a malfunction known as \"failure to extract\", which meant that the spent cartridge case remained lodged in the chamber after a round was fired. According to a congressional report, the malfunction was caused by a change of gunpowder in the ammunition, which was done without adequate testing and by a money saving policy, headed by Robert S. McNamara, to not issue adequate cleaning kits to soldiers. This led to a myth of a self-cleaning gun. These decisions were made without regard to the safety of soldiers and resulted in many deaths.\n\nThe heavily armored, 90&nbsp;mm gun [[M48 Patton|M48A3 'Patton' tank]] saw extensive action during the Vietnam War and over 600 were deployed with U.S. forces. They played an important role in infantry support though there were a  few tank versus tank battles. The [[M67 Flame Thrower Tank|M67A1 flamethrower tank]] (nicknamed the [[Zippo]]) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam. Artillery was used extensively by both sides but the Americans were able to ferry the lightweight 105&nbsp;mm [[M102 howitzer]] by helicopter to remote locations on quick notice.<ref>Bart Hagerman, USA Airborne: 50th Anniversary, Turner Publishing Company, p.237</ref><ref name=\"Tolsonarmy\">{{cite book |url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/vietnam/airmobility/airmobility-fm.html |title = Vietnam Studies: Airmobility 1961\u201371 |work = Department of the Army |author = Lieutenant General John J.

U.S. airpower was credited with breaking the [[Battle of Khe Sanh|siege of Khe Sanh]] and blunting the 1972 [[Easter Offensive]] against South Vietnam. At sea, the U.S. Navy had the run of the coastline, using aircraft carriers as platforms for offshore strikes and other naval vessels for offshore artillery support. Offshore naval fire played a pivotal role in the [[Battle of Hu\u1ebf]] in February 1968, providing accurate fire in support of the U.S. counter-offensive to retake the city.<ref>{{cite book|first=George W.|last=Smith|title=The siege at Hue|publisher= Lynne Reinner Publishers|date=1999|pp=142-143}}</ref>\n[[File:Khu_tr\u01b0ng_b\u00e0y_m\u00e1y_bay.JPG|thumb|Captured South Vietnamese warplanes in Ho Chi Minh City]]\nThe Vietnam War was the first conflict that saw wide scale tactical deployment of helicopters.<ref>Dwayne A.

War]]''', which involved the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) or North Vietnamese Army (NVA), National Liberation Front for South Vietnam (NLF) or [[Viet Cong]] (VC), and the armed forces of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN), [[United States Armed Forces|United States]], [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces|Republic of Korea]], [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Philippines]], [[Royal Thai Armed Forces|Thailand]], and the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian]], [[New Zealand Defence Force|New Zealand]] defence forces, and a variety of irregular troops.\n\nNearly all United States-allied forces were armed with U.S. weapons including the [[M1 Garand]], [[M1 carbine]], [[M14 rifle|M-14]] and [[M16 rifle|M-16]].  The Australian and New Zealand forces employed the 7.62&nbsp;mm [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] as their service rifle, with the occasional US M16.\n\nThe PAVN, although having inherited a variety of American, French, and Japanese weapons from [[World War II]] and the [[First Indochina War]] (aka French Indochina War), were largely armed and supplied by the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[Soviet Union]], and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies. In addition, some weapons\u2014notably anti-personnel explosives, the [[K-50M]] (a [[PPSh-41]] copy), and \"home-made\" versions of the [[RPG-2]]\u2014were manufactured in North Vietnam. By 1969 the US Army had identified 40 rifle/carbine types, 22 machine gun types, 17 types of mortar, 20 recoilless rifle or rocket launcher types, nine types of antitank weapons, and 14 anti-aircraft artillery weapons used by ground troops on all sides. Also in use, primarily by anti-communist forces, were the 24 types of armored vehicles and self-propelled artillery, and 26 types of field artillery and rocket launchers.\n\n==Communist forces and weapons==\n[[File:Captured NVA Weapons.jpg|thumb|Captured PAVN weapons]]\nDuring the early stages of their insurgency, the Viet Cong mainly sustained itself with captured arms (often of American manufacture){{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=813.3}} or crude, self-made weapons (e.g. copies of the US [[Thompson submachine gun]]{{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=187.2}} and [[shotgun]]s made of galvanized pipes).{{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=994.1}} Most arms were captured from poorly defended ARVN militia outposts.{{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=814.4}}\n\nCommunist forces were principally armed with Chinese and Soviet weaponry though some VC guerrilla units were equipped with Western infantry weapons either captured from French stocks during the first Indochina war, such as the [[MAT-49]], or from ARVN units or requisitioned through illicit purchase.\n\nIn the summer and fall of 1967, all Viet Cong battalions were reequipped with arms of Soviet design such as the [[AK-47]] assault rifle and the [[RPG-2]] anti-tank weapon.{{sfn|Sheehan|2009|p=1883.5}} Their weapons were principally of Chinese<ref>{{cite web|first=Bob|last=Seals|url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/20thcentury/articles/chinesesupport.aspx|title=Chinese Support for North Vietnam during the Vietnam War: The Decisive Edge|work=Military History Online|date=23 September 2008}}</ref> or Soviet manufacture.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Albert|last=Parray|magazine=Military Review|url=http://calldp.leavenworth.army.mil/eng_mr/txts/VOL47/00000006/art2.pdf|title=Soviet aid to Vietnam|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110428210157/http://calldp.leavenworth.army.mil/eng_mr/txts/VOL47/00000006/art2.pdf|archive-date=28 April 2011|url-status=dead|date=June 1967}}</ref> The period up to the conventional phase in the 1970, the Viet Cong and NVA were primarily limited to mortars, recoil-less rifles and small-arms and had significantly lighter equipment and firepower in comparison with the US arsenal, relying on ambushes alongside superior stealth, planning, marksmanship and small-unit tactics to face the disproportionate US technological advantage.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=jexmAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT101|title=Indochina and Vietnam: The Thirty-five Year War, 1940\u20131975|last=Miller|first=Robert|last2=Wainstock|first2=Dennis D.|publisher=Enigma Books|year=2013|isbn=978-1936274666|location=|pages=101\u201302|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMany divisions within the NVA would incorporate armoured and mechanised battalions including the [[Type 59 tank]]., [[BTR-60]], [[D-74 122 mm field gun|Type 60 artillery]] and rapidly altered and integrated new war doctrines following the Tet Offensive into a mobile combined-arms force.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/north-vietnams-master-plan.htm|title=North Vietnam's Master Plan|website=HistoryNet|access-date=2018-06-01}}</ref> The North Vietnamese had both [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious tanks]] (such as the [[PT-76]]) and [[light tank]]s (such the [[Type 62]]) used during the conventional phase.

Often the gun suffered from a malfunction known as \"failure to extract\", which meant that the spent cartridge case remained lodged in the chamber after a round was fired. According to a congressional report, the malfunction was caused by a change of gunpowder in the ammunition, which was done without adequate testing and by a money saving policy, headed by Robert S. McNamara, to not issue adequate cleaning kits to soldiers. This led to a myth of a self-cleaning gun. These decisions were made without regard to the safety of soldiers and resulted in many deaths.\n\nThe heavily armored, 90&nbsp;mm gun [[M48 Patton|M48A3 'Patton' tank]] saw extensive action during the Vietnam War and over 600 were deployed with U.S. forces. They played an important role in infantry support though there were a  few tank versus tank battles. The [[M67 Flame Thrower Tank|M67A1 flamethrower tank]] (nicknamed the [[Zippo]]) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam. Artillery was used extensively by both sides but the Americans were able to ferry the lightweight 105&nbsp;mm [[M102 howitzer]] by helicopter to remote locations on quick notice.<ref>Bart Hagerman, USA Airborne: 50th Anniversary, Turner Publishing Company, p.237</ref><ref name=\"Tolsonarmy\">{{cite book |url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/vietnam/airmobility/airmobility-fm.html |title = Vietnam Studies: Airmobility 1961\u201371 |work = Department of the Army |author = Lieutenant General John J.

U.S. airpower was credited with breaking the [[Battle of Khe Sanh|siege of Khe Sanh]] and blunting the 1972 [[Easter Offensive]] against South Vietnam. At sea, the U.S. Navy had the run of the coastline, using aircraft carriers as platforms for offshore strikes and other naval vessels for offshore artillery support. Offshore naval fire played a pivotal role in the [[Battle of Hu\u1ebf]] in February 1968, providing accurate fire in support of the U.S. counter-offensive to retake the city.<ref>{{cite book|first=George W.|last=Smith|title=The siege at Hue|publisher= Lynne Reinner Publishers|date=1999|pp=142-143}}</ref>\n[[File:Khu_tr\u01b0ng_b\u00e0y_m\u00e1y_bay.JPG|thumb|Captured South Vietnamese warplanes in Ho Chi Minh City]]\nThe Vietnam War was the first conflict that saw wide scale tactical deployment of helicopters.<ref>Dwayne A.

Arguably, an effective deterrent as there is no record of them ever being engaged in serious combat.\n\n=== '''Modern History''' ===\nAlthough the population of Hoy is now only around 400, there was a much larger population in the past. In 1890 there were 4 schools on the island and 4 churches suggesting a much larger population. Despite the larger population there was no paved road between the north of the island and the southern tip of the island and [[South Walls]] island, only a footpath. There was however an unmetalled road between the two villages on the north of the isle; Rackwick and Moaness. <ref name=\":2\">observations of ordnance survey maps of the time.</ref>\n\n==== '''Longhope lifeboat station''' ====\nA Lifeboat has been on Hoy since 1874 which was originally housed in a prominent stone building close to the west end of the causeway that links the two islands of Hoy and South Walls together at a cost of \u00a3228. It was stationed there as it meant that the lifeboat could be dragged over wooden skids and into the sea in either North Bay, giving access to [[Scapa Flow]] or in Aith Hope, an offshoot of the notorious [[Pentland Firth]] to the south. The shed continued to serve as the base of the Longhope lifeboat until 1906, when it was replaced.\n\nThe lifeboat station that stands slightly to the south of the original station which is now home to the Longhope Lifeboat Museum, cost \u00a32,700 to build in 1906. It continued to serve as the base for the Longhope lifeboat until 1999. Whilst based at this station,1969 On 17 March the lifeboat 'T.G.B.' ON 962, capsized while on service to the Liberian vessel 'Irene' and her entire crew of eight lost their lives, known as the Longhope lifeboat disaster.<ref name=\":2\" /> In August of that year an Arun-class lifeboat, Sir Max Aitken II became the Longhope lifeboat. This class was designed to stay permanently afloat, and the decision was taken to move her to purpose-built moorings at Longhope pier. The lifeboats that have served here since have also been stationed at Longhope, including the current vessel the Helen Comrie (a [[Tamar-class lifeboat|Tamar class lifeboat)]] and her predecessor The Queen Mother, which was based here between 2004 and 2006. A station has been built where the lifeboat is moored at Longhope which is also the main habout for boats to and from the island. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== '''World Wars''' ====\nThe main naval base for the British fleet in both the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second]] World Wars, [[Scapa Flow]], was at [[Lyness]] in the southeast of the island. This iis because the sheltered harbour offered an ideal location for refuelling and maintaining the fleet.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe sheltered sounds around the islands of [[Flotta]], Fara, Cava and [[Rysa Little]] made up the [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy\u2019s]] main fleet anchorage in [[Scapa Flow]] during both world wars. At Lyness on Hoy, an oil depot, naval quarters and stores were established during [[World War I]] and were considerably developed in the second world war to form the [[Scapa Flow]] Naval Base Headquarters, temporary wartime home to thousands of military and civilian personnel.\n\nNear the modern ferry terminal is a solitary oil storage tank and pumping station, which together now serve as the Scapa Flow Visitor Centre. This tank, which had a capacity of 12 000 tons, was one of four erected in 1917 when oil-fired warships were coming into service with the Royal Navy. The associated pumping station, also built in 1917, housed the steam pumps which drew the heavy fuel oil from tankers at the pier. Originally coal fired, the pumps were converted to diesel power in 1936 when, with the threat of another war looming, plans were laid to massively increase oil-storage capacity. In 1937, Messrs Balfour Beatty & Co. Ltd were contracted to build 12 slightly larger 15 000 [[ton]] tanks, bringing the total complement of above-ground tanks to 16 by 1938. Also in 1937 the considerable engineering challenge of creating underground tanks \u2013 safer from potential aerial attack \u2013 went to [[Sir William Arrol & Co.|Sir William Arrol & Co. Ltd]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/98128/hoy-lyness-royal-naval-oil-terminal|title=Hoy, Lyness, Royal Naval Oil Terminal {{!}} Canmore|website=canmore.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early years of [[World War II|WWII]], up to 12,000 personnel were based in and around [[Lyness]] to support the defences of the naval anchorage at [[Scapa Flow]] and the ships that used it. To support this huge population, hundreds of accommodation huts were built in a number of camps around [[Lyness]]. A large [[wharf]] was built (known as the Golden Wharf because of its huge cost) along with a series of piers and slipways. Offices, workshops, stores and recreational buildings were erected, including a cinema, a theatre and several churches. An earlier headquarters building was replaced in 1943 by an imposing concrete HQ and communications centre, also located high on Wee Fea which now serves as a hotel.\n\nLyness was finally closed as a naval base in 1957, when it was cleared of many of its wartime buildings, but continued to function as an Admiralty oil fuel depot until 1977.\n[[File:Lyness Royal Naval Cemetery, Hoy, Orkney - geograph.org.uk - 121041.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lyness%20Royal%20Naval%20Cemetery,%20Hoy,%20Orkney%20-%20geograph.org.uk%20-%20121041.jpg|thumb|Lyness Royal Naval Cemetery.]]\nLyness Royal Naval Cemetery is situated around 1.0km inland from the naval base and has an area of around 10,000 square meters (2.5 acres). The cemetery was begun in 1915 when [[Scapa Flow]] was the base of the [[Grand Fleet]]. [[Lyness]] remained as a [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] base until July 1946 and the cemetery contains graves from both wars. There are 445 [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] burials of the First World War, 109 of which are unidentified. The majority of the graves are of officers, ratings, and members of the land forces lost from H.M.S. \"[[HMS Hampshire (1903)|Hampshire]],\" \"[[HMS Vanguard|Vanguard]],\" \"[[HMS Narborough (1916)|Narborough]]\" and \"[[HMS Opal (1915)|Opal]].\" The 200 burials of the Second World War in the cemetery include those of 26 men from H.M.S. \"Royal Oak\", which was sunk off [[Longhope, Orkney|Longhope]] in Scapa Flow by a [[German U-boat]] on 14 October 1939. 8 of these burials are unidentified. The cemetery also contains the graves of 14 sailors of the [[German Navy]] (the [[High Seas Fleet]] was interned at [[Scapa Flow]] after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 Armistice]]), 3 German airmen and 1 German sailor from the 1939-45 war and 1 Norwegian sailor of the 1939-45 war. There are also 30 civilian burials in the site (mostly [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy seaman]]).<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/74567/LYNESS%20ROYAL%20NAVAL%20CEMETERY|title=Cemetery|website=www.cwgc.org|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nHoy is probably most famous though for the stack of the Rackwick coast; the [[Old Man of Hoy]] a sea stack formed from [[Old Red Sandstone]], it is one of the tallest stacks in the United Kingdom at a height of 449-foot (137-metres). The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through [[hydraulic action]] some time after 1750, the stack is no more than a few hundred years old, and paintings 1817 shows the stack with an arch at the bottom which has now further eroded and no longer remains hence it may soon collapse into the sea.\n\nThe dramatic coastline of Hoy can be seen by visitors travelling to Orkney by ferry from the Scottish mainland. It has some of the highest sea cliffs in the Uk at St John's Head, which reach 350m (1,150ft)<ref name=\"Smith\" />\n\nThe name Hoy comes from the [[Old Norse language|Norse]] word ''H\u00e1ey'' meaning \"high island\". It is therefore not surprising that the island of Hoy is the most mountainous in the [[Orkney]] [[archipelago]]. The highest point on the island (and indeed the whole archipelago is [[Ward Hill, Hoy|Ward Hill]] which stands at 481 m (1,578 ft) and is to the north of the island. There is a [[Triangulation station|trig point]] at the summit. \n\nHoy is part of the [[Hoy and West Mainland National Scenic Area|Hoy and West Mainland]] [[National Scenic Area (Scotland)|National Scenic Area]], one of 40 in Scotland.<ref>[http://www.snh.gov.uk/protecting-scotlands-nature/protected-areas/national-designations/nsa/ National Scenic Areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311014235/http://www.snh.gov.uk/protecting-scotlands-nature/protected-areas/national-designations/nsa/|date=11 March 2017}}.

Arguably, an effective deterrent as there is no record of them ever being engaged in serious combat.\n\n=== '''Modern History''' ===\nAlthough the population of Hoy is now only around 400, there was a much larger population in the past. In 1890 there were 4 schools on the island and 4 churches suggesting a much larger population. Despite the larger population there was no paved road between the north of the island and the southern tip of the island and [[South Walls]] island, only a footpath. There was however an unmetalled road between the two villages on the north of the isle; Rackwick and Moaness. <ref name=\":2\">observations of ordnance survey maps of the time.</ref>\n\n==== '''Longhope lifeboat station''' ====\nA Lifeboat has been on Hoy since 1874 which was originally housed in a prominent stone building close to the west end of the causeway that links the two islands of Hoy and South Walls together at a cost of \u00a3228. It was stationed there as it meant that the lifeboat could be dragged over wooden skids and into the sea in either North Bay, giving access to [[Scapa Flow]] or in Aith Hope, an offshoot of the notorious [[Pentland Firth]] to the south. The shed continued to serve as the base of the Longhope lifeboat until 1906, when it was replaced.\n\nThe lifeboat station that stands slightly to the south of the original station which is now home to the Longhope Lifeboat Museum, cost \u00a32,700 to build in 1906. It continued to serve as the base for the Longhope lifeboat until 1999. Whilst based at this station,1969 On 17 March the lifeboat 'T.G.B.' ON 962, capsized while on service to the Liberian vessel 'Irene' and her entire crew of eight lost their lives, known as the Longhope lifeboat disaster.<ref name=\":2\" /> In August of that year an Arun-class lifeboat, Sir Max Aitken II became the Longhope lifeboat. This class was designed to stay permanently afloat, and the decision was taken to move her to purpose-built moorings at Longhope pier. The lifeboats that have served here since have also been stationed at Longhope, including the current vessel the Helen Comrie (a [[Tamar-class lifeboat|Tamar class lifeboat)]] and her predecessor The Queen Mother, which was based here between 2004 and 2006. A station has been built where the lifeboat is moored at Longhope which is also the main habout for boats to and from the island. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== '''World Wars''' ====\nThe main naval base for the British fleet in both the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second]] World Wars, [[Scapa Flow]], was at [[Lyness]] in the southeast of the island. This iis because the sheltered harbour offered an ideal location for refuelling and maintaining the fleet.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe sheltered sounds around the islands of [[Flotta]], Fara, Cava and [[Rysa Little]] made up the [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy\u2019s]] main fleet anchorage in [[Scapa Flow]] during both world wars. At Lyness on Hoy, an oil depot, naval quarters and stores were established during [[World War I]] and were considerably developed in the second world war to form the [[Scapa Flow]] Naval Base Headquarters, temporary wartime home to thousands of military and civilian personnel.\n\nNear the modern ferry terminal is a solitary oil storage tank and pumping station, which together now serve as the Scapa Flow Visitor Centre. This tank, which had a capacity of 12 000 tons, was one of four erected in 1917 when oil-fired warships were coming into service with the Royal Navy. The associated pumping station, also built in 1917, housed the steam pumps which drew the heavy fuel oil from tankers at the pier. Originally coal fired, the pumps were converted to diesel power in 1936 when, with the threat of another war looming, plans were laid to massively increase oil-storage capacity. In 1937, Messrs Balfour Beatty & Co. Ltd were contracted to build 12 slightly larger 15 000 [[ton]] tanks, bringing the total complement of above-ground tanks to 16 by 1938. Also in 1937 the considerable engineering challenge of creating underground tanks \u2013 safer from potential aerial attack \u2013 went to [[Sir William Arrol & Co.|Sir William Arrol & Co. Ltd]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/98128/hoy-lyness-royal-naval-oil-terminal|title=Hoy, Lyness, Royal Naval Oil Terminal {{!}} Canmore|website=canmore.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early years of [[World War II|WWII]], up to 12,000 personnel were based in and around [[Lyness]] to support the defences of the naval anchorage at [[Scapa Flow]] and the ships that used it. To support this huge population, hundreds of accommodation huts were built in a number of camps around [[Lyness]]. A large [[wharf]] was built (known as the Golden Wharf because of its huge cost) along with a series of piers and slipways. Offices, workshops, stores and recreational buildings were erected, including a cinema, a theatre and several churches. An earlier headquarters building was replaced in 1943 by an imposing concrete HQ and communications centre, also located high on Wee Fea which now serves as a hotel.\n\nLyness was finally closed as a naval base in 1957, when it was cleared of many of its wartime buildings, but continued to function as an Admiralty oil fuel depot until 1977.\n[[File:Lyness Royal Naval Cemetery, Hoy, Orkney - geograph.org.uk - 121041.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lyness%20Royal%20Naval%20Cemetery,%20Hoy,%20Orkney%20-%20geograph.org.uk%20-%20121041.jpg|thumb|Lyness Royal Naval Cemetery.]]\nLyness Royal Naval Cemetery is situated around 1.0km inland from the naval base and has an area of around 10,000 square meters (2.5 acres). The cemetery was begun in 1915 when [[Scapa Flow]] was the base of the [[Grand Fleet]]. [[Lyness]] remained as a [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] base until July 1946 and the cemetery contains graves from both wars. There are 445 [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] burials of the First World War, 109 of which are unidentified. The majority of the graves are of officers, ratings, and members of the land forces lost from H.M.S. \"[[HMS Hampshire (1903)|Hampshire]],\" \"[[HMS Vanguard|Vanguard]],\" \"[[HMS Narborough (1916)|Narborough]]\" and \"[[HMS Opal (1915)|Opal]].\" The 200 burials of the Second World War in the cemetery include those of 26 men from H.M.S. \"Royal Oak\", which was sunk off [[Longhope, Orkney|Longhope]] in Scapa Flow by a [[German U-boat]] on 14 October 1939. 8 of these burials are unidentified. The cemetery also contains the graves of 14 sailors of the [[German Navy]] (the [[High Seas Fleet]] was interned at [[Scapa Flow]] after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 Armistice]]), 3 German airmen and 1 German sailor from the 1939-45 war and 1 Norwegian sailor of the 1939-45 war.

The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through [[hydraulic action]] some time after 1750, the stack is no more than a few hundred years old, and paintings 1817 shows the stack with an arch at the bottom which has now further eroded and no longer remains hence it may soon collapse into the sea.\n\nThe dramatic coastline of Hoy can be seen by visitors travelling to Orkney by ferry from the Scottish mainland. It has some of the highest sea cliffs in the Uk at St John's Head, which reach 350m (1,150ft)<ref name=\"Smith\" />\n\nThe name Hoy comes from the [[Old Norse language|Norse]] word ''H\u00e1ey'' meaning \"high island\". It is therefore not surprising that the island of Hoy is the most mountainous in the [[Orkney]] [[archipelago]]. The highest point on the island (and indeed the whole archipelago is [[Ward Hill, Hoy|Ward Hill]] which stands at 481 m (1,578 ft) and is to the north of the island.
