Carnaval officially begins on Sunday and lasts three days until the start of Lent's first day, [[Ash Wednesday]], at midnight.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> Many people in modern times do not relate the holiday at all with religion, but its date is still set before the start of the Christian season of Lent. Also the core of the modern Carnaval has maintained its socially critical function by role reversal and temporary abandonment of social norms. The first day of Carnaval is six weeks before Easter Sunday. Carnaval officially begins on Sunday and lasts three days until the start of Ash Wednesday at midnight. Nowadays the celebrations often start on Thursday evening though, which makes it in practice a six-day celebretion.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nIn the southern part of the Netherlands during Carnaval, normal daily life comes to a near stop. Roads are temporarily blocked and many local businesses close for the week because many employees take days off during and after Carnaval. According to post-[[Napoleon]] tradition, the [[feast day|feast]] lasts from Sunday until Tuesday. In recent years the feast usually starts on Saturday. Also Friday evening (or at schools at Friday afternoon) and in some places Thursday (''Ouwe Wijven'') are considered the start of Carnaval, which makes it a six days' celebration. The festivities last the entire day and well into the nights. Some parades and many balls and ''bonte avonden'' or other meetings are held in the weeks before the official Carnaval, but never before the first official court meeting on 11 November. Historically the 40 days of [[Lent]] would start on Wednesday at midnight and continue until Easter. Nowadays it is still the official ending of Carnaval, though some Carnaval activities such as herring eating are traditionally held on Wednesday after Carnaval. 20 days into Lent there might be another parade or festivities, called \"Half-Vasten\" (Half-Lent). Lent itself is generally not practiced anymore by the Southern Dutch population as a result of [[irreligion]] dominating the area nowadays.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n\n==Name origin==\nThe oldest word which points in the direction of the word \"Carnaval\" is listed on a certificate from the Italian [[Subiaco, Lazio|Subiaco]] from 965 [[common era|CE]] as a timestamp ''Carnelevare''. Also known from the 13th century are the words ''Carnisprivialis'', ''Carnis Privium'' and in an old [[Li\u00e8ge]] text the term ''Quarnivalle''.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nThe origin can be traced to the [[Latin]] expression ''Carne Levare'', or Italian ''Carne lavare'' or ''Carnem levare'' which with reasonable certainty can be translated into \"farewell to the flesh\" or \"taking away the flesh\",<ref>[http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/carnaval etymologiebank.nl]. etymologiebank.nl.

Two other, less likely, explanations that the term would be a contraction of the Latin ''Carne'' (meat) and ''Paler'' (rule), literally \"the time that meat reigns\" and the Italian ''Carnueale'' or the French ''Carne Avalis'' (both mean so much as \"devour flesh\") are given as well.<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\">[http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/meertensnet/wdb.php?sel=79966 Carnaval].

On what nowadays is called ''vastenavond'' (the days before [[fasting]]) all the remaining winter stores of lard, butter and meat which were left would be eaten, for it would soon start to rot and decay. The selected livestock had in fact already been slaughtered in November and the meat would be no longer preservable.

Carnaval, or rather Shrove Tuesday, was officially accepted by Christianity in 1091 and was followed by Lent (the time of penance and mortification) on Ash Wednesday.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nWithin the confines of church liturgy, the old ways changed into the \"Fools Feast\" (''Narrenfeest'', ''F\u00eates des Fous'' or ''Donkey Feast''). The main roles were in the beginning played by the clergy of the minor orders, the sub-deacons. This were clerics who were in many cases illiterate and were also the local main baker or butcher.\nHowever, during the carnaval they became prominent and played the role of crazy bishop or \"donkey pope\" as part of the role reversal function of the carnaval.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nFrom [[Den Bosch]] is according to a document from 1383 known that public stage performances, [[jousting]] tournaments, games, [[cockfight]]s and role dressing were organized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traditie.nl/tradities_26.html?action=tradition&id=15|title=Carnaval Oeteldonk|work=Carnaval Oeteldonk|access-date=10 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225213245/http://www.traditie.nl/tradities_26.html?action=tradition&id=15|archive-date=25 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Around 1400 it was prohibited to roll dice (gambling), but an exception was made during carnaval. This appears from a letter from the council of [[Maastricht]] in 1405. The ban was temporarily lifted and people were allowed to play dice during the carnaval.<ref name=\"ziggo1\"/>\n \nSeveral popes in the past were explicitly involved with the shrove Tuesday celebration. They organized synods regarding fasting and shrove Tuesday, participated with carts in the processions, and promulgated special collections. [[Pope Martin V]], elected on 11 November 1417, is known to be nicknamed \"Papa Carnavale\". This was not due to the fact that he was elected on 11 November to be pope, but because he felt that the carnaval didn't last long enough.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nLike now the carnaval in the Middle Ages reached the highlight in the three days before the beginning of lent. During this period, the city officially handed over the power to \"Prince Carnaval\" and the social revolution was complete. Because of the anonymity offered by the costumes, rank and position were no longer important and one could freely express his opinion and mock anything and anyone. In particular, the [[nobility]], clergy and the wealthy citizens were mocked and ridiculed. This tradition is still reflected in contemporary parades and at the Brabantian ''tonproaten'' and Limburgish ''buutereednen'', the speakers subjects include mocking and ridiculing the local administration.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nThe catholic church, being the most powerful and influential organisation at the time, had to suffer most during carnaval. All kinds of sacred traditions and rules were ridiculed during the feast. A [[donkey]] would be put on the altar during the ''ezelsmis'' (donkey's mass) after which a civilian dressed as a priest staged a [[mass]]. During all the prayers, the \"[[amen]]\"  would be replaced by the donkey imitation \"ia, ia, ia\".  A dance called the [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]] was done during which people did not follow the pastor with the hand on the shoulder, but with the nose at the bottom.  Also celebrated on 28 December is the now forgotten feast of the [[massacre of the innocents]], commemorating the infanticide in [[Bethlehem]]. On this day the children were given the power for one day and turned it against the church. The choirboys put the clergy on a cart full of [[manure]], and then let them pass through the village. Often this gave the mass the opportunity to pelt the church ministers with shit, a phenomenon in slightly modified version to be found now in the spreading [[confetti]] from the carnaval floats.<ref name=\"Isgeschiedenis.nl\"/>\n \nHowever, in 1445 the church attacked the feast furiously. The theologians in Paris felt that the carnaval was out of control, issued a number of prohibitions and drafted a letter, which included the following:\n \n:''The priests wear [[mask]]s during mass, they dance in the [[choir]] dressed as women, matchmakers or minstrels and singing outrageous songs. On the altar they eat [[black pudding]] and fat sausages. They roll [[dice]]s and old shoes are burned instead of incense. Also there is running and jumping by them inside the church. After this mass they go out on the streets in their disguises. With carts and wagons they roam through the city, and give shameless performances to excite the laughter of the audience, which they also further incite with filthy songs and obscene gestures.''\n \nThe theologians conclude their letter stating that they do not even want to mention the worst things that take place during the carnaval.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/><ref name=\"Isgeschiedenis.nl\"/>\n \nThe role of the lower clergy, however, gradually got taken over by [[laymen]]. That is not to say that therefore there was no longer shrove Tuesday or fools bishops, and donkey popes and donkey bishops. The [[laity]] started to play the roles of the dignitaries they ridiculed. Later this practice developed into real titles and the roles of \"[[Prince|Prins]]\" or \"[[F\u00fcrst|Vorst]]\" came into use.\nThe feasts with jesters were in [[Flanders]] and the Netherlands very widespread.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nLater the \"feasts of fools\" are taken over by urban carnaval associations, such as the [[shipping companies]] and [[guild]]s. The celebrations became more expensive every year, so expensive that even the ''Prins'' or ''Vorst'' candidate often fled the city to prevent being elected. Cities even increased their taxes to finance these highly elaborate feasts.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nAlso early as the [[Late Middle Ages]] [[charivari]]s occurred during the carnaval more than usual.<ref>Geschiedenis van het persoonlijk leven.

The [[council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563) and the [[reformation]] caused a complete reverse in attitude towards the carnaval.<ref name=\"ziggo1\"/> The [[Protestant Reformation|schism]] within Christianity as a result of the [[reformation]], led to a religious divide in the territory of the present [[Netherlands]]. [[Protestantism]] became the dominant religion north of the rivers [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] and [[Rhine]]. In the areas that cover today the provinces of Limburg and North Brabant the Catholic religion remained dominant. In the part of the Netherlands that after the reformation became predominantly Protestant, the public [[shrovetide]] celebration disappeared from the streets. The new Protestant clergy found the riotous Catholic carnaval sinful. In the north, the feast quickly eradicated and also in the south the carnaval was restricted. Shrove Tuesday was interpreted as a \"[[romish]]\" [[superstition]] and prohibited to ban it out.<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\"/> In [['s-Hertogenbosch]] e.g. the carnaval was banned in 1629 after Protestants had conquered the city which had belonged to the Roman Catholic [[Spanish Netherlands|Spaniards]].<ref name=\"ziggo1\"/>  By the end of the 17th century carnaval in the [[Netherlands]] had mostly disappeared, though smaller festivities before [[lent]] in the south of the Netherlands and in German [[Rhineland]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] kept some carnaval traditions alive over the next 150 years.<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\"/> In the Catholic south the feast became less celebrated as well during the seventeenth and eighteenth century.<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\"/> Though the celebrations were banned, they did not entirely disappear. This is clear from the fact that a new ban had to be enacted every year.<ref>[http://groetenuitdenbosch.nl/509a.htm Oeteldonk]. Groetenuitdenbosch.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref>  Despite the Protestant rule, the Catholics in the 18th century managed to celebrate some sort of street carnaval. There were still dressing, eating and drinking feasts and all sorts of games were held like goose pulling / rooster smashing (smashing or pulling the head of the animal), cat burning/smashing, [[Ray (fish)|ray]] stabbing, [[wolf hunting]] and herring biting. These games were held in both the 18th and in the 19th century. In [[Venlo]] these games were banned in 1775, but in [[Wijnandsrade]] this tradition was held till 1848.<ref name=\"ziggo1\"/> Also sketches and plays were held. It was only since 1794, the beginning of the [[Batavian Revolution|French era]], that [[Den Bosch]] would officially allow celebrating carnaval again.<ref name=\"ziggo1\"/> In [[Den Bosch]] a large [[effigy]] named ''Knillis'' would be burned as a typical carnaval ritual, until this was prohibited around 1853.<ref>http://thuisinbrabant.delving.org/pdf/thuisinbrabant/brabants-heem/brabants_heem_1958_X_1_125_128.pdf</ref>\n \nAlso [[charivari]]s, which were folk customs that may already existed before 1600, were more often held around the carnaval time. Like in other European countries, the two main purposes of the charivari in Europe were to facilitate change in the current social structure and to act as a form of censure within the community. The goal was to enforce social standards and to rid the community of socially unacceptable relationships that threatened the stability of the whole. By the charivari's the community would punish and correct fellow citizens by public mocking and [[humiliation]] for unwanted behavior like adulterous relationships, men who let themselves be deceived by their wives, men who abused their wives, men who were not dominant in the marriage, widows who wished to remarry, women who wish to marry outside the social group (like a partner from a neighboring village) and other violators of social norms. The victims were subjected to humiliating [[procession]]s with noise and music through the village, forced to do embarrassing or hard labor or their possessions and house would be marked, damaged and soiled. In the period before the carnaval, groups of men would build a carnaval float, while others painted portraits of promiscuous girls, girls of which the boys / men felt had come to age to get married, or women who behaved \"wrongly\".<ref name=\"nl.wikibooks.org\">{{in lang|nl}} [https://nl.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sociale_geschiedenis_van_Europa_1500-1795/Sociale_controle Sociale geschiedenis van Europa 1500-1795/Sociale controle \u2013 Wikibooks].

This girl was chosen because of \"bad\" behavior: often a maid that was sexually used by her master. A large doll to depict the girl was shown on the Sunday of the carnaval after church. The men sang mocking songs on the town square around the doll. Not just \"premarital sexual active\" and \"adulterous\" girls were mocked, also girls could get criticized because of their appearance or language, for turning down suitors, for the extent to which she was kind or kept faithful to her friends.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [https://nl.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sociale_geschiedenis_van_Europa_1500-1795/Liefde_en_vriendschap#Liefde_en_seksualiteit Sociale geschiedenis van Europa 1500-1795/Liefde en vriendschap \u2013 Wikibooks].

This kind of \"political charivaris\" never questioned the [[authority]] of the government itself, but were intended to denounce abuse of power and corruption by the government. The heyday of the political charivaris was between 1820 and 1850. In North Brabant there were various forms of community charivaris around carnaval which till 1934 still often occurred.<ref>Charivari in het oostelijk deel van Noord-Brabant, 1750\u20131850.

The [[carnival]] of [[Venice]] was for a long time the most famous carnival (although [[Napoleon]] abolished it in 1797 and only in 1959 the tradition was restored). From Italy carnival traditions spread to the Catholic nations of Spain, [[Portugal]], and France. From France it spread to [[New France]] in North America (the [[mardi gras]]). From Spain and Portugal, it spread with Catholic colonization to the [[Caribbean]] and Latin America. In the early 19th century the weakened medieval tradition started to revive as well in the German Rhineland and [[Southern Netherlands]]. In 1823 the first modern carnaval parade took place in [[Cologne]], [[Rhineland]], Germany.<ref>[http://www.koelner-karneval.info/Dreigestirn/Dreigestirn.htm Das K\u00f6lner Dreigestirn]. Koelner-karneval.info. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref>\n \nWithout denying that the current carnaval contains several recognizable aspects of the past, the feast as it is held today is relatively young. Carnaval as it's known today began in the postwar period. Before that, it was repressed as a result of the strong protestant influence in the country. With the exception of some places in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and [[North Brabant]], where in the nineteenth century the organization of medieval Carnaval celebrations was reviving again, the vast majority of the carnaval associations is established after [[World War II]].<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nIn the 1950s, with a few exceptions, the feast was still confined to the southern provinces of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and [[North Brabant]], where the majority of the population was Catholic. During the 1960s, the relatively strong [[Border|demarcation]] between the catholic south on one side and the [[calvinism|Calvinist]] west and north on the other side of the Netherlands started to diminish. According to cultural anthropologist Jef de Jager,\n \n<blockquote>The upcoming protest generation saw that its desire for looser manners was honored, at least during the Carnaval days. ...&nbsp;Even mild criticism of the political and social system, until then painstakingly smothered by the authorities, suddenly appeared to be possible&nbsp;...</blockquote>\n \nFor most adolescent participants the longing for personal freedom appealed most to them; thus,\n \n<blockquote>Carnaval became to the South, what the [[provo (movement)|Provo]] was to the North [of the Netherlands]. What actually happened was exactly the opposite of what had happened during the [[Middle Ages]]: a new morality was tested, not to investigate what is not allowed, but to investigate what is allowed.</blockquote>\n \nHence, De Jager believes, Carnaval was one of the developments that gave impetus to the South to more informal manners, [[Individualism|individualization]] and [[sexual revolution]] and then to [[Pillarization|ontzuiling]] (depillarisation) and [[secularization]].<ref name=\"jefdejager.nl\">[http://www.jefdejager.nl/carnaval.php carnaval rituelen en tradities]. Jefdejager.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref>\n \nThe Carnaval exceeded in the 1970s the border that is formed by \"[[Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt delta|the Great Rivers]]\" (the [[Meuse (river)|Maas]], the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] and the [[Rhine]]), lost all religious connotations and became a secular feast. Also the practice of [[lent]] became rapidly extinct in the Netherlands in the 1960s and 1970s. The south of the Netherlands, which is mostly [[Roman Catholic]] by tradition is now largely [[cultural Catholic|secular in practice]].<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\"/>\n \nAfter the modern feast of carnaval lost the association with Christian religion as a result of the rapid secularization in the Netherlands in the second half of the 20th century, the carnaval became more celebrated in parts of the country which were Protestant by tradition. At the end of the twentieth century there were carnaval associations in all the provinces of the Netherlands which are active in organizing the celebrations.<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\"/>  However, in the areas which did not originally celebrate, the feast is still growing to become a tradition. As a result, the carnaval in these parts of the country usually lasts only one day with the emphasis on role dressing and feasting, without the social criticism, parades and months of prelude. The massive carnaval festivities, which suspend the daily life, still mainly take place in [[North Brabant]], [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], [[Twente]] and the municipalities of [[Hulst]], [[Sluis]], [[Nijmegen]], [[Over-Betuwe]], [[Lingewaard]], [[De Liemers]] and [[Arnhem]].<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nCarnaval officially lasts from Sunday to Tuesday, but the current practice is that often there are numerous Carnaval festivities between 11 November and the actual feast, especially in the last weeks before carnaval. Sometimes there are also on [[Ash Wednesday]] some carnaval activities held. The post-Christian carnaval consist of several days consecutively drinking, feasting, role-dressing, social criticizing and mocking, parades and music. Also specific carnaval traditions and customs which may vary from town to town are an important part of the modern carnaval. The ridiculing and socially critical aspects of the carnaval are mostly emphasized during the parades.  Southern schools often dedicate the Friday afternoon before the actual feast to the carnaval. Children are invited to come role-dressed to school, sometimes the schools even organize a school parade and choose a school prince.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> Though some people take the Carnaval traditions very seriously, many people nowadays keep it simple and just drink, sing and dance wearing a colourful outfit.\n \nOn 11 November (the eleventh of the eleventh), at exactly 11:11&nbsp;am, starts the carnaval season. In the Netherlands, the start of the season is celebrated in almost every carnaval celebrating town with some kind of ceremony. The reason for this date is the number 11, which is traditionally the number of fools and madmen.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n[[File:Carnaval 2013 Netherlands.jpg|thumb|Carnaval 2013 Netherlands]]\n\n===Kinds of Carnaval===\nIn the Netherlands there are two kinds of Carnaval: the [[Rhenish]] carnaval and the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] carnaval.\n \nThe Carnavals are in many ways similar, but because of their origins and unique traditions they are also easy to distinguish from each other.\nThe Rhenish variant is usually celebrated in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], the Burgundian variant in the north, mid and west of [[North Brabant]], [[Gelderland]], [[Twente]] and in parts of [[Zeeland]] and in [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. The east of North Brabant (where [[East Brabantian]] is spoken) has manifestations of both types of carnaval and forms an overlap region of the two types of carnaval, but is often classified as [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]]. The [[Rhenish]] carnaval in the Netherlands is a derivative of the [[Cologne]] carnaval. The [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] carnaval originated from the traditional eating feasts during which people would ridicule one another during the carnaval in the [[Southern Netherlands]] (nowadays [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and the Dutch Provinces [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]), especially in the [[Duchy of Brabant]].<ref>[http://www.historien.nl/carnaval-eeuwenoud-feest-der-zotten/ Carnaval: eeuwenoud feest der zotten \u2013 Histori\u00ebn]. Historien.nl (11 November 2009). Retrieved on 2015-05-13.</ref>\n \n==Carnaval customs==\n===Role reversal and role dressing===\nCarnaval is not only a feast of eating and drinking, but also serves as social [[role reversal]] feast which allows people to behave outside the usual acceptable [[Norm (social)|social norm]]. People will dress up as a character, much as seen during the eve of the Christian feast of [[All Saints Day|All Hallows]] that appears in the [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Anglo-Saxon]] culture, which though has developed from a different origin.<ref>McNeill, F. Marian. Hallowe'en: its origin, rites and ceremonies in the Scottish tradition. Albyn Press, 1970. pp.29\u201331</ref> During the Dutch carnaval people will often dress colourful and take on roles like [[jesters]], [[Job (role)|occupation]]s, objects, animals, other [[gender]]s and sexes, [[Archetypal literary criticism|archetype]]s or [[fairytale]] characters, well known people, [[subcultures]], historical figures or foreign cultures. Masks and face paint are often used in combination with the costumes. The old tradition of wearing masks is becoming more and more replaced by the use of face paint, which makes it easier to drink and eat during the feasting. The costumes allow people to change their identity and role in society for a few days without being judged for it by their fellowman during and after the carnaval. This also applies to feasting and drinking and other licentious behaviour which can be attributed to the temporary identity one takes on, rather than to the person him or herself.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> The costumes may, but are often not, meant to be [[Political incorrectness|political incorrect]], ridiculing, [[taboo]]-breaking, politically and socially and religiously critical, insulting or self-mocking, which is part of the role reversal origins of the feast. The function of this is to mirror and exaggerate daily life, to denounce and raise awareness of every day events and put life in perspective. A proper mocking carnaval costume does not simply insult or ridicule, but makes actually a valuable point. When not used to make a point, carnaval costumes offer an opportunity to temporarily change [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and express oneself freely.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> Nowadays some people will have a different costume for each day they celebrate carnaval because of the lack of time to wash their clothes.\n \nTraditionally the role dressing serves three major purposes:<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n* The costume allows people to become and act according to an [[Identity (social science)|identity]] they cannot take on or express during the rest of the year because of social standards and serves thus as an outlet for such needs.\n* The costume offers a visual way of protesting or expressing criticism and mirroring by exaggeration of social circumstances, authority and daily life to break taboos, create awareness and reflect on past and current events.\n* The costume provides protection when criticizing and ridiculing others because the wearer can either not be recognized or the criticism can be attributed to the role the wearer assumes during the carnaval rather than to the wearer himself. Because of this the wearer can safely express his criticism and opinion without having to fear for consequences in his daily life.\n \n===Key transfer===\nThe Prince of carnaval receives on the first day of the carnaval the symbolic key to the city / town from the hands of the mayor, who transfers to him three days of \"power\". This element of the carnaval is already known in the medieval carnaval. The changing of positions in power provide an opportunity to criticize the authorities without fear of retribution and are part of the role reversal function of the carnaval.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n===Carnaval associations===\nSince 1839 numerous societies were established which organized carnaval balls. In fact, these associations took on lots of activities which the [[guild]]s used to organize in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern Period]] before the [[History of the Netherlands|French occupation]] and are in that sense their successors.\n \nMore than Burgundian, the Rhenish carnaval celebrations are dominated by carnaval associations. These associations, of which there are sometimes many per city or village with each their own prince and council of eleven, organize their own festivities for both members and non-members of the association during the carnaval.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> At the Burgundian carnaval the main features (\"bonte avonden\" and \"pronkzitting\", key exchange, [[parades]], etc.) are organized by a carnaval association. The associations choose a prince (and entourage) and even though a [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] town can have dozens of carnaval associations, there is only one prince per city or village.\n \n[[Cologne]] had already started organizing carnaval by an association in 1823, followed in 1835 by [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and [[Mainz]] in 1838. In Limburg the carnaval organized by an association was as common as in the German [[Rhineland]]. Momus was probably the first carnaval association in the Netherlands and was founded in 1839 in [[Maastricht]], followed by Jocus in the city of [[Venlo]] in 1842. Momus name derives from the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Momus]]. According to the ''D\u00fcsseldorfer Narrenkalender'' from 1841 \"Carnaval the Great has three sons: Momus, [[Comus]] and Jocus\". Momus is the Greek god of mockery and criticism. When in Venlo a sorority founded the carnaval association, they could thus choose between Comus ([[Greek mythology|Greek god]] of festivity, anarchy and chaos) and Jocus ([[Roman mythology|Roman god]] of wit and raillery). Momus is not the oldest existing carnaval association because it had faded out before the [[Second World War]] in 1939. After the war the carnaval in [[Maastricht]] was organized by the Tempeleers.<ref>[http://www.tempeleers.nl Home | De Tempeleers]. Tempeleers.nl (17 February 2015).

Jocusvenlo.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref>\n \n===Carnaval parades===\nIn many places, large carnaval parades are held with large floats, organized and created by the carnaval associations. These are called ''D'n Optocht'' or ''D'n Boonte St\u00f6rrem'' (The Motley Storm). The parades have usual a particular theme whereby authorities are ridiculed and criticized, events of the past year are represented and which are often politically incorrect and used to make people think outside the box or function as a mirror to the society. Also groups or individuals on foot will participate and fill the gaps between the carnaval wagons during the parade. Fanfares and marching bands will provide for typical carnaval music. The floats are built by carnaval associations, but also often by independent groups of friends, families, neighbourhoods or other clubs. A massive ship-looking wagon is shown in every carnaval parade which is manned by the prince, his entourage and the council of eleven of the city it is held or of the carnaval association that organized the parade and is usually the last float at the parade. Carnaval parades often start at 11.11&nbsp;am and end early in the afternoon. Some wil start in the afternoon to give participants the opportunity to join several parades a day and to give the public and participants the opportunity to be somewhat more sober / less hangover after the drinking of the day before. In that case they will start at 11 past the hour as well. Usually a competition will be held to choose the most outstanding contribution to the parade with separate categories for floats, groups on foot and individual participants. Although a procession usually takes from a starting point to a point of arrival, it actually roams from nowhere to nowhere. What only matters is the social binding during the parade. Along the route, the crowd forms a very essential part of the parade. The crowd is not just spectator, they form living dikes along the carnaval river without which the parade would lose meaning.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nAlso separate children's parade are sometimes held which focuses not on [[ridiculing]] and criticism, but on role changing and dressing.\n \n[[File:Prins Stan.jpg|thumb|upright|Youth prince Stan and adjutant of \"Keiengat\" ([[Waalre]]), 2006]]\n \n===Eleven===\nThe number [[11 (number)|eleven]] plays an undeniably important role in the carnaval.\nThe opinions on this subject are very divergent, so much so that one explanation often has nothing to do even with the other.\nOn the other hand, the number eleven is not only central to the carnaval, but it has built up a kind of mystical and magical value through the ages.\n \n====11 November====\n11 November, the 11th of the 11th, is an important date. 11 November is exactly 40 days before 21 December, the shortest day. This happens to be the feast day of ''sint Maarten'' ([[st. Martin's day]]). This day is celebrated in some parts of [[Groningen]], [[North Holland]] and the southern part of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and to a lesser extent in [[South Holland]] and [[Zeeland]]. This feast is the beginning of the dark period before Christmas and the long days of winter.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nFor centuries, 11 November, was the day that the year's work was deemed to be done. The barns were filled for the winter, the selected livestock would have been slaughtered and very importantly: the lease, property taxes, interests, and [[tithe]] were to be paid. These often weighed very heavily on the population. A year of scraping, frugality and putting every penny aside, would end after the payment on 11 November.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nIn both the Rhenish and the Burgundian carnaval 11-11 plays an important role. At 11\u201311 on 11.11 a.m. is the first of court meetings by the Council of Eleven held in preparation for the upcoming carnaval. During this meeting will also the new Prince be announced. In Brabant at the same meeting the new carnaval [[mottos]] are disclosed by the prince.\nAlso it is the start of the building of the carnaval [[Float (parade)|floats]] for the coming [[parade]].<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n====Origin theories====\n=====Association with fools and imperfection=====\nEleven is original the \"fools number\" in [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] culture. In German it is called a [[repdigit|''Schnapszahl'']] and associated with alcohol consumption and used in [[numerology]]. In the Dutch language it is associated with idiocy ({{lang-nl|gekkengetal}}). It is an imperfect number since it is one number less than the base number twelve in the [[duodecimal]] numeral system and one number more than the base number ten in the [[decimal]] numeral system. Also it is a [[prime number]].<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n=====Association with elves=====\nThe number eleven in Dutch and German is translated as ''Elf''. The word originates from the [[Proto-Germanic]]: ''ainalibi'', which is a combination of the words ''aina'' (one) and ''libi'' (left \"over ten\") or ''ain'' (one) + ''leikw'' (leave, remain). Other derivatives are ''elleovene'' from [[Old English]] ''endleofan'', from Proto-Germanic *''ainlif''- ([[Saxon]]: ''elleban'', [[Old Frisian]]: ''andlova'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''elf'', [[Old High German]]: ''einlif'', [[German language|German]]: ''elf'', [[Old Norse]]: ''ellifu'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]]: ''ainlif'').<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=eleven Online Etymology Dictionary]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref><ref>[http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/elf1 etymologiebank.nl]. etymologiebank.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref>\n \nThere is suggested that the word \"''elf''\" became associated with the words ''[[Elf]]'', ''[[Elves]]'', ''[[Alven|Elven]]'' or ''[[Alven]]''.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> Early elves, whose description depends almost entirely on [[Norse mythology]] texts, were a race of beings with magical skills, ambivalent towards humans and capable of either helping or hindering them. But Christianized societies were viewing elves in increasingly sinister light. In [[Anglo-Saxon]] England as early as the 10th century, Old English medical books attest to elves afflicting humans and livestock by \"[[elf-shot]]\". The German elf or alp was seen as an ''addler'' of people in medical books, but already in the [[High Middle Ages]] there were prayers warding against it as the agent causing nightmares, and eventually for the alp its identity as [[Mare (folklore)|nightmare spirit]] became predominant.<ref>Jolly, Karen Louise (1992), \"Magic, Miracle, and Popular Practice in the Early Medieval West: Anglo-Saxon England\", in Neusner, Jacob; Frerichs, Ernest S.; Flesher, Paul Virgil McCracken, Religion, Science, and Magic: In Concert and in Conflict (Oxford University Press): 172, {{ISBN|978-0-19-507911-1}}</ref>\n \nThe ritual re-enactment of the [[Wild Hunt]] was a cultural phenomenon among many [[Gallic people|Gallic]] and [[Germanic peoples]]. At the head of this army, would have been [[Erlking|Erlenk\u00f6ning]] [[Herla|Hellequin]].<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n=====Adolf of Cleve=====\nAlthough there is certain historical data on ancient meaning of the number 11, there may also be a younger explanation. It is known that the oldest ''Geckengesellschaft'' (jester group) was founded by count [[Adolf III of the Marck|Adolf of Cleve]] in 1381 and took place on 12 November. Everything indicates that the foundation celebration of the 11th apparently got out of control, so the signing took place one day too late. The seal of the count takes the 11th place in the row of 35 stamps. The motto of this noble jester society was ''EyLustigh Fr\u00f6hlich'' (Merry Cheerful).<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n===Carnaval Cabaret===\n[[Cabaret]] in [[dialect]] is held in both variants of carnaval. In North Brabant the person doing the cabaret is called a ''tonpraoter'' (barrel speaker) or in the Western part of North Brabant a ''sauwelaar'', and is actually in or on a barrel. In Limburg they are named ''buuttereedner'' or ''buutteredner'' and in Zeeland they are called an ''ouwoer''. They all perform a cabaret speech in dialect, during which many current issues and events of the past year are reviewed. Often there are local situations and celebrities from the local and regional politics who will be mocked, ridiculed and insulted. The ''tonpraoter'' or ''buuttereedner'' is a successor of the medieval [[jester]].<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nOpen stages are held in the weeks before the carnaval where people from the community, mostly amateurs, can participate in carnaval related acts like music, [[farce]]s, dance acts and cabaret. Such a ''[[bonte avond]]'' is free to visit for the public. One special revue (called ''pronkzitting'') is an organized event at or before the carnaval with singing and dancing, but focuses mainly on humorous contributions by a variety of local ''tonpraoters / buuttereedners''. During the \"pronkzitting\" there are also performances of carnaval orchestras and [[Majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s. The prince and youth prince and their councils of eleven will attend. Unlike at other carnaval events, at the ''pronkzitting'' the usual dress code for the public is [[black tie|evening dress]].\n \n[[File:Tonpraoter.JPG|thumb|upright|Brabantian Tonpraoter]]\n \n====Origin of the Carnaval Cabaret====\nIt may be assumed that the emergence of the figure of the [[jester]] is coinciding with the development of the medieval civilization. Since the very beginning of his occurrence, the fool has been the [[personification]] of folly for centuries, as the jester was the one who tipped reality. In other words, the jesters mirrored or exaggerated the everyday reality, and is way-ward or [[taboo]]-breaking. They spoke truths that others were only secretly thinking. Actual fools often lacks the ability to behave according to the norms, while conscious jesters exaggerated to serve as a mirror to their public. The image of the jester is mainly shaped by its heyday. This ran from the [[Middle Ages]] to the late seventeenth century. The default image is that of the jester with fool's cap with bells, cheerful colors and oversized shoes, and [[marotte]]. In reality, some wore a jester costume, but other wore deliberately shabby clothes and some wore noble robes. Nowadays we imagine the jester often with a small deformed appearance, but this was not always the case.\n \nThere were basically two kinds of jesters. The ones with physical and especially mental disabilities (the fools) who could be mocked by their employers and the real jesters who were hired or recruited to mock others and entertain. If there were setbacks, they were the ones whom one could blame or who could take the heat, or the ones people could laugh about and determine that things could be worse. The jesters were intelligent artists, well-spoken and theatrical witty. They were aware of their duties and took a position between the ruler and the people. They could tell the king or ruler what no one else dared. A role that the contemporary ''tonpraoters'' and ''buuttereedners'' continue in a modern way.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n===Council of Eleven, Prince and Adjutant===\nA familiar phenomenon during the carnaval is the presence of the prince<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> and his entourage which is a parody on the normal authorities. The prince rules the city during the days of carnaval and symbolizes this way the power that is held by the common people. The format of this custom varies by region, the prince and his [[jester]] (generally called ''adjutant'') however, are almost universally within the carnaval traditions. The prince is traditionally a male and can be the same person for years, but often a different person is elected every year. Depending on the towns tradition, the prince is chosen by the association or by all the people of the town, in which case a campaign is often held. The prince is called ''Prins'' (Prince) or sometimes ''Vorst'' ([[F\u00fcrst]]). The female ''Prins'' / ''Vorst'', which is called ''Prinses'' (Princess) or ''Vorstin'' ([[F\u00fcrst]]in) begins to occur more frequently the last decade. Each year the (usual all male) Council of Eleven of every carnaval association proclaims a prince, and one (adjutant) or more aides.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> Most associations also have an all-gender youth council of eleven which chooses a youth prince and youth aides. The council of eleven does not necessarily hold eleven members, often there are more than eleven, sometimes less. The adjutant of the prince (on occasion called jester) is part of the Council of Eleven and is the main aid of the prince and second in command.\n \n====Origin of the Council of Eleven====\nThe actual origin of the name \"Council of Eleven\" is traced back to the [[Duchy of Brabant]] in the fifteenth century.\nThe Netherlands and Belgium in the Middle Ages consisted of a number of [[duchies]], counties, [[heerlijkheid|heerlijkheden]], etc. One of those duchies was the [[Duchy of Brabant]], which was the heart and most important region of the [[Low Countries]] until late in the 15th century and included the current province of [[North Brabant]] (Netherlands) and the provinces of [[Antwerp]] and [[Flemish Brabant]] (Belgium). When the Duke of Brabant [[Anthony, Duke of Brabant|Anthony of Burgundy]] in 1415 was killed in the battle of [[Battle of Agincourt|Anzicourt]], the delegates of the seven ancient cities of Brabant and the four largest abbeys of Brabant organized a meeting to discuss the succession of the Duke. The Duchess-Widow was not eligible for the succession, because of her rights to [[Luxembourg]]. However, they had two sons, the oldest named [[John IV, Duke of Brabant|Jan]], was only eleven years. On 4 November, the states decided to recognize him as Duke of Brabant, and that the day-to-day government should be looked after by the \"Council of Eleven\" (consisting of the seven cities of Brabant and the four abbeys). The appointment of the board members of the \"Council of Eleven\" is very likely to have occurred in the following week, on or around 11 November.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n====Plumes====\nIt is traditional that the prince, and his council of eleven wears a fore-and-aft [[bicorne]] with ([[Common pheasant|pheasant]]) tail feathers, in particular in those places that are influenced by the Rhenish Carnaval. Carnaval is however by definition controlled by unwritten laws. Hence the use of this tradition varies from place to place. However generally speaking the prince wears \"three\" feathers on his bicorne. The former princes, adjutant and the carnaval association president wear two feathers, while the actual members of the Council of Eleven wear one feather on their bicorne. The plumes are worn on the left side of the bicorne.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n===Peasant wedding===\nNot everywhere in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and [[North Brabant|Brabant]] is a ''boerenbruiloft'' ([[peasant]]'s wedding) part of the carnaval. Especially in the northern and central part of Limburg and eastern part of North Brabant is the ''boerenbruiloft'' very often held during the carnaval and is an important part of the carnaval culture.\nEach carnaval association has its own tradition concerning choosing the spouse for a wedding. When it's a small association often the bride and groom are chosen by the council of eleven or by the couple that was married the year before.\nIn Venlo it is not the carnaval association that chooses the participants of the peasant wedding, but an outsider group. This may be a company, a family, a football club, or as in 2013 a delegation of the hospital in [[Venlo]]. In that case, the board has determined who would become bride and groom.\n \nIt is not necessary that the newlyweds are a couple in real life. It is also not necessary that the bride and groom are single. Both the bride and groom, however, should be in love during the carnaval and they need to transfer their love to all the people who celebrate their wedding along with them. The highlight of the festival of the peasant wedding is the wedding and feast of the ''onecht'' (not-marriage) of the bride and groom. There are many aspects that can be found in a real-life marriage. First the [[engagement]] will be announced just as if it would be an officially marriage. And both the families should learn to know each other very well in organizing the party and the ceremony, like a normal wedding. The two families prepare a piece of entertainment for the wedding. And just like a real wedding, a [[Wedding reception|reception]] and a feast is organized where guests are asked to wear appropriate clothing. The bride and groom will often dress in wedding clothing from before 1940. The bride for example will often wear a [[poffer]], which is a traditional Brabantian headdress.<ref name=\"Vastelaovendinlimburg.nl\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.vastelaovendinlimburg.nl/2013/02/01/boerenbruiloft-hoezo-in-het-onecht-verbonden/ |title=Boerenbruiloft: hoezo in het \u2018onecht\u2019 verbonden? &#124; Vastelaovend en Carnaval in Limburg |publisher=Vastelaovendinlimburg.nl |date=8 April 2013 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n \n====Origin of the peasant wedding====\n[[File:Peasant wedding.png|{{largethumb}}|Peasant wedding or ''Boerenbruiloft'' during the Dutch carnaval, the bride is wearing a traditional white headdress named a [[poffer]].]]\n \nThe first mention of a \"boerenbruiloft\" ([[peasant]] wedding) was in 1582, when the [[Saxon]] [[prince-electors|elector]] [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony|August]] in [[Dresden]] wedded a [[peasant]] and his wife during a large ritual ceremony ''d'n onech'' (the not-marriage). It was not a real wedding and the to-be spouse were also not real peasants, but rather the nobility. The real peasants were given the role of [[noblemen]].  It was a reversal ritual, in which the roles were deliberately reversed. This role reversal was intended to avoid the attraction of the eye of the Christian god. Within the noble circles it was believed that it was the eye of the god which at the beginning of the spring focused on them because of their failure in the past year. They thought they could escape this danger by dressing during this wedding celebrations and to behave as peasants, and thus appear to be the people at the bottom of the social ladder. They believed the consequence was that the peasants dressed as nobleman would be harmed by their god instead of the nobles themselves.<ref name=\"Vastelaovendinlimburg.nl\"/>\n \n===Music===\n====Carnaval songs====\nCarnaval songs are a relatively recent phenomenon after World War II. Intentionally amateurish marching bands (''Zaate Hermeniekes'' or Drunken Marching Bands) traditionally perform this kind of music on the streets, mainly in Limburg. In North-Brabant the music is played mainly indoors in pubs and feast halls, which is also done in Limburg. Carnaval music is often a song written especially for the occasion and is easy to dance to. It is an expression of one's own culture, one's own lifestyle. The contents of a canavalschlager is often melancholy and even chauvinistic. For example, it may be an expression of pride in one's own village, town or region, local patriotism and praise of one's own place, and therefore in one's own local dialect. But it can also be a resistance to loss of identity and alienation, to changes affecting the individuality or local society and against the absorption in the broader culture. Therefore, it often happens that the village name or the name of the prince of the group, appear in the text of a carnaval song. The carnaval music is used during the carnaval to ridicule the normal culture, therefore the creating and playing of carnaval music is a very seasonal happening.\n \nCarnaval music is usual composed in 6/8 [[Bar (music)|bar]] or 3/4 bar. Local carnaval clubs usually try to address current issues in local dialect in a carnaval song. Carnaval songs are a form of opportunity compositions.\nA good carnaval song has several recognizable ingredients:\n* An easy, catchy \"popular\" melody\n* Usually the song is deliberately sung out of tune\n* A rhythm with 'leaping' character: long-short is often continuously rotated and triplets are common\n* Many accents in music and lots of question-answer elements\n* The harmony contains many thirds and sixths\n* The text is easy to remember (thus it can be remembered when drunk), and often humorous in nature to make a point\n* The text is many times sexual, vulgar, mocking and offensive in nature or totally non-sense\n* The form usually consists of several verses that alternate\n* Choruses with an accessible, inviting and compelling rhythm: there should be danced on\n \n====Dancing====\n''Hossen'' (jumping together in a group) is a way of dancing during the carnaval which is mainly found in [[North Brabant|Brabant]], also the polonaise is done during the carnaval. In the southernmost part of the Netherlands in Limburg, there are three ways of carnaval dancing: ''sjoenkele'' (slowly moving back and forth, left to right, etc. while sitting or standing with ones arms on the shoulders of the person beside him or with the arms hooked together at 3/4 tact), ''pogo''-ing (jumping up and down by oneself) and the [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]]. In southern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] the polonaise is called the ''reijaloet''. The polonaise is usually done spontaneous and for short moment of times, but can be done by dozens of people together. Also during the parade and official gatherings there are usual dance shows performed by the [[majorette (dancer)|majorettes]] called ''dansmarietjes'' or ''dansmariekes'' in Dutch.<ref>[http://www.vastelaovendinlimburg.nl/2013/01/20/limburgse-carnaval-voor-beginners-snelcursus-vastelaovend-vieren/ Limburgse carnaval voor beginners: snelcursus vastelaovend vieren | Vastelaovend en Carnaval in Limburg].

The word dweilen generally means \"to mop\" in Dutch, but in this context it means \"to amble\", and indicates the partygoers ambling from bar to bar) commonly provide during the feast for the music in the [[pubs]] / feasting halls and during the parades (in North-Brabant). In Limburg, the orchestras are more limited to playing outside. This immediately shows a big difference between the two variants: Burgundian carnaval is mainly celebrated indoors, Rhenish carnaval is mostly celebrated outdoors. Many pubs in [[Maastricht]] take their facade away during carnaval to open up to the feast on the streets.<ref>[http://carnaval.eropuitinlimburg.com/evenementen-overzicht/tradities/ Tradities | Carnaval in Limburg 2015 \u2013 Er op uit in Limburg].

It is not used on other days of the year. The word is introduced through [[Maastricht]] from the [[Cologne]] word ''alaaf'' (at least 18th century, but probably older) and ended up in Limburg and hence the rest of the Southern Netherlands. The Cologne word probably goes back to a dialect form of German ''all-ab'', meaning ''Everything out of the way'', with extension of the second A.<ref>[http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/alaaf etymologiebank.nl]. etymologiebank.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref> When just used as a greeting, the word is often accompanied by a reversed [[salute]]. The German [[Rhineland]] used to be occupied by the [[Prussia]]ns at the time, which had strong militaristic customs. In this region an alternate salute was devised as a protest parody: not with the right hand against the right temple as usual, but with the top of the right hand to the left temple.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n===Local rituals===\nIn addition to national and provincial variations, there also is a diversity in carnaval [[ritual]]s between the various cities or towns. In the many yearbooks of local carnaval groups are the local rituals described.<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\"/>\n \nFor example: In [[Den Bosch]] and some other near municipalities a large doll named Farmer Knillis symbolizes the peasant farmer. Dressed in an early 20th century farmers outfit and several meters tall, he stands prominently on his pedestal at the Market. On Carnaval Sunday he is revealed in the early afternoon by the Prince in the presence of sometimes thousands of carnaval celebrators. Carnaval ends on Tuesday midnight with the symbolic burial (or burning, depending on the town's tradition) of Farmer Knillis by the Prince and his Adjutant. Knillis has grown into a tradition in several towns and is in [[Den Bosch]] revealed since 1922 on Carnaval Sunday. Each leap year, Knillis is accompanied by his wife Hendrien. Until 1853 Knillis would be burned at the end of the Carnaval in Den Bosch, but the tradition was then outlawed until it revived in the early 20th century. Since then Knillis is buried instead of burned in [[Den Bosch]]. This tradition is not known however in the majority of Carnaval celebrating towns in [[North-Brabant|Brabant]].<ref>[http://oeteldonk.org/over-oeteldonk/symbolen/symbolen Symbolen en verwijzingen \u2013 Oeteldonksche Club van 1882].

The boulder stays above ground for four days as a symbol of the Carnaval. At the very end of the Carnaval it is buried again until the following year, while the bystanders mourn for it by loud wailing and weeping.<ref name=\"deweekkrant.nl\">[http://www.deweekkrant.nl/carnaval/plaatsen/carnaval_in_helmond Carnaval in Helmond e.o. | Traverse | d\u00e9 Weekkrant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106232123/http://www.deweekkrant.nl/carnaval/plaatsen/carnaval_in_helmond |date=6 January 2015 }}.

Especially [[Cologne]], which in turn was based mostly on the carnival of [[Venice]], has had a major impact on the nature of this carnaval. By the end of the 19th century, the carnaval in the [[Rhineland]] was used as an opportunity to protest against the [[imperialist]] (and [[protestant]]) [[Prussia]] which annexated the area at the time. Many of the current militaristic traditions can be traced back to this protest feast.<ref name=\"Omroepbrabant.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/108108772/Geschiedenis+van+carnaval.aspx |title=Omroep Brabant: Geschiedenis van carnaval |publisher=[[Omroep Brabant]]|date=4 November 2008 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n \n===Oude Wijven / Auw Wiever===\nIn the week before carnaval (usual Thursday) there are, so-called ''Oude Wijven'' or {{lang-li|Auw Wiever}} (old women) days and ''Oudewijvenbals'' (old women [[Ball (dance)|ball]]s). During ''Ouwe Wijve'' or ''Auw Wiever'' the pubs and streets are crowded by costumed women, usually dressed as old women. Men who dare to go out on the streets and in the pubs are at risk to be humiliated, be hit on the buttock and chased away. Also in some towns it is tradition that the women are allowed to kiss every man they like to during ''Ouw Wijve''.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> The established tradition on this day is to also cut away the ties, belts and the shoelaces which the men wear when they get caught showing themselves. This tradition is especially widespread in the south of Limburg. It is believed to be a postwar invention from [[Rhineland]], where women wanted to emphasize the independence they gained to men who had returned from the front after the years of war.<ref name=\"jefdejager.nl\"/>\n \nThe tradition may have an older background though. The position of men compared to women in society has often been a matter of debate. In [[Cologne]] is since 1824 the so-called ''[[Weiberfastnacht]]'' known. On the Thursday before carnaval, women are wearing men's clothes, reversing the roles and thus literally \"being the man\". In the Dutch border village [[Groenstraat]] a precursor to the ''Auwwieverbal'' (Old women ball) or ''Auw Wieverdaag'' (old women day) was known already in the early 19th century. The people at that time earned a living by breeding goats and selling woman's hair. The Thursday before carnaval the men would sell the hair to their French buyers. After the sale, as the man had plenty of money, they would go visit the pubs. The women would not be at the sale because they were expected to stay at home. Out of fear that their men would squander the money raised by their hair, the women would go find their husbands to prevent them from wasting it on alcohol. The search along the pubs transformed later to the ''Ouwewijvenbal''. The women, this time incognito, firmly asserted themselves to their husbands and other men.<ref>[http://www.goirlesbelang.nl/nw-7833-7-157193/nieuws/stichting_karnaval_ballefruttersgat_organiseert_het_aaw_wvebal.html Stichting Karnaval Ballefruttersgat organiseert het Aaw W\u00e8\u00e8vebal \u2013 Goirles Belang] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010209/http://www.goirlesbelang.nl/nw-7833-7-157193/nieuws/stichting_karnaval_ballefruttersgat_organiseert_het_aaw_wvebal.html |date=3 December 2013 }}.

Some buy a complete themed costume in a party store, others create their costumes themselves. Because the Rhenish carnaval mostly takes place outside on the streets, the costumes are also warmer and generally cover the entire body. The costumes are elaborate and consist usually out of multiple layers. Old women or witch costumes, animal costumes with horns or sometimes with antlers, face concealing masks, concealing black or red face paint and joker costumes were traditional popular, but these themes are less standard today. Ordinary jackets or clothing are never to be worn on top of the carnaval clothing, at most underneath the costume.<ref name=\"Omroepbrabant.nl\"/>\n[[File:Marchingband in parade during the Dutch Carnaval 2012.png|thumb|Marchingband in parade during the Dutch Carnaval 2012]]\n \n===Majorettes or Dansmarietjes===\n[[File:K\u00f6lner Rosenmontagszug 2013 192.JPG|upright|thumb|A ''Funkemariechen'' majorette is lifted at Rose Monday Parade of the [[Cologne Carnival]] in Germany]]\n[[Majorette (dancer)|Majorettes]] perform a typical carnaval dance originating in the [[Rhineland]], where the young women who perform this dance are called ''Tanzmariechen'' in [[German language|German]]. In the Netherlands these young women or girls are called ''Dansmarietjes'' (Dance Mary's) or ''Dansmariekes'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. They are doing choreographed dance or movement, primarily [[baton twirling]] during [[parade]]s and official carnaval meetings and were introduced into the Dutch carnaval after the second world war.\n \nDuring the carnival the normal form of government is parodied in the form of the Prince and his entourage taking over the town. Also the army and the defense forces were traditionally parodied as a way of protesting the Prussian occupation of the Rhenish area at the time. In [[Cologne]], these imitations arose in particular to make [[Prussian]] militarism ridiculous, with a carnaval greeting (''Alaaf''), which is the normal greeting as it were reverses. And with a joke army that did just about everything, which would make a normal company look ridiculous.\n \nThe majorettes show clear origins in the camp followers in the 18th and 19th century, and have a vibrant and eventful past. Around this time Germany had a very large number of armies, and there would be young women in each regiment, who served during the day as a sellers and providers of food and drink and took on household chores like washing clothes. Thereby offered many of these women and girls themselves as prostitutes, for which they would dress themselves more sexually provocative and they would dance for the soldiers.\n \nAround 1800 began to emerge of more regulations in the armies. Slowly these were also applied to the camp followers. Increasingly, she was a woman who was married to a corporal or soldier, and whose task it was among other things \"to wash the linen,\" according to an old army decision.\nThe camp follower became not a typical army prostitute anymore, but also not a proper married women. Besides caring for the soldiers, she could still continue entertaining them in various ways.\n \nIn the carnaval mockery both the officers and the camp followers were depicted. The officer by portraying him as an effeminate, wig bearing, conceited fool. The camp follower as a women who was military but provocatively costumed, but also clearly recognizable as a man: the ''Tanzmarie''.\n \nIn the early twentieth century, the carnaval associations found further inspiration in the [[revue]] girls that performed in the theater at the time. These were scantily clad young women, accompanied by some military attributes like peak helmets and military backpacks, which showed provocative dances in small groups. The revue girl grew into a nightclub-like star. It can not be denied that the carnaval with its Tanzmariechen has popularized and even parodied the sparkling shows that could otherwise be enjoyed only in the European major cities. Young women and girls again took on the role of tanzmariechen instead of men and they performed at the parades during the post-war carnaval. A show element was added to carnaval, partly due to the rapidly evolving ballet education. Majorettes or ''dansmariekes'' began increasingly to act in groups. Some parts of the Prussian military background are sometimes still reflected today in the movements, music or clothing of the majorettes.\n \nThe somewhat slovenly camp follower who accompanied the troops, has evolved into, a still on the Prussian army-inspired, show dance group. This metamorphosis went through the intermediate of the role performed by men as ''Tanzmarie''.\nAlthough the current majorette or ''dansmarietje'' has her roots in the carnaval scene, the associations of majorettes widely break these historical ties, and profile themselves more as a sports or dance club.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n===Colors===\nThe Rhenish carnaval has three official colors which appear everywhere. These are red, yellow and green.\nAccording carnavalogist Theo Fransen from [[Venlo]] the tradition of these colors goes back several centuries, more specifically to the jester in medieval times. The [[jester]] group of [[Kleve]] (1381 \u2013 Germany) wore the colors yellow/red. The jesters preferably wore green/red in France. Even before 1450 a group of French jesters in Lyon dressed in red, yellow and green. Colours used to have much more meaning than nowadays, and were very important as a means of communication. An at that time most people could not read or write and therefore used other symbols among which were colors. The symbolism of the colors of the jester was for people in the Middle Ages immediately clear.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nIn present day, a jester is seen as funny and humorous. At the time of the Middle Ages this was different, since the jester in fact was the personification of devil. The symbolic value each color the jester carries should be seen in that regard.\n \nRed is the color of Christian virtue and ardent love but also is the color of the devil, fire, death, conflict and war.\nThe yellow color stands for cheerfulness and elation, but also envy, retardation, ignorance and insanity. Green represents new life, youthfulness, boldness, the joy of life, vibrancy, growth and prosperity, but on the other hand, also stands for inexperience and nescience.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n==Burgundian Carnaval==\nThe exuberant [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] carnaval is the variant that is traditionally seen in most places in the north, mid and west of [[North Brabant]] (including the area of [[Den Bosch]] and [[Oss]]), [[Gelderland]] ([[Rivierenland (Nederland)|Land of Maas and Waal]], [[Achterhoek]], [[Arnhem]], [[Nijmegen]]), parts of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and in [[Overijssel]] ([[Twente]]), [[Flanders]] and in some places in [[South Beveland]]. The eastern part of North Brabant (specifically the [[Peel, Netherlands|Peelland Kwartier]] and in a lesser degree the [[Campine|Kempenland Kwartier]]) shows a combination of both Burgundian and Rhenish characteristics: though the festivities take place mostly inside the pubs and halls, it shows many costume traditions and other customs from the Rhenish Carnaval, but without the [[Prussia]]n militaristic influences.<ref name=\"borchgrave.nl\">[http://www.borchgrave.nl/?page_id=145 Bourgondisch carnaval | Carnavalsvereiniging De Borchgrave Roostere]. Borchgrave.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref>\n \n===Motto===\nMany, but not all, Burgundian carnavals towns have an official motto. This is often a famous saying in local dialect. It is proclaimed on 11 November by the new Prince.\n \nMotto's of \"Kielegat\" ([[Breda]]) since 2000\n* 2000 \u2013 De kop isser af.\n* 2001 \u2013 Tis ene grote kerremus.\n* 2002 \u2013 Dur wazzis... eel lang geleje.\n* 2003 \u2013 Tis nie te filleme.\n* 2004 \u2013 We gaon dum boot in.\n* 2005 \u2013 Me zijn ut spoor bijster.\n* 2006 \u2013 Me maoken'ut g\u00e8\u00e8f bont.\n* 2007 \u2013 Ast mar erregus op lekt.\n* 2008 \u2013 Ziedegij ut ok zitte.\n* 2009 \u2013 T'Oren, zien en zwijgen.\n* 2010 \u2013 Tis drop of dronder.\n* 2011 \u2013 K'ebber un nuske vor.\n* 2012 \u2013 K'ebb'ut licht gezien.\n* 2013 \u2013 Meej tweej zevus kende nie blijve zitte.\n* 2014 \u2013 Ut wor dweile of plakke.\n* 2015 \u2013 Kekse Straole.\n \n===Costume===\nThe typical costume of the Burgundian Carnaval has developed in the prosperous cities of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and [[County of Flanders]] at the time of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]]. The shape of the Burgundian carnaval was originally that of a costumed eating feast during which people ridiculed each other. Because of the great poverty that prevailed in Brabant after the [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age]] until [[World War II]], the traditional feast became characterized by (seemingly) simple costumes, of which the blue [[Smock-frock|smock]] with red bandana of mid and especially western [[North Brabant]] is perhaps the most iconic and can still be found among the costumes today. The wearing of the smock secondarily made everyone egalitarian, since people's status cannot be determined by their clothing and thus making it possible to criticize authority regardless people's position in daily life. Traditional clothing consists of old clothing, curtains, blue smocks and bandana with all kinds of accessories. This outfit can be found especially in the western part of North Brabant, but it is becoming less common in the last decade.<ref name=\"borchgrave.nl\"/>\n \nBurgundian carnaval takes place mostly inside in pubs and feasting halls. Since it is warmer in there, the clothing is also less thick and consists of fewer layers. When going to the different feasting locations, many people use old coats to keep from getting cold outside.<ref name=\"borchgrave.nl\"/>\n \n===Name changing===\nIt is common for cities with a [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] carnaval tradition to change their name during carnaval (although there are some places in eastern Netherlands with the Rhenish carnaval which do this as well). This name changing tradition is especially common in the towns in and around North Brabant. The tradition to change the city names originates in North Brabant and is seldom seen in Limburg. In Limburg some towns do change their name during carnaval into a dialect version.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nDuring the three days of the carnaval [[Den Bosch]] for example will change its name to ''Oeteldonk'', which by popular belief says \"Frog Hill\". Contrary to popular belief, ''oetel'' in the name ''Oeteldonk'' is not a referral to a frog but is a facetious reference to the 's-Hertogenbosch Bishop Adrianus Godschalk (Den Dungen 1 August 1819 \u2013 [['s-Hertogenbosch]] 2 January 1892) who came from the village of [[Den Dungen]] to become the new Bishop of [[Den Bosch]] (8 January 1878), and often fulminated against the \"Pagan\" Carnaval festivities. \"Van den Oetelaar\" was a very common surname in Den Dungen at that time. ''Donk'' is a reference to a higher dry place in the [[marsh]]. The frog is however a symbol often used during Carnaval, and it became a symbol of the Oeteldonk [[Marsh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oetelpedia.nl/wiki/index.php/Oeteldonk |title=Oeteldonk \u2013 Oetelpedia |language=Dutch |publisher=Oetelpedia.nl |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref>\n \nSome examples of carnaval name changes are;\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|* Ganzegat: [[Aarle-Rixtel]]\n* Turftreiersriek: [[America, Limburg|America]]\n* De Klot: [[Asten, Netherlands|Asten]]\n* Baek: [[Beek]]\n* De Heksenketel: [[Beek, Ubbergen|Beek]]\n* Ganzendonck: [[Beek en Donk]]\n* Krabbegat: [[Bergen op Zoom]]\n* Klompengat: [[Best, Netherlands|Best]]\n* Eendengat (Indegat): [[Boxtel]]\n* Kielegat: [[Breda]]\n* Bokkenriek: [[Budel]]\n* Oiverland: [[Eerde]]\n* Lampegat: [[Eindhoven]]\n* Krekkelstad [[Enschede]]\n* Oggelvorsenpoel: [[Esch, Netherlands|Esch]]\n* 't Slotgat: [[Empel]]\n* Lappegat: [[Geldrop]]\n* Dringersgat: [[Gilze]]\n* Ballefruttersgat: [[Goirle]]\n* Snevelbokkenland: [[Heeswijk-Dinther]]\n* Kraaienland: [[Heeze]]\n* Keiebijtersstad / [[Kattegat]]: [[Helmond]]\n* Oeteldonk: [['s-Hertogenbosch]]\n* Pezerikkengat: [[Hilvarenbeek]]\n* Lappelekkursland: [[Hoogeloon]]\n* Dreumelrijk / H\u00f4rs: [[Horst, Limburg|Horst]]\n* Sanegat: [[Huijbergen]]\n* Blaosdonk: [[Leende]]\n* Ploegersland: [[Liempde]]\n* Kouwvoetenland: [[Lierop]]\n* Raopersgat: [[Lieshout]]\n* Mestreech: [[Maastricht]]\n* 't Heidurp: [[Mariahout]]\n* Vl\u00e8geldarp: [[Montferland]]\n* Knotsenburg: [[Nijmegen]]\n* Kneutergat: [[Nijnsel]]\n* Sk\u00f4n Orregat: [[Oirschot]]\n* D\u00f6llekesgat: [[Oisterwijk]]\n* Kaaiendonk: [[Oosterhout]]\n* Ossekoppenrijk: [[Oss]]\n* Ostrecht: [[Ossendrecht]]\n* Boemeldonck: [[Prinsenbeek]]\n* Put en Buntland: [[Putte, Netherlands|Putte]]\n* Pomperstad: [[Ravenstein, Netherlands|Ravenstein]]\n* 't Bremspoersengat: [[Riethoven]]\n* Wringersgat: [[Rijen]]\n* Tullepetaonstad: [[Roosendaal]]\n* Zandhazendorp: [[Rosmalen]]\n* Moesland: [[Schaijk]]\n* Schorsbos: [[Schijndel]]\n* Papgat: [[Sint-Oedenrode]]\n* De Meerpoel: [[Someren]]\n* Krutjesgat: [[Son en Breugel]]\n* Plankcity: [[Tegelen]]\n* Kruikestad: [[Tilburg]]\n* Knoerissenrijk / Keienschijtersrijk: [[Uden]]\n* 't Bokkeriek: [[Valkenburg (city)|Valkenburg]]\n* Striepersgat: [[Valkenswaard]]\n* Kuussegat: [[Veghel]]\n* Rommelgat: [[Veldhoven]]\n* Jocus Ri\u00e9k: [[Venlo]]\n* Pi\u00eblhaazeriek: [[Venray]]\n* Pieperland: [[Volkel]]\n* Dommelbaorzedurp: [[Vught]]\n* Schoenlapperslaand: [[Waalwijk]]\n* Keiengat: [[Waalre]]\n* Wjeeldrecht: [[Woensdrecht]] / [[Hoogerheide]]\n* Zeuvebultelaand: [[Zevenbergen]]\n* Reigerland: [[Zijtaart]]}}\n\n===Colors===\nThe Burgundian Carnaval does not necessarily use the green, red and yellow which is used in the Rhenish Carnaval.

The feast was assimilated by the [[Catholic Church]], taking elements from ancient pagan spring festivals and is celebrated in the three days preceding the Christian holidays of [[Ash Wednesday]] and [[Lent]].<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nFrom an [[anthropological]] point of view, Carnaval is a reversal ritual, in which social roles are reversed and norms about desired behavior are suspended.<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\"/> Winter was thought of as the reign of the winter spirits that were to be driven out for summer to return.

Carnaval officially begins on Sunday and lasts three days until the start of Lent's first day, [[Ash Wednesday]], at midnight.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> Many people in modern times do not relate the holiday at all with religion, but its date is still set before the start of the Christian season of Lent. Also the core of the modern Carnaval has maintained its socially critical function by role reversal and temporary abandonment of social norms. The first day of Carnaval is six weeks before Easter Sunday. Carnaval officially begins on Sunday and lasts three days until the start of Ash Wednesday at midnight. Nowadays the celebrations often start on Thursday evening though, which makes it in practice a six day celebretion.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nIn the southern part of the Netherlands during Carnaval, normal daily life comes to a near stop. Roads are temporarily blocked and many local businesses close for the week because many employees take days off during and after Carnaval. According to post-[[Napoleon]] tradition, the [[feast day|feast]] lasts from Sunday until Tuesday. In recent years the feast usually starts on Saturday. Also Friday evening (or at schools at Friday afternoon) and in some places Thursday (''Ouwe Wijven'') are considered the start of Carnaval, which makes it a six days' celebration. The festivities last the entire day and well into the nights. Some parades and many balls and ''bonte avonden'' or other meetings are held in the weeks before the official Carnaval, but never before the first official court meeting on 11 November. Historically the 40 days of [[Lent]] would start on Wednesday at midnight and continue until Easter. Nowadays it is still the official ending of Carnaval, though some Carnaval activities such as herring eating are traditionally held on Wednesday after Carnaval. 20 days into Lent there might be an other parade or festivities, called \"Half-Vasten\" (Half-Lent). Lent itself is generally not practiced anymore by the Southern Dutch population as a result of [[irreligion]] dominating the area nowadays.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n\n==Name origin==\nThe oldest word which points in the direction of the word \"Carnaval\" is listed on a certificate from the Italian [[Subiaco, Lazio|Subiaco]] from 965 [[common era|CE]] as a timestamp ''Carnelevare''. Also known from the 13th century are the words ''Carnisprivialis'', ''Carnis Privium'' and in an old [[Li\u00e8ge]] text the term ''Quarnivalle''.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nThe origin can be traced to the [[Latin]] expression ''Carne Levare'', or Italian ''Carne lavare'' or ''Carnem levare'' which with reasonable certainty can be translated into \"farewell to the flesh\" or \"taking away the flesh\",<ref>[http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/carnaval etymologiebank.nl]. etymologiebank.nl.

Carnaval, or rather Shrove Tuesday, was officially accepted by Christianity in 1091 and was followed by Lent (the time of penance and mortification) on Ash Wednesday.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nWithin the confines of church liturgy, the old ways changed into the \"Fools Feast\" (''Narrenfeest'', ''F\u00eates des Fous'' or ''Donkey Feast''). The main roles were in the beginning played by the clergy of the minor orders, the sub-deacons. This were clerics who were in many cases illiterate and were also the local main baker or butcher.\nHowever, during the carnaval they became prominent and played the role of crazy bishop or \"donkey pope\" as part of the role reversal function of the carnaval.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nFrom [[Den Bosch]] is according to a document from 1383 known that public stage performances, [[jousting]] tournaments, games, [[cockfight]]s and role dressing were organized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traditie.nl/tradities_26.html?action=tradition&id=15|title=Carnaval Oeteldonk|work=Carnaval Oeteldonk|access-date=10 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225213245/http://www.traditie.nl/tradities_26.html?action=tradition&id=15|archive-date=25 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Around 1400 it was prohibited to roll dice (gambling), but an exception was made during carnaval. This appears from a letter from the council of [[Maastricht]] in 1405. The ban was temporarily lifted and people were allowed to play dice during the carnaval.<ref name=\"ziggo1\"/>\n \nSeveral popes in the past were explicitly involved with the shrove Tuesday celebration. They organized synods regarding fasting and shrove Tuesday, participated with carts in the processions, and promulgated special collections. [[Pope Martin V]], elected on 11 November 1417, is known to be nicknamed \"Papa Carnavale\". This was not due to the fact that he was elected on 11 November to be pope, but because he felt that the carnaval didn't last long enough.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nLike now the carnaval in the Middle Ages reached the highlight in the three days before the beginning of lent. During this period, the city officially handed over the power to \"Prince Carnaval\" and the social revolution was complete. Because of the anonymity offered by the costumes, rank and position were no longer important and one could freely express his opinion and mock anything and anyone. In particular, the [[nobility]], clergy and the wealthy citizens were mocked and ridiculed. This tradition is still reflected in contemporary parades and at the Brabantian ''tonproaten'' and Limburgish ''buutereednen'', the speakers subjects include mocking and ridiculing the local administration.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nThe catholic church, being the most powerful and influential organisation at the time, had to suffer most during carnaval. All kinds of sacred traditions and rules were ridiculed during the feast. A [[donkey]] would be put on the altar during the ''ezelsmis'' (donkey's mass) after which a civilian dressed as a priest staged a [[mass]]. During all the prayers, the \"[[amen]]\"  would be replaced by the donkey imitation \"ia, ia, ia\".  A dance called the [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]] was done during which people did not follow the pastor with the hand on the shoulder, but with the nose at the bottom.  Also celebrated on 28 December is the now forgotten feast of the [[massacre of the innocents]], commemorating the infanticide in [[Bethlehem]]. On this day the children were given the power for one day and turned it against the church. The choirboys put the clergy on a cart full of [[manure]], and then let them pass through the village. Often this gave the mass the opportunity to pelt the church ministers with shit, a phenomenon in slightly modified version to be found now in the spreading [[confetti]] from the carnaval floats.<ref name=\"Isgeschiedenis.nl\"/>\n \nHowever, in 1445 the church attacked the feast furiously. The theologians in Paris felt that the carnaval was out of control, issued a number of prohibitions and drafted a letter, which included the following:\n \n:''The priests wear [[mask]]s during mass, they dance in the [[choir]] dressed as women, matchmakers or minstrels and singing outrageous songs. On the altar they eat [[black pudding]] and fat sausages. They roll [[dice]]s and old shoes are burned instead of incense. Also there is running and jumping by them inside the church. After this mass they go out on the streets in their disguises. With carts and wagons they roam through the city, and give shameless performances to excite the laughter of the audience, which they also further incite with filthy songs and obscene gestures.''\n \nThe theologians conclude their letter stating that they do not even want to mention the worst things that take place during the carnaval.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/><ref name=\"Isgeschiedenis.nl\"/>\n \nThe role of the lower clergy, however, gradually got taken over by [[laymen]]. That is not to say that therefore there was no longer shrove Tuesday or fools bishops, and donkey popes and donkey bishops. The [[laity]] started to play the roles of the dignitaries they ridiculed. Later this practice developed into real titles and the roles of \"[[Prince|Prins]]\" or \"[[F\u00fcrst|Vorst]]\" came into use.\nThe feasts with jesters were in [[Flanders]] and the Netherlands very widespread.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nLater the \"feasts of fools\" are taken over by urban carnaval associations, such as the [[shipping companies]] and [[guild]]s. The celebrations became more expensive every year, so expensive that even the ''Prins'' or ''Vorst'' candidate often fled the city to prevent being elected. Cities even increased their taxes to finance these highly elaborate feasts.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nAlso early as the [[Late Middle Ages]] [[charivari]]s occurred during the carnaval more than usual.<ref>Geschiedenis van het persoonlijk leven.

The [[council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563) and the [[reformation]] caused a complete reverse in attitude towards the carnaval.<ref name=\"ziggo1\"/> The [[Protestant Reformation|schism]] within Christianity as a result of the [[reformation]], led to a religious divide in the territory of the present [[Netherlands]]. [[Protestantism]] became the dominant religion north of the rivers [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] and [[Rhine]]. In the areas that cover today the provinces of Limburg and North Brabant the Catholic religion remained dominant. In the part of the Netherlands that after the reformation became predominantly Protestant, the public [[shrovetide]] celebration disappeared from the streets. The new Protestant clergy found the riotous Catholic carnaval sinful. In the north, the feast quickly eradicated and also in the south the carnaval was restricted. Shrove Tuesday was interpreted as a \"[[romish]]\" [[superstition]] and prohibited to ban it out.<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\"/> In [['s-Hertogenbosch]] e.g. the carnaval was banned in 1629 after Protestants had conquered the city which had belonged to the Roman Catholic [[Spanish Netherlands|Spaniards]].<ref name=\"ziggo1\"/>  By the end of the 17th century carnaval in the [[Netherlands]] had mostly disappeared, though smaller festivities before [[lent]] in the south of the Netherlands and in German [[Rhineland]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] kept some carnaval traditions alive over the next 150 years.<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\"/> In the Catholic south the feast became less celebrated as well during the seventeenth and eighteenth century.<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\"/> Though the celebrations were banned, they did not entirely disappear. This is clear from the fact that a new ban had to be enacted every year.<ref>[http://groetenuitdenbosch.nl/509a.htm Oeteldonk]. Groetenuitdenbosch.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref>  Despite the Protestant rule, the Catholics in the 18th century managed to celebrate some sort of street carnaval. There were still dressing, eating and drinking feasts and all sorts of games were held like goose pulling / rooster smashing (smashing or pulling the head of the animal), cat burning/smashing, [[Ray (fish)|ray]] stabbing, [[wolf hunting]] and herring biting. These games were held in both the 18th and in the 19th century. In [[Venlo]] these games were banned in 1775, but in [[Wijnandsrade]] this tradition was held till 1848.<ref name=\"ziggo1\"/> Also sketches and plays were held. It was only since 1794, the beginning of the [[Batavian Revolution|French era]], that [[Den Bosch]] would officially allow celebrating carnaval again.<ref name=\"ziggo1\"/> In [[Den Bosch]] a large [[effigy]] named ''Knillis'' would be burned as a typical carnaval ritual, until this was prohibited around 1853.<ref>http://thuisinbrabant.delving.org/pdf/thuisinbrabant/brabants-heem/brabants_heem_1958_X_1_125_128.pdf</ref>\n \nAlso [[charivari]]s, which were folk customs that may already existed before 1600, were more often held around the carnaval time. Like in other European countries, the two main purposes of the charivari in Europe were to facilitate change in the current social structure and to act as a form of censure within the community. The goal was to enforce social standards and to rid the community of socially unacceptable relationships that threatened the stability of the whole. By the charivari's the community would punish and correct fellow citizens by public mocking and [[humiliation]] for unwanted behavior like adulterous relationships, men who let themselves be deceived by their wives, men who abused their wives, men who were not dominant in the marriage, widows who wished to remarry, women who wish to marry outside the social group (like a partner from a neighboring village) and other violators of social norms. The victims were subjected to humiliating [[procession]]s with noise and music through the village, forced to do embarrassing or hard labor or their possessions and house would be marked, damaged and soiled. In the period before the carnaval, groups of men would build a carnaval float, while others painted portraits of promiscuous girls, girls of which the boys / men felt had come to age to get married, or women who behaved \"wrongly\".<ref name=\"nl.wikibooks.org\">{{in lang|nl}} [https://nl.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sociale_geschiedenis_van_Europa_1500-1795/Sociale_controle Sociale geschiedenis van Europa 1500-1795/Sociale controle \u2013 Wikibooks].

The men sang mocking songs on the town square around the doll.

This kind of \"political charivaris\" never questioned the [[authority]] of the government itself, but were intended to denounce abuse of power and corruption by the government. The heyday of the political charivaris was between 1820 and 1850. In North Brabant there were various forms of community charivaris around carnaval which till 1934 still often occurred.<ref>Charivari in het oostelijk deel van Noord-Brabant, 1750\u20131850.

The [[carnival]] of [[Venice]] was for a long time the most famous carnival (although [[Napoleon]] abolished it in 1797 and only in 1959 the tradition was restored). From Italy carnival traditions spread to the Catholic nations of Spain, [[Portugal]], and France. From France it spread to [[New France]] in North America (the [[mardi gras]]). From Spain and Portugal, it spread with Catholic colonization to the [[Caribbean]] and Latin America. In the early 19th century the weakened medieval tradition started to revive as well in the German Rhineland and [[Southern Netherlands]]. In 1823 the first modern carnaval parade took place in [[Cologne]], [[Rhineland]], Germany.<ref>[http://www.koelner-karneval.info/Dreigestirn/Dreigestirn.htm Das K\u00f6lner Dreigestirn].

Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref>\n \nWithout denying that the current carnaval contains several recognizable aspects of the past, the feast as it is held today is relatively young. Carnaval as it\u2019s known today began in the postwar period. Before that, it was repressed as a result of the strong protestant influence in the country. With the exception of some places in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and [[North Brabant]], where in the nineteenth century the organization of medieval Carnaval celebrations was reviving again, the vast majority of the carnaval associations is established after [[World War II]].<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nIn the 1950s, with a few exceptions, the feast was still confined to the southern provinces of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and [[North Brabant]], where the majority of the population was Catholic. During the 1960s, the relatively strong [[Border|demarcation]] between the catholic south on one side and the [[calvinism|Calvinist]] west and north on the other side of the Netherlands started to diminish. According to cultural anthropologist Jef de Jager,\n \n<blockquote>The upcoming protest generation saw that its desire for looser manners was honored, at least during the Carnaval days. ...&nbsp;Even mild criticism of the political and social system, until then painstakingly smothered by the authorities, suddenly appeared to be possible&nbsp;...</blockquote>\n \nFor most adolescent participants the longing for personal freedom appealed most to them; thus,\n \n<blockquote>Carnaval became to the South, what the [[provo (movement)|Provo]] was to the North [of the Netherlands]. What actually happened was exactly the opposite of what had happened during the [[Middle Ages]]: a new morality was tested, not to investigate what is not allowed, but to investigate what is allowed.</blockquote>\n \nHence, De Jager believes, Carnaval was one of the developments that gave impetus to the South to more informal manners, [[Individualism|individualization]] and [[sexual revolution]] and then to [[Pillarization|ontzuiling]] (depillarisation) and [[secularization]].<ref name=\"jefdejager.nl\">[http://www.jefdejager.nl/carnaval.php carnaval rituelen en tradities].

Also the practice of [[lent]] became rapidly extinct in the Netherlands in the 1960s and 1970s. The south of the Netherlands, which is mostly [[Roman Catholic]] by tradition is now largely [[cultural Catholic|secular in practice]].<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\"/>\n \nAfter the modern feast of carnaval lost the association with Christian religion as a result of the rapid secularization in the Netherlands in the second half of the 20th century, the carnaval became more celebrated in parts of the country which were Protestant by tradition. At the end of the twentieth century there were carnaval associations in all the provinces of the Netherlands which are active in organizing the celebrations.<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\"/>  However, in the areas which did not originally celebrate, the feast is still growing to become a tradition. As a result, the carnaval in these parts of the country usually lasts only one day with the emphasis on role dressing and feasting, without the social criticism, parades and months of prelude. The massive carnaval festivities, which suspend the daily life, still mainly take place in [[North Brabant]], [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], [[Twente]] and the municipalities of [[Hulst]], [[Sluis]], [[Nijmegen]], [[Over-Betuwe]], [[Lingewaard]], [[De Liemers]] and [[Arnhem]].<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nCarnaval officially lasts from Sunday to Tuesday, but the current practice is that often there are numerous Carnaval festivities between 11 November and the actual feast, especially in the last weeks before carnaval. Sometimes there are also on [[Ash Wednesday]] some carnaval activities held. The post-Christian carnaval consist of several days consecutively drinking, feasting, role-dressing, social criticizing and mocking, parades and music. Also specific carnaval traditions and customs which may vary from town to town are an important part of the modern carnaval. The ridiculing and socially critical aspects of the carnaval are mostly emphasized during the parades.  Southern schools often dedicate the Friday afternoon before the actual feast to the carnaval. Children are invited to come role-dressed to school, sometimes the schools even organize a school parade and choose a school prince.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> Though some people take the Carnaval traditions very seriously, many people nowadays keep it simple and just drink, sing and dance wearing a colourful outfit.\n \nOn 11 November (the eleventh of the eleventh), at exactly 11:11&nbsp;am, starts the carnaval season. In the Netherlands, the start of the season is celebrated in almost every carnaval celebrating town with some kind of ceremony. The reason for this date is the number 11, which is traditionally the number of fools and madmen.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n[[File:Carnaval 2013 Netherlands.jpg|thumb|Carnaval 2013 Netherlands]]\n\n===Kinds of Carnaval===\nIn the Netherlands there are two kinds of Carnaval: the [[Rhenish]] carnaval and the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] carnaval.\n \nThe Carnavals are in many ways similar, but because of their origins and unique traditions they are also easy to distinguish from each other.\nThe Rhenish variant is usually celebrated in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], the Burgundian variant in the north, mid and west of [[North Brabant]], [[Gelderland]], [[Twente]] and in parts of [[Zeeland]] and in [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. The east of North Brabant (where [[East Brabantian]] is spoken) has manifestations of both types of carnaval and forms an overlap region of the two types of carnaval, but is often classified as [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]]. The [[Rhenish]] carnaval in the Netherlands is a derivative of the [[Cologne]] carnaval. The [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] carnaval originated from the traditional eating feasts during which people would ridicule one another during the carnaval in the [[Southern Netherlands]] (nowadays [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and the Dutch Provinces [[North Brabant]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]), especially in the [[Duchy of Brabant]].<ref>[http://www.historien.nl/carnaval-eeuwenoud-feest-der-zotten/ Carnaval: eeuwenoud feest der zotten \u2013 Histori\u00ebn].

Retrieved on 2015-05-13.</ref>\n \n==Carnaval customs==\n===Role reversal and role dressing===\nCarnaval is not only a feast of eating and drinking, but also serves as social [[role reversal]] feast which allows people to behave outside the usual acceptable [[Norm (social)|social norm]]. People will dress up as a character, much as seen during the eve of the Christian feast of [[All Saints Day|All Hallows]] that appears in the [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Anglo-Saxon]] culture, which though has developed from a different origin.<ref>McNeill, F. Marian. Hallowe'en: its origin, rites and ceremonies in the Scottish tradition. Albyn Press, 1970. pp.29\u201331</ref> During the Dutch carnaval people will often dress colourful and take on roles like [[jesters]], [[Job (role)|occupation]]s, objects, animals, other [[gender]]s and sexes, [[Archetypal literary criticism|archetype]]s or [[fairytale]] characters, well known people, [[subcultures]], historical figures or foreign cultures. Masks and face paint are often used in combination with the costumes. The old tradition of wearing masks is becoming more and more replaced by the use of face paint, which makes it easier to drink and eat during the feasting. The costumes allow people to change their identity and role in society for a few days without being judged for it by their fellowman during and after the carnaval. This also applies to feasting and drinking and other licentious behaviour which can be attributed to the temporary identity one takes on, rather than to the person him or herself.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> The costumes may, but are often not, meant to be [[Political incorrectness|political incorrect]], ridiculing, [[taboo]]-breaking, politically and socially and religiously critical, insulting or self-mocking, which is part of the role reversal origins of the feast. The function of this is to mirror and exaggerate daily life, to denounce and raise awareness of every day events and put life in perspective. A proper mocking carnaval costume does not simply insult or ridicule, but makes actually a valuable point. When not used to make a point, carnaval costumes offer an opportunity to temporarily change [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and express oneself freely.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> Nowadays some people will have a different costume for each day they celebrate carnaval because of the lack of time to wash their clothes.\n \nTraditionally the role dressing serves three major purposes:<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n* The costume allows people to become and act according to an [[Identity (social science)|identity]] they cannot take on or express during the rest of the year because of social standards and serves thus as an outlet for such needs.\n* The costume offers a visual way of protesting or expressing criticism and mirroring by exaggeration of social circumstances, authority and daily life to break taboos, create awareness and reflect on past and current events.\n* The costume provides protection when criticizing and ridiculing others because the wearer can either not be recognized or the criticism can be attributed to the role the wearer assumes during the carnaval rather than to the wearer himself. Because of this the wearer can safely express his criticism and opinion without having to fear for consequences in his daily life.\n \n===Key transfer===\nThe Prince of carnaval receives on the first day of the carnaval the symbolic key to the city / town from the hands of the mayor, who transfers to him three days of \"power\". This element of the carnaval is already known in the medieval carnaval. The changing of positions in power provide an opportunity to criticize the authorities without fear of retribution and are part of the role reversal function of the carnaval.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n===Carnaval associations===\nSince 1839 numerous societies were established which organized carnaval balls. In fact, these associations took on lots of activities which the [[guild]]s used to organize in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern Period]] before the [[History of the Netherlands|French occupation]] and are in that sense their successors.\n \nMore than Burgundian, the Rhenish carnaval celebrations are dominated by carnaval associations. These associations, of which there are sometimes many per city or village with each their own prince and council of eleven, organize their own festivities for both members and non-members of the association during the carnaval.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> At the Burgundian carnaval the main features (\"bonte avonden\" and \"pronkzitting\", key exchange, [[parades]], etc.) are organized by a carnaval association. The associations choose a prince (and entourage) and even though a [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] town can have dozens of carnaval associations, there is only one prince per city or village.\n \n[[Cologne]] had already started organizing carnaval by an association in 1823, followed in 1835 by [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] and [[Mainz]] in 1838. In Limburg the carnaval organized by an association was as common as in the German [[Rhineland]]. Momus was probably the first carnaval association in the Netherlands and was founded in 1839 in [[Maastricht]], followed by Jocus in the city of [[Venlo]] in 1842. Momus name derives from the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Momus]]. According to the ''D\u00fcsseldorfer Narrenkalender'' from 1841 \"Carnaval the Great has three sons: Momus, [[Comus]] and Jocus\". Momus is the Greek god of mockery and criticism. When in Venlo a sorority founded the carnaval association, they could thus choose between Comus ([[Greek mythology|Greek god]] of festivity, anarchy and chaos) and Jocus ([[Roman mythology|Roman god]] of wit and raillery). Momus is not the oldest existing carnaval association because it had faded out before the [[Second World War]] in 1939. After the war the carnaval in [[Maastricht]] was organized by the Tempeleers.<ref>[http://www.tempeleers.nl Home | De Tempeleers]. Tempeleers.nl (17 February 2015). Retrieved on 2015-05-13.</ref> The currently oldest carnaval association is Jocus.<ref>[http://www.jocusvenlo.nl/default.asp?Historie Venloosch Vastelaovesgezelschap JOCUS \u2013 Historie]. Jocusvenlo.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref>\n \n===Carnaval parades===\nIn many places, large carnaval parades are held with large floats, organized and created by the carnaval associations. These are called ''D'n Optocht'' or ''D'n Boonte St\u00f6rrem'' (The Motley Storm). The parades have usual a particular theme whereby authorities are ridiculed and criticized, events of the past year are represented and which are often politically incorrect and used to make people think outside the box or function as a mirror to the society. Also groups or individuals on foot will participate and fill the gaps between the carnaval wagons during the parade. Fanfares and marching bands will provide for typical carnaval music. The floats are built by carnaval associations, but also often by independent groups of friends, families, neighbourhoods or other clubs. A massive ship-looking wagon is shown in every carnaval parade which is manned by the prince, his entourage and the council of eleven of the city it is held or of the carnaval association that organized the parade and is usually the last float at the parade. Carnaval parades often start at 11.11&nbsp;am and end early in the afternoon. Some wil start in the afternoon to give participants the opportunity to join several parades a day and to give the public and participants the opportunity to be somewhat more sober / less hangover after the drinking of the day before. In that case they will start at 11 past the hour as well. Usually a competition will be held to choose the most outstanding contribution to the parade with separate categories for floats, groups on foot and individual participants. Although a procession usually takes from a starting point to a point of arrival, it actually roams from nowhere to nowhere. What only matters is the social binding during the parade. Along the route, the crowd forms a very essential part of the parade. The crowd is not just spectator, they form living dikes along the carnaval river without which the parade would lose meaning.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nAlso separate children's parade are sometimes held which focuses not on [[ridiculing]] and criticism, but on role changing and dressing.\n \n[[File:Prins Stan.jpg|thumb|upright|Youth prince Stan and adjutant of \"Keiengat\" ([[Waalre]]), 2006]]\n \n===Eleven===\nThe number [[11 (number)|eleven]] plays an undeniably important role in the carnaval.\nThe opinions on this subject are very divergent, so much so that one explanation often has nothing to do even with the other.\nOn the other hand, the number eleven is not only central to the carnaval, but it has built up a kind of mystical and magical value through the ages.\n \n====11 November====\n11 November, the 11th of the 11th, is an important date. 11 November is exactly 40 days before 21 December, the shortest day. This happens to be the feast day of ''sint Maarten'' ([[st. Martin's day]]). This day is celebrated in some parts of [[Groningen]], [[North Holland]] and the southern part of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and to a lesser extent in [[South Holland]] and [[Zeeland]]. This feast is the beginning of the dark period before Christmas and the long days of winter.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nFor centuries, 11 November, was the day that the year's work was deemed to be done. The barns were filled for the winter, the selected livestock would have been slaughtered and very importantly: the lease, property taxes, interests, and [[tithe]] were to be paid. These often weighed very heavily on the population. A year of scraping, frugality and putting every penny aside, would end after the payment on 11 November.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nIn both the Rhenish and the Burgundian carnaval 11-11 plays an important role. At 11\u201311 on 11.11 a.m. is the first of court meetings by the Council of Eleven held in preparation for the upcoming carnaval. During this meeting will also the new Prince be announced. In Brabant at the same meeting the new carnaval [[mottos]] are disclosed by the prince.\nAlso it is the start of the building of the carnaval [[Float (parade)|floats]] for the coming [[parade]].<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n====Origin theories====\n=====Association with fools and imperfection=====\nEleven is original the \"fools number\" in [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] culture. In German it is called a [[repdigit|''Schnapszahl'']] and associated with alcohol consumption and used in [[numerology]]. In the Dutch language it is associated with idiocy ({{lang-nl|gekkengetal}}). It is an imperfect number since it is one number less than the base number twelve in the [[duodecimal]] numeral system and one number more than the base number ten in the [[decimal]] numeral system. Also it is a [[prime number]].<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n=====Association with elves=====\nThe number eleven in Dutch and German is translated as ''Elf''. The word originates from the [[Proto-Germanic]]: ''ainalibi'', which is a combination of the words ''aina'' (one) and ''libi'' (left \"over ten\") or ''ain'' (one) + ''leikw'' (leave, remain). Other derivatives are ''elleovene'' from [[Old English]] ''endleofan'', from Proto-Germanic *''ainlif''- ([[Saxon]]: ''elleban'', [[Old Frisian]]: ''andlova'', [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''elf'', [[Old High German]]: ''einlif'', [[German language|German]]: ''elf'', [[Old Norse]]: ''ellifu'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]]: ''ainlif'').<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=eleven Online Etymology Dictionary]. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref><ref>[http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/elf1 etymologiebank.nl]. etymologiebank.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref>\n \nThere is suggested that the word \"''elf''\" became associated with the words ''[[Elf]]'', ''[[Elves]]'', ''[[Alven|Elven]]'' or ''[[Alven]]''.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> Early elves, whose description depends almost entirely on [[Norse mythology]] texts, were a race of beings with magical skills, ambivalent towards humans and capable of either helping or hindering them. But Christianized societies were viewing elves in increasingly sinister light. In [[Anglo-Saxon]] England as early as the 10th century, Old English medical books attest to elves afflicting humans and livestock by \"[[elf-shot]]\". The German elf or alp was seen as an ''addler'' of people in medical books, but already in the [[High Middle Ages]] there were prayers warding against it as the agent causing nightmares, and eventually for the alp its identity as [[Mare (folklore)|nightmare spirit]] became predominant.<ref>Jolly, Karen Louise (1992), \"Magic, Miracle, and Popular Practice in the Early Medieval West: Anglo-Saxon England\", in Neusner, Jacob; Frerichs, Ernest S.; Flesher, Paul Virgil McCracken, Religion, Science, and Magic: In Concert and in Conflict (Oxford University Press): 172, {{ISBN|978-0-19-507911-1}}</ref>\n \nThe ritual re-enactment of the [[Wild Hunt]] was a cultural phenomenon among many [[Gallic people|Gallic]] and [[Germanic peoples]]. At the head of this army, would have been [[Erlking|Erlenk\u00f6ning]] [[Herla|Hellequin]].<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n=====Adolf of Cleve=====\nAlthough there is certain historical data on ancient meaning of the number 11, there may also be a younger explanation. It is known that the oldest ''Geckengesellschaft'' (jester group) was founded by count [[Adolf III of the Marck|Adolf of Cleve]] in 1381 and took place on 12 November. Everything indicates that the foundation celebration of the 11th apparently got out of control, so the signing took place one day too late. The seal of the count takes the 11th place in the row of 35 stamps. The motto of this noble jester society was ''EyLustigh Fr\u00f6hlich'' (Merry Cheerful).<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n===Carnaval Cabaret===\n[[Cabaret]] in [[dialect]] is held in both variants of carnaval. In North Brabant the person doing the cabaret is called a ''tonpraoter'' (barrel speaker) or in the Western part of North Brabant a ''sauwelaar'', and is actually in or on a barrel. In Limburg they are named ''buuttereedner'' or ''buutteredner'' and in Zeeland they are called an ''ouwoer''. They all perform a cabaret speech in dialect, during which many current issues and events of the past year are reviewed. Often there are local situations and celebrities from the local and regional politics who will be mocked, ridiculed and insulted. The ''tonpraoter'' or ''buuttereedner'' is a successor of the medieval [[jester]].<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nOpen stages are held in the weeks before the carnaval where people from the community, mostly amateurs, can participate in carnaval related acts like music, [[farce]]s, dance acts and cabaret. Such a ''[[bonte avond]]'' is free to visit for the public. One special revue (called ''pronkzitting'') is an organized event at or before the carnaval with singing and dancing, but focuses mainly on humorous contributions by a variety of local ''tonpraoters / buuttereedners''. During the \"pronkzitting\" there are also performances of carnaval orchestras and [[Majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s. The prince and youth prince and their councils of eleven will attend. Unlike at other carnaval events, at the ''pronkzitting'' the usual dress code for the public is [[black tie|evening dress]].\n \n[[File:Tonpraoter.JPG|thumb|upright|Brabantian Tonpraoter]]\n \n====Origin of the Carnaval Cabaret====\nIt may be assumed that the emergence of the figure of the [[jester]] is coinciding with the development of the medieval civilization. Since the very beginning of his occurrence, the fool has been the [[personification]] of folly for centuries, as the jester was the one who tipped reality. In other words, the jesters mirrored or exaggerated the everyday reality, and is way-ward or [[taboo]]-breaking. They spoke truths that others were only secretly thinking. Actual fools often lacks the ability to behave according to the norms, while conscious jesters exaggerated to serve as a mirror to their public. The image of the jester is mainly shaped by its heyday. This ran from the [[Middle Ages]] to the late seventeenth century. The default image is that of the jester with fool's cap with bells, cheerful colors and oversized shoes, and [[marotte]]. In reality, some wore a jester costume, but other wore deliberately shabby clothes and some wore noble robes. Nowadays we imagine the jester often with a small deformed appearance, but this was not always the case.\n \nThere were basically two kinds of jesters. The ones with physical and especially mental disabilities (the fools) who could be mocked by their employers and the real jesters who were hired or recruited to mock others and entertain. If there were setbacks, they were the ones whom one could blame or who could take the heat, or the ones people could laugh about and determine that things could be worse. The jesters were intelligent artists, well-spoken and theatrical witty. They were aware of their duties and took a position between the ruler and the people. They could tell the king or ruler what no one else dared. A role that the contemporary ''tonpraoters'' and ''buuttereedners'' continue in a modern way.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n===Council of Eleven, Prince and Adjutant===\nA familiar phenomenon during the carnaval is the presence of the prince<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> and his entourage which is a parody on the normal authorities. The prince rules the city during the days of carnaval and symbolizes this way the power that is held by the common people. The format of this custom varies by region, the prince and his [[jester]] (generally called ''adjutant'') however, are almost universally within the carnaval traditions. The prince is traditionally a male and can be the same person for years, but often a different person is elected every year. Depending on the towns tradition, the prince is chosen by the association or by all the people of the town, in which case a campaign is often held. The prince is called ''Prins'' (Prince) or sometimes ''Vorst'' ([[F\u00fcrst]]). The female ''Prins'' / ''Vorst'', which is called ''Prinses'' (Princess) or ''Vorstin'' ([[F\u00fcrst]]in) begins to occur more frequently the last decade. Each year the (usual all male) Council of Eleven of every carnaval association proclaims a prince, and one (adjutant) or more aides.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> Most associations also have an all-gender youth council of eleven which chooses a youth prince and youth aides. The council of eleven does not necessarily hold eleven members, often there are more than eleven, sometimes less. The adjutant of the prince (on occasion called jester) is part of the Council of Eleven and is the main aid of the prince and second in command.\n \n====Origin of the Council of Eleven====\nThe actual origin of the name \"Council of Eleven\" is traced back to the [[Duchy of Brabant]] in the fifteenth century.\nThe Netherlands and Belgium in the Middle Ages consisted of a number of [[duchies]], counties, [[heerlijkheid|heerlijkheden]], etc. One of those duchies was the [[Duchy of Brabant]], which was the heart and most important region of the [[Low Countries]] until late in the 15th century and included the current province of [[North Brabant]] (Netherlands) and the provinces of [[Antwerp]] and [[Flemish Brabant]] (Belgium). When the Duke of Brabant [[Anthony, Duke of Brabant|Anthony of Burgundy]] in 1415 was killed in the battle of [[Battle of Agincourt|Anzicourt]], the delegates of the seven ancient cities of Brabant and the four largest abbeys of Brabant organized a meeting to discuss the succession of the Duke. The Duchess-Widow was not eligible for the succession, because of her rights to [[Luxembourg]]. However, they had two sons, the oldest named [[John IV, Duke of Brabant|Jan]], was only eleven years. On 4 November, the states decided to recognize him as Duke of Brabant, and that the day-to-day government should be looked after by the \"Council of Eleven\" (consisting of the seven cities of Brabant and the four abbeys). The appointment of the board members of the \"Council of Eleven\" is very likely to have occurred in the following week, on or around 11 November.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n====Plumes====\nIt is traditional that the prince, and his council of eleven wears a fore-and-aft [[bicorne]] with ([[Common pheasant|pheasant]]) tail feathers, in particular in those places that are influenced by the Rhenish Carnaval. Carnaval is however by definition controlled by unwritten laws. Hence the use of this tradition varies from place to place. However generally speaking the prince wears \"three\" feathers on his bicorne. The former princes, adjutant and the carnaval association president wear two feathers, while the actual members of the Council of Eleven wear one feather on their bicorne. The plumes are worn on the left side of the bicorne.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n===Peasant wedding===\nNot everywhere in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and [[North Brabant|Brabant]] is a ''boerenbruiloft'' ([[peasant]]'s wedding) part of the carnaval. Especially in the northern and central part of Limburg and eastern part of North Brabant is the ''boerenbruiloft'' very often held during the carnaval and is an important part of the carnaval culture.\nEach carnaval association has its own tradition concerning choosing the spouse for a wedding. When it's a small association often the bride and groom are chosen by the council of eleven or by the couple that was married the year before.\nIn Venlo it is not the carnaval association that chooses the participants of the peasant wedding, but an outsider group. This may be a company, a family, a football club, or as in 2013 a delegation of the hospital in [[Venlo]]. In that case, the board has determined who would become bride and groom.\n \nIt is not necessary that the newlyweds are a couple in real life. It is also not necessary that the bride and groom are single. Both the bride and groom, however, should be in love during the carnaval and they need to transfer their love to all the people who celebrate their wedding along with them. The highlight of the festival of the peasant wedding is the wedding and feast of the ''onecht'' (not-marriage) of the bride and groom. There are many aspects that can be found in a real-life marriage. First the [[engagement]] will be announced just as if it would be an officially marriage. And both the families should learn to know each other very well in organizing the party and the ceremony, like a normal wedding. The two families prepare a piece of entertainment for the wedding. And just like a real wedding, a [[Wedding reception|reception]] and a feast is organized where guests are asked to wear appropriate clothing. The bride and groom will often dress in wedding clothing from before 1940. The bride for example will often wear a [[poffer]], which is a traditional Brabantian headdress.<ref name=\"Vastelaovendinlimburg.nl\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.vastelaovendinlimburg.nl/2013/02/01/boerenbruiloft-hoezo-in-het-onecht-verbonden/ |title=Boerenbruiloft: hoezo in het \u2018onecht\u2019 verbonden? &#124; Vastelaovend en Carnaval in Limburg |publisher=Vastelaovendinlimburg.nl |date=8 April 2013 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n \n====Origin of the peasant wedding====\n[[File:Peasant wedding.png|{{largethumb}}|Peasant wedding or ''Boerenbruiloft'' during the Dutch carnaval, the bride is wearing a traditional white headdress named a [[poffer]].]]\n \nThe first mention of a \"boerenbruiloft\" ([[peasant]] wedding) was in 1582, when the [[Saxon]] [[prince-electors|elector]] [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony|August]] in [[Dresden]] wedded a [[peasant]] and his wife during a large ritual ceremony ''d'n onech'' (the not-marriage). It was not a real wedding and the to-be spouse were also not real peasants, but rather the nobility. The real peasants were given the role of [[noblemen]].  It was a reversal ritual, in which the roles were deliberately reversed. This role reversal was intended to avoid the attraction of the eye of the Christian god. Within the noble circles it was believed that it was the eye of the god which at the beginning of the spring focused on them because of their failure in the past year. They thought they could escape this danger by dressing during this wedding celebrations and to behave as peasants, and thus appear to be the people at the bottom of the social ladder. They believed the consequence was that the peasants dressed as nobleman would be harmed by their god instead of the nobles themselves.<ref name=\"Vastelaovendinlimburg.nl\"/>\n \n===Music===\n====Carnaval songs====\nCarnaval songs are a relatively recent phenomenon after World War II. Intentionally amateurish marching bands (''Zaate Hermeniekes'' or Drunken Marching Bands) traditionally perform this kind of music on the streets, mainly in Limburg. In North-Brabant the music is played mainly indoors in pubs and feast halls, which is also done in Limburg. Carnaval music is often a song written especially for the occasion and is easy to dance to. It is an expression of one's own culture, one's own lifestyle. The contents of a canavalschlager is often melancholy and even chauvinistic. For example, it may be an expression of pride in one's own village, town or region, local patriotism and praise of one's own place, and therefore in one's own local dialect. But it can also be a resistance to loss of identity and alienation, to changes affecting the individuality or local society and against the absorption in the broader culture. Therefore, it often happens that the village name or the name of the prince of the group, appear in the text of a carnaval song. The carnaval music is used during the carnaval to ridicule the normal culture, therefore the creating and playing of carnaval music is a very seasonal happening.\n \nCarnaval music is usual composed in 6/8 [[Bar (music)|bar]] or 3/4 bar. Local carnaval clubs usually try to address current issues in local dialect in a carnaval song. Carnaval songs are a form of opportunity compositions.\nA good carnaval song has several recognizable ingredients:\n* An easy, catchy \"popular\" melody\n* Usually the song is deliberately sung out of tune\n* A rhythm with 'leaping' character: long-short is often continuously rotated and triplets are common\n* Many accents in music and lots of question-answer elements\n* The harmony contains many thirds and sixths\n* The text is easy to remember (thus it can be remembered when drunk), and often humorous in nature to make a point\n* The text is many times sexual, vulgar, mocking and offensive in nature or totally non-sense\n* The form usually consists of several verses that alternate\n* Choruses with an accessible, inviting and compelling rhythm: there should be danced on\n \n====Dancing====\n''Hossen'' (jumping together in a group) is a way of dancing during the carnaval which is mainly found in [[North Brabant|Brabant]], also the polonaise is done during the carnaval. In the southernmost part of the Netherlands in Limburg, there are three ways of carnaval dancing: ''sjoenkele'' (slowly moving back and forth, left to right, etc. while sitting or standing with ones arms on the shoulders of the person beside him or with the arms hooked together at 3/4 tact), ''pogo''-ing (jumping up and down by oneself) and the [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]]. In southern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] the polonaise is called the ''reijaloet''. The polonaise is usually done spontaneous and for short moment of times, but can be done by dozens of people together. Also during the parade and official gatherings there are usual dance shows performed by the [[majorette (dancer)|majorettes]] called ''dansmarietjes'' or ''dansmariekes'' in Dutch.<ref>[http://www.vastelaovendinlimburg.nl/2013/01/20/limburgse-carnaval-voor-beginners-snelcursus-vastelaovend-vieren/ Limburgse carnaval voor beginners: snelcursus vastelaovend vieren | Vastelaovend en Carnaval in Limburg].

The word dweilen generally means \"to mop\" in Dutch, but in this context it means \"to amble\", and indicates the partygoers ambling from bar to bar) commonly provide during the feast for the music in the [[pubs]] / feasting halls and during the parades (in North-Brabant). In Limburg, the orchestras are more limited to playing outside. This immediately shows a big difference between the two variants: Burgundian carnaval is mainly celebrated indoors, Rhenish carnaval is mostly celebrated outdoors. Many pubs in [[Maastricht]] take their facade away during carnaval to open up to the feast on the streets.<ref>[http://carnaval.eropuitinlimburg.com/evenementen-overzicht/tradities/ Tradities | Carnaval in Limburg 2015 \u2013 Er op uit in Limburg].

It is not used on other days of the year. The word is introduced through [[Maastricht]] from the [[Cologne]] word ''alaaf'' (at least 18th century, but probably older) and ended up in Limburg and hence the rest of the Southern Netherlands. The Cologne word probably goes back to a dialect form of German ''all-ab'', meaning ''Everything out of the way'', with extension of the second A.<ref>[http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/alaaf etymologiebank.nl]. etymologiebank.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref> When just used as a greeting, the word is often accompanied by a reversed [[salute]]. The German [[Rhineland]] used to be occupied by the [[Prussia]]ns at the time, which had strong militaristic customs. In this region an alternate salute was devised as a protest parody: not with the right hand against the right temple as usual, but with the top of the right hand to the left temple.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n===Local rituals===\nIn addition to national and provincial variations, there also is a diversity in carnaval [[ritual]]s between the various cities or towns. In the many yearbooks of local carnaval groups are the local rituals described.<ref name=\"meertens.knaw.nl\"/>\n \nFor example: In [[Den Bosch]] and some other near municipalities a large doll named Farmer Knillis symbolizes the peasant farmer. Dressed in an early 20th century farmers outfit and several meters tall, he stands prominently on his pedestal at the Market. On Carnaval Sunday he is revealed in the early afternoon by the Prince in the presence of sometimes thousands of carnaval celebrators. Carnaval ends on Tuesday midnight with the symbolic burial (or burning, depending on the town's tradition) of Farmer Knillis by the Prince and his Adjutant. Knillis has grown into a tradition in several towns and is in [[Den Bosch]] revealed since 1922 on Carnaval Sunday. Each leap year, Knillis is accompanied by his wife Hendrien. Until 1853 Knillis would be burned at the end of the Carnaval in Den Bosch, but the tradition was then outlawed until it revived in the early 20th century. Since then Knillis is buried instead of burned in [[Den Bosch]]. This tradition is not known however in the majority of Carnaval celebrating towns in [[North-Brabant|Brabant]].<ref>[http://oeteldonk.org/over-oeteldonk/symbolen/symbolen Symbolen en verwijzingen \u2013 Oeteldonksche Club van 1882].

The boulder stays above ground for four days as a symbol of the Carnaval. At the very end of the Carnaval it is buried again until the following year, while the bystanders mourn for it by loud wailing and weeping.<ref name=\"deweekkrant.nl\">[http://www.deweekkrant.nl/carnaval/plaatsen/carnaval_in_helmond Carnaval in Helmond e.o. | Traverse | d\u00e9 Weekkrant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106232123/http://www.deweekkrant.nl/carnaval/plaatsen/carnaval_in_helmond |date=6 January 2015 }}.

This is called: ''[[Friction drum|foekepotten]]''. This however is not common anymore in the rest of the Netherlands. The custom of Foekepotten is already seen on a painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], called [[The Fight Between Carnival and Lent]] from 1559 (the man with the stick in the jar beneath the figure on the barrel).<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.traditiesinoverijssel.nl/node/33 Foekepotterij | Tradities in Overijssel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108000716/http://www.traditiesinoverijssel.nl/node/33 |date=8 January 2015 }}.

Especially [[Cologne]], which in turn was based mostly on the carnival of [[Venice]], has had a major impact on the nature of this carnaval. By the end of the 19th century, the carnaval in the [[Rhineland]] was used as an opportunity to protest against the [[imperialist]] (and [[protestant]]) [[Prussia]] which annexated the area at the time. Many of the current militaristic traditions can be traced back to this protest feast.<ref name=\"Omroepbrabant.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/108108772/Geschiedenis+van+carnaval.aspx |title=Omroep Brabant: Geschiedenis van carnaval |publisher=[[Omroep Brabant]]|date=4 November 2008 |accessdate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n \n===Oude Wijven / Auw Wiever===\nIn the week before carnaval (usual Thursday) there are, so-called ''Oude Wijven'' or {{lang-li|Auw Wiever}} (old women) days and ''Oudewijvenbals'' (old women [[Ball (dance)|ball]]s). During ''Ouwe Wijve'' or ''Auw Wiever'' the pubs and streets are crowded by costumed women, usually dressed as old women. Men who dare to go out on the streets and in the pubs are at risk to be humiliated, be hit on the buttock and chased away. Also in some towns it is tradition that the women are allowed to kiss every man they like to during ''Ouw Wijve''.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/> The established tradition on this day is to also cut away the ties, belts and the shoelaces which the men wear when they get caught showing themselves. This tradition is especially widespread in the south of Limburg. It is believed to be a postwar invention from [[Rhineland]], where women wanted to emphasize the independence they gained to men who had returned from the front after the years of war.<ref name=\"jefdejager.nl\"/>\n \nThe tradition may have an older background though. The position of men compared to women in society has often been a matter of debate. In [[Cologne]] is since 1824 the so-called ''[[Weiberfastnacht]]'' known. On the Thursday before carnaval, women are wearing men's clothes, reversing the roles and thus literally \"being the man\". In the Dutch border village [[Groenstraat]] a precursor to the ''Auwwieverbal'' (Old women ball) or ''Auw Wieverdaag'' (old women day) was known already in the early 19th century. The people at that time earned a living by breeding goats and selling woman's hair. The Thursday before carnaval the men would sell the hair to their French buyers. After the sale, as the man had plenty of money, they would go visit the pubs. The women would not be at the sale because they were expected to stay at home. Out of fear that their men would squander the money raised by their hair, the women would go find their husbands to prevent them from wasting it on alcohol. The search along the pubs transformed later to the ''Ouwewijvenbal''. The women, this time incognito, firmly asserted themselves to their husbands and other men.<ref>[http://www.goirlesbelang.nl/nw-7833-7-157193/nieuws/stichting_karnaval_ballefruttersgat_organiseert_het_aaw_wvebal.html Stichting Karnaval Ballefruttersgat organiseert het Aaw W\u00e8\u00e8vebal \u2013 Goirles Belang] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010209/http://www.goirlesbelang.nl/nw-7833-7-157193/nieuws/stichting_karnaval_ballefruttersgat_organiseert_het_aaw_wvebal.html |date=3 December 2013 }}.

This name is probably derived from the headstrong figure [[Gertruid Bolwater]] from [[Venlo]]. According to the [[legend]] during a siege of the city during the [[Guelders Wars]] in 1499 or 1511 she defeated several enemy soldiers and tore the banner from the hands of an enemy soldier.<ref>[http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/DVN/lemmata/data/Bolwater/en Online Dictionary of Dutch Women].

Some buy a complete themed costume in a party store, others create their costumes themselves. Because the Rhenish carnaval mostly takes place outside on the streets, the costumes are also warmer and generally cover the entire body. The costumes are elaborate and consist usually out of multiple layers. Old women or witch costumes, animal costumes with horns or sometimes with antlers, face concealing masks, concealing black or red face paint and joker costumes were traditional popular, but these themes are less standard today. Ordinary jackets or clothing are never to be worn on top of the carnaval clothing, at most underneath the costume.<ref name=\"Omroepbrabant.nl\"/>\n[[File:Marchingband in parade during the Dutch Carnaval 2012.png|thumb|Marchingband in parade during the Dutch Carnaval 2012]]\n \n===Majorettes or Dansmarietjes===\n[[File:K\u00f6lner Rosenmontagszug 2013 192.JPG|upright|thumb|A ''Funkemariechen'' majorette is lifted at Rose Monday Parade of the [[Cologne Carnival]] in Germany]]\n[[Majorette (dancer)|Majorettes]] perform a typical carnaval dance originating in the [[Rhineland]], where the young women who perform this dance are called ''Tanzmariechen'' in [[German language|German]]. In the Netherlands these young women or girls are called ''Dansmarietjes'' (Dance Mary's) or ''Dansmariekes'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. They are doing choreographed dance or movement, primarily [[baton twirling]] during [[parade]]s and official carnaval meetings and were introduced into the Dutch carnaval after the second world war.\n \nDuring the carnival the normal form of government is parodied in the form of the Prince and his entourage taking over the town. Also the army and the defense forces were traditionally parodied as a way of protesting the Prussian occupation of the Rhenish area at the time. In [[Cologne]], these imitations arose in particular to make [[Prussian]] militarism ridiculous, with a carnaval greeting (''Alaaf''), which is the normal greeting as it were reverses. And with a joke army that did just about everything, which would make a normal company look ridiculous.\n \nThe majorettes show clear origins in the camp followers in the 18th and 19th century, and have a vibrant and eventful past. Around this time Germany had a very large number of armies, and there would be young women in each regiment, who served during the day as a sellers and providers of food and drink and took on household chores like washing clothes. Thereby offered many of these women and girls themselves as prostitutes, for which they would dress themselves more sexually provocative and they would dance for the soldiers.\n \nAround 1800 began to emerge of more regulations in the armies. Slowly these were also applied to the camp followers. Increasingly, she was a woman who was married to a corporal or soldier, and whose task it was among other things \"to wash the linen,\" according to an old army decision.\nThe camp follower became not a typical army prostitute anymore, but also not a proper married women. Besides caring for the soldiers, she could still continue entertaining them in various ways.\n \nIn the carnaval mockery both the officers and the camp followers were depicted. The officer by portraying him as an effeminate, wig bearing, conceited fool. The camp follower as a women who was military but provocatively costumed, but also clearly recognizable as a man: the ''Tanzmarie''.\n \nIn the early twentieth century, the carnaval associations found further inspiration in the [[revue]] girls that performed in the theater at the time. These were scantily clad young women, accompanied by some military attributes like peak helmets and military backpacks, which showed provocative dances in small groups. The revue girl grew into a nightclub-like star. It can not be denied that the carnaval with its Tanzmariechen has popularized and even parodied the sparkling shows that could otherwise be enjoyed only in the European major cities. Young women and girls again took on the role of tanzmariechen instead of men and they performed at the parades during the post-war carnaval. A show element was added to carnaval, partly due to the rapidly evolving ballet education. Majorettes or ''dansmariekes'' began increasingly to act in groups. Some parts of the Prussian military background are sometimes still reflected today in the movements, music or clothing of the majorettes.\n \nThe somewhat slovenly camp follower who accompanied the troops, has evolved into, a still on the Prussian army-inspired, show dance group. This metamorphosis went through the intermediate of the role performed by men as ''Tanzmarie''.\nAlthough the current majorette or ''dansmarietje'' has her roots in the carnaval scene, the associations of majorettes widely break these historical ties, and profile themselves more as a sports or dance club.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n===Colors===\nThe Rhenish carnaval has three official colors which appear everywhere. These are red, yellow and green.\nAccording carnavalogist Theo Fransen from [[Venlo]] the tradition of these colors goes back several centuries, more specifically to the jester in medieval times. The [[jester]] group of [[Kleve]] (1381 \u2013 Germany) wore the colors yellow/red. The jesters preferably wore green/red in France. Even before 1450 a group of French jesters in Lyon dressed in red, yellow and green. Colours used to have much more meaning than nowadays, and were very important as a means of communication. An at that time most people could not read or write and therefore used other symbols among which were colors. The symbolism of the colors of the jester was for people in the Middle Ages immediately clear.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nIn present day, a jester is seen as funny and humorous. At the time of the Middle Ages this was different, since the jester in fact was the personification of devil. The symbolic value each color the jester carries should be seen in that regard.\n \nRed is the color of Christian virtue and ardent love but also is the color of the devil, fire, death, conflict and war.\nThe yellow color stands for cheerfulness and elation, but also envy, retardation, ignorance and insanity. Green represents new life, youthfulness, boldness, the joy of life, vibrancy, growth and prosperity, but on the other hand, also stands for inexperience and nescience.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \n==Burgundian Carnaval==\nThe exuberant [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] carnaval is the variant that is traditionally seen in most places in the north, mid and west of [[North Brabant]] (including the area of [[Den Bosch]] and [[Oss]]), [[Gelderland]] ([[Rivierenland (Nederland)|Land of Maas and Waal]], [[Achterhoek]], [[Arnhem]], [[Nijmegen]]), parts of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and in [[Overijssel]] ([[Twente]]), [[Flanders]] and in some places in [[South Beveland]]. The eastern part of North Brabant (specifically the [[Peel, Netherlands|Peelland Kwartier]] and in a lesser degree the [[Campine|Kempenland Kwartier]]) shows a combination of both Burgundian and Rhenish characteristics: though the festivities take place mostly inside the pubs and halls, it shows many costume traditions and other customs from the Rhenish Carnaval, but without the [[Prussia]]n militaristic influences.<ref name=\"borchgrave.nl\">[http://www.borchgrave.nl/?page_id=145 Bourgondisch carnaval | Carnavalsvereiniging De Borchgrave Roostere]. Borchgrave.nl. Retrieved on 13 May 2015.</ref>\n \n===Motto===\nMany, but not all, Burgundian carnavals towns have an official motto. This is often a famous saying in local dialect. It is proclaimed on 11 November by the new Prince.\n \nMotto's of \"Kielegat\" ([[Breda]]) since 2000\n* 2000 \u2013 De kop isser af.\n* 2001 \u2013 Tis ene grote kerremus.\n* 2002 \u2013 Dur wazzis... eel lang geleje.\n* 2003 \u2013 Tis nie te filleme.\n* 2004 \u2013 We gaon dum boot in.\n* 2005 \u2013 Me zijn ut spoor bijster.\n* 2006 \u2013 Me maoken'ut g\u00e8\u00e8f bont.\n* 2007 \u2013 Ast mar erregus op lekt.\n* 2008 \u2013 Ziedegij ut ok zitte.\n* 2009 \u2013 T'Oren, zien en zwijgen.\n* 2010 \u2013 Tis drop of dronder.\n* 2011 \u2013 K'ebber un nuske vor.\n* 2012 \u2013 K'ebb'ut licht gezien.\n* 2013 \u2013 Meej tweej zevus kende nie blijve zitte.\n* 2014 \u2013 Ut wor dweile of plakke.\n* 2015 \u2013 Kekse Straole.\n \n===Costume===\nThe typical costume of the Burgundian Carnaval has developed in the prosperous cities of the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and [[County of Flanders]] at the time of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]]. The shape of the Burgundian carnaval was originally that of a costumed eating feast during which people ridiculed each other. Because of the great poverty that prevailed in Brabant after the [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age]] until [[World War II]], the traditional feast became characterized by (seemingly) simple costumes, of which the blue [[Smock-frock|smock]] with red bandana of mid and especially western [[North Brabant]] is perhaps the most iconic and can still be found among the costumes today. The wearing of the smock secondarily made everyone egalitarian, since people's status cannot be determined by their clothing and thus making it possible to criticize authority regardless people's position in daily life. Traditional clothing consists of old clothing, curtains, blue smocks and bandana with all kinds of accessories. This outfit can be found especially in the western part of North Brabant, but it is becoming less common in the last decade.<ref name=\"borchgrave.nl\"/>\n \nBurgundian carnaval takes place mostly inside in pubs and feasting halls. Since it is warmer in there, the clothing is also less thick and consists of fewer layers. When going to the different feasting locations, many people use old coats to keep from getting cold outside.<ref name=\"borchgrave.nl\"/>\n \n===Name changing===\nIt is common for cities with a [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] carnaval tradition to change their name during carnaval (although there are some places in eastern Netherlands with the Rhenish carnaval which do this as well). This name changing tradition is especially common in the towns in and around North Brabant. The tradition to change the city names originates in North Brabant and is seldom seen in Limburg. In Limburg some towns do change their name during carnaval into a dialect version.<ref name=\"fenvlaanderen.be\"/>\n \nDuring the three days of the carnaval [[Den Bosch]] for example will change its name to ''Oeteldonk'', which by popular belief says \"Frog Hill\". Contrary to popular belief, ''oetel'' in the name ''Oeteldonk'' is not a referral to a frog but is a facetious reference to the 's-Hertogenbosch Bishop Adrianus Godschalk (Den Dungen 1 August 1819 \u2013 [['s-Hertogenbosch]] 2 January 1892) who came from the village of [[Den Dungen]] to become the new Bishop of [[Den Bosch]] (8 January 1878), and often fulminated against the \"Pagan\" Carnaval festivities. \"Van den Oetelaar\" was a very common surname in Den Dungen at that time. ''Donk'' is a reference to a higher dry place in the [[marsh]]. The frog is however a symbol often used during Carnaval, and it became a symbol of the Oeteldonk [[Marsh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oetelpedia.nl/wiki/index.php/Oeteldonk |title=Oeteldonk \u2013 Oetelpedia |language=Dutch |publisher=Oetelpedia.nl |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref>\n \nSome examples of carnaval name changes are;\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|* Ganzegat: [[Aarle-Rixtel]]\n* Turftreiersriek: [[America, Limburg|America]]\n* De Klot: [[Asten, Netherlands|Asten]]\n* Baek: [[Beek]]\n* De Heksenketel: [[Beek, Ubbergen|Beek]]\n* Ganzendonck: [[Beek en Donk]]\n* Krabbegat: [[Bergen op Zoom]]\n* Klompengat: [[Best, Netherlands|Best]]\n* Eendengat (Indegat): [[Boxtel]]\n* Kielegat: [[Breda]]\n* Bokkenriek: [[Budel]]\n* Oiverland: [[Eerde]]\n* Lampegat: [[Eindhoven]]\n* Krekkelstad [[Enschede]]\n* Oggelvorsenpoel: [[Esch, Netherlands|Esch]]\n* 't Slotgat: [[Empel]]\n* Lappegat: [[Geldrop]]\n* Dringersgat: [[Gilze]]\n* Ballefruttersgat: [[Goirle]]\n* Snevelbokkenland: [[Heeswijk-Dinther]]\n* Kraaienland: [[Heeze]]\n* Keiebijtersstad / [[Kattegat]]: [[Helmond]]\n* Oeteldonk: [['s-Hertogenbosch]]\n* Pezerikkengat: [[Hilvarenbeek]]\n* Lappelekkursland: [[Hoogeloon]]\n* Dreumelrijk / H\u00f4rs: [[Horst, Limburg|Horst]]\n* Sanegat: [[Huijbergen]]\n* Blaosdonk: [[Leende]]\n* Ploegersland: [[Liempde]]\n* Kouwvoetenland: [[Lierop]]\n* Raopersgat: [[Lieshout]]\n* Mestreech: [[Maastricht]]\n* 't Heidurp: [[Mariahout]]\n* Vl\u00e8geldarp: [[Montferland]]\n* Knotsenburg: [[Nijmegen]]\n* Kneutergat: [[Nijnsel]]\n* Sk\u00f4n Orregat: [[Oirschot]]\n* D\u00f6llekesgat: [[Oisterwijk]]\n* Kaaiendonk: [[Oosterhout]]\n* Ossekoppenrijk: [[Oss]]\n* Ostrecht: [[Ossendrecht]]\n* Boemeldonck: [[Prinsenbeek]]\n* Put en Buntland: [[Putte, Netherlands|Putte]]\n* Pomperstad: [[Ravenstein, Netherlands|Ravenstein]]\n* 't Bremspoersengat: [[Riethoven]]\n* Wringersgat: [[Rijen]]\n* Tullepetaonstad: [[Roosendaal]]\n* Zandhazendorp: [[Rosmalen]]\n* Moesland: [[Schaijk]]\n* Schorsbos: [[Schijndel]]\n* Papgat: [[Sint-Oedenrode]]\n* De Meerpoel: [[Someren]]\n* Krutjesgat: [[Son en Breugel]]\n* Plankcity: [[Tegelen]]\n* Kruikestad: [[Tilburg]]\n* Knoerissenrijk / Keienschijtersrijk: [[Uden]]\n* 't Bokkeriek: [[Valkenburg (city)|Valkenburg]]\n* Striepersgat: [[Valkenswaard]]\n* Kuussegat: [[Veghel]]\n* Rommelgat: [[Veldhoven]]\n* Jocus Ri\u00e9k: [[Venlo]]\n* Pi\u00eblhaazeriek: [[Venray]]\n* Pieperland: [[Volkel]]\n* Dommelbaorzedurp: [[Vught]]\n* Schoenlapperslaand: [[Waalwijk]]\n* Keiengat: [[Waalre]]\n* Wjeeldrecht: [[Woensdrecht]] / [[Hoogerheide]]\n* Zeuvebultelaand: [[Zevenbergen]]\n* Reigerland: [[Zijtaart]]}}\n\n===Colors===\nThe Burgundian Carnaval does not necessarily use the green, red and yellow which is used in the Rhenish Carnaval.

Two of them, S\u00e3o Paulo/[[Guarulhos International Airport]] and [[Congonhas-S\u00e3o Paulo Airport]] are located in the metropolitan area, while the third, [[Campo de Marte]], is located north of the [[Central Zone of S\u00e3o Paulo|city center]]. Campo de Marte also hosts the Ventura Goodyear Blimp.\n\nCongonhas Airport operates domestic and regional flights, mainly to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Bras\u00edlia]]. Guarulhos International Airport, also known to S\u00e3o Paulo locals as \"Cumbica\", is located {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} North East of the city center, in the neighbouring city of [[Guarulhos]]. Guarulhos airport operates both domestic and international flights. Major Brazilian airlines handled by Congonhas Airport and Guarulhos Airport include [[TAM Airlines]], [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos]], and [[Azul Brazilian Airlines]]. Campo de Marte airport handles some private and small-sized airplanes.\n\nIn 2006, about 34.3 million people used the city's airports (mainly from Congonhas and Guarulhos International Airport, the only two operating commercial flights). Infraero, Brazil's main aviation authority, estimates that with the remodelling of Guarulhos Airport, S\u00e3o Paulo's airports will be able to handle about 45 million passengers a year within the next five years.\n\n===Heliports===\nS\u00e3o Paulo has the largest fleet of [[helicopter]]s in the world, with around 500 registered helicopters and 700 flights per day in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lab.org.uk/sao-paulo-the-worlds-biggest-helicopter-fleet/|title=S\u00e3o Paulo: the world\u2019s biggest helicopter fleet {{!}} Latin America Bureau|last=Branford|first=Sue|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref> The owners are an elite wealthy class who take advantage of approximately one hundred helipads and heliports to conveniently avoid heavy traffic.

Construction is being carried out in four phases: west, south, east and north. As of mid-2010, the west and south section have been completed. The beginning of construction on the east section is planned for February 2011. Due to the rougher terrain and environmental concerns, there is no projected date for the initiation of construction on the northern section.\n\n====Travel restrictions====\n\nSimilar to the [[Hoy No Circula]] program in Mexico, S\u00e3o Paulo has implemented restrictions on travel to maintain the quality of air.

Two of them, S\u00e3o Paulo/[[Guarulhos International Airport]] and [[Congonhas-S\u00e3o Paulo Airport]] are located in the metropolitan area, while the third, [[Campo de Marte]], is located north of the [[Central Zone of S\u00e3o Paulo|city center]]. Campo de Marte also hosts the Ventura Goodyear Blimp.\n\nCongonhas Airport operates domestic and regional flights, mainly to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Bras\u00edlia]]. Guarulhos International Airport, also known to S\u00e3o Paulo locals as \"Cumbica\", is located {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} North East of the city center, in the neighbouring city of [[Guarulhos]]. Guarulhos airport operates both domestic and international flights. Major Brazilian airlines handled by Congonhas Airport and Guarulhos Airport include [[TAM Airlines]], [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos]], and [[Azul Brazilian Airlines]]. Campo de Marte airport handles some private and small-sized airplanes.\n\nIn 2006, about 34.3 million people used the city's airports (mainly from Congonhas and Guarulhos International Airport, the only two operating commercial flights). Infraero, Brazil's main aviation authority, estimates that with the remodelling of Guarulhos Airport, S\u00e3o Paulo's airports will be able to handle about 45 million passengers a year within the next five years.\n\n===Heliports===\nS\u00e3o Paulo has the largest fleet of [[helicopter]]s in the world, with around 500 registered helicopters and 700 flights per day in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lab.org.uk/sao-paulo-the-worlds-biggest-helicopter-fleet/|title=S\u00e3o Paulo: the world\u2019s biggest helicopter fleet {{!}} Latin America Bureau|last=Branford|first=Sue|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref> The owners are an elite wealthy class who take advantage of approximately one hundred helipads and heliports to conveniently avoid heavy traffic. In addition, there are many [[air taxi]] companies in the city, used mostly by the upper class to travel between S\u00e3o Paulo and [[Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n==Motorways==\n[[Image:Rodovia Bandeirantes SAO 2008 06.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Rodovia dos Bandeirantes|Bandeirantes highway]], one of the main lines connecting with the interior of the [[state of S\u00e3o Paulo]].

Construction is being carried out in four phases: west, south, east and north. As of mid-2010, the west and south section have been completed. The beginning of construction on the east section is planned for February 2011. Due to the rougher terrain and environmental concerns, there is no projected date for the initiation of construction on the northern section.\n\n====Travel restrictions====\n\nSimilar to the [[Hoy No Circula]] program in Mexico, S\u00e3o Paulo has implemented restrictions on travel to maintain the quality of air.

He knows that not only the children need the support of Aina but he also needs as well as Aina also needs Mohsin. He doesn't want to scold her but he cannot control himself and scolds her everytime.\n\nMeanwhile, Faraz and Sajal decide to go to America knowing that Aina told them not to go and that is why she married Mohsin but Faraz tries to explain Aina that Sajal wants to live in America and he doesn't want to upset her. After so much of pressure she agrees to let them go but she is not happy about it. Since they left Aina is always thinking about Maaz and couldn't concentrate on anything and also she doesn't talks to Mohsin. Faraz calls Mohsin and asks if everything is okay he says that he doesn't know what happened to Aina Faraz then says Mohsin to take care of her and don't repeat the same mistake of the behaviour he kept with Nadia and says that if something happens to Aina he won't forgive himself. Mohsin couldn't take the behaviour of Aina anymore so he told Aina that why is she running away from him and why doesn't she accept this marriage then Aina hugs him and tells him she couldn't live like this, her loneliness will kill her. After saying that she faints and then Zubaida comes and scolds Mohsin for not taking care of Aina she tells him to call the doctor and the doctor says her blood pressure is low. After that he was remembering the old Aina that how joyful she used to be and now whatever he says to her she doesn't says a word.\n\nThe next day Mohsin prepared breakfast for Aina and took her very nicely. Mohsin brought his twin children and told Aina that he don't want a child right now from her maybe later but not that time because he doesn't want Aina to take care of her child more than his children. Aina has now too many responsibilities so she asked Mohsin that she wants a maid. At first he didn't agree because of all that Nafeesa drama he didn't want to take anymore risks but later on he accepts. The next day Aina was happy because she got support of maid and told Mohsin that she works really nicely and told that she cooks also very well and then Mohsin told that the maid prepared the food and she told yes I was checking that if she can cook or not because if there is any emergency so she will cook. Then he got angry and started shouting at her and told her this is his house and whatever he says only that will happen and he doesn't wants to eat the food if it is made by the maid and said her what does she even do everyday. After that Ayna said that yeah I am not doing anything everyday angels are coming and taking care of the house and I am doing nothing and just sleeping she said that in anger and ran furiously down the stairs and then her foot slipped and then she fell down. Then Mohsin came and helped her. After that he had to eat the food by maid the whole week. Ayna started to feel jealous seeing Nadia and Mohsin wedding picture and then she removed it from the wall and put the frame of her children. Mohsin noticed it and then got angry and said to put the frame back she said she will not put the frame and if he does she will throw the frame outside she told that I am your wife now Nadia I nowhere in her life. After a few days, Ayna went to her old home and was remembering her good old memories with Sajal and her mother. Mohsin arrived home and was waiting for Ayna when she came he told her where are you going everyday at this time and saying bad stuff to her. She then says that she doesn't want to live with her and then he says cause you want to marry I mean and then she says you are a very cheap person and then she leaves the home. She then went to Zubaida (Khala) home and said her everything what happened. After that she left her home and went again back to her old home I.e.. her mother's home and was crying there. On The other hand, Mohsin was thinking that why he scolds her every time he then was imaging a shadow of himself in which his shadow says him that he have to control himself otherwise he and his children will not be happy without her. Then he visits Zubaida's house and asked her about Ayna. She said that she went to her home and then he says she is not there. Then he thought that Ayna would must be in her old house and then he goes there and convinces her and apologize her and then she agrees to live with him.\n\nThe story then leaps 18 years. The twins (Rania (Hina Altaf) and Aasher (Agha Jarrar) and Tabinda (Mariyam Nafees) have matured.  Tabinda is shy and sweet while Rania is much the opposite and Rania is lively and confident. Tabinda wants to become an engineer and study in university however Mohsin denies as he doesn't want her end up doing the mistakes Aina did in the past when she went college. Tabinda tries to convince Mohsin but Mohsin's decision remains the same. Also Mohsin is planning to get Tabinda married but Tabinda does not agree. But as usual, what Mohsin wishes only that will happen. After few days, Mohsin and Faraz's sister Aliya (Zainab Qayyum) and her son Afaaq (Umer Naru) moved to Mohsin's house to stay there forever. Afaaq is a really selfish and irresponsible guy, Aliya is also not a really good woman. The next day, Aliya said to Mohsin that Ayna is a really good woman and she took a really good care of the kids to which Mohsin agrees then Ayna came inside and she sat on the sofa then Aliya asked Mohsin that why he didn't allow Tabinda to take admission in University. He then told her that she has grown older so he is looking for a boy to marry her. After that Aliya asked hand in marriage for Tabinda to Mohsin to which Mohsin was really happy and finally agreed. After that Ayna told Mohsin that he should have asked her point of view. Then Mohsin says I don't need to listen and that why is she not agreeing for Afaaq to which Ayna replied because he has just shifted here and they don't know him much and Tabi will also not agree. Then Mohsin says if Tabi doesn't agree then he will finish all his relations between his daughter and Ayna. Mohsin also decided that Rania will marry Maaz and Taabi will marry Afaaq to which Rania overheard and then she ran to Tabi and told her about what Mohsin says that she will marry Afaaq and when she heard that she cried a lot then Ayna was calming her down and told her not to cry. The next day, when Ayna gave tea to Mohsin, he asked how Taabi responded when she learned that she will marry Afaaq. Ayna said she was quiet. Meanwhile, Afaaq was happy to marry Taabi because he thought that then he can get money  from Mohsin because he is going to be his son-in-law.\n\nWhile, Maaz (Raees Alam) is unaware of fact that he is step-son of Sajal and Faraz. Once, he comes to Aina's home, Aina initially don't know that he is Maaz, but when he says that he is Maaz, she is surprised. He has actually come without permission of Sajal but Faraz knows. Rania and Maaz start taking interest in each other and would marry in coming episodes. Initially Mohsin was not in favour of his son to get education from abroad but when he asked Affaq about it, Affaq also favour his (Mohsin's) son because he wanted to handle all the business of his father-in-law. while on the other side Faraz and Sajjal return to Pakistan and Sajjal is not happy with the soft behavior of Maaz towards Aina. Whereas Maaz has fallen in love with Rania. Sajjal continuously insults Rania and Maaz gave her choice of court marriage. Aina listens there conversation and thought Rania is going to do same mistake as Aina did in past Faraz gave proposal of Maaz to Rania parents though which Aina rejected. Maaz and Rania are is great sorrow and Sajal is quite happy. But Maaz began to hate his own mother after this.he than was going back to America. \n \nWhen Sajal apologizes to Aina and Sajal wants Rania and Maaz to marry each other, when they found out they were so surprised, at Taabi's mehndi a girl threatens Taabi to stay away from Afaqq, she zoomed to Afaqq's prison of the house and gives him the photos, Aliya was shocked to see the photos. At the shaadi the boys were dancing (Maaz, Asher, and Afaqq) when the police arrived and took Afaq, when Mohsin blames Aliya for her sons misbehavior, they decide to replace Taabi's Shaadi With Rania's marriage. Then Mohsin finds out Maaz is not Faraz and Sajal son but does not know it is Aaina and tells Rania to divorce him. Maaz comes in and he tells Rania to go with him but Mohsin gets a gun out just to threaten Maaz but out of pressure Aaina tells Mohsin about Imran and Maaz being her son. Mohsin is shocked and Faraz tries to take the gun off and then Mohsin accidentally shoots Maaz. Aaina and Faraz take him to the hospital and gets him treated. Rania on the other hand is in a state of shock and Tabi tries to console her and says he is fine and is asking about her. Mohsin is thinking about what he has done and remembers about his past. When Aina is back to home to take Rania to hospital to see Maaz, Mohsin tells about the fact that Aina is not their mother. Despite this, they accepted her as their mother. Maaz went to meet his father and grandmother they were shocked and aina went back to Mohsin. At least Taabi and Afaq married and Rania and Maaz as well they had a family picture and that was the ending.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Naveen Waqar]] as Ayna \"Aani\" \n* [[Emmad Irfani]] as Mohsin  \n* [[Asad Zaman Khan]] as Imran\n* Shazia Naz as Sajal\n* Zain Mirza as Faraz \n* [[Hira Hussain]] as Annie \n* [[Maryam Nafees]] as Tabinda \"Taabi\" \n* [[Hina Altaf]] as Rania\n* Raeed Muhammed as Maaz\n* Zainab Jameel as Nadia (dead)\n* [[Huma Nawab]] as Nayyara (dead)\n* [[Abid Ali (actor)|Abid Ali]] as Sohail (dead)\n* Umer Naru as Afaaq \n* [[Ismat Zaidi]] as Zainab\n* [[Zainab Qayyum]] as Aliya\n* Agha Jararuddin as Aashir\n* Fouzia Mushtaq as Zubaida \n* Shahid as Noman  \n* Neema Alam\n* Zainab Fatima ([[child actor]]) as the young Tabinda \"Taabi\"\n* Rashida Tabassum\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of programs broadcast by Hum TV]]\n* [[2016 in Pakistani television]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hum TV Programs}}\n{{Television in Pakistan |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Pakistani drama television series]]\n[[Category:2010s Pakistani television series]]\n[[Category:2017 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2017 Pakistani television series endings]]\n[[Category:Urdu-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Hum TV series]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Pakistani English|date=September 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2016}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Kuch Na Kaho \n| image                    =\n| caption                  =\n| genre                    = \n* [[Drama]]\n*[[Telenovela]]\n* [[Family Drama]] \n* Romantic Drama\n| based_on                 = Sabz Ruton Ka Pehla Phool\n| writer                   = Rahat Jabeen \n| director                 = [[Ilyas Kashmiri]]\n| starring                 = [[Naveen Waqar]]<br/>[[Emmad Irfani]]<br/>[[Mariyam Nafees]]<br/>Huma Nawab<br/>Asad Zaman Khan<br/>[[Abid Ali (actor)|Abid Ali]]<br/>[[Ismat Zaidi]]<br/>[[Hira Hussain]]<br/>Zainab Jameel<br/>Shazia Naz<br/>[[Zainab Qayyum]]<br/>Umar Naru\n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \"Kuch Na Kaho\" by Afshan Fawad\n| endtheme                 =   \n| composer                 = \n| country                  = Pakistan \n| language                 = [[Urdu]]\n| num_episodes             = 48 \n| list_episodes            = \n| executive_producer       = \n| producer                 = [[Momina Duraid]]\n| location                 =Karachi and Islamabad\n| cinematography           = \n| editor                   = \n| camera                   = [[Multi-camera setup]]\n| runtime                  =40 minutes  \n| company                  = [[MD Productions]] \n| distributor              = [[Hum TV]]\n| network                  = [[Hum TV]], [[Hum Network Limited]]\n| picture_format           = {{plainlist|\n* [[HDTV]] [[480i]]\n* [[720p]]\n}}\n| audio_format             = \n| first_run                = Pakistan  \n| first_aired              = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|10|31}}\n| last_aired               = {{End date|df=yes|2017|04|18}}\n| preceded_by =  ''[[Hatheli (TV series)|Hatheli]]'' [Moved to Wednesdays and Thursdays at 9:10pm]<br>''[[Deewana (TV series)|Deewana]]'' [Ended]\n| followed_by = ''[[Mohabbat Khawab Safar]]''\n| website                  = http://www.hum.tv\n| production_website       = \n}}\n\n'''''Kuch Na Kaho''''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''\u06a9\u0686\u06be \u0646\u06c1 \u06a9\u06c1\u0648'''}}}}; lit: ''Don't Say Anything'') is a [[Pakistani drama]] serial which is based on a novel named ''Sabz Ruton Ka Pehla Phool'' by Rahat Jabeen.

He doesn't want to scold her but he cannot control himself and scolds her everytime.\n\nMeanwhile, Faraz and Sajal decide to go to America knowing that Aina told them not to go and that is why she married Mohsin but Faraz tries to explain Aina that Sajal wants to live in America and he doesn't want to upset her. After so much of pressure she agrees to let them go but she is not happy about it. Since they left Aina is always thinking about Maaz and couldn't concentrate on anything and also she doesn't talks to Mohsin. Faraz calls Mohsin and asks if everything is okay he says that he doesn't know what happened to Aina Faraz then says Mohsin to take care of her and don't repeat the same mistake of the behaviour he kept with Nadia and says that if something happens to Aina he won't forgive himself. Mohsin couldn't take the behaviour of Aina anymore so he told Aina that why is she running away from him and why doesn't she accept this marriage then Aina hugs him and tells him she couldn't live like this, her loneliness will kill her. After saying that she faints and then Zubaida comes and scolds Mohsin for not taking care of Aina she tells him to call the doctor and the doctor says her blood pressure is low. After that he was remembering the old Aina that how joyful she used to be and now whatever he says to her she doesn't says a word.\n\nThe next day Mohsin prepared breakfast for Aina and took her very nicely. Mohsin brought his twin children and told Aina that he don't want a child right now from her maybe later but not that time because he doesn't want Aina to take care of her child more than his children. Aina has now too many responsibilities so she asked Mohsin that she wants a maid. At first he didn't agree because of all that Nafeesa drama he didn't want to take anymore risks but later on he accepts. The next day Aina was happy because she got support of maid and told Mohsin that she works really nicely and told that she cooks also very well and then Mohsin told that the maid prepared the food and she told yes I was checking that if she can cook or not because if there is any emergency so she will cook. Then he got angry and started shouting at her and told her this is his house and whatever he says only that will happen and he doesn't wants to eat the food if it is made by the maid and said her what does she even do everyday. After that Ayna said that yeah I am not doing anything everyday angels are coming and taking care of the house and I am doing nothing and just sleeping she said that in anger and ran furiously down the stairs and then her foot slipped and then she fell down. Then Mohsin came and helped her. After that he had to eat the food by maid the whole week. Ayna started to feel jealous seeing Nadia and Mohsin wedding picture and then she removed it from the wall and put the frame of her children. Mohsin noticed it and then got angry and said to put the frame back she said she will not put the frame and if he does she will throw the frame outside she told that I am your wife now Nadia I nowhere in her life. After a few days, Ayna went to her old home and was remembering her good old memories with Sajal and her mother. Mohsin arrived home and was waiting for Ayna when she came he told her where are you going everyday at this time and saying bad stuff to her. She then says that she doesn't want to live with her and then he says cause you want to marry I mean and then she says you are a very cheap person and then she leaves the home. She then went to Zubaida (Khala) home and said her everything what happened. After that she left her home and went again back to her old home I.e.. her mother's home and was crying there. On The other hand, Mohsin was thinking that why he scolds her every time he then was imaging a shadow of himself in which his shadow says him that he have to control himself otherwise he and his children will not be happy without her. Then he visits Zubaida's house and asked her about Ayna. She said that she went to her home and then he says she is not there. Then he thought that Ayna would must be in her old house and then he goes there and convinces her and apologize her and then she agrees to live with him.\n\nThe story then leaps 18 years. The twins (Rania (Hina Altaf) and Aasher (Agha Jarrar) and Tabinda (Mariyam Nafees) have matured.  Tabinda is shy and sweet while Rania is much the opposite and Rania is lively and confident. Tabinda wants to become an engineer and study in university however Mohsin denies as he doesn't want her end up doing the mistakes Aina did in the past when she went college. Tabinda tries to convince Mohsin but Mohsin's decision remains the same. Also Mohsin is planning to get Tabinda married but Tabinda does not agree. But as usual, what Mohsin wishes only that will happen. After few days, Mohsin and Faraz's sister Aliya (Zainab Qayyum) and her son Afaaq (Umer Naru) moved to Mohsin's house to stay there forever. Afaaq is a really selfish and irresponsible guy, Aliya is also not a really good woman. The next day, Aliya said to Mohsin that Ayna is a really good woman and she took a really good care of the kids to which Mohsin agrees then Ayna came inside and she sat on the sofa then Aliya asked Mohsin that why he didn't allow Tabinda to take admission in University. He then told her that she has grown older so he is looking for a boy to marry her. After that Aliya asked hand in marriage for Tabinda to Mohsin to which Mohsin was really happy and finally agreed. After that Ayna told Mohsin that he should have asked her point of view. Then Mohsin says I don't need to listen and that why is she not agreeing for Afaaq to which Ayna replied because he has just shifted here and they don't know him much and Tabi will also not agree. Then Mohsin says if Tabi doesn't agree then he will finish all his relations between his daughter and Ayna. Mohsin also decided that Rania will marry Maaz and Taabi will marry Afaaq to which Rania overheard and then she ran to Tabi and told her about what Mohsin says that she will marry Afaaq and when she heard that she cried a lot then Ayna was calming her down and told her not to cry. The next day, when Ayna gave tea to Mohsin, he asked how Taabi responded when she learned that she will marry Afaaq. Ayna said she was quiet. Meanwhile, Afaaq was happy to marry Taabi because he thought that then he can get money  from Mohsin because he is going to be his son-in-law.\n\nWhile, Maaz (Raees Alam) is unaware of fact that he is step-son of Sajal and Faraz. Once, he comes to Aina's home, Aina initially don't know that he is Maaz, but when he says that he is Maaz, she is surprised. He has actually come without permission of Sajal but Faraz knows. Rania and Maaz start taking interest in each other and would marry in coming episodes. Initially Mohsin was not in favour of his son to get education from abroad but when he asked Affaq about it, Affaq also favour his (Mohsin's) son because he wanted to handle all the business of his father-in-law. while on the other side Faraz and Sajjal return to Pakistan and Sajjal is not happy with the soft behavior of Maaz towards Aina. Whereas Maaz has fallen in love with Rania. Sajjal continuously insults Rania and Maaz gave her choice of court marriage. Aina listens there conversation and thought Rania is going to do same mistake as Aina did in past Faraz gave proposal of Maaz to Rania parents though which Aina rejected. Maaz and Rania are is great sorrow and Sajal is quite happy. But Maaz began to hate his own mother after this.he than was going back to America. \n \nWhen Sajal apologizes to Aina and Sajal wants Rania and Maaz to marry each other, when they found out they were so surprised, at Taabi's mehndi a girl threatens Taabi to stay away from Afaqq, she zoomed to Afaqq's prison of the house and gives him the photos, Aliya was shocked to see the photos. At the shaadi the boys were dancing (Maaz, Asher, and Afaqq) when the police arrived and took Afaq, when Mohsin blames Aliya for her sons misbehavior, they decide to replace Taabi's Shaadi With Rania's marriage. Then Mohsin finds out Maaz is not Faraz and Sajal son but does not know it is Aaina and tells Rania to divorce him. Maaz comes in and he tells Rania to go with him but Mohsin gets a gun out just to threaten Maaz but out of pressure Aaina tells Mohsin about Imran and Maaz being her son. Mohsin is shocked and Faraz tries to take the gun off and then Mohsin accidentally shoots Maaz. Aaina and Faraz take him to the hospital and gets him treated. Rania on the other hand is in a state of shock and Tabi tries to console her and says he is fine and is asking about her. Mohsin is thinking about what he has done and remembers about his past. When Aina is back to home to take Rania to hospital to see Maaz, Mohsin tells about the fact that Aina is not their mother. Despite this, they accepted her as their mother. Maaz went to meet his father and grandmother they were shocked and aina went back to Mohsin. At least Taabi and Afaq married and Rania and Maaz as well they had a family picture and that was the ending.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Naveen Waqar]] as Ayna \"Aani\" \n* [[Emmad Irfani]] as Mohsin  \n* [[Asad Zaman Khan]] as Imran\n* Shazia Naz as Sajal\n* Zain Mirza as Faraz \n* [[Hira Hussain]] as Annie \n* [[Maryam Nafees]] as Tabinda \"Taabi\" \n* [[Hina Altaf]] as Rania\n* Raeed Muhammed as Maaz\n* Zainab Jameel as Nadia (dead)\n* [[Huma Nawab]] as Nayyara (dead)\n* [[Abid Ali (actor)|Abid Ali]] as Sohail (dead)\n* Umer Naru as Afaaq \n* [[Ismat Zaidi]] as Zainab\n* [[Zainab Qayyum]] as Aliya\n* Agha Jararuddin as Aashir\n* Fouzia Mushtaq as Zubaida \n* Shahid as Noman  \n* Neema Alam\n* Zainab Fatima ([[child actor]]) as the young Tabinda \"Taabi\"\n* Rashida Tabassum\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of programs broadcast by Hum TV]]\n* [[2016 in Pakistani television]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hum TV Programs}}\n{{Television in Pakistan |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Pakistani drama television series]]\n[[Category:2010s Pakistani television series]]\n[[Category:2017 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2017 Pakistani television series endings]]\n[[Category:Urdu-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Hum TV series]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "poor French", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuch_Na_Kaho_(TV_series)"}

Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the [[lion (heraldry)|lion rampant]] club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters ''RFC'' overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881\u201382 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto ''Ready'', which was shortened from ''Aye Ready'' (meaning ''Always Ready'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]), all surrounded by the team name, ''Rangers Football Club''. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo. The scroll crest first appeared on the teams shorts for the start of the 1978\u201379 season.<ref name=\"Rangers Crest Badges\">{{cite web|url=http://www.danburymint.co.uk/index.php?act=product&product_id=4250&cat_id=&mediacode=&kiks_code=|title=The Badges of Rangers Football Club|publisher=Danbury Mint|accessdate=21 January 2013|quote=The earliest badge featured the celebrated RFC scroll crest believed to have been used since 1872.

The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation. '1872\u20132012' appeared above the scroll crest with the words '140 years' featuring below.<ref name=\"Rangers Crest Gersnet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.therangersarchive.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=261&Itemid=326|title=The Rangers Crest|publisher=Gersnet Online|accessdate=21 January 2013|quote=From 1990 to 1994 'Rangers Football Club' and the 'Ready' motto were placed above and below the Crest respectively.

However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624074927/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|archivedate=24 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue [[Star (polygon)#Six-pointed stars|six pointed star]] on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a [[third kit]]. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913081516/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|archivedate=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993\u201394,<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\" /> worn once in 2002\u201303 and reintroduced in 2018\u201319, have courted controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the [[Orange Order]].<ref name = \"2018\u201319 kits\">{{cite news|title=Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership 2018 - 2019|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/season/2018-2019/premiership.html|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"|Selection of Rangers kits through history<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\" />\n|-\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_hoops_white|leftarm=0033FF|body=0033FF|rightarm=0033FF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0033FF|alt=The blue shirt, white shorts and blue & white hooped socks.

Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the [[lion (heraldry)|lion rampant]] club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters ''RFC'' overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881\u201382 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto ''Ready'', which was shortened from ''Aye Ready'' (meaning ''Always Ready'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]), all surrounded by the team name, ''Rangers Football Club''. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo.

The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation.

However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624074927/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|archivedate=24 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue [[Star (polygon)#Six-pointed stars|six pointed star]] on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a [[third kit]]. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913081516/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|archivedate=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993\u201394,<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\" /> worn once in 2002\u201303 and reintroduced in 2018\u201319, have courted controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the [[Orange Order]].<ref name = \"2018\u201319 kits\">{{cite news|title=Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership 2018 - 2019|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/season/2018-2019/premiership.html|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"|Selection of Rangers kits through history<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\" />\n|-\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_hoops_white|leftarm=0033FF|body=0033FF|rightarm=0033FF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0033FF|alt=The blue shirt, white shorts and blue & white hooped socks.
