The film stars Habib Boufares as an aging immigrant from the [[Maghreb]] whose ambition to establish a successful restaurant as an inheritance for his large and disparate family meets sceptical opposition from the French bureaucracy.\n\nThe French title of the film refers to a \"grain of [[couscous]]\" and to [[Flathead mullet|mullet]], a type of small fish, both popular in [[Tunisia]]n cuisine. The two ingredients constitute both the staple of his extended family's diet and the menu on which he plans to establish his restaurant.\n\n==Plot==\nSlimane Beiji (Habib Boufares) is the divorced head of a Franco-Arabic family living in [[S\u00e8te|Sete]].  As he is being forced out of his job at the local shipyard, he interacts in a series of extended vignettes with various members of his extended family including his ex-wife, his sons and daughters, their husbands and wives, and his grandchildren. Determined to leave a legacy for his beloved family, and encouraged by his long-term partner's daughter, Rym, (Hafsia Herzi) he pursues his dream of converting a dilapidated boat into a family restaurant that will specialise in his ex-wife's fish couscous, a meal that she prepares for the entire family every Sunday.\n\nWith Rym's enthusiastic help, Slimane applies for the relevant licences and loans, but soon finds himself knee-deep in bureaucratic red tape. Undaunted, Slimane enlists his sons to help with the renovation and arranges an opening gala of a large dinner party, to which he invites the many bureaucrats on whose decision the fate of the project rests, in an attempt to demonstrate the viability of the enterprise. On the night in question attendance is high, although notable by her absence is his long-term partner, Latifa. Insulted and threatened by the involvement of Slimane's ex-wife in the project, the restaurant's cook and creator of the pivotal fish couscous, Latifa refuses to leave her hotel. Rym pleads with her to attend, encouraging her to use the opportunity to flaunt her comparative youth and beauty in front of Slimane's ex-wife, and eventually she concedes.\n\nHaving prepared the couscous, fish, vegetables and sauce in large metal cauldrons, Slimane's ex-wife sends the food to the boat with her sons and leaves her apartment to find a 'poor man' so that she can donate a plate of food that she habitually reserves for the less fortunate. At the restaurant, the sons unload the metal cauldrons and the women serve wine and appetisers to the waiting guests. The guests, talking amongst themselves, begin to speak both positively and anxiously about the likely success of the restaurant, now concerned that it may draw custom away from the other restaurants in the area. Slimane's son Majid, whilst surveying the crowd, notices a bureaucrat's wife with whom he has had several illicit sexual liaisons and decides to leave quietly. He instructs his brother to tell the rest of the family that he has gone to help a friend who has broken down on the highway. The women start to heat up the food when they notice the absence of the couscous. Panic mounts when they discover that it is definitively absent and Majid, who has taken the car that still holds the metal cauldron in the trunk, is not answering his phone. Knowing that it will take at least another hour to cook a new batch, they continue to frantically call Majid and attempt to call Souad, who is out searching for an unfortunate in need of plate of couscous. Slimane takes his motorbike out to Souad's apartment building to find her.\n\nIn the dining room the guests, despite the attempts of the women to placate them with assurances and date liqueur, become extremely restless. Their comments turn nasty and they turn on the waitressing girls. When he cannot find his ex-wife, Slimane leaves the apartment building to find his motorbike stolen. The culprits, three young boys, sit atop the stolen bike on the other side of the river, mocking him. He runs after them, but every time they stop to mock him they move on before he can catch up to them.\n\nTensions in the dining room reach a peak and Rym decides to step in. She whispers to the musicians, and suddenly the music stops and the lights go out. When they come back on, Rym stands before the assembled diners in a red belly-dancing outfit. The musicians play for her and she entrances the guests with a fervent performance, charged with youthful, sexual energy. Latifa uses the opportunity to slip off the boat and return to the hotel to start a new pot of couscous.\n\nAs Rym dances and sweats, her mother walks up the gangplank with a new cauldron of couscous, whilst Slimane continues to chase the youths around the apartment building. Finally he sinks to his knees, before collapsing flat on the ground, unmoving.\n\n==Cast==\n* '''Habib Boufares''' as '''Slimane Beiji''', a sixty-year-old shipyard worker and immigrant from the [[Maghreb]].

{"title_page": "Mayor", "text_new": "{{short description|Head of municipal government such as a town or city}}\n{{other uses}}\nIn many countries, a '''mayor''' is the highest-ranking [[official]] in a [[Municipal corporation|municipal government]] such as that of a [[city]] or a [[town]].\n\nWorldwide, there is a wide [[variance]] in local laws and customs regarding the powers and responsibilities of a mayor as well as the means by which a mayor is elected or otherwise mandated. Depending on the system chosen, a mayor may be the chief executive officer of the municipal government, may simply chair a multi-member governing body with little or no independent power, or may play a solely ceremonial role. Options for selection of a mayor include direct election by the public, or selection by an elected governing council or board.\n\n==History==\n\n===British Isles===\n{{anchor|England|Scotland|Wales}}{{See also|Mayors in England|Mayors in Wales}}\nIn modern [[England]] and [[Wales]], the position of mayor descends from the feudal lord's [[bailiff]] or [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] (''see [[borough]]''). The [[chief magistrate]] of [[London]] bore the title of [[portreeve]] for considerably more than a century after the [[Norman Conquest]]. This official was elected by popular choice, a privilege secured from [[John, King of England|King John]]. By the beginning of the 12th century, the title of portreeve gave way to that of mayor as the designation of the chief officer of London, followed around 1190 by that of [[Winchester]]. Other boroughs adopted the title later.\n\nIn the 19th century, in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1882]], Section 15, regulated the election of mayors. The mayor was to be a fit person elected annually on 9&nbsp;November by the council of the borough from among the aldermen or councillors or persons qualified to be such. His term of office was one year, but he was eligible for re-election. He might appoint a deputy to act during illness or absence, and such deputy must be either an alderman or councillor. A mayor who was absent from the borough for more than two months became disqualified and had to vacate his office. A mayor was ''ex officio'' a [[justice of the peace]] for the borough during his year of office and the following year. He received such remuneration as the council thought reasonable. These provisions have now been repealed.\n\nIn medieval Wales, the [[Laws of Hywel Dda]] codified the [[maer (office)|mayor]] ([[Medieval Latin|Latin]]: ''{{lang|la|maior}}''; [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''{{lang|cy|maer}}'') as a position at the [[Welsh kingdoms|royal courts]] charged with administering the serfs of the [[demesne|king's lands]]. To maintain its dependence on and loyalty to the Crown, the position was forbidden to the leaders of the clan groups.<ref name=HyDda>[[Wade-Evans, Arthur]]. \nPage:Welsh Medieval Law.djvu/447|Welsh Medieval Law]]''. Oxford Univ., 1909. Accessed 1 Feb 2013.</ref> A separate mayor, known as the \"cow dung mayor\"<!--seriously. see source.--> (''maer biswail''), was charged with overseeing the royal cattle.<ref name=HyDda/> There were similar offices at the Scottish and Irish courts.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe office of [[mayors and provosts in the United Kingdom|mayor]] in most modern English and Welsh boroughs and towns did not in the 20th century entail any important administrative duties, and was generally regarded as an honour conferred for local distinction, long service on the council, or for past services. The mayor was expected to devote much of his (or her) time to civic, ceremonial, and representational functions, and to preside over meetings for the advancement of the public welfare. His or her administrative duties were to act as returning officer at parliamentary elections, and as chairman of the meetings of the council.\n\nHowever, since [[Local Government Act 2000|reforms]] introduced in 2000, fourteen English local authorities have [[Elected mayors in the United Kingdom|directly elected mayors]] who combine the \"civic\" mayor role with that of [[leader of the council]] and have significantly greater powers than either. The mayor of a [[town council]] is officially known as \"town mayor\" (although in popular parlance, the word \"town\" is often dropped). Women mayors are also known as \"mayor\"; the wife of a mayor is sometimes known as the \"mayoress\". Mayors are not appointed to district councils which do not have [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]]. Their place is taken by the chairman of council, who undertakes exactly the same functions and is, like a mayor, the civic head of the district concerned.\n\nIn [[Scotland]] the post holders are known as convenors, [[provost (civil)|provost]]s, or lord provosts depending on the local authority.\n\n===Continental Europe===\n{{main|Mayor of the Palace|podest\u00e0}}\nThe original [[Franks|Frankish]] mayors or majordomos were {{ndash}} like the Welsh ''meiri'' {{ndash}} lords commanding the king's lands around the [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] courts in [[Austrasia]], [[kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]], and [[Neustria]]. The mayorship of Paris eventually became hereditary in the [[Pippinids]], who later established the [[Carolingian dynasty]].\n\nIn modern [[France]], since the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], a mayor (''maire'') and a number of mayoral adjuncts (''adjoints au maire'') are selected by the municipal council from among their number. Most of the administrative work is left in their hands, with the full council meeting comparatively infrequently. The model was copied throughout Europe in Britain's mayors, Italy's [[sindaco]]s, most of the German states' [[burgomaster]]s, and Portugal's [[President of the Municipal Chamber|presidents of the municipal chambers]].\n\nIn [[Medieval Italy]], the [[Italian city-states|city-states]] who did not consider themselves independent principalities or dukedoms {{ndash}} particularly those of the Imperial [[Ghibelline]] faction {{ndash}} were led by [[podest\u00e0]]s.\n\nThe [[Greece|Greek]] equivalent of a mayor is the [[demarch]] ({{lang-el|\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2|3=[[archon]] of the [[deme]]}}).\n\n====Scandinavia====\nIn [[Denmark]] all [[Municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]] are led by a political official called ''[[Burgomaster|borgmester]]'', \"mayor\". The mayor of [[Copenhagen]] is however called ''[[List of mayors of Copenhagen|overborgmester]]'' \"superior mayor\". In that city other mayors, ''borgmestre'' (plural), are subordinate to him with different undertakings, like ministers to a prime minister. In other municipalities in Denmark there is only a single mayor.\n\nIn [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] the mayoral title ''borgermester/borgm\u00e4stare'' has now been abolished. Norway abolished it in 1937 as a title of the non-political top manager of (city) municipalities and replaced it with the title ''r\u00e5dmann'' (\"[[alderman]]\" or \"[[magistrate]]\"), which is still in use when referring to the top managers of the [[municipalities of Norway]]. The top ''elected'' official of the municipalities of Norway, on the other hand, has the title ''ordf\u00f8rer'', which actually means \"word-bearer\", i.e. \"chairman\" or \"president\", an equivalent to the Swedish word ''[[:wikt:ordf\u00f6rande|ordf\u00f6rande]]''.\n\nIn [[Sweden]] ''borgm\u00e4stare'' was a title of the senior judge of the courts of the cities, courts which were called ''r\u00e5dhusr\u00e4tt'', literally \"town hall court\", somewhat of an equivalent to an English [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]. These courts were abolished in 1971. Until 1965 these mayor judges on historical grounds also performed administrative functions in the \"board of magistrates\", in Swedish known collegially{{clarify|date=April 2017}} as ''magistrat''. Until 1965 there were also municipal mayors (''kommunalborgm\u00e4stare''), who had these non-political administrative roles in smaller cities without a magistrates' court or ''magistrat''. This office was an invention of the 20th century as the smaller cities in Sweden during the first half of the 20th century subsequently lost their own courts and magistrates.\n\nIn the 16th century in Sweden, king [[Gustav Vasa]] considerably centralised government and appointed the mayors directly. In 1693 king [[Charles XI]] accepted a compromise after repeated petitions from the Estate of the Burgesses over decades against the royal mayor appointments. The compromise was that the burgesses in a city could normally nominate a mayor under the supervision of the local governor. The nominee was then to be presented to and appointed by the king, but the king could appoint mayors directly in exceptional cases. This was codified in the [[Instrument of Government]] of 1720 and on 8 July the same year [[Privy Council of Sweden|Riksr\u00e5det (\"the Council of the Realm\")]] decided, after a petition from the said Estate, that only the city could present nominees, not the king or anyone else. Thus the supervision of the local governor and directly appointed mayors by the king ceased after 1720 (the so-called [[Age of Liberty]]). On 16 October 1723, it was decided after a petition that the city should present three nominees, of whom the king (or the Council of the Realm) appointed one.<ref name=NF>[http://runeberg.org/nfbc/0637.html The article ''Borgm\u00e4stare'' (in Swedish)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605184600/http://runeberg.org/nfbc/0637.html |date=2013-06-05 }} in [[Nordisk Familjebok]].</ref> This was kept as a rule from then on in all later regulations<ref name=NF/> and was also kept as a tradition in the [[Instrument of Government (1809)|1809 Instrument of Government]] ([http://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/Regeringsform_1809#.C2.A731. \u00a7 31]) until 1965.\n\nIn [[Finland]], there are two mayors, in [[Tampere]] and [[Pirkkala]]. Usually in Finland the highest executive official is not democratically elected, but is appointed to a public office by the city council, and is called simply ''kaupunginjohtaja'' \"city manager\" or ''kunnanjohtaja'' \"municipal manager\", depending on whether the municipality defines itself as a city. The term ''pormestari'' \"mayor\", from Swedish ''borgm\u00e4stare'' confusingly on historical grounds has referred to the highest official in the registry office and in the city courts (abolished in 1993) as in Sweden, not the city manager. In addition, ''pormestari'' is also an honorary title, which may be given for distinguished service in the post of the city manager. The city manager of Helsinki is called ''ylipormestari'', which translates to \"Chief Mayor\", for historical reasons. Furthermore, the term \"city manager\" may be seen translated as \"mayor\".\n\n==Mayors by country==\n===Australia===<!-- This section is linked from [[Albury, New South Wales]] -->\nOn Australian councils, the mayor is generally the member of the council who acts as ceremonial figurehead at official functions, as well as carrying the authority of council between meetings. Mayoral decisions made between meetings are subject to council and may be confirmed or repealed if necessary. Mayors in Australia may be elected either directly through a ballot for the position of mayor at a local-government election, or alternatively may be elected from within the council at a meeting.\n\nThe civic regalia and insignia of local government have basically remained unaltered for centuries. For ceremonial occasions a mayor may wear robes, a [[Livery collar|mayoral chain]] and a [[Ceremonial mace|mace]]. Mayors have the title of ''''[[Worship (style)|His/Her Worship]]'''' whilst holding the position.\n\nIn councils where [[councillors]] are elected representing political parties, the mayor is normally the leader of the party receiving the most seats on council. In [[Queensland]], the [[lord mayor]] and mayors are elected by popular vote at the general council election.\n\n===Brazil===\nEvery municipality in Brazil elects a mayor (Portuguese: ''prefeito''/''prefeita''), for a four-year term, acting as an executive officer with the city council (Portuguese: ''C\u00e2mara Municipal'') functioning with legislative powers. The mayor can be re-elected and manage the city for two consecutive terms.\n\nThe Brazilian system works similarly to the [[mayor-council government]] in the United States.\n\n===Canada===\nThe chief executives of [[borough#Canada|boroughs]] (''[[Arrondissement#Quebec|arrondissements]]'') in [[Quebec]] are termed mayors (''maires/mairesses'' in French). A borough mayor simultaneously serves as head of the borough council and as a regular councillor on the main city council.\n\nAs is the practice in most Commonwealth countries, in Canada a mayor is addressed as His/Her Worship while holding office.\n\nIn some small [[township (Canada)|townships]] in [[Ontario]], the title '''reeve''' was historically used instead of mayor. In some other municipalities, \"mayor\" and \"reeve\" were two separate offices, with the mayor retaining leadership powers while the reeve was equivalent to what other municipalities called an \"[[at-large]] councillor\". While most municipalities in the province now designate their elected municipal government heads as mayors, in certain areas of the province, the elected head of the municipality continues to be referred to as reeve, and the second-in-command is referred to as the deputy reeve. For example, this continues to be the case in the municipalities of [[Algonquin Highlands]], [[Dysart et al]], [[Highlands East]], and [[Minden Hills]], all located within [[Haliburton County]], as well as [[Beckwith, Ontario|Beckwith Township]], [[Lanark Highlands]], [[Drummond/North Elmsley | Drummond/North Elmsley Township]], [[Tay Valley | Tay Valley Township]], and [[Montague, Ontario|Montague Township]], all located within [[Lanark County]].\n\nMany municipalities in Alberta continue to use the title reeve to denote the office of mayor or chief elected official in accordance with the Municipal Government Act.\n\nIn rural municipalities (RM) in the provinces of [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]], the elected head of the RM is still referred to as a \"reeve\", as are the heads of most counties and district municipalities (DMs) in Alberta.\n\nThe scheduling of municipal elections in Canada varies by jurisdiction, as each province and territory has its own laws regarding municipal governance. See also [[municipal elections in Canada]].\n\n===Dominican Republic===\nThe mayor of a municipality in the [[Dominican Republic]] is called indistinctly ''alcalde'' or ''s\u00edndico''. The latter name is preferred as to avoid confusing the title with the similarly sounding ''alcaide'' (''lit. [[prison warden]]''). Such person is the governor of the municipality whose township elected him (or her) by [[direct vote]] for a term of four years. The mayor's office daily duties are restricted to the local governance, and as such, it is responsible for the coordination of [[waste collection]], [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|upkeep]] of [[public spaces]] (parks, undeveloped urban parcels, streets, city ornate, traffic light control, sewage and most public utilities). In practice most of it duties are centered in light street repairing (new or big road projects, like overpasses, bridges, pedestrian crossings, etc. are handled by the Public Works Ministry (''Ministerio de Obras P\u00fablicas'' in Spanish) office), under the direct control of the Central Government. Subcontracting [[Waste collection|garbage collection]] and management, overseeing the use of public spaces and arbitring neighborhood land ''use'' disputes which is managed by the National Property office (''Oficina de Bienes Nacionales'' in Spanish) is also controlled by the mayor's office. Water, electrical supply and public transportation coordination are handled by several Central Government's offices, and as such, are not under control of the mayor.\n\n===France===\n{{details|Mayor (France)}}\nMayors (''maires'') in France are elected every six years in [[Elections in france#Municipal|local elections]].\n\n===Germany===\nIn Germany local government is regulated by [[states of Germany|state]] statutes. Nowadays only the mayors of the three city-states (Berlin, Hamburg and [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]]) are still elected by the respective city-state parliaments. In all the other states the mayors are now elected directly by the [[EU citizen]]s living in that area. The post of mayor may be said to be a professional one, the mayor being the head of the local government, and requiring, in order to be eligible, a training in administration. In big cities (details are regulated by state statutes) the official title is ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'' ([[lord mayor]]). In these cities a \"simple\" mayor is just a deputy responsible for a distinct task (e.g., welfare or construction works). Big cities are usually ''[[Kreisfreie Stadt|kreisfrei]]'' (\"free of district\"). That means that the city council also has the powers and duties of a rural district council. The leader of a rural district council is called ''Landrat'' (\"land counsellor\"). In that case the chief mayor has also the duties and powers of a ''Landrat''. The term ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'' is not used in the three city-states, where the mayors are simultaneously [[minister-president|head of state governments]], but ''Regierender B\u00fcrgermeister'' ([[Governing Mayor of Berlin]]), ''Erster B\u00fcrgermeister'' ([[First Mayor of the city-state of Hamburg]]) and ''Pr\u00e4sident des Senats und B\u00fcrgermeister'' ([[Mayor of Bremen|President of the Senate and Mayor of Bremen]]) are used.\n\n===Greece===\nMayors (\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9, ''d\u0113marchoi'', sing. \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, ''[[demarchos|d\u0113marchos]]'') in [[Greece]] were previously elected every four years in [[Elections in Greece#Local elections|local elections]] and are the head of various municipal governments in which the state is divided. Starting from 2014, mayors are elected for a five-year term. Local administration elections for the new, consolidated municipalities and peripheries will henceforth be held together with the [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].\n\nLocal administration in Greece recently underwent extensive reform in two phases: the first phase, implemented in 1997 and commonly called the \"[[Kapodistrias Plan]]\", consolidated the country's numerous municipalities and communities down to approximately 1000. The second phase, initially called \"Kapodistrias II\" but eventually called the \"[[Kallikratis Plan]]\", was implemented in 2010, further consolidated municipalities down to 370, and merged the country's 54 prefectures were disbanded in favour of the larger 13 regions. The Kallikratian municipalities were designed according to several guidelines; for example each island (except [[Crete]]) was incorporated into a single municipality, while the majority of small towns were consolidated so as to have an average municipal population of 25,000.\n\n=== India ===\nIn [[India]], the mayor is leader of the council and has a number of roles, both legislative and functional. The legislative requirements are outlined in Section 73 and 73AA of Local Government Act 1989. In most Indian states mayors are elected indirectly among the council members themselves except in eight states [[Bihar]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Haryana]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Odisha]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Uttarakhand]]; where mayors are elected directly by the public.\n\n===Indonesia===\nIn [[Indonesia]], mayor ({{lang-id|wali kota}}, formerly called ''walikotamadya'' and ''walikota'') is a regional head of a city or town. A mayor has the same level as a [[regent]] ({{lang-id|bupati}}), head of a regency ({{lang-id|kabupaten}}). Basically, a mayor has duties and authority to lead the implementation of the policies established by the region along with the city council ({{lang-id|Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Kota}}, DPRD Kota; formerly called Tier 2-DPRD (''DPRD tingkat II'')). A mayor is elected in a pair with a vice mayor through direct elections and is a political office, except in Jakarta. There, mayoralty is a civil-service career position with limited authority and is designated by the [[Governor of Jakarta]]. Their region are called [[Jakarta#Administrative divisions|administration cities]] ({{lang-id|kota administrasi}}).\n\nBefore 1999, there were administrative cities ({{lang-id|kota administratif}}, [[:id:Kota administratif|id]]) which were headed by administrative mayors.\n\n===Iran===\nIn [[Iran]], the mayor is the executive manager of a city and elected by the Islamic City Council. The mayor is elected for a four-year term.\n\n===Ireland===\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], the head of a borough corporation was called \"mayor\" from the [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840]] until boroughs were abolished by the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]]. The [[Local Government Act 2001]] allowed [[Counties of Ireland|county]] councils to style their chairperson as \"mayor\" and most do so. [[City status in Ireland|City]] council chairs are \"mayor\" (or \"lord mayor\" in the cases [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|of Dublin]] and [[Lord Mayor of Cork|of Cork]]). Since 2000 [[Proposed directly elected mayor for the Dublin Metropolitan Area|there have been proposals]] for a directly elected mayor of the [[Dublin Metropolitan Area]].\n\n===Italy===\nIn Italy the mayor is called ''sindaco'', or informally ''primo cittadino'' (\"first citizen\"). Every municipality ({{lang-it|Comune}}) has its mayor who represents the local government. The mayor is elected every five years by the inhabitants of the municipality, but he cannot be re-elected after two terms.<ref>{{in lang|it}} [https://www.academia.edu/11358245/Del_terzo_mandato_dei_sindaci {{lang|it|No ai tre mandati dei sindaci. Principio di legalit\u00e0 batte disobbedienti}}].</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nJapan's [[Local Autonomy Law|Local-Autonomy Law]] of 1947 defines the structure of Japanese local governments, which were strengthened after World War II. It gives strong executive power to the mayor in the local politics like [[mayor-council government#Executive or Strong Mayor Form|strong mayors]] in large cities in the United States of America.\nThe titles that are translated as \"mayor\" by the governments are those of the heads of [[cities of Japan|cities]] {{Nihongo||\u5e02\u9577|shich\u014d}}, [[towns of Japan|towns]] {{Nihongo||\u753a\u9577|ch\u014dch\u014d}}, [[villages of Japan|villages]] {{Nihongo||\u6751\u9577|sonch\u014d}}, and Tokyo's [[special wards of Tokyo|special wards]] {{Nihongo||\u533a\u9577|kuch\u014d}}.\n(The head of the [[Tokyo|Tokyo prefecture]] is the {{Nihongo|Governor|\u77e5\u4e8b|Chiji}}.)\nA mayor is elected every four years by direct popular votes held separately from the assembly. A mayor can be [[recall election|recalled]] by a popular initiative but the [[prefectures of Japan|prefectural]] and the national governments cannot remove a mayor from office. Towards the assembly the mayor prepares budgets, proposes local [[Act of Parliament|acts]] and has vetoes on local acts just approved by the assembly which can be overridden by two-thirds assembly support. A mayor can dissolve the assembly if the assembly passes a [[motion of no confidence]] or if the mayor thinks the assembly has no confidence in fact.\n\n===Kazakhstan===\nIn Kazakhstan, the mayor is called [[Akim]] who is the head of an akimat, a municipal, district, or provincial government (mayorat), and serves as the Presidential representative. Akims of provinces and cities are appointed to the post by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the akims of other administrative and territorial units are appointed or selected to the post in an order defined by the President. He may also dismiss akims from their posts. Powers of akims ends with the introduction into the post of new-elected president of the republic. Thus, the akim continues to fulfill the duties before appointment of corresponding akim by the President of Kazakhstan.\n\n===Malaysia===\n{{See also|Mayor of Kuala Lumpur|Mayor of Penang Island}}\nThe mayor functions as the head of the local government of the cities in Malaysia. To date, there are [[List of cities in Malaysia#Cities of Malaysia|14 officially-recognised cities in the country]].\n\nIn cities which lie within the jurisdiction of any one of the [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|13 Malaysian states]], the mayor is appointed by the state government.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/10/24/elect-local-leaders|title=Elect local leaders|website=www.thesundaily.my|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617165044/http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/10/24/elect-local-leaders|archive-date=2018-06-17|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Kuala Lumpur]], the country's capital, is a notable exception, as it forms part of the [[Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Federal Territories]] which come under the purview of the [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian federal government]], via the [[Ministry of Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Ministry of Federal Territories]].

The members of the Local Councils are directly elected and collectively serve as a basic form of local government.\n\n===Moldova===\nThe Mayor of the municipality in Moldova is elected for four years. In [[Chi\u015fin\u0103u]], the last mayor elections had to be repeated three times, because of the low rate of participation.\n\n===Netherlands===\n{{Main|Burgemeester}}\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the mayor (in {{lang-nl|burgemeester}}) is the leader of the municipal executives ('[[College van Burgemeester en Wethouders]]'). In the Netherlands, burgermeesters are ''de facto'' appointed by the national [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|cabinet]], ''de jure'' by the [[Dutch Monarchy|monarch]]. They preside both the municipal executive and the legislative ('[[gemeenteraad]]'). The title is sometimes translated as [[burgomaster]], to emphasize the appointed, rather than elected, nature of the office. The appointment procedure was brought for discussion in the early 2000s (decade), as some of the political parties represented in parliament regarded the procedure as undemocratic. Generally, mayors in the Netherlands are selected from the established political parties. Alternatives proposed were direct election of the mayor by the people or appointment by the city council (''gemeenteraad''). A constitutional change to allow for this failed to pass the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] in March 2005, but succeeded in 2018.\n\n===Nepal===\n{{main|List of Mayors of Nepal}}\nMayors in Nepal are elected every Five years in the [[Elections in Nepal|Local elections]]. They are very powerful in Municipal Government .\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|Mayors in New Zealand}}\n\nMayors in New Zealand are elected every three years in the [[Elections in New Zealand|local body elections]].\n\n===Pakistan===\nIn [[Pakistan]], a city is headed by the [[Districts of Pakistan|District]] [[Nazim]] (the word means \"supervisor\" in Urdu, but is sometimes translated as Mayor) and assisted by [[Naib Nazim]] who is also speaker of District Council. District Nazim is elected by the nazims of [[Union councils of Pakistan|union councils]], union councillors and by [[tehsil]] nazims, who themselves are elected directly by the votes of the local public. Council elections are held every four years.\n\n===Philippines===\nIn the [[Philippines]], mayors ({{lang-tl|Punong Bayan / Punong Lungsod}}) are the head of a [[List of cities and municipalities in the Philippines|municipality or a city]], with the vice mayor as the second highest position in the city. They are elected every three years during the midterm and national elections, and they can serve until three terms of office. As of \u2013 September 2012, there are 1,635 mayors in the Philippines.\n\n===Poland===\nMayors in [[Poland]] are [[direct election|directly elected]] by inhabitants of their respective [[municipality]]. A mayor is the sole chief of the [[executive branch]] of the municipality and he/she cannot serve in the municipal council ([[city council]]) or in the [[parliament]]. Mayors may appoint a deputy mayor if needed. In Poland mayor is called a ''burmistrz'' or, in towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants or other municipalities that traditionally use the title, ''prezydent'' (\"president\", for example \"President of [[Warsaw]]\" instead of \"Mayor of Warsaw\"). The equivalent title in a rural community (\"[[gmina]]\") is \"[[w\u00f3jt]]\".\n\nA mayor is elected for a five-year term concurrently with the five-year term of the municipal council, and his/her service is terminated at the end of the municipal council's term. Mayors cannot be dismissed by the municipal council, but they can be removed from the office by the citizens of their municipality in a [[referendum]]. Mayors can also be dismissed by the [[Prime Minister]] in case of persistent transgression of the law. Citizens having a criminal record cannot run for mayor, but only if sentenced for intentional criminal offence prosecuted [[ex officio]].\n\nMayors manage the municipal estate, issues minor regulations, and incurs [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] within limits set by the municipal council. Mayors present a budget to the municipal council, that may be then amended by the council. After the municipal council passes the budget in a form of resolution, the mayor is responsible for its realization. Mayors are the head of the [[town hall]] and the [[register office]] (he/she may appoint deputies for these specific tasks). Mayors legally act as employers for all of the officials of the town hall. Mayors in Poland have wide administrative authority: the only official that he/she cannot appoint or dismiss is a [[city treasurer]], who is appointed by a city council. Although mayors in Poland do not have veto power over city council resolutions, their position is relatively strong and should be classified as a [[mayor-council government]].\n\n===Portugal===\nIn [[Portugal]] and many other Portuguese-speaking countries the mayor of a municipality is called the ''Presidente da C\u00e2mara Municipal'' ([[President of the Municipal Chamber]]).\n\n===Romania===\nIn [[Romania]] the mayor of a commune, town or city is called ''primar''. He or she is elected for a period of four years. In carrying out his responsibilities he is assisted by an elected local council (''consiliu local''). [[Bucharest]] has a general mayor (''primar general'') and six sector mayors (''primar de sector''), one for each [[Sectors of Bucharest|sector]]. The responsibilities of the mayor and of the local council are defined by Law 215/2001 of the Romanian Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legislatie.resurse-pentru-democratie.org/legea/215-2001.php|title=Legea nr. 215/2001|author=APD-Timisoara|work=resurse-pentru-democratie.org|access-date=2014-12-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104170314/http://legislatie.resurse-pentru-democratie.org/legea/215-2001.php|archive-date=2014-11-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Russia===\nIn Russia, the '''\u041c\u044d\u0440''', from [[France language|fr]] '''Maire''' ([[English language|en]] transcription = ''Mer'' \u2013 not to be confused with the NATO [[OF-3]] rank ''\u041c\u0430\u0439\u043e\u0440'' \u2013 en: ''[[Major]]''), is one of possible titles of the head of the administration of a city or municipality.  This title is equivalent to that of the head of a Russian rural district. Exceptionally, the ''mer'' of [[Moscow]], [[Saint-Petersburg]] and [[Sevastopol]] are equivalent to governors in Russia, since these three federal cities are Russian federal subjects.\n\nExcept for those just-named three large cities, the governance system of a Russian municipality (city, county, district or town) is subordinate to the representative council of the federation in which it is located. The ''mer'', is either directly elected in municipal elections (citywide referendum) or is elected by the members of the municipality's representative council. Election by council members is now more widespread because it better integrates with the Russian federal three-level vertical governance structure:\n#National government: \n##President (executive) \n##[[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Federal Assembly]]\n#Federation governments: \n##Heads of federation (commonly governors)\n##Regional representative councils\n#Local governments: \n##Heads of administration (who have the official title of ''mer'', whether or not local law defines it as such)\n##Local representative councils\n\nThe typical term of office of a ''mer'' in Russia is four years. The ''mer's'' office administers all municipal services, public property, police and fire protection, and most public agencies, and enforces all local and state laws within a city or town.\n\nAccording to Medialogy,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlg.ru/ratings/mayors/2949/6/2014/4/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222162625/http://www.mlg.ru/ratings/mayors/2949/6/2014/4/ |archivedate=2015-12-22 }}</ref> the ''mer'' of [[Novosibirsk]], Edward Lokot', is mentioned in the media more than any other Russian mayor.  The ''mer'' of [[Kazan]], Il'sur Metshin, is the most popular in Russia, scoring 76 out of 100, according to the Russian People's Rating of ''Mers''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://russia-rating.ru/info/1530.html|title=\u0420\u0435\u0433\u0438\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438: \u0420\u0435\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u041c\u044d\u0440\u043e\u0432 (\u041c\u0430\u0439, 2014)|work=russia-rating.ru|access-date=2014-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220100742/http://russia-rating.ru/info/1530.html|archive-date=2015-02-20|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe status of the post in Sevastopol is not legally recognized outside of the [[Russian Federation]], except for puppet states of the Russian Federation.\n\n===Serbia===\nIn [[Serbia]], the mayor is the head of the city or a town. He or she acts on behalf of the city, and performs an executive function. The position of the mayor of [[Belgrade]] is important as the capital city is the most important hub of economics, culture and science in [[Serbia]]. Furthermore, the post of the mayor of Belgrade is the third most important position in the government after the [[Prime Minister of Serbia|Prime Minister]] and [[President of Serbia|President]].\n\n===Spain and Hispanic America===\n''[[Alcalde]]'' is the most common Spanish term for the mayor of a town or city. It is derived from the {{lang-ar|[[Qadi|al-qa\u1e0di]]|script=Latn}} ({{lang|ar|\u0642\u0627\u0636\u064a|rtl=yes}}), i.e., \"the ([[Sharia]]) judge,\" who often had administrative, as well as judicial, functions. Although the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] ''alcalde'' and the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] ''qa\u1e0di'' had slightly different attributes (the ''qa\u1e0di'' oversaw an entire province, the ''alcalde'' only a municipality; the former was appointed by the ruler of the state but the latter was elected by the [[Cabildo (council)|municipal council]]), the adoption of this term reflects how much Muslim society in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] influenced the Christian one in the early phases of the ''[[Reconquista]]''. As Spanish Christians took over an increasing part of the Peninsula, they adapted the Muslim systems and terminology for their own use.\n\nToday, it refers to the executive head of a municipal or local government, who usually does not have judicial functions. The word ''[[Intendant|intendente]]'' is used in [[Argentina]] and [[Paraguay]] for the office that is analogous to a mayor.\n\nIn [[municipio]]s and larger cities in [[Mexico]], the chief executive is known as both alcalde or as ''presidente municipal'' (\"municipal president\"), with the latter being more widely used.\n\n===Sweden===\nThe Swedish title ''borgm\u00e4stare'' ([[burgomaster]]) was abolished in the court reform of 1971 when also the [[stad (Sweden)|towns of Sweden]] were officially abolished. Since the middle of the 20th century, the [[municipal commissioner]] \u2013 the highest-ranking politician in each municipality \u2013 is informally titled \"mayor\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} in English.\n\n===Switzerland===\nThe function and title for mayor vary from one canton to another. Generally, the mayor presides an executive council of several members governing a [[municipalities of Switzerland|municipality]].\n\nThe title is:\n*in Italian: ''Sindaco'' ([[Ticino]]), Podest\u00e0 ([[Grigioni]])\n*in French: ''Maire'' ([[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]], [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], [[Canton of Bern|Bern]]), ''Syndic'' ([[Vaud]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]]),  ''Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil municipal'' ([[Valais]]), ''Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil communal'' ([[Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel]])\n*in German: e.g. ''Stadtpr\u00e4sident'', ''Stadtammann'', ''Gemeindepr\u00e4sident'', ''Gemeindeammann''\n\n===Taiwan===\nIn the [[Republic of China]] in Taiwan the mayor is the head of city's government and its city's council, which is in charge of legislative affairs. The mayor and city council are elected separately by the city's residents.\n\n===Turkey===\nMayors ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]:''Belediye Ba\u015fkan\u0131'') in Turkey are elected by the municipal council. As a rule, there are municipalities in all province centers and district centers as well as towns ({{lang-tr|belde}}) which are actually villages with a population in excess of 2000. However beginning by 1983, a new level of municipality is introduced in Turkish administrative system. In big cities Metropolitan municipalities ({{lang-tr|B\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fehir belediyesi}}) are established. (See [[Metropolitan municipalities in Turkey]]) In a Metropolitan municipality there may be several  district municipalities (hence mayors).\n\n===Ukraine===\nIn [[Ukraine]] the title \"Head of the city\" (''Misky holova'', unofficially foreign adaptation ''Mer'' also is present) was introduced in 1999. Since than the post is elected by all residents of the city. Before that date the post was elected by members of the city's council only and was known as Head of the city's council which ex oficio also serves as the head of the executive committee. For the cities that carry special status such as [[Kiev]] and [[Sevastopol]], the Head of the city was a matter of long debate and the post is regulated by special laws.\n\nSince 2015 a post of Starosta (\"Elder\") is being implemented at lower level of administrative-territorial pyramid. Candidates to the post are also being elected by members of the territorial community (hromada). The post is historical and existed on the territory of Ukraine during times of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].\n\n===United States===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of mayors of New York City]] -->\n{{Main|Mayoralty in the United States}}\n\nThe mayor is the municipal head of government, the maximum civil authority at the municipal level, in most United States municipalities (such as cities, townships, etc.). In the [[Mayoralty in the United States|United States]], there are several distinct types of mayors, depending on whether the system of local government is [[council-manager government]] or [[mayor-council government]].\n\nUnder the council-manager government system, the mayor is a [[first among equals]] on the [[city council]], which acts as a legislative body while executive functions are performed by the appointed manager. The mayor may chair the city council, but lacks any special legislative powers. The mayor and city council serve part-time, with day-to-day administration in the hands of a professional city manager. The system is most common among medium-sized cities from around 25,000 to several hundred thousand, usually rural and suburban municipalities.\n\nUnder the mayor-council system, the mayoralty and city council are separate offices. This system may be of two types, either a strong mayor system or a weak mayor system. Under the ''strong mayor'' system, the mayor acts as an elected executive with the city council exercising legislative powers. They may select a [[chief administrative officer]] to oversee the different departments. This is the system used in most of the United States' large cities, primarily because mayors serve full-time and have a wide range of services that they oversee. In a ''weak mayor'' or ''ceremonial mayor'' system, the mayor has appointing power for department heads but is subject to checks by the city council, sharing both executive and legislative duties with the council. This is common for smaller cities, especially in [[New England]]. [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] are two notable large cities with a ceremonial mayor.\n\nMany American mayors are styled \"His Honor\" or \"Her Honor\" while in office.\n\n* Also see [[List of United States cities by population]]\n\n==Multi-tier local government==\nIn several countries, where there is not local [[autonomy]], mayors are often appointed by some branch of the national or regional government. In some cities, subdivisions such as [[borough]]s may have their own mayors; this is the case, for example, with the [[arrondissement]]s of Paris, [[Montreal]], and [[Mexico City]]. In Belgium, the capital, [[Brussels]], is administratively one of the federation's three regions, and is the only city subdivided, without the other regions' provincial level, into 19 rather small municipalities, which each have an elected\u2014formally appointed\u2014Burgomaster (i.e., Mayor, responsible to his / her elected council); while [[Antwerp]], the other major metropolitan area, has one large city (where the boroughs, former municipalities merged into it, elect a lower level, albeit with very limited competence) and several smaller surrounding municipalities, each under a normal Burgomaster as in Brussels.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, the Mayor (\u5e02\u9577) may be the administrative head of any municipality, provincial, prefecture-level, or county-level. The Mayor is usually the most recognized official in cities, although the position is the second-highest-ranking official in charge after the local Communist Party Secretary. In principle, the Mayor (who also serves as the Deputy Communist Party Secretary of the city) is responsible for managing the city administration while the Communist Party Secretary is responsible for general policy and managing the party bureaucracy, but in practice the roles blur, frequently causing conflict.\n\n==Acting mayor==\n'''Acting mayor''' is a temporary office created by the charter of some [[municipal]] governments.\n\nIn many cities and towns, the charter or some similar fundamental document provides that in the event of the death, illness, resignation, or removal from office of the [[incumbent]] mayor, another official will lead the municipality for a temporary period, which, depending on the jurisdiction, may be for a stated period of days or months until a [[special election]] can be held, or until the original end of the term to which the vacating mayor was elected.\n\nSome cities may also provide for a [[deputy mayor]] to be temporarily designated as \"acting mayor\" in the event that the incumbent mayor is temporarily unavailable, such as for health reasons or out-of-town travel, but still continues to hold the position and is expected to return to the duties of the office. In this latter capacity, the acting mayor's role is to ensure that city government business can continue in the regular mayor's absence, and the acting mayor is not deemed to have actually held the office of mayor.\n\nThe position of acting mayor is usually of considerably more importance in a [[mayor-council]] form of municipal government, where the mayor performs functions of day-to-day leadership, than it is in a [[council-manager]] form of government, where the [[city manager]] provides day-to-day leadership and the position of mayor is either a largely or entirely ceremonial one.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the mayor's successor is not considered to be an acting mayor but rather fully mayor in his or her own right, much in the manner that the [[Vice President of the United States]] is not styled or considered to be [[Acting President of the United States|Acting President]] following the death or resignation of the [[President of the United States|President]], but rather President in every sense.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lists of mayors by country]]\n* [[Deputy mayor]]\n* [[Governor]]\n\n'''Concepts:'''\n* [[Acting (law)]]\n* [[Burgomaster]]\n* [[Sarpanch]]\n* [[World Mayor]]\n\n'''Local government:'''\n* [[Seat of local government]]\n* [[Council-manager government]]\n* [[Mayor-council government]]\n\n;Historical\n* [[Schulthei\u00df]]\n* [[Urban prefect]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* A.

Depending on the system chosen, a mayor may be the chief executive officer of the municipal government, may simply chair a multi-member governing body with little or no independent power, or may play a solely ceremonial role. Options for selection of a mayor include direct election by the public, or selection by an elected governing council or board.\n\n==History==\n\n===British Isles===\n{{anchor|England|Scotland|Wales}}{{See also|Mayors in England|Mayors in Wales}}\nIn modern [[England]] and [[Wales]], the position of mayor descends from the feudal lord's [[bailiff]] or [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] (''see [[borough]]''). The [[chief magistrate]] of [[London]] bore the title of [[portreeve]] for considerably more than a century after the [[Norman Conquest]]. This official was elected by popular choice, a privilege secured from [[John, King of England|King John]]. By the beginning of the 12th century, the title of portreeve gave way to that of mayor as the designation of the chief officer of London, followed around 1190 by that of [[Winchester]]. Other boroughs adopted the title later.\n\nIn the 19th century, in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1882]], Section 15, regulated the election of mayors. The mayor was to be a fit person elected annually on 9&nbsp;November by the council of the borough from among the aldermen or councillors or persons qualified to be such. His term of office was one year, but he was eligible for re-election. He might appoint a deputy to act during illness or absence, and such deputy must be either an alderman or councillor. A mayor who was absent from the borough for more than two months became disqualified and had to vacate his office. A mayor was ''ex officio'' a [[justice of the peace]] for the borough during his year of office and the following year. He received such remuneration as the council thought reasonable. These provisions have now been repealed.\n\nIn medieval Wales, the [[Laws of Hywel Dda]] codified the [[maer (office)|mayor]] ([[Medieval Latin|Latin]]: ''{{lang|la|maior}}''; [[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''{{lang|cy|maer}}'') as a position at the [[Welsh kingdoms|royal courts]] charged with administering the serfs of the [[demesne|king's lands]]. To maintain its dependence on and loyalty to the Crown, the position was forbidden to the leaders of the clan groups.<ref name=HyDda>[[Wade-Evans, Arthur]]. \nPage:Welsh Medieval Law.djvu/447|Welsh Medieval Law]]''. Oxford Univ., 1909. Accessed 1 Feb 2013.</ref> A separate mayor, known as the \"cow dung mayor\"<!--seriously. see source.--> (''maer biswail''), was charged with overseeing the royal cattle.<ref name=HyDda/> There were similar offices at the Scottish and Irish courts.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe office of [[mayors and provosts in the United Kingdom|mayor]] in most modern English and Welsh boroughs and towns did not in the 20th century entail any important administrative duties, and was generally regarded as an honour conferred for local distinction, long service on the council, or for past services. The mayor was expected to devote much of his (or her) time to civic, ceremonial, and representational functions, and to preside over meetings for the advancement of the public welfare. His or her administrative duties were to act as returning officer at parliamentary elections, and as chairman of the meetings of the council.\n\nHowever, since [[Local Government Act 2000|reforms]] introduced in 2000, fourteen English local authorities have [[Elected mayors in the United Kingdom|directly elected mayors]] who combine the \"civic\" mayor role with that of [[leader of the council]] and have significantly greater powers than either. The mayor of a [[town council]] is officially known as \"town mayor\" (although in popular parlance, the word \"town\" is often dropped). Women mayors are also known as \"mayor\"; the wife of a mayor is sometimes known as the \"mayoress\". Mayors are not appointed to district councils which do not have [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]]. Their place is taken by the chairman of council, who undertakes exactly the same functions and is, like a mayor, the civic head of the district concerned.\n\nIn [[Scotland]] the post holders are known as convenors, [[provost (civil)|provost]]s, or lord provosts depending on the local authority.\n\n===Continental Europe===\n{{main|Mayor of the Palace|podest\u00e0}}\nThe original [[Franks|Frankish]] mayors or majordomos were {{ndash}} like the Welsh ''meiri'' {{ndash}} lords commanding the king's lands around the [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] courts in [[Austrasia]], [[kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]], and [[Neustria]]. The mayorship of Paris eventually became hereditary in the [[Pippinids]], who later established the [[Carolingian dynasty]].\n\nIn modern [[France]], since the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], a mayor (''maire'') and a number of mayoral adjuncts (''adjoints au maire'') are selected by the municipal council from among their number. Most of the administrative work is left in their hands, with the full council meeting comparatively infrequently. The model was copied throughout Europe in Britain's mayors, Italy's [[sindaco]]s, most of the German states' [[burgomaster]]s, and Portugal's [[President of the Municipal Chamber|presidents of the municipal chambers]].\n\nIn [[Medieval Italy]], the [[Italian city-states|city-states]] who did not consider themselves independent principalities or dukedoms {{ndash}} particularly those of the Imperial [[Ghibelline]] faction {{ndash}} were led by [[podest\u00e0]]s.\n\nThe [[Greece|Greek]] equivalent of a mayor is the [[demarch]] ({{lang-el|\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2|3=[[archon]] of the [[deme]]}}).\n\n====Scandinavia====\nIn [[Denmark]] all [[Municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]] are led by a political official called ''[[Burgomaster|borgmester]]'', \"mayor\". The mayor of [[Copenhagen]] is however called ''[[List of mayors of Copenhagen|overborgmester]]'' \"superior mayor\". In that city other mayors, ''borgmestre'' (plural), are subordinate to him with different undertakings, like ministers to a prime minister. In other municipalities in Denmark there is only a single mayor.\n\nIn [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] the mayoral title ''borgermester/borgm\u00e4stare'' has now been abolished. Norway abolished it in 1937 as a title of the non-political top manager of (city) municipalities and replaced it with the title ''r\u00e5dmann'' (\"[[alderman]]\" or \"[[magistrate]]\"), which is still in use when referring to the top managers of the [[municipalities of Norway]]. The top ''elected'' official of the municipalities of Norway, on the other hand, has the title ''ordf\u00f8rer'', which actually means \"word-bearer\", i.e. \"chairman\" or \"president\", an equivalent to the Swedish word ''[[:wikt:ordf\u00f6rande|ordf\u00f6rande]]''.\n\nIn [[Sweden]] ''borgm\u00e4stare'' was a title of the senior judge of the courts of the cities, courts which were called ''r\u00e5dhusr\u00e4tt'', literally \"town hall court\", somewhat of an equivalent to an English [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]. These courts were abolished in 1971. Until 1965 these mayor judges on historical grounds also performed administrative functions in the \"board of magistrates\", in Swedish known collegially{{clarify|date=April 2017}} as ''magistrat''. Until 1965 there were also municipal mayors (''kommunalborgm\u00e4stare''), who had these non-political administrative roles in smaller cities without a magistrates' court or ''magistrat''. This office was an invention of the 20th century as the smaller cities in Sweden during the first half of the 20th century subsequently lost their own courts and magistrates.\n\nIn the 16th century in Sweden, king [[Gustav Vasa]] considerably centralised government and appointed the mayors directly. In 1693 king [[Charles XI]] accepted a compromise after repeated petitions from the Estate of the Burgesses over decades against the royal mayor appointments. The compromise was that the burgesses in a city could normally nominate a mayor under the supervision of the local governor. The nominee was then to be presented to and appointed by the king, but the king could appoint mayors directly in exceptional cases. This was codified in the [[Instrument of Government]] of 1720 and on 8 July the same year [[Privy Council of Sweden|Riksr\u00e5det (\"the Council of the Realm\")]] decided, after a petition from the said Estate, that only the city could present nominees, not the king or anyone else. Thus the supervision of the local governor and directly appointed mayors by the king ceased after 1720 (the so-called [[Age of Liberty]]). On 16 October 1723, it was decided after a petition that the city should present three nominees, of whom the king (or the Council of the Realm) appointed one.<ref name=NF>[http://runeberg.org/nfbc/0637.html The article ''Borgm\u00e4stare'' (in Swedish)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605184600/http://runeberg.org/nfbc/0637.html |date=2013-06-05 }} in [[Nordisk Familjebok]].</ref> This was kept as a rule from then on in all later regulations<ref name=NF/> and was also kept as a tradition in the [[Instrument of Government (1809)|1809 Instrument of Government]] ([http://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/Regeringsform_1809#.C2.A731. \u00a7 31]) until 1965.\n\nIn [[Finland]], there are two mayors, in [[Tampere]] and [[Pirkkala]]. Usually in Finland the highest executive official is not democratically elected, but is appointed to a public office by the city council, and is called simply ''kaupunginjohtaja'' \"city manager\" or ''kunnanjohtaja'' \"municipal manager\", depending on whether the municipality defines itself as a city. The term ''pormestari'' \"mayor\", from Swedish ''borgm\u00e4stare'' confusingly on historical grounds has referred to the highest official in the registry office and in the city courts (abolished in 1993) as in Sweden, not the city manager. In addition, ''pormestari'' is also an honorary title, which may be given for distinguished service in the post of the city manager. The city manager of Helsinki is called ''ylipormestari'', which translates to \"Chief Mayor\", for historical reasons. Furthermore, the term \"city manager\" may be seen translated as \"mayor\".\n\n==Artificial intelligence mayors==\n{{See also|Government by algorithm}}\nIn 2018, an activist named [https://icobench.com/u/michihito Michihito Matsuda] ran for mayor in the [[Tama, Tokyo|Tama city area of Tokyo]] as a human proxy for an [[artificial intelligence]] program.<ref>{{cite web |title=POLITICS 2028: WHY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL REPLACE POLITICIANS b\u2026 |url=https://www.slideshare.net/MichihitoMatsuda/politics-2028-why-artificial-intelligence-will-replace-politicians-by-michihito-matsuda |website=SlideShare |accessdate=22 September 2019 |date=14 July 2018}}</ref> While election  posters and campaign material used the term 'robot', and displayed [[stock images]] of a feminine [[Android (robot)|android]], the 'AI mayor' was in fact a [[machine learning algorithm]] trained using Tama city datasets.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnston |first1=Lachlan |title=There's an AI Running for the Mayoral Role of Tama City, Tokyo |url=https://www.otaquest.com/tama-city-ai-mayor/ |website=OTAQUEST |accessdate=22 September 2019 |date=12 April 2018}}</ref> The project was backed by high-profile executives Tetsuzo Matsumoto of [[Softbank]] and Norio Murakami of [[Google]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ai-mayor.com/|title=AI\u515a &#124; \u591a\u6469\u5e02\u8b70\u4f1a\u8b70\u54e1\u9078\u63192019|website=AI\u515a &#124; \u591a\u6469\u5e02\u8b70\u4f1a\u8b70\u54e1\u9078\u63192019}}</ref> Michihito Matsuda came third in the election, being defeated by [[Hiroyuki Abe (politician)|Hiroyuki Abe]].<ref>[https://www.rt.com/news/424402-robot-mayor-japan-tama/ Robot's mayoral race: AI candidate gets thousands of votes in Japanese city]</ref> Organisers claimed that the 'AI mayor' was programmed to analyze [[Online petition|citizen petitions]] put forward to the [[city council]] in a more 'fair and balanced' way than human politicians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/robot-run-mayor-japan-world-12377782|title=Robot to run for mayor in Japan promising 'fairness and balance' for all|first1=Abigail|last1=O'Leary|first2=Anna|last2=Verdon|date=April 17, 2018|website=mirror}}</ref>\n\n==Mayors by country==\n===Australia===<!-- This section is linked from [[Albury, New South Wales]] -->\nOn Australian councils, the mayor is generally the member of the council who acts as ceremonial figurehead at official functions, as well as carrying the authority of council between meetings. Mayoral decisions made between meetings are subject to council and may be confirmed or repealed if necessary. Mayors in Australia may be elected either directly through a ballot for the position of mayor at a local-government election, or alternatively may be elected from within the council at a meeting.\n\nThe civic regalia and insignia of local government have basically remained unaltered for centuries. For ceremonial occasions a mayor may wear robes, a [[Livery collar|mayoral chain]] and a [[Ceremonial mace|mace]]. Mayors have the title of ''''[[Worship (style)|His/Her Worship]]'''' whilst holding the position.\n\nIn councils where [[councillors]] are elected representing political parties, the mayor is normally the leader of the party receiving the most seats on council. In [[Queensland]], the [[lord mayor]] and mayors are elected by popular vote at the general council election.\n\n===Brazil===\nEvery municipality in Brazil elects a mayor (Portuguese: ''prefeito''/''prefeita''), for a four-year term, acting as an executive officer with the city council (Portuguese: ''C\u00e2mara Municipal'') functioning with legislative powers. The mayor can be re-elected and manage the city for two consecutive terms.\n\nThe Brazilian system works similarly to the [[mayor-council government]] in the United States.\n\n===Canada===\nThe chief executives of [[borough#Canada|boroughs]] (''[[Arrondissement#Quebec|arrondissements]]'') in [[Quebec]] are termed mayors (''maires/mairesses'' in French). A borough mayor simultaneously serves as head of the borough council and as a regular councillor on the main city council.\n\nAs is the practice in most Commonwealth countries, in Canada a mayor is addressed as His/Her Worship while holding office.\n\nIn some small [[township (Canada)|townships]] in [[Ontario]], the title '''reeve''' was historically used instead of mayor. In some other municipalities, \"mayor\" and \"reeve\" were two separate offices, with the mayor retaining leadership powers while the reeve was equivalent to what other municipalities called an \"[[at-large]] councillor\". While most municipalities in the province now designate their elected municipal government heads as mayors, in certain areas of the province, the elected head of the municipality continues to be referred to as reeve, and the second-in-command is referred to as the deputy reeve. For example, this continues to be the case in the municipalities of [[Algonquin Highlands]], [[Dysart et al]], [[Highlands East]], and [[Minden Hills]], all located within [[Haliburton County]], as well as [[Beckwith, Ontario|Beckwith Township]], [[Lanark Highlands]], [[Drummond/North Elmsley | Drummond/North Elmsley Township]], [[Tay Valley | Tay Valley Township]], and [[Montague, Ontario|Montague Township]], all located within [[Lanark County]].\n\nMany municipalities in Alberta continue to use the title reeve to denote the office of mayor or chief elected official in accordance with the Municipal Government Act.\n\nIn rural municipalities (RM) in the provinces of [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]], the elected head of the RM is still referred to as a \"reeve\", as are the heads of most counties and district municipalities (DMs) in Alberta.\n\nThe scheduling of municipal elections in Canada varies by jurisdiction, as each province and territory has its own laws regarding municipal governance. See also [[municipal elections in Canada]].\n\n===Dominican Republic===\nThe mayor of a municipality in the [[Dominican Republic]] is called indistinctly ''alcalde'' or ''s\u00edndico''. The latter name is preferred as to avoid confusing the title with the similarly sounding ''alcaide'' (''lit. [[prison warden]]''). Such person is the governor of the municipality whose township elected him (or her) by [[direct vote]] for a term of four years. The mayor's office daily duties are restricted to the local governance, and as such, it is responsible for the coordination of [[waste collection]], [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|upkeep]] of [[public spaces]] (parks, undeveloped urban parcels, streets, city ornate, traffic light control, sewage and most public utilities). In practice most of it duties are centered in light street repairing (new or big road projects, like overpasses, bridges, pedestrian crossings, etc. are handled by the Public Works Ministry (''Ministerio de Obras P\u00fablicas'' in Spanish) office), under the direct control of the Central Government. Subcontracting [[Waste collection|garbage collection]] and management, overseeing the use of public spaces and arbitring neighborhood land ''use'' disputes which is managed by the National Property office (''Oficina de Bienes Nacionales'' in Spanish) is also controlled by the mayor's office. Water, electrical supply and public transportation coordination are handled by several Central Government's offices, and as such, are not under control of the mayor.\n\n===France===\n{{details|Mayor (France)}}\nMayors (''maires'') in France are elected every six years in [[Elections in france#Municipal|local elections]].\n\n===Germany===\nIn Germany local government is regulated by [[states of Germany|state]] statutes. Nowadays only the mayors of the three city-states (Berlin, Hamburg and [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]]) are still elected by the respective city-state parliaments. In all the other states the mayors are now elected directly by the [[EU citizen]]s living in that area. The post of mayor may be said to be a professional one, the mayor being the head of the local government, and requiring, in order to be eligible, a training in administration. In big cities (details are regulated by state statutes) the official title is ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'' ([[lord mayor]]). In these cities a \"simple\" mayor is just a deputy responsible for a distinct task (e.g., welfare or construction works). Big cities are usually ''[[Kreisfreie Stadt|kreisfrei]]'' (\"free of district\"). That means that the city council also has the powers and duties of a rural district council. The leader of a rural district council is called ''Landrat'' (\"land counsellor\"). In that case the chief mayor has also the duties and powers of a ''Landrat''. The term ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'' is not used in the three city-states, where the mayors are simultaneously [[minister-president|head of state governments]], but ''Regierender B\u00fcrgermeister'' ([[Governing Mayor of Berlin]]), ''Erster B\u00fcrgermeister'' ([[First Mayor of the city-state of Hamburg]]) and ''Pr\u00e4sident des Senats und B\u00fcrgermeister'' ([[Mayor of Bremen|President of the Senate and Mayor of Bremen]]) are used.\n\n===Greece===\nMayors (\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9, ''d\u0113marchoi'', sing. \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, ''[[demarchos|d\u0113marchos]]'') in [[Greece]] were previously elected every four years in [[Elections in Greece#Local elections|local elections]] and are the head of various municipal governments in which the state is divided. Starting from 2014, mayors are elected for a five-year term. Local administration elections for the new, consolidated municipalities and peripheries will henceforth be held together with the [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].\n\nLocal administration in Greece recently underwent extensive reform in two phases: the first phase, implemented in 1997 and commonly called the \"[[Kapodistrias Plan]]\", consolidated the country's numerous municipalities and communities down to approximately 1000. The second phase, initially called \"Kapodistrias II\" but eventually called the \"[[Kallikratis Plan]]\", was implemented in 2010, further consolidated municipalities down to 370, and merged the country's 54 prefectures were disbanded in favour of the larger 13 regions. The Kallikratian municipalities were designed according to several guidelines; for example each island (except [[Crete]]) was incorporated into a single municipality, while the majority of small towns were consolidated so as to have an average municipal population of 25,000.\n\n=== India ===\nIn [[India]], the mayor is leader of the council and has a number of roles, both legislative and functional. The legislative requirements are outlined in Section 73 and 73AA of Local Government Act 1989. In most Indian states mayors are elected indirectly among the council members themselves except in eight states [[Bihar]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Haryana]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Odisha]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Uttarakhand]]; where mayors are elected directly by the public.\n\n===Indonesia===\nIn [[Indonesia]], mayor ({{lang-id|wali kota}}, formerly called ''walikotamadya'' and ''walikota'') is a regional head of a city or town. A mayor has the same level as a [[regent]] ({{lang-id|bupati}}), head of a regency ({{lang-id|kabupaten}}). Basically, a mayor has duties and authority to lead the implementation of the policies established by the region along with the city council ({{lang-id|Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Kota}}, DPRD Kota; formerly called Tier 2-DPRD (''DPRD tingkat II'')). A mayor is elected in a pair with a vice mayor through direct elections and is a political office, except in Jakarta. There, mayoralty is a civil-service career position with limited authority and is designated by the [[Governor of Jakarta]]. Their region are called [[Jakarta#Administrative divisions|administration cities]] ({{lang-id|kota administrasi}}).\n\nBefore 1999, there were administrative cities ({{lang-id|kota administratif}}, [[:id:Kota administratif|id]]) which were headed by administrative mayors.\n\n===Iran===\nIn [[Iran]], the mayor is the executive manager of a city and elected by the Islamic City Council. The mayor is elected for a four-year term.\n\n===Ireland===\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], the head of a borough corporation was called \"mayor\" from the [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840]] until boroughs were abolished by the [[Local Government Reform Act 2014]]. The [[Local Government Act 2001]] allowed [[Counties of Ireland|county]] councils to style their chairperson as \"mayor\" and most do so. [[City status in Ireland|City]] council chairs are \"mayor\" (or \"lord mayor\" in the cases [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|of Dublin]] and [[Lord Mayor of Cork|of Cork]]). Since 2000 [[Proposed directly elected mayor for the Dublin Metropolitan Area|there have been proposals]] for a directly elected mayor of the [[Dublin Metropolitan Area]].\n\n===Italy===\nIn Italy the mayor is called ''sindaco'', or informally ''primo cittadino'' (\"first citizen\"). Every municipality ({{lang-it|Comune}}) has its mayor who represents the local government. The mayor is elected every five years by the inhabitants of the municipality, but he cannot be re-elected after two terms.<ref>{{in lang|it}} [https://www.academia.edu/11358245/Del_terzo_mandato_dei_sindaci {{lang|it|No ai tre mandati dei sindaci. Principio di legalit\u00e0 batte disobbedienti}}].</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nJapan's [[Local Autonomy Law|Local-Autonomy Law]] of 1947 defines the structure of Japanese local governments, which were strengthened after World War II. It gives strong executive power to the mayor in the local politics like [[mayor-council government#Executive or Strong Mayor Form|strong mayors]] in large cities in the United States of America.\nThe titles that are translated as \"mayor\" by the governments are those of the heads of [[cities of Japan|cities]] {{Nihongo||\u5e02\u9577|shich\u014d}}, [[towns of Japan|towns]] {{Nihongo||\u753a\u9577|ch\u014dch\u014d}}, [[villages of Japan|villages]] {{Nihongo||\u6751\u9577|sonch\u014d}}, and Tokyo's [[special wards of Tokyo|special wards]] {{Nihongo||\u533a\u9577|kuch\u014d}}.\n(The head of the [[Tokyo|Tokyo prefecture]] is the {{Nihongo|Governor|\u77e5\u4e8b|Chiji}}.)\nA mayor is elected every four years by direct popular votes held separately from the assembly. A mayor can be [[recall election|recalled]] by a popular initiative but the [[prefectures of Japan|prefectural]] and the national governments cannot remove a mayor from office. Towards the assembly the mayor prepares budgets, proposes local [[Act of Parliament|acts]] and has vetoes on local acts just approved by the assembly which can be overridden by two-thirds assembly support. A mayor can dissolve the assembly if the assembly passes a [[motion of no confidence]] or if the mayor thinks the assembly has no confidence in fact.\n\n===Kazakhstan===\nIn Kazakhstan, the mayor is called [[Akim]] who is the head of an akimat, a municipal, district, or provincial government (mayorat), and serves as the Presidential representative. Akims of provinces and cities are appointed to the post by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. Meanwhile, the akims of other administrative and territorial units are appointed or selected to the post in an order defined by the President. He may also dismiss akims from their posts. Powers of akims ends with the introduction into the post of new-elected president of the republic. Thus, the akim continues to fulfill the duties before appointment of corresponding akim by the President of Kazakhstan.\n\n===Malaysia===\n{{See also|Mayor of Kuala Lumpur|Mayor of Penang Island}}\nThe mayor functions as the head of the local government of the cities in Malaysia. To date, there are [[List of cities in Malaysia#Cities of Malaysia|14 officially-recognised cities in the country]].\n\nIn cities which lie within the jurisdiction of any one of the [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|13 Malaysian states]], the mayor is appointed by the state government.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/10/24/elect-local-leaders|title=Elect local leaders|website=www.thesundaily.my|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617165044/http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/10/24/elect-local-leaders|archive-date=2018-06-17|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Kuala Lumpur]], the country's capital, is a notable exception, as it forms part of the [[Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Federal Territories]] which come under the purview of the [[Government of Malaysia|Malaysian federal government]], via the [[Ministry of Federal Territories (Malaysia)|Ministry of Federal Territories]].

The members of the Local Councils are directly elected and collectively serve as a basic form of local government.\n\n===Moldova===\nThe Mayor of the municipality in Moldova is elected for four years. In [[Chi\u015fin\u0103u]], the last mayor elections had to be repeated three times, because of the low rate of participation.\n\n===Netherlands===\n{{Main|Burgemeester}}\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the mayor (in {{lang-nl|burgemeester}}) is the leader of the municipal executives ('[[College van Burgemeester en Wethouders]]'). In the Netherlands, burgermeesters are ''de facto'' appointed by the national [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|cabinet]], ''de jure'' by the [[Dutch Monarchy|monarch]]. They preside both the municipal executive and the legislative ('[[gemeenteraad]]'). The title is sometimes translated as [[burgomaster]], to emphasize the appointed, rather than elected, nature of the office. The appointment procedure was brought for discussion in the early 2000s (decade), as some of the political parties represented in parliament regarded the procedure as undemocratic. Generally, mayors in the Netherlands are selected from the established political parties. Alternatives proposed were direct election of the mayor by the people or appointment by the city council (''gemeenteraad''). A constitutional change to allow for this failed to pass the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] in March 2005, but succeeded in 2018.\n\n===Nepal===\n{{main|List of Mayors of Nepal}}\nMayors in Nepal are elected every Five years in the [[Elections in Nepal|Local elections]]. They are very powerful in Municipal Government .\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|Mayors in New Zealand}}\n\nMayors in New Zealand are elected every three years in the [[Elections in New Zealand|local body elections]].\n\n===Pakistan===\nIn [[Pakistan]], a city is headed by the [[Districts of Pakistan|District]] [[Nazim]] (the word means \"supervisor\" in Urdu, but is sometimes translated as Mayor) and assisted by [[Naib Nazim]] who is also speaker of District Council. District Nazim is elected by the nazims of [[Union councils of Pakistan|union councils]], union councillors and by [[tehsil]] nazims, who themselves are elected directly by the votes of the local public. Council elections are held every four years.\n\n===Philippines===\nIn the [[Philippines]], mayors ({{lang-tl|Punong Bayan / Punong Lungsod}}) are the head of a [[List of cities and municipalities in the Philippines|municipality or a city]], with the vice mayor as the second highest position in the city. They are elected every three years during the midterm and national elections, and they can serve until three terms of office. As of \u2013 September 2012, there are 1,635 mayors in the Philippines.\n\n===Poland===\nMayors in [[Poland]] are [[direct election|directly elected]] by inhabitants of their respective [[municipality]]. A mayor is the sole chief of the [[executive branch]] of the municipality and he/she cannot serve in the municipal council ([[city council]]) or in the [[parliament]]. Mayors may appoint a deputy mayor if needed. In Poland mayor is called a ''burmistrz'' or, in towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants or other municipalities that traditionally use the title, ''prezydent'' (\"president\", for example \"President of [[Warsaw]]\" instead of \"Mayor of Warsaw\"). The equivalent title in a rural community (\"[[gmina]]\") is \"[[w\u00f3jt]]\".\n\nA mayor is elected for a five-year term concurrently with the five-year term of the municipal council, and his/her service is terminated at the end of the municipal council's term. Mayors cannot be dismissed by the municipal council, but they can be removed from the office by the citizens of their municipality in a [[referendum]]. Mayors can also be dismissed by the [[Prime Minister]] in case of persistent transgression of the law. Citizens having a criminal record cannot run for mayor, but only if sentenced for intentional criminal offence prosecuted [[ex officio]].\n\nMayors manage the municipal estate, issues minor regulations, and incurs [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] within limits set by the municipal council. Mayors present a budget to the municipal council, that may be then amended by the council. After the municipal council passes the budget in a form of resolution, the mayor is responsible for its realization. Mayors are the head of the [[town hall]] and the [[register office]] (he/she may appoint deputies for these specific tasks). Mayors legally act as employers for all of the officials of the town hall. Mayors in Poland have wide administrative authority: the only official that he/she cannot appoint or dismiss is a [[city treasurer]], who is appointed by a city council. Although mayors in Poland do not have veto power over city council resolutions, their position is relatively strong and should be classified as a [[mayor-council government]].\n\n===Portugal===\nIn [[Portugal]] and many other Portuguese-speaking countries the mayor of a municipality is called the ''Presidente da C\u00e2mara Municipal'' ([[President of the Municipal Chamber]]).\n\n===Romania===\nIn [[Romania]] the mayor of a commune, town or city is called ''primar''. He or she is elected for a period of four years. In carrying out his responsibilities he is assisted by an elected local council (''consiliu local''). [[Bucharest]] has a general mayor (''primar general'') and six sector mayors (''primar de sector''), one for each [[Sectors of Bucharest|sector]]. The responsibilities of the mayor and of the local council are defined by Law 215/2001 of the Romanian Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legislatie.resurse-pentru-democratie.org/legea/215-2001.php|title=Legea nr. 215/2001|author=APD-Timisoara|work=resurse-pentru-democratie.org|access-date=2014-12-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104170314/http://legislatie.resurse-pentru-democratie.org/legea/215-2001.php|archive-date=2014-11-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Russia===\nIn Russia, the '''\u041c\u044d\u0440''', from [[France language|fr]] '''Maire''' ([[English language|en]] transcription = ''Mer'' \u2013 not to be confused with the NATO [[OF-3]] rank ''\u041c\u0430\u0439\u043e\u0440'' \u2013 en: ''[[Major]]''), is one of possible titles of the head of the administration of a city or municipality.  This title is equivalent to that of the head of a Russian rural district. Exceptionally, the ''mer'' of [[Moscow]], [[Saint-Petersburg]] and [[Sevastopol]] are equivalent to governors in Russia, since these three federal cities are Russian federal subjects.\n\nExcept for those just-named three large cities, the governance system of a Russian municipality (city, county, district or town) is subordinate to the representative council of the federation in which it is located. The ''mer'', is either directly elected in municipal elections (citywide referendum) or is elected by the members of the municipality's representative council. Election by council members is now more widespread because it better integrates with the Russian federal three-level vertical governance structure:\n#National government: \n##President (executive) \n##[[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Federal Assembly]]\n#Federation governments: \n##Heads of federation (commonly governors)\n##Regional representative councils\n#Local governments: \n##Heads of administration (who have the official title of ''mer'', whether or not local law defines it as such)\n##Local representative councils\n\nThe typical term of office of a ''mer'' in Russia is four years. The ''mer's'' office administers all municipal services, public property, police and fire protection, and most public agencies, and enforces all local and state laws within a city or town.\n\nAccording to Medialogy,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlg.ru/ratings/mayors/2949/6/2014/4/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222162625/http://www.mlg.ru/ratings/mayors/2949/6/2014/4/ |archivedate=2015-12-22 }}</ref> the ''mer'' of [[Novosibirsk]], Edward Lokot', is mentioned in the media more than any other Russian mayor.

He or she acts on behalf of the city, and performs an executive function. The position of the mayor of [[Belgrade]] is important as the capital city is the most important hub of economics, culture and science in [[Serbia]]. Furthermore, the post of the mayor of Belgrade is the third most important position in the government after the [[Prime Minister of Serbia|Prime Minister]] and [[President of Serbia|President]].\n\n===Spain and Hispanic America===\n''[[Alcalde]]'' is the most common Spanish term for the mayor of a town or city. It is derived from the {{lang-ar|[[Qadi|al-qa\u1e0di]]|script=Latn}} ({{lang|ar|\u0642\u0627\u0636\u064a|rtl=yes}}), i.e., \"the ([[Sharia]]) judge,\" who often had administrative, as well as judicial, functions. Although the [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] ''alcalde'' and the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] ''qa\u1e0di'' had slightly different attributes (the ''qa\u1e0di'' oversaw an entire province, the ''alcalde'' only a municipality; the former was appointed by the ruler of the state but the latter was elected by the [[Cabildo (council)|municipal council]]), the adoption of this term reflects how much Muslim society in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] influenced the Christian one in the early phases of the ''[[Reconquista]]''. As Spanish Christians took over an increasing part of the Peninsula, they adapted the Muslim systems and terminology for their own use.\n\nToday, it refers to the executive head of a municipal or local government, who usually does not have judicial functions. The word ''[[Intendant|intendente]]'' is used in [[Argentina]] and [[Paraguay]] for the office that is analogous to a mayor.\n\nIn [[municipio]]s and larger cities in [[Mexico]], the chief executive is known as both alcalde or as ''presidente municipal'' (\"municipal president\"), with the latter being more widely used.\n\n===Sweden===\nThe Swedish title ''borgm\u00e4stare'' ([[burgomaster]]) was abolished in the court reform of 1971 when also the [[stad (Sweden)|towns of Sweden]] were officially abolished. Since the middle of the 20th century, the [[municipal commissioner]] \u2013 the highest-ranking politician in each municipality \u2013 is informally titled \"mayor\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} in English.\n\n===Switzerland===\nThe function and title for mayor vary from one canton to another. Generally, the mayor presides an executive council of several members governing a [[municipalities of Switzerland|municipality]].\n\nThe title is:\n*in Italian: ''Sindaco'' ([[Ticino]]), Podest\u00e0 ([[Grigioni]])\n*in French: ''Maire'' ([[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]], [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], [[Canton of Bern|Bern]]), ''Syndic'' ([[Vaud]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]]),  ''Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil municipal'' ([[Valais]]), ''Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil communal'' ([[Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel|Neuch\u00e2tel]])\n*in German: e.g. ''Stadtpr\u00e4sident'', ''Stadtammann'', ''Gemeindepr\u00e4sident'', ''Gemeindeammann''\n\n===Taiwan===\nIn the [[Republic of China]] in Taiwan the mayor is the head of city's government and its city's council, which is in charge of legislative affairs. The mayor and city council are elected separately by the city's residents.\n\n===Turkey===\nMayors ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]:''Belediye Ba\u015fkan\u0131'') in Turkey are elected by the municipal council. As a rule, there are municipalities in all province centers and district centers as well as towns ({{lang-tr|belde}}) which are actually villages with a population in excess of 2000. However beginning by 1983, a new level of municipality is introduced in Turkish administrative system. In big cities Metropolitan municipalities ({{lang-tr|B\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fehir belediyesi}}) are established. (See [[Metropolitan municipalities in Turkey]]) In a Metropolitan municipality there may be several  district municipalities (hence mayors).\n\n===Ukraine===\nIn [[Ukraine]] the title \"Head of the city\" (''Misky holova'', unofficially foreign adaptation ''Mer'' also is present) was introduced in 1999. Since than the post is elected by all residents of the city. Before that date the post was elected by members of the city's council only and was known as Head of the city's council which ex oficio also serves as the head of the executive committee. For the cities that carry special status such as [[Kiev]] and [[Sevastopol]], the Head of the city was a matter of long debate and the post is regulated by special laws.\n\nSince 2015 a post of Starosta (\"Elder\") is being implemented at lower level of administrative-territorial pyramid. Candidates to the post are also being elected by members of the territorial community (hromada). The post is historical and existed on the territory of Ukraine during times of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].\n\n===United States===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of mayors of New York City]] -->\n{{Main|Mayoralty in the United States}}\n\nThe mayor is the municipal head of government, the maximum civil authority at the municipal level, in most United States municipalities (such as cities, townships, etc.). In the [[Mayoralty in the United States|United States]], there are several distinct types of mayors, depending on whether the system of local government is [[council-manager government]] or [[mayor-council government]].\n\nUnder the council-manager government system, the mayor is a [[first among equals]] on the [[city council]], which acts as a legislative body while executive functions are performed by the appointed manager. The mayor may chair the city council, but lacks any special legislative powers. The mayor and city council serve part-time, with day-to-day administration in the hands of a professional city manager. The system is most common among medium-sized cities from around 25,000 to several hundred thousand, usually rural and suburban municipalities.\n\nUnder the mayor-council system, the mayoralty and city council are separate offices. This system may be of two types, either a strong mayor system or a weak mayor system. Under the ''strong mayor'' system, the mayor acts as an elected executive with the city council exercising legislative powers. They may select a [[chief administrative officer]] to oversee the different departments. This is the system used in most of the United States' large cities, primarily because mayors serve full-time and have a wide range of services that they oversee. In a ''weak mayor'' or ''ceremonial mayor'' system, the mayor has appointing power for department heads but is subject to checks by the city council, sharing both executive and legislative duties with the council. This is common for smaller cities, especially in [[New England]]. [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] are two notable large cities with a ceremonial mayor.\n\nMany American mayors are styled \"His Honor\" or \"Her Honor\" while in office.\n\n* Also see [[List of United States cities by population]]\n\n==Multi-tier local government==\nIn several countries, where there is not local [[autonomy]], mayors are often appointed by some branch of the national or regional government. In some cities, subdivisions such as [[borough]]s may have their own mayors; this is the case, for example, with the [[arrondissement]]s of Paris, [[Montreal]], and [[Mexico City]]. In Belgium, the capital, [[Brussels]], is administratively one of the federation's three regions, and is the only city subdivided, without the other regions' provincial level, into 19 rather small municipalities, which each have an elected\u2014formally appointed\u2014Burgomaster (i.e., Mayor, responsible to his / her elected council); while [[Antwerp]], the other major metropolitan area, has one large city (where the boroughs, former municipalities merged into it, elect a lower level, albeit with very limited competence) and several smaller surrounding municipalities, each under a normal Burgomaster as in Brussels.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, the Mayor (\u5e02\u9577) may be the administrative head of any municipality, provincial, prefecture-level, or county-level. The Mayor is usually the most recognized official in cities, although the position is the second-highest-ranking official in charge after the local Communist Party Secretary. In principle, the Mayor (who also serves as the Deputy Communist Party Secretary of the city) is responsible for managing the city administration while the Communist Party Secretary is responsible for general policy and managing the party bureaucracy, but in practice the roles blur, frequently causing conflict.\n\n==Acting mayor==\n'''Acting mayor''' is a temporary office created by the charter of some [[municipal]] governments.\n\nIn many cities and towns, the charter or some similar fundamental document provides that in the event of the death, illness, resignation, or removal from office of the [[incumbent]] mayor, another official will lead the municipality for a temporary period, which, depending on the jurisdiction, may be for a stated period of days or months until a [[special election]] can be held, or until the original end of the term to which the vacating mayor was elected.\n\nSome cities may also provide for a [[deputy mayor]] to be temporarily designated as \"acting mayor\" in the event that the incumbent mayor is temporarily unavailable, such as for health reasons or out-of-town travel, but still continues to hold the position and is expected to return to the duties of the office. In this latter capacity, the acting mayor's role is to ensure that city government business can continue in the regular mayor's absence, and the acting mayor is not deemed to have actually held the office of mayor.\n\nThe position of acting mayor is usually of considerably more importance in a [[mayor-council]] form of municipal government, where the mayor performs functions of day-to-day leadership, than it is in a [[council-manager]] form of government, where the [[city manager]] provides day-to-day leadership and the position of mayor is either a largely or entirely ceremonial one.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the mayor's successor is not considered to be an acting mayor but rather fully mayor in his or her own right, much in the manner that the [[Vice President of the United States]] is not styled or considered to be [[Acting President of the United States|Acting President]] following the death or resignation of the [[President of the United States|President]], but rather President in every sense.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lists of mayors by country]]\n* [[Deputy mayor]]\n* [[Governor]]\n\n'''Concepts:'''\n* [[Acting (law)]]\n* [[Burgomaster]]\n* [[Sarpanch]]\n* [[World Mayor]]\n\n'''Local government:'''\n* [[Seat of local government]]\n* [[Council-manager government]]\n* [[Mayor-council government]]\n\n;Historical\n* [[Schulthei\u00df]]\n* [[Urban prefect]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* A.

Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos.\n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

The two were married on September 29, 1886, and had eleven children together. Their first five children died with only five girls and one boy surviving into adulthood: Gladys, Kathryn J., Pauline, Janette, George, and Mary Margaret Harris.<ref name=\"Lounsberry\"/><ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\n== Frontier doctor ==\nBoarman built his first home out of [[lumber]] and lived rough with his only luxuries being a [[Stove#Coal stoves|coal stove]] and [[hurricane lamp]]s he ordered through the local [[general store]].<ref name=\"HDP\"/> As a young doctor traveling the countryside he faced many obstacles including severe weather conditions such as floods and thunderstorms, and especially the [[Upper Midwest#Climate|harsh winters of the Upper Midwest]], as well as poor roads and no telegraph system. Harris made countless house calls and delivered over 3,000 babies in his near 60-year career.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nA member of the Grand Forks District Medical Society and the North Dakota State Medical Society, Harris was well-read on medical and scientific research and had \"comprehensive knowledge of the science of medicine\". In 1888, he was appointed Pembina Health Officer and remained in this position for nearly five decades; he also spent thirty years as a county medical commissioner examining cases of insanity.<ref name=\"Lounsberry\"/>\n\n== Later years ==\nBy the late-1890s, Harris had taken on other interests in addition to medicine. Starting in 1895, he spent twenty-five years as president of the Pembina school board. He owned several farms in Pembina County, which he personally managed, and a large wheat field contributing significantly to his income.<ref name=\"Lounsberry\"/><ref name=\"SOJ\"/> His wife, a devout [[Methodist]], was socially active in the community starting the [[public park]]s in South Pembina and the original Masonic park. In 1905, Harris opened a doctor's office in downtown Pembina. The office itself was twelve feet wide on the southside while a drug store occupied the north end of the building. The old doctor's office exists today as part of Pembina's \"Spot Bar\".<ref name=\"Walker\"/>  In 1911, Harris became president of the Merchants Bank of Pembina and held this post for over 15 years. In addition, he belonged to the [[Ancient Order of United Workmen]], [[Degree of Honor Protective Association|Degree of Honor]], Masons, and the Yeomen.<ref name=\"Lounsberry\"/>\n\nOn September 5, 1936, Charles and Catherine Harris celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.<ref name=\"Lounsberry\"/> The Saturday afternoon event was attended by hundreds of friends and family at the Harris residence. Among the family members were their children Gladys, Kathryn, Pauline, Jeanette, George, and Margaret Harris, as well as seven grandchildren Janet Holmquist, Mary Marcy Schave, Georgia, Mary and Harold Stratte, and Charles and John Wilkins. Charles Harris continued practicing medicine during his final years and was still performing his duties at 80 years old. He died at his home<ref name=\"SOJ\"/> from a heart ailment on January 2, 1942. Harris was the oldest practicing physician in Pembina County at the time of his death.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the ten surviving grandchildren of Charles and Catherine Harris pooled together enough money for a silver level donation to the Pembina Community Center Renovation project in their memory.

He eventually set up his own practice and became the first doctor in the county.<ref name=\"Walker\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pembina.govoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC=%7BFF258D1D-9E8D-42DE-A53C-2C57D082770B%7D |title=Harris Family Remembered |author=Walker, Chuck and Hetty |year=2007 |website=Pembina.govoffice.com |publisher= |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt was in Pembina that Harris met his future wife Catherine Jane Abrams, the daughter of Canadian-born [[land agent]] George Abrams, who was then working as [[register of deeds]] at the town courthouse. The two were married on September 29, 1886, and had eleven children together. Their first five children died with only five girls and one boy surviving into adulthood: Gladys, Kathryn J., Pauline, Janette, George, and Mary Margaret Harris.<ref name=\"Lounsberry\"/><ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\n== Frontier doctor ==\nBoarman built his first home out of [[lumber]] and lived rough with his only luxuries being a [[Stove#Coal stoves|coal stove]] and [[hurricane lamp]]s he ordered though the local [[general store]].<ref name=\"HDP\"/> As a young doctor traveling the countryside he faced many obstacles including severe weather conditions such as floods and thunderstorms, and especially the [[Upper Midwest#Climate|harsh winters of the Upper Midwest]], as well as poor roads and no telegraph system. Harris made countless house calls and delivered over 3,000 babies in his near 60-year career.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nA member of the Grand Forks District Medical Society and the North Dakota State Medical Society, Harris was well-read on medical and scientific research and had \"comprehensive knowledge of the science of medicine\". In 1888, he was appointed Pembina Health Officer and remained in this position for nearly five decades; he also spent thirty years as a county medical commissioner examining cases of insanity.<ref name=\"Lounsberry\"/>\n\n== Later years ==\nBy the late-1890s, Harris had taken on other interests in addition to medicine. Starting in 1895, he spent twenty-five years as president of the Pembina school board. He owned several farms in Pembina County, which he personally managed, and a large wheat field contributing significantly to his income.<ref name=\"Lounsberry\"/><ref name=\"SOJ\"/> His wife, a devout [[Methodist]], was socially active in the community starting the [[public park]]s in South Pembina and the original Masonic park. In 1905, Harris opened a doctor's office in downtown Pembina. The office itself was twelve feet wide on the southside while a drug store occupied the north end of the building. The old doctor's office exists today as part of Pembina's \"Spot Bar\".<ref name=\"Walker\"/>  In 1911, Harris became president of the Merchants Bank of Pembina and held this post for over 15 years. In addition, he belonged to the [[Ancient Order of United Workmen]], [[Degree of Honor Protective Association|Degree of Honor]], Masons, and the Yeomen.<ref name=\"Lounsberry\"/>\n\nOn September 5, 1936, Charles and Catherine Harris celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.<ref name=\"Lounsberry\"/> The Saturday afternoon event was attended by hundreds of friends and family at the Harris residence. Among the family members were their children Gladys, Kathryn, Pauline, Jeanette, George, and Margaret Harris, as well as seven grandchildren Janet Holmquist, Mary Marcy Schave, Georgia, Mary and Harold Stratte, and Charles and John Wilkins. Charles Harris continued practicing medicine during his final years and was still performing his duties at 80 years old. He died at his home<ref name=\"SOJ\"/> from a heart ailment on January 2, 1942. Harris was the oldest practicing physician in Pembina County at the time of his death.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the ten surviving grandchildren of Charles and Catherine Harris pooled together enough money for a silver level donation to the Pembina Community Center Renovation project in their memory. The civic contributions of the Harris' were subsequently recognized by local officials.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite web |url=http://webapp.und.edu/dept/library/Collections/og1210.html |title=Pioneer Doctors |editor=Pembina County Pioneer Daughters |year=1975 |work=Series I: Biographical Sketches of Pioneer Mothers and Fathers |website= |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{cite web |url=http://56755.blogspot.com/2006/05/profile-dr-charles-harris.html |title=Profile: Dr. Charles Harris |author=Lewis, Trish Short |date=May 25, 2006 |website=St. Vincent Memories |publisher= |accessdate=September 12, 2013}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mnrrvn/Essay-Harris-Doctor.html |title=Charles B.

He was the son of Vitor Augusto Nepomuceno and Maria Virginia de Oliveira Paiva. He started studying music with his father, who was a violinist, organist, teacher and chapel-master at the Cathedral of Fortaleza, Brazil. In 1872, he moved with his family to Recife (Brazil), where he started studying piano and violin. Later on, he became one of the most important defenders of the Republican and [[Slavery in Brazil|Abolitionist]] causes in Brazil, being very active in several campaigns over that time period, leading to the overthrow of the Monarchy and creation of the [[First Brazilian Republic]] in 1889. However, he did not stop being a musician, and at the age of eighteen, he became director of the Carlos Gomes Club where all the important music concerts happened in Recife, Brazil.\n[[File:Eliseu Visconti - Retrato do Maestro Alberto Nepomuceno.jpg|thumb|right|290px|\nPortrait of the Maestro Alberto Nepomuceno in 1895, work of [[Eliseu Visconti]]..]]\nIn 1885, he presented for the first time his compositions, a series of songs all in Portuguese, at the Musical National Institute. The main objective of the concert was to oppose those who thought Portuguese was inappropriate for the ''[[bel canto]]''. He was very criticised for doing that and he started a true battle against several newspapers and music critics. His battle for the nationalisation of the classical music was extended by his work at the Popular Concert Association from 1896\u20131906, where he promoted the recognition of several Brazilian Composers.\n\nIn 1888, he was able to leave for Europe to further his musical studies. In Rome he studied with [[Giovanni Sgambati]]. In 1890, he moved to Berlin where he studied composition with [[Heinrich von Herzogenberg]] and continued his piano studies with the famous teacher [[Teodor Leszetycki]] at the [[Stern Conservatory]]. In Lechetitzky's class, he met a Norwegian student whom he married in 1893. She had been a student and friend of [[Edvard Grieg]] and Nepomuceno moved to Bergen after his wedding and lived in Grieg's house. Grieg, of course, was a proponent of nationalism in composition. Nepomuceno's friendship with Grieg was instrumental in convincing him to write music which reflected Brazilian culture. Before leaving Europe he visited Paris where he met such luminaries as [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]] and [[Vincent d'Indy]].\n[[File:Nepomuceno String Quartet N.3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|String Quartet No. 3 by Nepomuceno<ref>[http://musicabrasilis.org.br/partituras/alberto-nepomuceno-quarteto-n-3-brasileiro-em-re-menor String Quartet No. 3], musicabrasilis.org.br</ref>]]\nHe subsequently returned to Brazil where he taught at the Instituto Nacional de M\u00fasica in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Later [[Gustav Mahler]] engaged him to conduct at the Vienna Opera but illness prevented this. He eventually returned to Europe in 1910 for a series of concerts in Brussels, Geneva and Paris. During this trip he became good friends with Debussy. Back in Brazil, he fought for the use of Portuguese in [[opera]] and song and remained the leading musical personality there until his death in Rio, aged 56. [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] was among his many students.\n\nAmong his most important works is his third [[string quartet]], subtitled by him \"Brasileiro\"\u2014the Brazilian. It is dated in his own hand, Berlin 1890. It is probably the first example of integration of Brazilian folk melody within the Central European romantic idiom. Though performed in Brazil on rare occasions from manuscript copy, String Quartet No.&nbsp;3 remained unpublished until 2005.\n\nAmong his other works are the operas ''Abul'' (1905), ''Artemis'' (1898), ''Electra'' (1894) and the unfinished ''O Garatuja'', the Orchestral Pieces (1888), Sinfonia in G minor (1893) and Serenata (1902).\n\n==References==\n<!-- Some of the information on this page appears on the website of Edition Silvertrust but permission has been granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License. -->\n<references />\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{GroveOnline|title=Nepomuceno, Alberto|author=Gerard B\u00e9hague|author-link=Gerard B\u00e9hague|access-date=23 June 2007}}\n*Jo\u00e3o Vidal.

[[Reese's Pieces]] are scattered throughout the world and are represented by dark dots.]]\n\n''E.T.'' is an [[adventure game]] in which players control an alien (E.T.) from a [[top-down perspective]]. The objective of the game is to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect [[Reese's Pieces]], which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes.<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite web | first = Kevin | last = Bowen | url = http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=290 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081010005643/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=290 | archivedate = October 10, 2008 | title = Game of the Week: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial | publisher = Classic Gaming | accessdate = August 18, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliott will come in and revive him.

He envisioned a three-dimensional cube world as the setting and adapted part of the film's plot, E.T. phoning home, as the goal. Warshaw then conceived that E.T. would need to assemble a special phone to call his ship and arrive at a special landing site to achieve this goal. He considered obstacles as an element that would determine the success of a game, and experienced difficulties when taking into account the time constraints and technical limitations of the console. Inspired by the movie, adults were implemented as antagonists that would chase the alien. Feeling more adversity was needed, Warshaw included a time limit for players to accomplish the goal. Pits were devised as an element to hide the pieces of the phone as well as expand the game's world.<ref name=\"gamesTM63\"/>\n\nWarshaw and other Atari executives presented this design to Spielberg, who did not express enthusiasm.<ref name=\"GS-2600Keynote\"/> Spielberg instead asked him to create a game similar to [[Namco]]'s ''[[Pac-Man]]''.<ref name=\"gamesTM63\"/> Believing the concept too derivative of a common game design, Warshaw proceeded with his concept, which he believed would capture the sentimentality he saw in the original film.<ref name=\"AVinterview\"/><ref name=\"GS-2600Keynote\"/> In retrospect, however, Warshaw stated that Spielberg's idea might have had merit.<ref name=\"GS-2600Keynote\"/><ref name=\"gamesTM63\"/> He spent the remaining time programming the game. Atari anticipated enormous sales based on the popularity of the film, as well as the stability the [[video game industry]] was experiencing in 1982. Due to time limitations, Atari decided to skip [[focus test|audience testing]] for the game.<ref name=\"wirt\">Cummings, \"How I Got Here\"</ref> Emanual Gerard, co-chief operating officer of Warner at the time, later suggested that the company had fallen into a false sense of security by the success of its previous releases, particularly [[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|its console version of ''Pac-Man'']], which was commercially successful despite poor critical reaction.<ref name=\"serious\">Pollack, \"The Game Turns Serious at Atari\"</ref><ref name=\"retroign-tas\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:ET2600-Pit.gif|thumb|right|alt=A horizontal rectangle video game screenshot that is a digital representation of the side view of a large hole.

[[Reese's Pieces]] are scattered throughout the world and are represented by dark dots.]]\n\n''E.T.'' is an [[adventure game]] in which players control an alien (E.T.) from a [[top-down perspective]]. The objective of the game is to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect [[Reese's Pieces]], which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes.<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite web | first = Kevin | last = Bowen | url = http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=290 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081010005643/http://classicgaming.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameMuseum.Detail&id=290 | archivedate = October 10, 2008 | title = Game of the Week: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial | publisher = Classic Gaming | accessdate = August 18, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliott will come in and revive him.

Though Warshaw had spent more than a year working on consecutive development schedules for games (seven months working on ''[[Yars' Revenge]]'' and then six months on ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark (video game)|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''), he accepted the offer based on the challenge of completing a game in a short time frame and at Spielberg's request.<ref name=\"rags\"/><ref name=\"gamesTM63\"/> Warshaw considered it an opportunity to develop an innovative Atari 2600 game based on a movie he enjoyed, \"provided we reach the right arrangement\".<ref name=\"gamesTM63\"/><ref name=\"The Crash, at G4\">{{cite episode | title=The Crash | serieslink=Icons (TV series) | series=G4 Icons | season=2 | number=14 | station=[[G4techTV]] | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuHbRPoOEEA | accessdate=August 18, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227090839/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuHbRPoOEEA | archivedate=December 27, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|9:34}} Kassar reportedly offered Warshaw {{USD|200,000}} and an all-expenses-paid vacation to [[Hawaii]] in compensation.<ref name=\"rags\"/> Kassar then told him to arrive at the [[San Jose International Airport|San Jose Airport]] a few days later to have a meeting with Spielberg.<ref name=\"gamesTM63\"/>\n\nWarshaw used those days to design the structure of the game and segmented the concept into four ideas: world, objective, path to achieve the objective, and obstacles. He envisioned a three-dimensional cube world as the setting and adapted part of the film's plot, E.T. phoning home, as the goal. Warshaw then conceived that E.T. would need to assemble a special phone to call his ship and arrive at a special landing site to achieve this goal. He considered obstacles as an element that would determine the success of a game, and experienced difficulties when taking into account the time constraints and technical limitations of the console. Inspired by the movie, adults were implemented as antagonists that would chase the alien. Feeling more adversity was needed, Warshaw included a time limit for players to accomplish the goal. Pits were devised as an element to hide the pieces of the phone as well as expand the game's world.<ref name=\"gamesTM63\"/>\n\nWarshaw and other Atari executives presented this design to Spielberg, who did not express enthusiasm.<ref name=\"GS-2600Keynote\"/> Spielberg instead asked him to create a game similar to [[Namco]]'s ''[[Pac-Man]]''.<ref name=\"gamesTM63\"/> Believing the concept too derivative of a common game design, Warshaw proceeded with his concept, which he believed would capture the sentimentality he saw in the original film.<ref name=\"AVinterview\"/><ref name=\"GS-2600Keynote\"/> In retrospect, however, Warshaw stated that Spielberg's idea might have had merit.<ref name=\"GS-2600Keynote\"/><ref name=\"gamesTM63\"/> He spent the remaining time programming the game. Atari anticipated enormous sales based on the popularity of the film, as well as the stability the [[video game industry]] was experiencing in 1982. Due to time limitations, Atari decided to skip [[focus test|audience testing]] for the game.<ref name=\"wirt\">Cummings, \"How I Got Here\"</ref> Emanual Gerard, co-chief operating officer of Warner at the time, later suggested that the company had fallen into a false sense of security by the success of its previous releases, particularly [[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|its console version of ''Pac-Man'']], which was commercially successful despite poor critical reaction.<ref name=\"serious\">Pollack, \"The Game Turns Serious at Atari\"</ref><ref name=\"retroign-tas\"/>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:ET2600-Pit.gif|thumb|right|alt=A horizontal rectangle video game screenshot that is a digital representation of the side view of a large hole.

This aspect of the game was negatively received by players and critics.]]\n\nAnticipation for ''E.T.'' was high in 1982, and it was a sought-after Christmas gift.<ref name=\"gamesTM63\"/> In early December 1982,  ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that video games based on successful movies, specifically ''E.T.'', would become \"an increasingly profitable source\" for video game development.<ref>New York Times Staff, \"A Squeeze in Video Games\"</ref> At first, retailers ordered more supplies than what was expected to be sold, but Atari received an increasing number of order cancellations as new competitors entered the market, an event the company had not anticipated.<ref name=\"serious\"/><ref name=\"zap\">Cohen, ''Zap! The Rise and Fall of Atari''</ref><ref name=\"NY-Pileggi\">[[Nicholas Pileggi|Pileggi, Nicholas]], \"The Warner Case: Curiouser and Curioser\"</ref> John Hubner and William Kistner of ''[[InfoWorld]]'' attribute the cancellations to changes Atari initiated in its relationship to distributors.

The same day, Alex receives an email that appears to be from Margot, which includes a link to a surveillance video clip that features his late wife looking alive and well. The message warns Alex that they are both being watched. He struggles to stay one step ahead of the law, while henchmen intimidate Alex's friends into telling them whatever they might know about him{{spnd}}the henchmen eventually kill one of them, Charlotte. In the meantime, Alex's sister Anne persuades her well-off wife H\u00e9l\u00e8ne to hire a respected attorney, \u00c9lisabeth Feldman, to handle Alex's case.\n\nIt is gradually revealed that Margot is apparently still alive. She attempts to arrange a meeting with Alex by sending him an email which he must read in an internet cafe to avoid being spied on. Before this meeting, a warrant is issued for Alex's arrest for the murder of Charlotte. He goes on the run whilst his friends and lawyers struggle to find out the truth about the murder, as well as Margot's reappearance. Alex, chased by police officers, is rescued by Bruno, a gangster from a rough part of the city who feels he owes Alex a favor. The mysterious henchmen reappear to prevent Alex's meeting with his wife, but he is rescued once again by Bruno. Margot is seen almost escaping on a flight to [[Buenos Aires]]. Elizabeth, the lawyer, proves that Alex has an alibi for the murder of Charlotte, thanks to eyewitness accounts at the internet cafe.\n\nAlex noted the numerous mysteries about his wife's death{{spnd}}mysterious photos of her covered in bruises and traces of heroin in her body. He soon discovers the truth that Margot's father faked his daughter's death. Margot had discovered that Philippe Neuville, the rich young son of a local aristocrat, was a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] [[Rape|rapist]] whose activities were being hidden because his father had influence over the police; when she confronted him, Philippe beat her up, causing the bruises. Her father explains that he walked in on the beating and shot Philippe. The elder Neuville hired thugs to kill Margot. Margot's father knew this because he tapped the phone call, so he doubled the payout for one of the thugs to fake Margot's murder instead, kill the other thug, and knock out Alex in the process. Margot's father then shot the second thug and buried both, then used the body of a dead heroin addict to stand in for Margot's.\n\nPolice, listening in on the father's confession, attempt to arrest him. Margot's father shoots himself dead before he can be arrested.\n\nIt is revealed that Margot's father knew Alex was wearing a wire, and that during a moment in which he had blocked the bug's transmission he had told Alex one last thing: it was in fact Margot who shot Philippe after he beat her; her father was covering up her crime, not his. His actions have ensured that she will never be suspected.

Finally, Philippe's father is arrested, and Alex and Margot reunite at the lake where they fell in love as children.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet]]: Alexandre Beck\n* [[Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze]]: Margot Beck\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Dussollier]]: Jacques Laurentin\n* [[Kristin Scott Thomas]]: H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Perkins\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and]]: Eric Levkowitch\n* [[Nathalie Baye]]: Ma\u00eetre Elisabeth Feldman\n* [[Jean Rochefort]]: Gilbert Neuville\n* [[Marina Hands]]: Anne Beck\n* [[Gilles Lellouche]]: Bruno\n* [[Philippe Lefebvre (actor)|Philippe Lefebvre]]: Lieutenant Philippe Meynard\n* [[Florence Thomassin]]: Charlotte Bertaud\n* [[Olivier Marchal]]: Bernard Valenti\n* [[Guillaume Canet]]: Philippe Neuville\n* [[Brigitte Catillon]]: Captain Barthas\n* [[Samir Guesmi]]: Lieutenant Saraoui\n* [[Jean-Pierre Lorit]]: Lavelle\n* [[Jalil Lespert]]: Ya\u00ebl Gonzales\n* [[\u00c9ric Savin]]: The prosecutor\n* [[\u00c9ric Naggar]]: Pierre Ferrault\n* [[Philippe Canet]]: Fran\u00e7ois Beck\n* [[Dani\u00e8le Ajoret]]: Madame Beck\n* [[Laurent Lafitte]]: The Basque\n* [[Thierry Neuvic]]: Marc Bertaud\n* [[Mika'ela Fisher]]: Zak\n* [[Anne Marivin]]: Alex's secretary\n* [[Sara Martins]]: Bruno's friend\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Bertin]]: Antoinette Levkowitch\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Damant]]: Simone\n* [[Pierre-Benoist Varoclier]]: Nurse 1\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe script made several alterations to the book; a torture expert changed from an Asian male to a white female, and the identity of the killer was switched.
