His work lay in the King's Household and in the control of the State Affairs of Scotland and he was the King's chief Scottish advisor. With the full backing and trust of [[James I of England|King James]] he travelled regularly from London to Edinburgh via [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]].\n\n==In Scotland==\nHome was the third son of Sir Alexander Home of [[Manderston]], [[Berwickshire]], by his spouse Janet, daughter of George Home of Spott. He was introduced, at the age of 26, to the Court of sixteen-year-old [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] by a relative, [[Alexander Home, 6th Lord Home]]. Establishing himself as a [[favourite]], he was in the retinue which accompanied King [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] to [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] to collect his future Queen. During the trip, James VI made him Keeper of the Royal Wardrobe and sacked Sir [[William Keith of Delny]], who had appeared in richer clothing than himself.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 478.</ref> In 1606, when making him [[Earl of Dunbar]], James VI praised him for his tact and diplomacy in Denmark at this time, his \"high prudence and rare discretion.\" <ref>''HMC 5th Report: M. E. Stirling of Renton'' (London, 1876), p. 648 \"summa prudentia et rara taciturnitas\".</ref>\n\nHe was knighted on 4 November 1590, and known as \"Sir George Home of Primrose Knowe\" and after 1593, \"Sir George Home of Spot\". [[Spott, East Lothian|Spott]] is a village in [[East Lothian]].\n\nIn the 1590s Home presided over an arrangement where clothes and textiles for the royal households were provided by the goldsmith [[Thomas Foulis]] and merchant [[Robert Jousie]], partly financed by money sent as a gift or subsidy to James VI by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].<ref>Jemma Field, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14629712.2019.1626120 'Dressing a Queen: The Wardrobe of Anna of Denmark at the Scottish Court of King James VI, 1590\u20131603', ''The Court Historian'', 24:2 (2019), p. 154.]</ref> Home had a role in financing the household of [[Anne of Denmark]] giving her \u00a33833 Scots in 1591, and in 1592 a dividend of \u00a34000 from her dowry which had been invested in various Scottish towns. He was in charge of paying her Danish servants who were owed fees by the Scottish exchequer, totalling \u00a31,200 in 1592.<ref>George Powell McNeill, ''[[Exchequer Rolls of Scotland]]'', vol. 22 (Edinburgh, 1903), pp. 153, 199, 232.</ref>\n\nIn November 1593 Anne of Denmark complained that people around the king were speaking disrespectfully of her. James asked Home to be watchful of the queen's honour. [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] wrote that Home himself was suspected of speaking against the queen, and [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Burghley]] endorsed this, adding \"The wolf to be a watchman.\"<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 230-1.</ref>\n\nIn 1598 he was appointed a [[Privy Counsellor]], and the following year appears as Sheriff of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], (by then in England).\n\nIn October 1600 James VI visited his house at Spott and was banqueted.

In 1603 he was also appointed to the [[Privy Council of England]], and on 1 June that year received a grant as [[Keeper of the Great Wardrobe]] for life. On 7 July 1604 he was created [[Baron Hume of Berwick]] in the [[Peerage of England]].

[[James I of England|King James]] was pleased with the initial results, although the hoped-for Union never occurred and the gulf between the King and the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] widened. In July 1605 some nineteen ministers assembled at [[Aberdeen]] in defiance of the King's prohibition against the General Assembly meeting. Six of them were subsequently imprisoned in [[Blackness Castle]] near [[Linlithgow]], and there, on 10 January 1606, the Earl of Dunbar came from London to be present at their trial and to act as the assessor. Everything was done that could be done by him to win a verdict for the King against the six ministers and it is said that he \"brought plenty of money with him to purchase a verdict\". In addition, the Earl himself selected the 15 jurymen, five of whom were Homes, his relatives. But even then the jury could not agree. In the end it was a majority verdict of nine against six in favour of the guilty verdict. Regardless of the irregularities, the verdict stood, and established the law that it was [[High Treason]] for any minister of the Established Church to dispute the authority of the King and the [[Privy Council]] in religious matters.\n\n==Family==\nIn 1590 he married Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of Alexander Gordon of [[Gight]]<ref>Some sources call this laird of Gight \"George Gordon\", see Duncan Forbes,''Ane account of the familie of Innes'' (Aberdeen, 1864), p. 248.</ref> and Agnes Beaton, daughter of Cardinal [[David Beaton]], [[Archbishop of St. Andrews]], and [[Marion Ogilvy]]. \n\nThe English ambassador [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] commented on Elizabeth's Gordon's arrival at court in June 1590.

Establishing himself as a [[favourite]], he was in the retinue which accompanied King [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] to [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] to collect his future Queen.

In July 1909, on only her second voyage, the ship, en route from [[Durban]] to [[Cape Town]], disappeared with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Design and construction==\nIn September 1907 W. Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day. At the time of construction, ''Waratah'' was not equipped with a radio, which was not unusual at the time.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=118|ps=}}\n\nThe sea trials were held on 23 October 1908 on the Firth of Clyde, during which the steamer was able to successfully maintain a mean speed of {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h}} over several runs on the measured mile.

The fire was largely brought under control by noon on the same day but continued reigniting until 10 December. The fire was apparently caused by the heat emitted by several reducing and steam valves located on the starboard side of the engine room. While the roof of the engine room was insulated, the starboard side was evidently not. The repairs were performed at Sydney to the chief engineer's satisfaction.\n\nDuring her maiden trip the steamer was scrutinized by the Captain and the crew, as one of the criteria used in acceptance trials was the ship's handling and stability. Captain Ilbery was not completely satisfied and, considering he was previously in charge of ''Geelong'', presumably reported to the owners that the ship did not have the same stability as his old vessel. He was especially concerned with the difficulty of properly loading the steamer to maintain her stability, which resulted in a heated exchange between the owners and the builders following the vessel's return to England.\n\nThe subsequent inquiry into her sinking raised some disputed reports of instability on this voyage.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article77352720 |title=THE S.S.

Sawyer, an engineer and experienced sea traveller, left the ship and sent the following [[Telegram|cable]] to his wife in London: \"Thought Waratah top-heavy, landed Durban\". Sawyer later testified to the London inquiry that he had booked passage on ''Waratah'' through to Cape Town, but had decided to disembark at Durban, as he had been nervous about the behaviour of the ship during his voyage. He also claimed that he had been disturbed by visions he saw in dreams during the voyage of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" Sawyer claimed that he took these visions to be a warning to leave the ship at the earliest opportunity. In any event his decision to leave the ship at Durban saved his life.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n===Disappearance===\nThe ''Waratah'' left Durban at approximately 20:15 on 26 July with 211 passengers and crew. At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n\nThat evening the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"\n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nThe same evening, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw a large steamer coming up astern of her, working hard in the heavy seas and making a great deal of smoke, enough to make her captain wonder if the steamer was on fire. When darkness fell, the crew of the ''Harlow'' could see the steamer's running lights approaching, but still {{convert|10|to|12|mi|km}} behind them, when there were suddenly two bright flashes from the vicinity of the steamer and the lights vanished. The mate of the ''Harlow'' thought the flashes were brush fires on the shore (a common phenomenon in the area at that time of year).

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously.

As ''Waratah'' was considered unsinkable, it was at first thought likely that she had been delayed by a breakdown or mechanical fault, and was still adrift. Fears started to grow for her safety, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

Most evidence came from passengers and crew from ''Waratah's'' maiden voyage, her builders and those who had handled her in port.\n\nThe expert witnesses all agreed that the ''Waratah'' was designed and built properly and sailed in good condition.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=130|ps=}} She had passed numerous inspections, including those by her builders, her owners, the Board of Trade and two by [[Lloyd's of London]], who gave her the classification \"+100 A1\"&nbsp;\u2013 their top rating,{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=118, 130|ps=}} granted only to ships Lloyds had inspected and assessed throughout the design, construction, fitting out and [[sea trial]]s, on top of the two valuations and inspections Lloyds had made of the completed ''Waratah''.\n\nHowever many witnesses who had travelled on the ship testified that the ''Waratah'' felt unstable, frequently [[Angle of list|listed]] to one side even in calm conditions, [[Ship motions|rolled]] excessively, and was very slow to come upright after leaning into a swell, and had a tendency for her [[bow (ship)|bow]] to dip into oncoming waves rather than ride over them.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\"/><ref name=\"NLAInqreport\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5235069 |title=THE WARATAH.

This passenger, physicist Professor [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]]. When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite. Both former passengers and crew members (ranking from stokers to a deck officer) said the ''Waratah'' was perfectly stable, with a comfortable, easy roll.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=133|ps=}} Many said they felt she was especially stable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5153599 |title=THE S.S.

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W.

The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day.

At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n\nThat evening the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"\n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nThe same evening, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw a large steamer coming up astern of her, working hard in the heavy seas and making a great deal of smoke, enough to make her captain wonder if the steamer was on fire.

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under.

Fears started to grow for her safety, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

This passenger, physicist Professor [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]]. When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite.

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

B7231.jpg|thumb|right|Supplies being unloaded from a ship at the [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry B artificial harbour]] in July 1944]]\n{{Campaignbox Normandy}}\n\n'''British logistics in the Normandy campaign''' played a key role in the success of [[Operation Overlord]], the Allied invasion of France in June 1944. The objective of the campaign was to secure a lodgement on the mainland of Europe for further operations. The Allies had to land sufficient forces to overcome the initial opposition and build it up faster than the Germans could respond. Planning for this operation had begun in 1942. The Anglo-Canadian force, the [[21st Army Group]], consisted of the [[British Second Army]] and [[Canadian First Army]]. Between them they had six armoured divisions (including the [[Polish 1st Armoured Division]]), ten infantry divisions, two airborne divisions, nine independent armoured brigades and two commando brigades. Logistical units included six supply unit headquarters, 25 Base Supply Depots (BSDs), 83 Detail Issue Depots (DIDs), 25 field bakeries, 14 field butcheries and 18 port detachments. The army group was supported over the beaches and through the [[Operation Mulberry|Mulberry]] artificial port specially constructed for the purpose.\n\nDuring the first seven weeks after the British and Canadian landings in Normandy on [[D-Day]], 6 June 1944, the advance was much slower than anticipated, and the [[lodgement]] area much smaller. The short lines of communication provided an opportunity to accumulate reserves of supplies. Two army roadheads were created, No. 1 Army Roadhead for [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] and No. 2 Army Roadhead for [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]], these being the two corps ashore at the time. When the Canadian First Army assumed control of the British I Corps on 21 June, No. 1 Army Roadhead also passed to its control. No. 2 Army Roadhead formed the nucleus of what became the Rear Maintenance Area (RMA) of the 21st Army Group. By 26 July, 675,000 personnel, 150,000 vehicles and {{convert|680000|LT|order=flip}} of stores and {{convert|68000|LT|order=flip}} of bulk petrol had been landed. Ammunition usage was high, exceeding the daily allocation for the [[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|25-pounder field guns]] by 8 per cent and for the [[BL 5.5-inch Medium Gun|5.5-inch medium guns]] by 24 per cent. Greater priority was given to ammunition shipments, with petrol, oil and lubricant (POL) shipments cut to compensate.\n\nOn 25 July, the [[First United States Army|US First Army]] began [[Operation Cobra]], the break-out from Normandy. On 26 August, 21st Army Group issued orders for an advance to the north to capture [[Antwerp]], Belgium. After a rapid advance, the British [[Guards Armoured Division]] liberated [[Brussels]], the Belgian capital, on 3 September and the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]] captured Antwerp the following day. The advance was much faster than expected and the rapid increase in the length of the [[line of communications]] threw up logistical challenges that, together with increased German resistance, threatened to stall the Allied armies. By mid-September, the Allies had liberated most of France and Belgium. The success of the 21st Army Group was in large part due to its [[military logistics|logistics]], which provided the operational commanders with enormous capacity and tremendous flexibility.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Invasion Build-up- Preparations For the D-day Landings, UK, 1944 D20402.jpg|thumb|right|Women of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] prepare for [[Operation Overlord]] at a [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] depot]]\nBetween the world wars the [[British Army]] developed a doctrine based on using machinery as a substitute for manpower. In this way, it was hoped that mobility could be restored to the battlefield and the enormous casualties of the [[Great War]] could be avoided.{{sfn|French|2000|p=106}} The Army embraced motor transport and mechanisation as a means of increasing the tempo of operations. The wholesale mechanisation of the infantry and artillery was ordered in 1934 and by 1938, the British Army had only 5,200 horses, compared with 28,700 in the eve of the Great War in 1914. In the [[Second World War]], the Army relied entirely on motor transport to move supplies between the railheads and the divisional depots.{{sfn|French|2000|pp=110\u2013113}}\n\nFrance was occupied by Germany in June 1940 following the German victory in the [[Battle of France]]. An important factor in the defeat was the failure of the logistical system of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], which responded too slowly to the rapid German advance.{{sfn|French|2000|p=116}} In the aftermath, the prospect of a British army invading and liberating France was remote, and the British Army concentrated on repelling rather than mounting a cross-channel attack. On 19 June 1940, the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS),  [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] Sir [[John Dill]], ordered that all line of communications units not required for home defence be disbanded and no further units be raised. In the event of an invasion of the UK, the Home Forces planned to rely on civilian resources for transportation, communications and maintenance. In March 1941, the [[Churchill war ministry|War Cabinet]] decided that the Army had reached its maximum size. Henceforth, although the manpower \"ceiling\" was to be raised a little, this meant that raising more logistical units required the conversion of other units.{{sfn|French|2003|p=273}}\n\nBy this time, Home Forces divisions had a divisional slice (the personnel of the division plus the supporting operational and logistical units at corps and army level) of 25,000, but overseas operations required one of 36,500 to 39,000.{{sfn|French|2003|p=273}} The [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 drew German forces away from the west, and the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, while having the immediate effect of diverting troops from the war against Germany, brought the United States into the war, with the prospect of substantial resources over the longer term. This made realistic planning for an invasion of France possible.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=239\u2013241}} A War Office staff study in May 1942 for [[Operation Sledgehammer]], an assault on France in 1942, revealed that an expeditionary force of six divisions would require all the logistical units in the UK, but not until 18 December 1942 was a final decision taken that a German invasion of the UK in 1943 was highly unlikely, and the reorganisation of the forces in the UK for an invasion of France could begin.{{sfn|French|2003|p=275}}\n\nOperation Sledgehammer was superseded by [[Operation Roundup (1942)|Operation Roundup]], a plan for an invasion of France in 1943. In January 1943, the [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces]], General Sir [[Bernard Paget]], estimated that an expeditionary force of eleven British and five Canadian divisions could be assembled by August 1943, but the diversion of resources to the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean theatre]] meant that by August there were only enough logistical units to support five divisions, and the full force would not be assembled until April 1944. By November 1943, the force earmarked for France had dropped to twelve British and Canadian divisions, but the Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]], felt that as the Americans were contributing fifteen divisions, this should be matched. Three divisions were therefore withdrawn from the Mediterranean. {{sfn|French|2003|pp=276\u2013278}}\n\nThe British Army's administrative doctrine was honed in the [[Western Desert Campaign]], where lessons were learnt and administrative staffs and logistical units developed effective procedures through trial and error.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=374\u2013375}} Doctrine based on fighting in Europe where there was a temperate climate and well-developed road and rail infrastructure was set aside and new organisational and logistical structures such as the Field Maintenance Centre (FMC) were developed.{{sfn|French|2000|pp=116\u2013117}} By 1944, the skill of the British Army in the field of logistics had been brought to a high state of efficiency and support from the United States through [[Lend-Lease]] made enormous quantities of [[materiel]] available.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=374\u2013375}} Mechanisation and overwhelming firepower demanded a great deal from the Army's logistical infrastructure. Fortunately, the British Army had 200 years' experience of fighting campaigns far from home.{{sfn|French|2000|p=278}}\n\n==Planning==\nA plan was for a cross-channel invasion was drawn up by a staff led by the designated [[Chief of Staff]] to the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] (COSSAC), and approved at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943. It was codenamed [[Operation Overlord]].{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=239\u2013241}} COSSAC also inherited and developed plans for Operation Rankin, a contingency plan for a sudden German collapse.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=248\u2013249}} Home Forces headquarters was divided in two in May 1943 to create an expeditionary headquarters, the  [[21st Army Group]].{{sfn|French|2000|p=276}} From January 1944 it was commanded by General [[Bernard Montgomery]]. It consisted of two [[Field army|armies]], the [[British Second Army]] and the [[Canadian First Army]].{{sfn|Ellis|1962|pp=31\u201332}} The two armies comprised six armoured divisions (including the [[Polish 1st Armoured Division]]), ten infantry divisions, two airborne divisions, nine independent armoured brigades and two [[British Commandos|commando]] brigades.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=2}}\n\nThe total strength of the British and Canadian components of 21st Army Group was about 849,000, of which 695,000 were British Army, 107,000 were Canadian Army, and 47,000 were members of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF).{{sfn|Boileau|1954|pp=301\u2013303}} Of the British troops in the 21st Army Group, 56 per cent were in the combat and combat support arms: the artillery, infantry, armour, engineers and signals. The 44 per cent in the services included 15 per cent in the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] (RASC), 10 per cent in the [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Pioneer Corps]], 5 per cent in the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (REME), 4 per cent in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] (RAMC), [[Royal Army Dental Corps]] and [[Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS) and 10 per cent in other services, such as the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] (RAOC) and the [[Royal Military Police|Corps of Military Police]] (CMP).{{sfn|Ellis|1962|p=536}}\n\n[[File:Invasion Build-up- Preparations For the D-day Landings, UK, 1944 D20396.jpg|thumb|left|A line of army lorries awaits collection along a tree-lined lane or path in preparation for Overlord]]\nLogistical units included six supply unit headquarters, 25 Base Supply Depots (BSDs), 83 Detail Issue Depots (DIDs), 25 field bakeries, 14 field butcheries and 18 port detachments. This was less than the planners called for, as fewer logistical units returned from the Mediterranean than anticipated. In April 1944, the RASC, the corps of the British Army responsible for most forms of supply and transport, was about 15,000 men short of its requirements. About 9,000 men were transferred from anti-aircraft units, 1,000 from Home Forces and 1,000 from units in the Middle East. This meant that they were still 4,000 men short at the end of May and this had to be accepted. Units designated for beach work received additional training at [[Combined Operations Headquarters|Combined Operations]] training centres. Eleven general transport companies were equipped with [[DUKW]]s and were trained at the RASC Amphibious Training Centre at [[Towyn]] in Wales.{{sfn|Boileau|1954|pp=301\u2013303}}\n\nThe [[United States First Army]] was also assigned to the 21st Army Group for the assault phase of the campaign and although the United States Army maintained a separate supply organisation, an American [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] was assigned as a deputy to the 21st Army Group's Major-General Administration (MGA) and representatives of the American G-1 and G-4 sections were attached to their corresponding opposite numbers at 21st Army Group, the A and Q staffs.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=2}} The MGA, Major-General [[Miles Graham]], had three principal subordinates: a Deputy Quartermaster General (DQMG) for plans and maintenance, Brigadier [[Randle Feilden|Randle (Gerry) Feilden]]; a DQMG for movements and transportation, Brigadier L. L. H. McKillop; and a Deputy Adjutant General (DAG), Brigadier Cyril Lloyd, responsible for personnel and administrative services.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=2}}{{sfn|Mead|2015|pp=126\u2013129}}\n\nA Headquarters (HQ) Line of Communications was formed from that of the disbanded [[54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division]]. Most of its component areas and sub areas were formed specifically for this campaign.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=247}} This was commanded by Major-General [[Robert Francis Brydges Naylor|Frank Naylor]], formerly the Vice QMG at the [[War Office]].{{sfn|Mead|2015|p=137}} In the assault, 101 and 102 Beach Sub Areas would support [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] while 104 Beach Sub Area supported [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]].{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=274\u2013275}} Each beach sub area controlled two [[beach groups]].{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=274\u2013275}} These were tri-service formations with units from the [[Royal Engineers]], RAMC, REME, RAOC, RASC, Pioneer Corps and Military Police. The [[Royal Navy]] provided each with a [[Royal Naval Commandos|Royal Navy Beach Commando]] and a signal unit; the RAF provided beach anti-aircraft defence. Each beach group also had an infantry battalion to mop up any opposition and then to act as a labour force. A beach group had a complement of about 3,000 men.{{sfn|Rogers|Rogers|2012|pp=19\u201320}} The beach sub areas would come under 11 Line of Communications Area when Second Army HQ arrived in Normandy, and it in turn would come under HQ Line of Communications when 21st Army Group HQ arrived.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=5}}\n\nPlans called for four days' supply of ammunition, {{convert|50|mi}} of fuel for all vehicles, and two days' supplies for the troops ashore by D+3 (i.e. three days after [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]), which would be gradually increased to a fortnight's reserves of all commodities by D+41. At first casualties would be evacuated to the UK by [[Amphibious warfare ship|landing ships]] or small hospital ships. Once hospitals were established ashore, only casualties requiring more than seven days' treatment would be returned to the UK. This would be increased later as more hospitals were established on the continent. Numbers were forecast based on War Office tables known as Evetts rates, after Major-General [[John Fullerton Evetts|John Evetts]], the [[Assistant Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Assistant Chief of the General Staff]], who devised them. For planning purposes, it was assumed that casualties on D-Day would be at an exceptionally high (\"double intense\") rate. In the event, this was not the case.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=7}} A special feature was the provision of \"survivor's kits\" at the beach dumps. These were bags packed with a full set of soldier's equipment and clothing, which could be issued to individuals who had lost all their kit through the sinking of their ship or landing craft.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=273}} [[Prisoners of war]] (POWs) were to be evacuated to camps in England.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=24\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Invasion Build-up- Preparations For the D-day Landings, UK, 1944 D20392.jpg|thumb|right|Jerry cans of petrol are lowered by crane into the hold of a ship]]\nTwo important co-ordinating bodies were created. The Build-Up Control Organisation (BUCO) was formed on 20 April 1944 at Combined Operations Headquarters (although it was not part of it). It was charged with responsibility for regulating the build-up of vehicles and personnel by allocating priorities for the available shipping. Once the final plans for the landing were drawn up, all further alterations had to be implemented by BUCO. Movement Control (MOVCO) was responsible for the movement of units to the coastal areas and ports from which they would embark. Like BUCO, it had separate staffs for the American and British zones which operated independently. There was also the Turnaround Control Organisation (TURCO), which controlled the turnaround of shipping at the ports of loading; the Combined Operations Repair Organisation (COREP), which handled repairs to damaged ships and landing craft; the Combined Tugboat Organisation (COTUG) managed a fleet of tugboats.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=264\u2013265}}{{sfn|Ellis|1962|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nThe objective of the campaign was to secure a lodgement on the mainland of Europe from which further operations could be conducted. The lodgement area had to be large enough and have sufficient port facilities to maintain between twenty-six and thirty divisions, with additional divisions arriving at the rate of three to five a month. The Allies had to land sufficient assaulting force to overcome the initial opposition, and build it up faster than the Germans could respond.{{sfn|Ellis|1962|pp=63\u201364}} The campaign plan involved a landing in [[Normandy]], followed by an advance to the south. The ports in [[Brittany]] would be captured, and the Allied armies would then turn east and cross the [[Seine]] River. For administrative planning purposes, it was assumed that the Breton and [[Loire]] ports would be captured by D+40 and the Seine reached by D+90.{{sfn|Ellis|1962|pp=81, 87}} Montgomery did not expect that the campaign would unfold according to plan and did not commit himself to a timetable. \"Whether operations will develop on these lines\", he noted on 8 May, \"must of course depend on our own and the enemy situation which cannot be predicted accurately at the present moment\".{{sfn|Ellis|1962|p=81}} The assault had to be postponed for 24 hours but there were contingency plans that covered both this and a 48-hour postponement.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=264\u2013265}}\n\n==Assault==\n{{see also|Beach groups}}\n[[File:British D-Day assault area.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.0|Map of British D-Day assault beaches]]\nThe landings on D-Day, 6 June, were successful.

It was difficult for landing craft to discharge motor vehicles at low tide, or to beach during an ebbing tide. This meant that except at high tide, landing craft and LSTs were beached. Causeways were constructed to allow them to discharge. Ships carrying stores had to anchor up to {{convert|5|mi|sigfig=1}} from shore, resulting in lengthy turnaround times for the DUKWs and other unloading craft.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=7}}{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|p=372}}\n\n[[File:British troops and naval beach parties on Sword Beach in Normandy on D-Day, 6 June 1944.

Landing beaches were divided into red and green landing areas. An [[Landing craft tank|LCT]] landing point was established at Love green-beach. Item, Red and Jig green-Beaches, were developed by 10 Beach Group, as planned. The main dumps were not ready to receive stores until 8 June, so in the meantime stores were accumulated in temporary locations near the beach.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nThe landing of 102 Beach Sub Area with the [[3rd Canadian Division]] on [[Juno Beach]] was delayed by rough seas and the development of Mike Beach by 7 Beach Group was delayed by fire from [[Vaux-sur-Aure]]. The German stronghold there was eliminated on 8 June by 7 Beach Group, supported by armour. Bad weather delayed the arrival of four [[Coastal trading vessel|coasters]] from England on D-Day and seven more on 7 June. This was offset when the tiny port of [[Courseulles-sur-Mer]] was captured intact on D-Day, allowing {{convert|1000|LT|order=flip}} per day to be unloaded there, but it proved unsuitable for coasters and was abandoned on 10 June.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nAt [[Sword Beach]], 101 Beach Sub Area landed with the [[British 3rd Division]], 5 Beach Group with its assault brigade and 6 Beach Group with its follow-up brigade. Four LCTs, each loaded with {{convert|200|LT|order=flip}} of high priority stores were beached and rapidly unloaded into temporary dumps near the beaches.

Between 16 and 30 June, the British Second Army mounted a series of operations to capture Caen, but it remained in German hands. Finally, after a bombardment by 420 heavy bombers from [[RAF Bomber Command]] on 7 July, Caen was taken on 9 July. [[Operation Goodwood]] was launched on 18 July and to contain the British and Canadian forces, almost all the German armour was concentrated east of the [[Orne River]], paving the way for a successful advance in the American sector.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=8}}\n\n===Organisation===\nCorps and divisional administrative staffs landed on D-Day. The Second Army staffs began landing the following day, allowing it to assume administrative control on 11 June, but the restricted lodgement area made the corps headquarters reluctant to relinquish control of the depots and dumps around the beaches. The beach sub area commanders found themselves answerable to corps, army and when it arrived, 11 Line of Communications Area. On 14 June, with the lodgement area {{convert|8|to|12|mi}} deep with a front {{convert|50|mi|adj=on}} long, Second Army assumed command of the beach sub areas, marking the end of the assault phase of Overlord.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=277\u2013278}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B8745.jpg|thumb|A convoy of supply lorries moves up through [[Jurques]] on 6 August 1944]]\nTwo army roadheads were created: No. 1 Army Roadhead for I Corps, and No. 2 Army Roadhead for XXX Corps.

There was also a CRASC Petrol Installation, whose command included 28 petrol depots and twelve mobile petrol filling centres (MPFCs).{{sfn|Boileau|1954|p=337}} Each MPFC could refill up to 8,000 jerry cans per day.{{sfn|Boileau|1954|p=340}}\n\nOn 15 June, 151 Forward Maintenance Area was opened by XXX Corps. The FMA concept, which had been used with success in the Mediterranean theatre, was not part of British doctrine. Unlike divisions, which incorporated logistics units, a corps was a purely operational formation and not part of the logistical plan. Doctrine called for the use of pack trains, railway trains which would deliver days' supplies direct to a division. These had worked well in the Great War but had been found to be impractical in the Middle East and were never seriously considered for Overlord.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=283\u2013286}} The FMA was only a few miles from No. 2 Army Roadhead but the XXX Corps staff considered that it knew best, given its combat experience in the [[North African Campaign]] and the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. The other corps of Second Army followed suit and established their own FMAs. Under the FMA scheme, divisions drew maintenance from the FMA rather than the roadhead.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=283\u2013286}}\n\nThe FMA allowed a corps to train newly arrived administrative units, to control the usage of ammunition by the divisions and alleviate the traffic congestion around Bayeux. The British Second Army gave tacit support for the practice, issuing an order that FMAs be called Field Maintenance Centres (FMCs), the original nomenclature in the Mediterranean. Henceforth, Second Army stocked the army roadhead and left the FMCs to the corps. The FMCs were manned using corps resources; each had two DIDs, a petrol depot, a transport company and two RASC composite platoons drawn from corps troops composite companies. Where possible, an MPFC was attached to each FMC. Occasionally they had to be reinforced with some additional transport platoons from Second Army. This organisation allowed an FMC to be operated while another was established. Each FMC held two days' rations and one day's maintenance stocks, two or three days' petrol, which was about {{convert|200000|impgal|l|order=flip}} and {{convert|3500|LT|order=flip}} of ammunition. Corps services such as the reinforcement centre, salvage unit, tank delivery squadron and ordnance field park tended to cluster around the FMC.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=283\u2013286}}{{sfn|Boileau|1954|pp=340\u2013342}}\n\nBy 26 July, 675,000 personnel, 150,000 vehicles, {{convert|680000|LT|order=flip}} of stores and {{convert|68000|LT|order=flip}} of bulk petrol had been landed.

Usage exceeded the seventy rounds per gun per day allocation for the [[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|25-pounder]] guns by six rounds per gun per day and the allocation of fifty rounds per gun per day for the 5.5-inch guns by twelve per gun per day. Fears that the crowded lodgement area would prove a tempting target for the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' led to an overstock of anti-aircraft ammunition. Later shipments of anti-aircraft ammunition were cancelled and other types of artillery ammunition were substituted. The requirement for tank and anti-tank ammunition was also over-estimated.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=287\u2013288, 396\u2013397}} While it seemed to the Germans that the British Army had an unlimited supply of ammunition, this was not the case and a reason why heavy bombers were used to augment the artillery in Operation Goodwood.{{sfn|French|2000|p=118}}\n\n===Mulberry harbour===\n{{main|Mulberry harbour}}\n[[File:The Mulberry artificial harbour off Arromanches in Normandy, September 1944.

This was expected to take three weeks and it was not large enough to meet the Allied needs. Until a major port could be captured, maintenance would have to be over open beaches that were at the mercy of the weather. Two artificial ([[Mulberry harbours]]) were planned: Mulberry A for the American sector and Mulberry B for the British sector. Work commenced in 1942 and prototypes were tested in 1943. Mulberry A was to have a capacity of {{convert|5000|LT|order=flip}} per day and Mulberry B of {{convert|7000|LT|order=flip}}. Each would handle 1,200 vehicles daily, and provide shelter for small craft.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=254\u2013256}}\n\nMulberry breakwaters consisted of [[blockship]]s, concrete [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] known as [[Phoenix breakwaters]] and floating breakwaters known as [[Bombardon breakwater]]s. Their construction consumed tens of thousands of tons of steel and cost \u00a325&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=256\u2013259}} Each harbour had three piers, a barge pier and an LST pier, each with one roadway, and a stores pier with two floating roadways.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|p=373}} When the Overlord plan was expanded in 1944, it was too late to enlarge the Mulberry harbours, so additional small craft shelters known as Gooseberries were provided, one for each invasion beach. The British Gooseberries were No. 3 at [[Arromanches]] on Gold Beach, No. 4 at [[Courseulles]] on Juno Beach and No. 5 at Ouistreham on Sword Beach.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=256\u2013259}}\n\nConstruction of Mulberry B commenced near Arromanches on Gold Beach on 9 June and coasters began discharging inside the breakwaters on 11 June.

Due to it, the LST pier planned to service twenty LSTs per day from 18 June was not opened until 20 July and LSTs had to be dried out\u2014beached and left stranded at low tide while unloading continued. Royal Navy misgivings about drying out store carrying LCTs had been overcome during the planning stages, but it now became necessary to dry out LSTs as well, with considerable consequent damage that was beyond the capacity of the naval repair teams, which slowed LST turnaround.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|pp=373\u2013374}}{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=276}} Because of the storm, only {{convert|19139|LT|order=flip}} of stores were landed by 29 June instead of the planned {{convert|39240|LT|order=flip}}.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=18\u201320}} The main effect was a shortage of ammunition, particularly for the [[25-pounder]]s and 5.5-inch guns, for which demand had been unexpectedly heavy.

A daily average of {{convert|850|LT|order=flip}} was unloaded there in June, rising to {{convert|1500|LT|order=flip}} in July and August. Operations ceased on 7 September.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\n[[Port-en-Bessin]] was operated as a bulk petroleum terminal, servicing both the British and American forces.

It contained the only deep-water berths in Allied hands and was useful in reducing the load on Port-en-Bessin. The railway line from Cherbourg to Caen commenced operation on 26 July, using rolling stock captured near Bayeux.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|pp=373\u2013374}} The lack of deep water berths meant that a large proportion of the supplies shipped went in coasters that could discharge at the small ports rather than in large, ocean-going Liberty ships.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nIt was hoped that Cherbourg could handle large and awkward loads, but it had been so badly damaged that it was not sufficiently rehabilitated to do so until late August. In the meantime, they were shipped already loaded on transporters, or unloaded from lighters by cranes at Courseulles or Port-en-Bessin. Although [[Manifest (transportation)|manifests]] were flown across each day, there was still trouble identifying cargo. A commendable but misplaced desire to use all available cargo space often led to one type of stores overlaying another. The result was mixed loads of stores being unloaded into the DUKWs, with a slowing of their turnaround time if they had to deliver to two different inland dumps.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nTo reduce turnaround time and wear on the DUKW tyres, which were in short supply, transshipment areas were established where the DUKWs could transfer their loads to ordinary lorries. There were timber platforms with a mobile crane at one end. DUKWs were loaded by depositing supplies on them over the side of ships in a cargo net. Each DUKW had been equipped with two of these in the UK. A control tower overlooking the port area used a [[loud hailer]] to direct the DUKWs to numbered platforms where a crane would remove the load. The DUKW would be given a replacement cargo net and head back out to the ship. The platform was large enough to permit some sorting of the stores. They would be loaded onto lorries backed up to the other side of the platform, either by hand or using roller runways.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=286}}\n\nBecause the shipping plan was so detailed, with everything carefully planned and scheduled in advance, timely and frequent alterations could not be tolerated. To make up for this, a system of \"express coasters\" was provided, which could carry a known tonnage of whatever was required on a given day. These carried unexpected and unforeseen demands, such as [[baling wire]] to help French farmers with their harvests.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nThe British beaches were closed on 3 September 1944. By this time {{convert|217924|LT|order=flip}} had been discharged through small ports, {{convert|605629|LT|order=flip}} over open beaches, and {{convert|451335|LT|order=flip}} through Mulberry B.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=256\u2013259}} This meant that 25 per cent of the total tonnage had been landed through Cherbourg and the small ports, 12.5 per cent through Mulberry B, and 62.5 per cent over the beaches. The tonnage handled over the beaches greatly exceeded the expectations of the planners; but it is unlikely that the invasion would have been launched in the first place without the reassurance provided by the Mulberry.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=280\u2013281}}\n\n===Ordnance===\n\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B8892.jpg|thumb|left|REME fitters prepare to install a new engine into a [[Sherman tank]]]]\nIn the first four weeks, stores were landed in Landing Reserve packs, each made up of about 8,000 cases containing a mix of stores intended to support a brigade group or the equivalent for thirty days.

When 15 Base Ammunition Depot arrived on 18 June, it took over those in 104 Beach Sub Area, while 17 Base Ammunition Depot took over those in 101 and 102 Beach Sub Areas.

Most swampings were caused not by faulty waterproofing but by landing craft discharging vehicles into more than {{convert|4|ft|order=flip}} of water. The recovery of vehicles on the beaches was a hazardous enterprise owing to shellfire, mines and aircraft. Some 669 vehicles were brought in for repair by XXX Corps workshops between 8 June and 19 June, of which 509 were repaired, the remainder being written off. I Corps workshops established a \"help yourself\" park of written off vehicles from which spare parts could be salvaged, the process being faster than obtaining them from the Beach Maintenance Packs, where correctly identifying parts was difficult. When the Americans developed the [[Rhino tank|Rhino]] tank attachment, the REME were asked to produce two dozen for British units. These were made in three days from steel salvaged from German beach obstacles.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nSeven British field artillery regiments were equipped with [[M7 Priest]] self-propelled guns, which required scarce American {{nowrap|105 mm}} ammunition and replaced them with [[Sexton (artillery)|Sexton]] 25-pounder self-propelled guns, delivered from Britain by 15 Advanced Ordnance Depot.{{sfn|Fernyhough|Harris|1967|p=290}} For [[Operation Totalize]], the Canadians converted the surplus Priests into [[armoured personnel carrier]]s, known as [[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroos]], by removing the guns and welding over the front apertures.

The problem was how to feed the troops in the first 48 hours, as the assault packs used in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and [[Operation Torch]] had been found to be too heavy and bulky proportional to their nutritional value. A new 24-hour ration pack was therefore devised for Overlord. Two proposed ration packs were tested under field conditions in June 1943 and a new 24-hour ration was produced that combined the merits of both. The resulting 24-hour ration pack was a {{convert|4000|cal|kJ|adj=on|order=flip}} ration that weighed {{convert|35|oz|order=flip}} and at {{convert|90|cuin|order=flip}} could fit into the standard British Army [[mess tin]]. The War Office then ordered 7.5&nbsp;million of them, with a delivery date of 31 March 1944. Only by strenuous efforts was this achieved.{{sfn|Boileau|1954|p=293}}\n\nThe field service (FS) bulk ration was in general use by 21 July, although combat units continued using the ration packs for certain operations. The FS ration was entirely composed of preserved components but it was supplemented by shipments of fresh meat, fruit and vegetables. Hospital patients began to receive fresh bread on 13 June, and it was in general issue by 5 August. The mixture of tea, sugar and powdered milk in the ration packs was widely disliked and advantage was taken of an order authorising the issue of tea, sugar and milk to troops engaged in \"heavy and arduous\" night work. As a result, a surprisingly large proportion of the 21st Army Group became engaged in such activities, unbalancing the reserve ration stocks. There were also large unforeseen demands for [[tommy cooker]]s, compact portable stoves fuelled by [[hexamine fuel tablet|hexamine tablets]] that could provide men in a front line trench with a hot cup of tea.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=287}}\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Supplying Allied Forces After D Day, July 1944 B7186.jpg|thumb|left|GMC two-and-a-half-ton 6 \u00d7 6 lorries (CCKW-353) parked on expanded metal standings, taking on fuel supplies]]\nEngineering works were initially the responsibility of the Chief Engineer, Second Army. Engineer store dumps were established at Tailleville (No. 1 Roadhead), Bayeux (No. 2 Roadhead), [[Ver-sur-Mer]] and [[Luc-sur-Mer]], with the engineer base workshop at Le Bergerie. Some 9,000 construction personnel and {{convert|42000|LT|order=flip}} of engineer stores were earmarked for shipment to Normandy by 25 July, but owing to the Channel storm and lack of demand due to the restricted lodgement area, only 6,000 personnel and {{convert|22000|LT|order=flip}} of engineer stores were landed.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=13}} The main engineering tasks were the rehabilitation of the road network, the construction of airfields, the building of bridges, and the development of the bulk POL installation.{{sfn|Buchanan|1953|p=179}}\n\nBy 26 July, the 21st Army Group had 152,499 vehicles in a lodgement area just {{convert|20|mi}} wide and {{convert|10|mi}} deep.{{sfn|Buchanan|1953|p=179}} Despite little or no maintenance during the war, the roads were found to be in better condition than expected but soon deteriorated under constant heavy military traffic. Potholes were filled in and bypasses constructed around villages with narrow streets that were suitable for one-way traffic only. Some additional bridges were erected to remove bottlenecks.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=13}}\n\nA lack of timber was foreseen by the planners and {{convert|12000|LT|order=flip}} was earmarked for shipment. This included 18,000 piles {{convert|60|to|120|ft|order=flip}} long and 47,000 pieces of squared timber. Five Canadian and two British forestry companies were in Normandy by the end of July, but the only sizeable source of timber in the lodgement area was the [[Cerisy Forest]], where there was about {{convert|5000|acre|ha|order=flip}} of [[beech]] and [[oak]]. As in the Great War, much trouble was experienced with trees that had been hit by shrapnel; mine detectors were used on them with mixed results. By 26 September, the forestry companies had produced {{convert|24000|LT|order=flip}} of sawn timber and {{convert|15000|LT|order=flip}} of firewood; five companies produced {{convert|7000|cuyd|order=flip}} of gravel for construction purposes from ten quarries.{{sfn|Buchanan|1953|pp=181\u2013184}}\n\nFive Royal Engineers airfield construction groups and an RAF airfield construction wing were active by the end of June. By the end of July, they had established seventeen airfields in the lodgement area, of which eight were surfaced with square meshed steel and one with bitumised hessian runways. Thirteen of these airfields were in operation by the RAF on 26 July. Problems were encountered with dust, which caused aircraft not fitted with air intake filters to suffer from excessive engine wear. The problem was largely overcome by wet weather in July.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=13}}\n\n===Salvage===\nA field salvage unit and field collecting unit arrived on 14 June. Prior to that, small dumps of salvaged equipment were established by the beach groups under the direction of the Second Army salvage officer. By 29 June, six salvage dumps were operational and those at No. 2 Roadhead had handled over {{convert|1000|LT|order=flip}} of materiel. The base salvage dump was opened in the RMA on 24 July. A major task was retrieving airborne equipment that lay strewn about the landing and drop zones, including gliders. Souvenir hunters were responsible for the loss of instruments and fittings from many gliders. Large numbers of parachutes were not recovered, owing to their being prized by soldiers and civilians alike for their silk. By 25 July, {{convert|7328|LT|order=flip}} of stores had been returned to ordnance.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=23}}{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=291\u2013292}}\n\n===Casualties===\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B5802.jpg|thumb|An operation is performed at No. 79 General Hospital near Bayeux on 20 June 1944]]\n[[Field ambulance]]s landed with the assault brigades and each beach group had a self-contained medical organisation with two field dressing stations, two field surgical units and a field transfusion unit; most were operational within 90 minutes of [[H-hour (D-day)|H-Hour]]. [[Casualty clearing station]]s and hospitals began arriving on 8 June, and these were concentrated in three medical areas, around [[Hermanville-sur-Mer]], [[Reviers]] and [[Ryes]]. On 12 June the installations in the Hermanville area moved to [[Douvres-la-D\u00e9livrande]] to make way for an expansion of the nearby ammunition depot. In late June the area around Bayeux was developed as the main Line of Communications hospital area. When HQ Line of Communications assumed administrative command on 13 July, it took over the Bayeux and Reviers groups, while responsibility for the D\u00e9livrande group passed to the First Canadian Army.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=24\u201326}}\n\nThe fighting was less severe than anticipated and casualties were lower. By 26 July, 44,503 British and 13,323 Canadian reinforcements had been dispatched to the 21st Army Group. By the same date, 38,581 casualties had been evacuated by sea. Air evacuation began on 13 June and by 26 July 7,719 casualties were evacuated to the UK.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=24\u201326}} Because of doubts about the availability of water in the lodgement area, large quantities of packaged potable water was shipped, particularly for the wounded on the beaches. The lower than expected casualties resulted in an accumulation of filled water containers which were not required.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=276}}\n\nCasualties among the infantry were particularly severe; although infantrymen made only 20 per cent of the 21st Army Group, the infantry suffered 70 per cent of its casualties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/tactics-and-the-cost-of-victory-in-normandy |title=Tactics and the Cost of Victory in Normandy |first=Ian |last=Carter |access-date=10 January 2018 |publisher=Imperial War Memorial }}</ref> On 16 August it was decided to disband the [[59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division]] and the 70th Infantry Brigade of the [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]] to provide infantry reinforcements for other units. The reinforcement section of the Rear HQ of 21st Army Group became overwhelmed by personnel matters unrelated to reinforcements, like transfers and psychiatric cases and the Organisation and Selection of Personnel Branches of GHQ Second Echelon were sent out, arriving on 16 September.\n{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=54\u201355}}\n\n===Provost===\nSix POW camps were placed at the disposal of 21st Army Group. Each was staffed to cater for 200 officers and 2,000 [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. The first of these arrived on 7 June, and was employed as a collection and transit centre. The next arrived on 11 June, and established a POW camp near Arromanches. Camps had been established in the UK for up to 25,000 prisoners but only 12,153 were captured by 26 July. Most were German but there were also Russians, Poles and other nationalities. Most were taken to the UK, but some were retained for labour duties. POW escorts were provided by the War Office and were based at [[Southampton]]. They crossed to Normandy on LSTs, collected the prisoners and took them back to the UK. This procedure did not work as well as planned, because the prisoners were not always ready to move when required, and the LSTs were unable to wait for them.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=24\u201326}}\n\nThe first CMP units to arrive landed on D-Day. These were three divisional provost companies, six beach provost companies, and two corps provost companies, which were used for traffic control. During the build-up phase, an additional company arrived with each division; four provost companies, four traffic control (TC) companies, and a vulnerable points (VP) company for each army and seven provost, seven TC and three VP companies for the Line of Communications Area. The VP companies were used to guard POWs. Delays in getting provost units ashore allowed traffic congestion to occur on the first two days, but the Line of Communications Area was established faster than planned when traffic congestion became a problem. One check point saw 18,836 vehicles pass it in a day, roughly one every four seconds. Despite all efforts, key towns like Courseulles and Bayeuex soon became bottlenecks. Bypasses were built, and strict movement control was instituted. Under this regime, operational vehicles operated at night when the volume of administrative traffic was lighter.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=23}} Five movement control groups, Nos 6, 17, 18, 19 and 20, were assigned to 21st Army Group. They did not operate as units, but were dispersed among the different headquarters.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|p=371}}\n\n==Breakout and pursuit==\n[[File:The British Army in the Normandy Campaign 1944 B8599.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sherman tank]]s pass a column of [[Churchill tank]]s as they advance towards [[Vassy, Calvados|Vassy]] on 4 August 1944]]\nOn 25 July, the US First Army began [[Operation Cobra]], the breakout from Normandy. The US [[Twelfth United States Army Group|12th Army Group]] became active on 1 August with the US First and [[United States Army Central|Third]] Armies under its command, all still commanded by the 21st Army Group HQ. This remained the case until [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) opened at [[Jullouville]] on 1 September. The rear headquarters of 21st Army Group joined the advanced headquarters at [[Vaucelles]] on 11 August. [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]] was captured on 16 August, and three days later the Canadians and Americans linked up, closing the [[Falaise Pocket]]. On 26 August, the 21st Army Group issued orders for an advance to the north to capture [[Antwerp]]. After a rapid advance (The Swan), the British [[Guards Armoured Division]] liberated [[Brussels]] on 3 September and the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]] captured Antwerp the following day.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=31\u201336}}\n\nAs the armies moved forward, No. 3 Army Roadhead was established for the First Canadian Army at [[Lisieux]] on 24 August and No. 4 Army Roadhead for the British Second Army near [[L'Aigle]] on 26 August. This was soon so far behind the advancing units that intermediate dumps known as \"cushions\" were established to which supplies required by the corps were sited forward of the roadhead in the direction in which the next roadhead would be established. The first of these, No. 1 Cushion, was established at Falaise on 21 August to support the First Canadian Army. No. 2 Cushion was established near [[Beauvais]] on 1 September and No. 3 near [[Doullens]] the next day. No. 5 Army Roadhead was sited on the road between [[Dieppe]] and [[Abbeville]] on 3 September, No. 6 Army Roadhead near Brussels on 6 September and No. 7 Army Roadhead near [[B\u00e9thune]] on 15 September. The 21st Army Group headquarters moved to Brussels on 23 September, and SHAEF moved to [[Versailles]] around the same time.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=31\u201336}}\n\nEach army roadhead had a CRASC Supply Unit, who controlled two BSDs, four DIDs and four mobile field bakeries, and a CRASC Petrol Installation, who controlled five petrol depots. About {{convert|26000|LT|order=flip}} of packaged fuel in jerry cans was held at a roadhead.{{sfn|Boileau|1954|pp=341\u2013342}} In mid-September, 12 Line of Communications Area became responsible for logistical activities south of the Seine, while 11 Line of Communications Area became responsible for those to the north.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=40}}\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU177.jpg|thumb|British troops enjoy the attention of French girls after bringing a food convoy to Paris, 29 August 1944.]]\nWith the establishment of No. 6 Army Roadhead, the 21st Army Group line of communications was {{convert|400|mi}} long, with the main depots still at the RMA and few stocks between them and the FMCs. A crucial decision was taken on 30 August to gamble on the early capture of [[Le Havre]], Dieppe and [[Boulogne]], and slash receipts from {{convert|16000|to|7000|LT|order=flip}} per day, to free transport, which would have been used to clear the beaches, for moving supplies forward of the RMA.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=31\u201336}} Vehicle maintenance was neglected but this presented few problems as most of the vehicles were new. An exception was 1,400 [[Austin K5]] three-ton lorries, along with all their replacement engines, which were found to have faulty [[piston]]s and gave trouble.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=47}}\n\nAdditional general transport companies were shipped urgently from the UK and some new companies were formed in Normandy, increasing the number of companies for the British Second Army from six to thirty-nine.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=300}} The War Office agreed to loan another 12 general transport companies to the 21st Army Group but only five had arrived by 26 September.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=304}} These were formed from [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] and Mixed Transport Command.{{sfn|Boileau|1954|p=350}} A new headquarters called TRANCO was created on 10 September and all road and railway transport was withdrawn from the armies and assigned to it, with the mission of moving supplies from the RMA to the army roadheads.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=31\u201336}}\n\nThe First Canadian Army converted a [[tank transporter]] trailer into a load carrier by welding on steel plank normally used for airfield construction to form a base and sides. The experiment was successful and the modified tank transporters could carry {{convert|16.5|LT|order=flip}} of supplies, {{convert|36|LT|order=flip}} of ammunition, or {{convert|10|LT|order=flip}} of POL, except on narrow roads. The British Second Army converted a whole company in this manner.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=303\u2013304}} The 21st Army Group initially had only two companies of tank transporters, and these were required in the UK until additional tank transporters arrived from the United States.{{sfn|Boileau|1954|pp=325\u2013326}}\n\nAnother expedient was to issue 30 additional lorries to four general transport companies that had enough relief drivers to man them. Two 10-ton companies were equipped with surplus 5-ton trailers. There were also eight DUKW companies, one of which was on loan to the US Army, and was involved in working [[Utah Beach]]. Two other companies were retained as DUKW companies and the remaining five were re-equipped with regular 3-ton lorries. In addition to the DUKW company, a 6-ton and a 3-ton general transport company were loaned to the US Army. These two companies were returned to the 21st Army Group on 4 September.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=303\u2013304}}{{sfn|Boileau|1954|pp=349\u2013350}} During the advance from the Seine, the Second Army employed only six of its eight infantry divisions, so the transport of two could be used to help maintain the other six.{{sfn|Ellis|1968|p=72}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU482.jpg|thumb|left|British vehicles enter Brussels on 4 September 1944]]\nWhile the railway lines in northern France and Belgium had suffered damage, this was much less than of the lines south of the Seine. Commencing on 10 September, trains were loaded in the RMA and supplies shipped to a railhead near Beauvais, where they were loaded onto lorries that took them across the Seine. On the other side, they were loaded onto trains for the final journey to No. 6 Army Roadhead. Work began on a new {{convert|529|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} bridge over the Seine at [[Le Manoir, Eure|Le Manoir]] on 8 September and it was opened a fortnight later. Some bridges over the [[Somme (river)|Somme]] were also down but were bypassed by a diversion at Doullens. A bridge at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]] in Belgium was repaired by the Belgian authorities.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=305}}\n\nProvision had been made in the Overlord plans for supply by air. Apart from supplying the Polish 1st Armoured Division for a short time, little use had been made of this, with the RAF freight service accounting for less than {{convert|200|LT|order=flip}} per week. In August, demand doubled from {{convert|12|to|25|LT}} per day. In the week ending 9 September {{convert|1000|LT|order=flip}} of petrol and {{convert|300|LT|order=flip}} of supplies were delivered to airfields around Amiens, [[Vitry-en-Artois]] and [[Douai]]. The following week, {{convert|2200|LT|order=flip}} of ammunition, {{convert|800|LT|order=flip}} of POL and {{convert|300|LT|order=flip}} of supplies were delivered. [[Haren Airport|Evere Airport]], the main airport at Brussels, was brought into use and {{convert|18000|LT|order=flip}} was landed there over the next five weeks.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=31\u201336}}{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=306}}\n\nAfter the [[liberation of Paris]], it had become apparent that the Germans had stripped the capital of its food and other resources for themselves before their capitulation. Many Parisians were desperate and Allied soldiers even used their own meagre rations to help. The [[Civil Affairs]] of SHAEF therefore requested an urgent shipment of {{convert|3000|LT|order=flip}} of food. A supply earmarked for just this purpose had been set aside at [[Bulford]] long before and on 27 August the first {{convert|500|LT|order=flip}} were delivered by RAF. This convoy labelled \"''Vivres Pour Paris''\" entered a day later, following which {{convert|500|ST|order=flip}} were delivered a day by the British. [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Dakotas]] were flown in which also delivered 500 tons a day. Along with French civilians outside Paris bringing in local resources, within ten days the food crisis in Paris was overcome.{{sfn|Coles|Weinberg|1964|pp=744\u2013745 }}\n\nA minor crisis developed due to a shortage of jerry cans. Discipline regarding the return of containers was lax during the advance, resulting in the Second Army's path through France and Belgium becoming strewn with discarded cans, many of which were quickly appropriated by the civilian population. As the advance continued, the time taken for cans to be returned lengthened, and a severe shortage developed which took some time to overcome. The result was a depletion of stocks at the depots, and the imposition of petrol rationing.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=308}}\n\n===Ports===\n[[File:RASC troops stacking ration boxes in the harbour at Dieppe, 14 October 1944. B10867.jpg|thumb|RASC troops stacking ration boxes in the harbour at Dieppe on 14 October 1944]]\nAntwerp was captured on 4 September but the port was unusable until 29 November because the [[Scheldt]] estuary remained in German hands until after the [[Battle of the Scheldt]].{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=312\u2013313}} In the meantime, a port construction and repair company arrived on 12 September and began the rehabilitation of the port. The quays were cleared of obstructions and the Kruisschans Lock was repaired by December.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=74\u201375}} The port was opened to coasters on 26 November and deep draught shipping on 28 November when the Royal Navy completed minesweeping activity.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=71}}\n\nAfter crossing the Seine, I Corps had swung left to take Le Havre. Although [[Saint-Valery-en-Caux]] was captured on 2 September, a full-scale assault was required to take Le Havre on 10 September, with support from the Royal Navy and RAF Bomber Command, which dropped almost {{convert|5000|LT|order=flip}} of bombs. By the time the garrison surrendered on 12 September, the port was badly damaged. Unexpectedly, the port was allocated to the American forces.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=312\u2013313}}\n\n[[Le Tr\u00e9port]] and Dieppe were captured by the Canadians on 1 September. Although the port facilities were almost intact, the approaches were extensively mined and several days of minesweeping were required; the first coaster docked there on 7 September.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=312\u2013313}} The rail link from Dieppe to Amiens was ready to accept traffic the day before.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|p=380}} By the end of September, it had a capacity of {{convert|6000|to|7000|LT|order=flip}} per day.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=40}} Le Tr\u00e9port became a satellite port of Dieppe.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=332}} Boulogne was captured on 22 September and Calais on 29 September.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=35}} Both were badly damaged and Boulogne was not opened until 12 October. [[Ostend]] was captured on 9 September and in spite of extensive demolitions it was opened on 28 September.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=332}}\n\n===Salvage===\nEnormous quantities of salvage were left at Falaise, and the HQ of the [[197th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade|197th Infantry Brigade]] was given responsibility for collecting it. Prisoners of war were used for labour. Depots for captured enemy stores were established at [[Cormelles-le-Royal]] for the area south of the Seine and at Amiens for north of the Seine. Top priority for collection was given to collecting jerry cans, which were in short supply. About 5,000 horses were captured, which were given to French farmers. By 26 September, {{convert|21840|LT|order=flip}} of salvage had been collected and turned over to ordnance depots.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=53}}\n\n===Prisoners===\nOnly small numbers of prisoners, mostly medical personnel who were used to care for wounded POWs, were retained for labour by 21st Army Group until August, when HQ Line of Communications was authorised to employ up to 40,000 of them. By 24 August, some 18,135 were being held and this climbed to 27,214 by 4 September. Thousands of prisoners were taken during the rapid pursuit phase and efforts were made to reduce prisoner numbers, shipping them to the UK via Arromanches, and later Dieppe. Numbers continued to increase, and exceeded 50,000 at the end of September, by which time over 90,000 prisoners had been shipped to the UK.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=56}}\n\n==Outcome==\nBy mid-September, the Allies had liberated most of France and Belgium. During the first seven weeks the advance had been much slower than anticipated, and the short lines of communication had provided an opportunity to accumulate reserves of supplies. This had been followed by a breakout and pursuit in which the advance had been much faster than contemplated and the rapidity of the advance and the length of the line of communications had thrown up severe logistical problems that, together with increased German resistance, threatened to stall the Allied armies.{{sfn|Ellis|1968|pp=1\u20133}}\n\nThe success of the 21st Army Group was in large part due to its logistics. The supply system developed by the British Army in the desert had become standard procedure, and the staffs and units serving the line of communications \"reached a high degree of efficiency in their own particular task\".{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=374}} The support of the army group over the beaches and through the artificial Mulberry port constructed for the purpose was a logistical feat. So too was the rapid advance across France and Belgium, which exploited the success achieved in Normandy. This was made possible only by the enormous capacity and tremendous flexibility of the logistical system. \"No Army or Navy\", Eisenhower wrote, \"was ever supported so generously or so well\".{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=375}}\n\nThe logistical performance of the 21st Army Group even outstripped that of the neighbouring US 12th Army Group, as the challenges facing the 21st Army Group were not as great; its lines of communications were shorter, fewer divisions were involved and some of the Channel ports had been captured, whereas the Breton ports intended to support the Americans, except for [[Saint-Malo]], had not. Montgomery remained confident that it was still possible to end the war in 1944 but he was wrong.{{sfn|Ellis|1968|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |author=21st Army Group |title=The Administrative History of the Operations of 21 Army Group on the Continent of Europe 6 June 1944 \u2013 8 May 1945 |location=Germany |date=November 1945 |publisher=21st Army Group |oclc=911257199 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Boileau |first=D.

B7231.jpg|thumb|right|Supplies being unloaded from a ship at the [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry B artificial harbour]] in July 1944]]\n{{Campaignbox Normandy}}\n\n'''British logistics in the Normandy Campaign''' played a key role in the success of [[Operation Overlord]], the Allied invasion of France in June 1944. The objective of the campaign was to secure a lodgement on the mainland of Europe for further operations. The Allies had to land sufficient forces to overcome the initial opposition and build it up faster than the Germans could respond. Planning for this operation had begun in 1942. The Anglo-Canadian force, the [[21st Army Group]], consisted of the [[British Second Army]] and [[Canadian First Army]]. Between them they had six armoured divisions (including the [[Polish 1st Armoured Division]]), ten infantry divisions, two airborne divisions, nine independent armoured brigades and two commando brigades. Logistical units included six supply unit headquarters, 25 Base Supply Depots (BSDs), 83 Detail Issue Depots (DIDs), 25 field bakeries, 14 field butcheries and 18 port detachments. The army group was supported over the beaches and through the [[Operation Mulberry|Mulberry]] artificial port specially constructed for the purpose.\n\nDuring the first seven weeks after the British and Canadian landings in Normandy on [[D-Day]], 6 June 1944, the advance was much slower than anticipated, and the [[lodgement]] area much smaller. The short lines of communication provided an opportunity to accumulate reserves of supplies. Two army roadheads were created, No. 1 Army Roadhead for [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] and No. 2 Army Roadhead for [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]], these being the two corps ashore at the time. When the Canadian First Army assumed control of the British I Corps on 21 June, No. 1 Army Roadhead also passed to its control. No. 2 Army Roadhead formed the nucleus of what became the Rear Maintenance Area (RMA) of the 21st Army Group. By 26 July, 675,000 personnel, 150,000 vehicles and {{convert|680000|LT|order=flip}} of stores and {{convert|68000|LT|order=flip}} of bulk petrol had been landed. Ammunition usage was high, exceeding the daily allocation for the [[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|25-pounder field guns]] by 8 per cent and for the [[BL 5.5-inch Medium Gun|5.5-inch medium guns]] by 24 per cent. Greater priority was given to ammunition shipments, with petrol, oil and lubricant (POL) shipments cut to compensate.\n\nOn 25 July, the [[First United States Army|US First Army]] began [[Operation Cobra]], the break-out from Normandy. On 26 August, 21st Army Group issued orders for an advance to the north to capture [[Antwerp]], Belgium. After a rapid advance, the British [[Guards Armoured Division]] liberated [[Brussels]], the Belgian capital, on 3 September and the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]] captured Antwerp the following day. The advance was much faster than expected and the rapid increase in the length of the [[line of communications]] threw up logistical challenges that, together with increased German resistance, threatened to stall the Allied armies. By mid-September, the Allies had liberated most of France and Belgium. The success of the 21st Army Group was in large part due to its [[military logistics|logistics]], which provided the operational commanders with enormous capacity and tremendous flexibility.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Invasion Build-up- Preparations For the D-day Landings, UK, 1944 D20402.jpg|thumb|right|Women of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] prepare for [[Operation Overlord]] at a [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] depot]]\nBetween the world wars the [[British Army]] developed a doctrine based on using machinery as a substitute for manpower. In this way, it was hoped that mobility could be restored to the battlefield and the enormous casualties of the [[Great War]] could be avoided.{{sfn|French|2000|p=106}} The Army embraced motor transport and mechanisation as a means of increasing the tempo of operations. The wholesale mechanisation of the infantry and artillery was ordered in 1934 and by 1938, the British Army had only 5,200 horses, compared with 28,700 in the eve of the Great War in 1914. In the [[Second World War]], the Army relied entirely on motor transport to move supplies between the railheads and the divisional depots.{{sfn|French|2000|pp=110\u2013113}}\n\nFrance was occupied by Germany in June 1940 following the German victory in the [[Battle of France]]. An important factor in the defeat was the failure of the logistical system of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], which responded too slowly to the rapid German advance.{{sfn|French|2000|p=116}} In the aftermath, the prospect of a British army invading and liberating France was remote, and the British Army concentrated on repelling rather than mounting a cross-channel attack. On 19 June 1940, the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS),  [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] Sir [[John Dill]], ordered that all line of communications units not required for home defence be disbanded and no further units be raised. In the event of an invasion of the UK, the Home Forces planned to rely on civilian resources for transportation, communications and maintenance. In March 1941, the [[Churchill war ministry|War Cabinet]] decided that the Army had reached its maximum size. Henceforth, although the manpower \"ceiling\" was to be raised a little, this meant that raising more logistical units required the conversion of other units.{{sfn|French|2003|p=273}}\n\nBy this time, Home Forces divisions had a divisional slice (the personnel of the division plus the supporting operational and logistical units at corps and army level) of 25,000, but overseas operations required one of 36,500 to 39,000.{{sfn|French|2003|p=273}} The [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 drew German forces away from the west, and the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, while having the immediate effect of diverting troops from the war against Germany, brought the United States into the war, with the prospect of substantial resources over the longer term. This made realistic planning for an invasion of France possible.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=239\u2013241}} A War Office staff study in May 1942 for [[Operation Sledgehammer]], an assault on France in 1942, revealed that an expeditionary force of six divisions would require all the logistical units in the UK, but not until 18 December 1942 was a final decision taken that a German invasion of the UK in 1943 was highly unlikely, and the reorganisation of the forces in the UK for an invasion of France could begin.{{sfn|French|2003|p=275}}\n\nOperation Sledgehammer was superseded by [[Operation Roundup (1942)|Operation Roundup]], a plan for an invasion of France in 1943. In January 1943, the [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces]], General Sir [[Bernard Paget]], estimated that an expeditionary force of eleven British and five Canadian divisions could be assembled by August 1943, but the diversion of resources to the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Mediterranean theatre]] meant that by August there were only enough logistical units to support five divisions, and the full force would not be assembled until April 1944. By November 1943, the force earmarked for France had dropped to twelve British and Canadian divisions, but the Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]], felt that as the Americans were contributing fifteen divisions, this should be matched. Three divisions were therefore withdrawn from the Mediterranean. {{sfn|French|2003|pp=276\u2013278}}\n\nThe British Army's administrative doctrine was honed in the [[Western Desert Campaign]], where lessons were learnt and administrative staffs and logistical units developed effective procedures through trial and error.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=374\u2013375}} Doctrine based on fighting in Europe where there was a temperate climate and well-developed road and rail infrastructure was set aside and new organisational and logistical structures such as the Field Maintenance Centre (FMC) were developed.{{sfn|French|2000|pp=116\u2013117}} By 1944, the skill of the British Army in the field of logistics had been brought to a high state of efficiency and support from the United States through [[Lend-Lease]] made enormous quantities of [[materiel]] available.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=374\u2013375}} Mechanisation and overwhelming firepower demanded a great deal from the Army's logistical infrastructure. Fortunately, the British Army had 200 years' experience of fighting campaigns far from home.{{sfn|French|2000|p=278}}\n\n==Planning==\nA plan was for a cross-channel invasion was drawn up by a staff led by the designated [[Chief of Staff]] to the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] (COSSAC), and approved at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943. It was codenamed [[Operation Overlord]].{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=239\u2013241}} COSSAC also inherited and developed plans for Operation Rankin, a contingency plan for a sudden German collapse.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=248\u2013249}} Home Forces headquarters was divided in two in May 1943 to create an expeditionary headquarters, the  [[21st Army Group]].{{sfn|French|2000|p=276}} From January 1944 it was commanded by General [[Bernard Montgomery]]. It consisted of two [[Field army|armies]], the [[British Second Army]] and the [[Canadian First Army]].{{sfn|Ellis|1962|pp=31\u201332}} The two armies comprised six armoured divisions (including the [[Polish 1st Armoured Division]]), ten infantry divisions, two airborne divisions, nine independent armoured brigades and two [[British Commandos|commando]] brigades.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=2}}\n\nThe total strength of the British and Canadian components of 21st Army Group was about 849,000, of which 695,000 were British Army, 107,000 were Canadian Army, and 47,000 were members of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF).{{sfn|Boileau|1954|pp=301\u2013303}} Of the British troops in the 21st Army Group, 56 per cent were in the combat and combat support arms: the artillery, infantry, armour, engineers and signals. The 44 per cent in the services included 15 per cent in the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] (RASC), 10 per cent in the [[Royal Pioneer Corps|Pioneer Corps]], 5 per cent in the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (REME), 4 per cent in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] (RAMC), [[Royal Army Dental Corps]] and [[Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS) and 10 per cent in other services, such as the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] (RAOC) and the [[Royal Military Police|Corps of Military Police]] (CMP).{{sfn|Ellis|1962|p=536}}\n\n[[File:Invasion Build-up- Preparations For the D-day Landings, UK, 1944 D20396.jpg|thumb|left|A line of army lorries awaits collection along a tree-lined lane or path in preparation for Overlord]]\nLogistical units included six supply unit headquarters, 25 Base Supply Depots (BSDs), 83 Detail Issue Depots (DIDs), 25 field bakeries, 14 field butcheries and 18 port detachments. This was less than the planners called for, as fewer logistical units returned from the Mediterranean than anticipated. In April 1944, the RASC, the corps of the British Army responsible for most forms of supply and transport, was about 15,000 men short of its requirements. About 9,000 men were transferred from anti-aircraft units, 1,000 from Home Forces and 1,000 from units in the Middle East. This meant that they were still 4,000 men short at the end of May and this had to be accepted. Units designated for beach work received additional training at [[Combined Operations Headquarters|Combined Operations]] training centres. Eleven general transport companies were equipped with [[DUKW]]s and were trained at the RASC Amphibious Training Centre at [[Towyn]] in Wales.{{sfn|Boileau|1954|pp=301\u2013303}}\n\nThe [[United States First Army]] was also assigned to the 21st Army Group for the assault phase of the campaign and although the United States Army maintained a separate supply organisation, an American [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] was assigned as a deputy to the 21st Army Group's Major-General Administration (MGA) and representatives of the American G-1 and G-4 sections were attached to their corresponding opposite numbers at 21st Army Group, the A and Q staffs.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=2}} The MGA, Major-General [[Miles Graham]], had three principal subordinates: a Deputy Quartermaster General (DQMG) for plans and maintenance, Brigadier [[Randle Feilden|Randle (Gerry) Feilden]]; a DQMG for movements and transportation, Brigadier L. L. H. McKillop; and a Deputy Adjutant General (DAG), Brigadier Cyril Lloyd, responsible for personnel and administrative services.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=2}}{{sfn|Mead|2015|pp=126\u2013129}}\n\nA Headquarters (HQ) Line of Communications was formed from that of the disbanded [[54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division]]. Most of its component areas and sub areas were formed specifically for this campaign.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=247}} This was commanded by Major-General [[Robert Francis Brydges Naylor|Frank Naylor]], formerly the Vice QMG at the [[War Office]].{{sfn|Mead|2015|p=137}} In the assault, 101 and 102 Beach Sub Areas would support [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] while 104 Beach Sub Area supported [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]].{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=274\u2013275}} Each beach sub area controlled two [[beach groups]].{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=274\u2013275}} These were tri-service formations with units from the [[Royal Engineers]], RAMC, REME, RAOC, RASC, Pioneer Corps and Military Police. The [[Royal Navy]] provided each with a [[Royal Naval Commandos|Royal Navy Beach Commando]] and a signal unit; the RAF provided beach anti-aircraft defence. Each beach group also had an infantry battalion to mop up any opposition and then to act as a labour force. A beach group had a complement of about 3,000 men.{{sfn|Rogers|Rogers|2012|pp=19\u201320}} The beach sub areas would come under 11 Line of Communications Area when Second Army HQ arrived in Normandy, and it in turn would come under HQ Line of Communications when 21st Army Group HQ arrived.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=5}}\n\nPlans called for four days' supply of ammunition, {{convert|50|mi}} of fuel for all vehicles, and two days' supplies for the troops ashore by D+3 (i.e. three days after [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]), which would be gradually increased to a fortnight's reserves of all commodities by D+41. At first casualties would be evacuated to the UK by [[Amphibious warfare ship|landing ships]] or small hospital ships. Once hospitals were established ashore, only casualties requiring more than seven days' treatment would be returned to the UK. This would be increased later as more hospitals were established on the continent. Numbers were forecast based on War Office tables known as Evetts rates, after Major-General [[John Fullerton Evetts|John Evetts]], the [[Assistant Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Assistant Chief of the General Staff]], who devised them. For planning purposes, it was assumed that casualties on D-Day would be at an exceptionally high (\"double intense\") rate. In the event, this was not the case.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=7}} A special feature was the provision of \"survivor's kits\" at the beach dumps. These were bags packed with a full set of soldier's equipment and clothing, which could be issued to individuals who had lost all their kit through the sinking of their ship or landing craft.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=273}} [[Prisoners of war]] (POWs) were to be evacuated to camps in England.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=24\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Invasion Build-up- Preparations For the D-day Landings, UK, 1944 D20392.jpg|thumb|right|Jerry cans of petrol are lowered by crane into the hold of a ship]]\nTwo important co-ordinating bodies were created. The Build-Up Control Organisation (BUCO) was formed on 20 April 1944 at Combined Operations Headquarters (although it was not part of it). It was charged with responsibility for regulating the build-up of vehicles and personnel by allocating priorities for the available shipping. Once the final plans for the landing were drawn up, all further alterations had to be implemented by BUCO. Movement Control (MOVCO) was responsible for the movement of units to the coastal areas and ports from which they would embark. Like BUCO, it had separate staffs for the American and British zones which operated independently. There was also the Turnaround Control Organisation (TURCO), which controlled the turnaround of shipping at the ports of loading; the Combined Operations Repair Organisation (COREP), which handled repairs to damaged ships and landing craft; the Combined Tugboat Organisation (COTUG) managed a fleet of tugboats.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=264\u2013265}}{{sfn|Ellis|1962|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nThe objective of the campaign was to secure a lodgement on the mainland of Europe from which further operations could be conducted. The lodgement area had to be large enough and have sufficient port facilities to maintain between twenty-six and thirty divisions, with additional divisions arriving at the rate of three to five a month. The Allies had to land sufficient assaulting force to overcome the initial opposition, and build it up faster than the Germans could respond.{{sfn|Ellis|1962|pp=63\u201364}} The campaign plan involved a landing in [[Normandy]], followed by an advance to the south. The ports in [[Brittany]] would be captured, and the Allied armies would then turn east and cross the [[Seine]] River. For administrative planning purposes, it was assumed that the Breton and [[Loire]] ports would be captured by D+40 and the Seine reached by D+90.{{sfn|Ellis|1962|pp=81, 87}} Montgomery did not expect that the campaign would unfold according to plan and did not commit himself to a timetable. \"Whether operations will develop on these lines\", he noted on 8 May, \"must of course depend on our own and the enemy situation which cannot be predicted accurately at the present moment\".{{sfn|Ellis|1962|p=81}} The assault had to be postponed for 24 hours but there were contingency plans that covered both this and a 48-hour postponement.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=264\u2013265}}\n\n==Assault==\n{{see also|Beach groups}}\n[[File:British D-Day assault area.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.0|Map of British D-Day assault beaches]]\nThe landings on D-Day, 6 June, were successful. Some 2,426 landing ships and [[landing craft]] were employed by [[Vice-admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] Sir [[Philip Vian]]'s Eastern Naval Task Force in support of the British and Canadian forces, including 37 [[Landing ship, infantry|landing ships, infantry]] (LSI), 3 [[dock landing ship|landing ships, dock]] (LSD), 155 [[Landing Craft Infantry|landing craft, infantry]] (LCI), 130 [[Landing Ship, Tank|Landing ships, tank]] (LST) and 487 [[Landing Craft Tank|landing craft, tank]] (LCT).{{sfn|Roskill|1961|pp=18\u201319}} While the fighting was fierce in some places, it was not as severe as had been feared.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=8}}\n\nThe slope of the beaches was not steep; grades varied from 1:100 to 1:250, with a tidal range of about {{convert|20|ft|order=flip|sigfig=1}}. It was difficult for landing craft to discharge motor vehicles at low tide, or to beach during an ebbing tide. This meant that except at high tide, landing craft and LSTs were beached. Causeways were constructed to allow them to discharge. Ships carrying stores had to anchor up to {{convert|5|mi|sigfig=1}} from shore, resulting in lengthy turnaround times for the DUKWs and other unloading craft.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=7}}{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|p=372}}\n\n[[File:British troops and naval beach parties on Sword Beach in Normandy on D-Day, 6 June 1944.

King Beach was supposed to be developed by 9 Beach Group but its peat and soft clay was found to be too soft and was abandoned, except for a pontoon causeway for landing personnel. Landing beaches were divided into red and green landing areas. An [[Landing craft tank|LCT]] landing point was established at Love green-beach. Item, Red and Jig green-Beaches, were developed by 10 Beach Group, as planned. The main dumps were not ready to receive stores until 8 June, so in the meantime stores were accumulated in temporary locations near the beach.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nThe landing of 102 Beach Sub Area with the [[3rd Canadian Division]] on [[Juno Beach]] was delayed by rough seas and the development of Mike Beach by 7 Beach Group was delayed by fire from [[Vaux-sur-Aure]]. The German stronghold there was eliminated on 8 June by 7 Beach Group, supported by armour. Bad weather delayed the arrival of four [[Coastal trading vessel|coasters]] from England on D-Day and seven more on 7 June. This was offset when the tiny port of [[Courseulles-sur-Mer]] was captured intact on D-Day, allowing {{convert|1000|LT|order=flip}} per day to be unloaded there, but it proved unsuitable for coasters and was abandoned on 10 June.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nAt [[Sword Beach]], 101 Beach Sub Area landed with the [[British 3rd Division]], 5 Beach Group with its assault brigade and 6 Beach Group with its follow-up brigade. Four LCTs, each loaded with {{convert|200|LT|order=flip}} of high priority stores were beached and rapidly unloaded into temporary dumps near the beaches. These had been intended for use on D-Day only but the intended beach maintenance area had not been captured and was not ready to receive stores until 9 June.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nAlthough it was captured intact on D-Day, the small port of [[Ouistreham]] could not be used due to German shellfire from around [[Caen]]. There were some attacks by [[E-boat]]s and a German air raid on 8 June struck the beach maintenance area, destroying {{convert|100000|impgal|l|order=flip}} of petrol and {{convert|400|LT|order=flip}} of ammunition.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=7}} Replacements were ordered with a high priority. Due to this interference, 101 Beach Sub Area posted the lowest receipt-of-stores rates; Sword Beach was closed on 12 July.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=9\u201310}} Minesweeping did not commence at Ouistreham until 21 August and it was not opened to shipping until 3 September.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\n==Build-up==\n{{further|Battle for Caen}}\n[[Bayeux]] was captured on 7 June but the lodgement area was smaller than anticipated, with determined German resistance being encountered. Between 16 and 30 June, the British Second Army mounted a series of operations to capture Caen, but it remained in German hands. Finally, after a bombardment by 420 heavy bombers from [[RAF Bomber Command]] on 7 July, Caen was taken on 9 July. [[Operation Goodwood]] was launched on 18 July and to contain the British and Canadian forces, almost all the German armour was concentrated east of the [[Orne River]], paving the way for a successful advance in the American sector.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=8}}\n\n===Organisation===\nCorps and divisional administrative staffs landed on D-Day. The Second Army staffs began landing the following day, allowing it to assume administrative control on 11 June, but the restricted lodgement area made the corps headquarters reluctant to relinquish control of the depots and dumps around the beaches. The beach sub area commanders found themselves answerable to corps, army and when it arrived, 11 Line of Communications Area. On 14 June, with the lodgement area {{convert|8|to|12|mi}} deep with a front {{convert|50|mi|adj=on}} long, Second Army assumed command of the beach sub areas, marking the end of the assault phase of Overlord.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=277\u2013278}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B8745.jpg|thumb|A convoy of supply lorries moves up through [[Jurques]] on 6 August 1944]]\nTwo army roadheads were created: No. 1 Army Roadhead for I Corps, and No. 2 Army Roadhead for XXX Corps. When the Canadian First Army assumed control of the British I Corps on 21 June, No. 1 Army Roadhead also passed to its control.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=283\u2013286}} Henceforth odd numbered roadheads served the Canadian First Army and even numbered ones the British Second Army.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=297}} No. 2 Army Roadhead formed the nucleus of what became the Rear Maintenance Area (RMA) of the 21st Army Group.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=283\u2013286}} At the RMA, there was a Commander, RASC (CRASC) Supply units, who had eight BSDs, eight DIDs, 13 field bakeries and two field butcheries. There was also a CRASC Petrol Installation, whose command included 28 petrol depots and twelve mobile petrol filling centres (MPFCs).{{sfn|Boileau|1954|p=337}} Each MPFC could refill up to 8,000 jerry cans per day.{{sfn|Boileau|1954|p=340}}\n\nOn 15 June, 151 Forward Maintenance Area was opened by XXX Corps. The FMA concept, which had been used with success in the Mediterranean theatre, was not part of British doctrine. Unlike divisions, which incorporated logistics units, a corps was a purely operational formation and not part of the logistical plan. Doctrine called for the use of pack trains, railway trains which would deliver days' supplies direct to a division. These had worked well in the Great War but had been found to be impractical in the Middle East and were never seriously considered for Overlord.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=283\u2013286}} The FMA was only a few miles from No. 2 Army Roadhead but the XXX Corps staff considered that it knew best, given its combat experience in the [[North African Campaign]] and the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. The other corps of Second Army followed suit and established their own FMAs. Under the FMA scheme, divisions drew maintenance from the FMA rather than the roadhead.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=283\u2013286}}\n\nThe FMA allowed a corps to train newly arrived administrative units, to control the usage of ammunition by the divisions and alleviate the traffic congestion around Bayeux. The British Second Army gave tacit support for the practice, issuing an order that FMAs be called Field Maintenance Centres (FMCs), the original nomenclature in the Mediterranean. Henceforth, Second Army stocked the army roadhead and left the FMCs to the corps. The FMCs were manned using corps resources; each had two DIDs, a petrol depot, a transport company and two RASC composite platoons drawn from corps troops composite companies. Where possible, an MPFC was attached to each FMC. Occasionally they had to be reinforced with some additional transport platoons from Second Army. This organisation allowed an FMC to be operated while another was established. Each FMC held two days' rations and one day's maintenance stocks, two or three days' petrol, which was about {{convert|200000|impgal|l|order=flip}} and {{convert|3500|LT|order=flip}} of ammunition. Corps services such as the reinforcement centre, salvage unit, tank delivery squadron and ordnance field park tended to cluster around the FMC.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=283\u2013286}}{{sfn|Boileau|1954|pp=340\u2013342}}\n\nBy 26 July, 675,000 personnel, 150,000 vehicles, {{convert|680000|LT|order=flip}} of stores and {{convert|68000|LT|order=flip}} of bulk petrol had been landed.

Usage exceeded the seventy rounds per gun per day allocation for the [[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|25-pounder]] guns by six rounds per gun per day and the allocation of fifty rounds per gun per day for the 5.5-inch guns by twelve per gun per day. Fears that the crowded lodgement area would prove a tempting target for the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' led to an overstock of anti-aircraft ammunition. Later shipments of anti-aircraft ammunition were cancelled and other types of artillery ammunition were substituted. The requirement for tank and anti-tank ammunition was also over-estimated.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=287\u2013288, 396\u2013397}} While it seemed to the Germans that the British Army had an unlimited supply of ammunition, this was not the case and a reason why heavy bombers were used to augment the artillery in Operation Goodwood.{{sfn|French|2000|p=118}}\n\n===Mulberry harbour===\n{{main|Mulberry harbour}}\n[[File:The Mulberry artificial harbour off Arromanches in Normandy, September 1944. BU1024.jpg|thumb|left|The Mulberry B artificial harbour in September 1944]]\nNo major ports were expected to be captured in the early stages of Overlord except [[Cherbourg]]. This was expected to take three weeks and it was not large enough to meet the Allied needs. Until a major port could be captured, maintenance would have to be over open beaches that were at the mercy of the weather. Two artificial ([[Mulberry harbours]]) were planned: Mulberry A for the American sector and Mulberry B for the British sector. Work commenced in 1942 and prototypes were tested in 1943. Mulberry A was to have a capacity of {{convert|5000|LT|order=flip}} per day and Mulberry B of {{convert|7000|LT|order=flip}}. Each would handle 1,200 vehicles daily, and provide shelter for small craft.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=254\u2013256}}\n\nMulberry breakwaters consisted of [[blockship]]s, concrete [[Caisson (engineering)|caissons]] known as [[Phoenix breakwaters]] and floating breakwaters known as [[Bombardon breakwater]]s. Their construction consumed tens of thousands of tons of steel and cost \u00a325&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=256\u2013259}} Each harbour had three piers, a barge pier and an LST pier, each with one roadway, and a stores pier with two floating roadways.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|p=373}} When the Overlord plan was expanded in 1944, it was too late to enlarge the Mulberry harbours, so additional small craft shelters known as Gooseberries were provided, one for each invasion beach. The British Gooseberries were No. 3 at [[Arromanches]] on Gold Beach, No. 4 at [[Courseulles]] on Juno Beach and No. 5 at Ouistreham on Sword Beach.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=256\u2013259}}\n\nConstruction of Mulberry B commenced near Arromanches on Gold Beach on 9 June and coasters began discharging inside the breakwaters on 11 June. The first coaster discharged over the store pier roadway on 18 June.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|pp=373\u2013374}} A severe storm\u2014the worst recorded in June in forty years\u2014swept over the channel between 19 and 22 June.{{sfn|Ellis|1962|p=272}} The storm halted discharge of personnel and supplies for 24 hours, destroyed Mulberry A and severely damaged Mulberry B. Components of Mulberry A were salvaged and used to repair and complete Mulberry B.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|pp=369\u2013370}} Phoenix caissons were filled with sand to give them greater stability.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=415}} The second roadway to the stores pier was opened on 6 July. By this time the sheltered area designed for 16 coasters was in use by seven [[Liberty ship]]s and 23 coasters.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|pp=373\u2013374}} It exceeded its designed daily capacity of {{convert|6000|LT|order=flip}}, averaging {{convert|6765|LT|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|p=415}} The ships discharged over their sides into DUKWs and [[Rhino ferries]].{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|pp=373\u2013374}} Ten of the eleven DUKW companies worked Mulberry B. Some 36 DUKWs were lost in the first five days.{{sfn|Boileau|1954|p=330}}\n\nDUKWs were able to operate safely inside the harbour every day except during the storm. Due to it, the LST pier planned to service twenty LSTs per day from 18 June was not opened until 20 July and LSTs had to be dried out\u2014beached and left stranded at low tide while unloading continued. Royal Navy misgivings about drying out store carrying LCTs had been overcome during the planning stages, but it now became necessary to dry out LSTs as well, with considerable consequent damage that was beyond the capacity of the naval repair teams, which slowed LST turnaround.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|pp=373\u2013374}}{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=276}} Because of the storm, only {{convert|19139|LT|order=flip}} of stores were landed by 29 June instead of the planned {{convert|39240|LT|order=flip}}.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=18\u201320}} The main effect was a shortage of ammunition, particularly for the [[25-pounder]]s and 5.5-inch guns, for which demand had been unexpectedly heavy. A high priority was given to additional shipments, with petrol, oil and lubricant (POL) shipments cut to compensate.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=276}} On 20 June, the Navy agreed to allow ammunition ships to enter Mulberry B, even though this was acknowledged to be very dangerous. An additional {{convert|10000|LT|order=flip}} arrived by 27 July, averting a crisis.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=12}}\n\n===Minor ports===\n\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B5910.jpg|thumb|right|A DUKW brings ammunition ashore at [[Arromanches]] on 22 June 1944]]\nIn addition to the Mulberry, small ports were used; Courseulles, which was mainly used by fishing boats, had a draught of {{convert|9|ft|6|in|order=flip|sigfig=2}}, making it suitable only for shallow-draught vessels, such as barges. A daily average of {{convert|850|LT|order=flip}} was unloaded there in June, rising to {{convert|1500|LT|order=flip}} in July and August. Operations ceased on 7 September.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\n[[Port-en-Bessin]] was operated as a bulk petroleum terminal, servicing both the British and American forces. Shallow-draught [[oil tanker]]s drawing up to {{convert|14|ft|order=flip}} could enter the port and larger tankers up to {{convert|5000|grt|lk=on}} could discharge using Tombolas, floating ship-to-shore lines.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|pp=373\u2013374}} Two ship-to-shore lines were in operation by 25 July, and six tanker berths were in operation, with pipelines connected to the bulk petroleum storage terminal, which had a capacity of {{convert|9800|LT|order=flip}} of petrol and {{convert|2000|LT|order=flip}} of [[aviation fuel]].{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=14}} The port was opened to store ships on 12 June, and to tankers on 24 June. Some {{convert|86000|LT|order=flip}} of petrol was discharged by 31 July, and a daily average of {{convert|11125|LT|order=flip}} of stores were discharged until the port was closed on 25 September.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\nCherbourg was captured by the Americans on 27 June but it was very badly damaged and was not opened to shipping until 16 July.{{sfn|Ruppenthal|1953|pp=427, 464}} Some {{convert|500|LT|order=flip}} of its daily capacity was allocated to the British. It contained the only deep-water berths in Allied hands and was useful in reducing the load on Port-en-Bessin. The railway line from Cherbourg to Caen commenced operation on 26 July, using rolling stock captured near Bayeux.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|pp=373\u2013374}} The lack of deep water berths meant that a large proportion of the supplies shipped went in coasters that could discharge at the small ports rather than in large, ocean-going Liberty ships.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nIt was hoped that Cherbourg could handle large and awkward loads, but it had been so badly damaged that it was not sufficiently rehabilitated to do so until late August. In the meantime, they were shipped already loaded on transporters, or unloaded from lighters by cranes at Courseulles or Port-en-Bessin. Although [[Manifest (transportation)|manifests]] were flown across each day, there was still trouble identifying cargo. A commendable but misplaced desire to use all available cargo space often led to one type of stores overlaying another. The result was mixed loads of stores being unloaded into the DUKWs, with a slowing of their turnaround time if they had to deliver to two different inland dumps.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nTo reduce turnaround time and wear on the DUKW tyres, which were in short supply, transshipment areas were established where the DUKWs could transfer their loads to ordinary lorries. There were timber platforms with a mobile crane at one end. DUKWs were loaded by depositing supplies on them over the side of ships in a cargo net. Each DUKW had been equipped with two of these in the UK. A control tower overlooking the port area used a [[loud hailer]] to direct the DUKWs to numbered platforms where a crane would remove the load. The DUKW would be given a replacement cargo net and head back out to the ship. The platform was large enough to permit some sorting of the stores. They would be loaded onto lorries backed up to the other side of the platform, either by hand or using roller runways.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=286}}\n\nBecause the shipping plan was so detailed, with everything carefully planned and scheduled in advance, timely and frequent alterations could not be tolerated. To make up for this, a system of \"express coasters\" was provided, which could carry a known tonnage of whatever was required on a given day. These carried unexpected and unforeseen demands, such as [[baling wire]] to help French farmers with their harvests.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nThe British beaches were closed on 3 September 1944. By this time {{convert|217924|LT|order=flip}} had been discharged through small ports, {{convert|605629|LT|order=flip}} over open beaches, and {{convert|451335|LT|order=flip}} through Mulberry B.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=256\u2013259}} This meant that 25 per cent of the total tonnage had been landed through Cherbourg and the small ports, 12.5 per cent through Mulberry B, and 62.5 per cent over the beaches. The tonnage handled over the beaches greatly exceeded the expectations of the planners; but it is unlikely that the invasion would have been launched in the first place without the reassurance provided by the Mulberry.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=280\u2013281}}\n\n===Ordnance===\n\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B8892.jpg|thumb|left|REME fitters prepare to install a new engine into a [[Sherman tank]]]]\nIn the first four weeks, stores were landed in Landing Reserve packs, each made up of about 8,000 cases containing a mix of stores intended to support a brigade group or the equivalent for thirty days. After that, Beach Maintenance Packs were used. These were similar, but contained a wider variety of stores to support a division for thirty days. Each contained about 12,000 cases, weighing about {{convert|500|LT|order=flip}}. Six Ordnance Beach Detachments landed on D-Day, along with two ammunition companies, two port ammunition detachments and a port ordnance detachment.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=18\u201320}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.da.mod.uk/DesktopModules/EasyDNNNews/DocumentDownload.ashx?portalid=0&moduleid=2116&articleid=924&documentid=1103 |title=The Assault Landings in Normandy \u2013 Order of Battle, Second British Army |publisher=UK Ministry of Defence |access-date=20 December 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe vessel carrying the recce party of 17 Advanced Ordnance Depot was torpedoed and most of the party was lost. A new party was organised, which arrived with the advance party on 13 June. The planned site for the depot near Vaux was satisfactory but at first, the area was occupied by two infantry divisions and the depot opened on 2 July. A vehicle park was established in the vicinity by 17 Vehicle Company on 13 June, mobile baths and laundries landed on 18 June and an industrial gas unit on 24 June to produce oxygen and [[acetylene]] for the workshops.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=18\u201320}}\n\nThe recce party of 14 Advanced Ordnance Depot landed on 28 June, and established the main RMA at [[Audrieu]]. The area was drained and 200 steel framed huts were erected. On 11 June, 17 Base Ammunition Depot arrived and began co-ordinating the stores and ammunition depots. When 15 Base Ammunition Depot arrived on 18 June, it took over those in 104 Beach Sub Area, while 17 Base Ammunition Depot took over those in 101 and 102 Beach Sub Areas. The average daily tonnage handled by the two base ammunition depots in the first two months of the campaign was {{convert|8230|LT|order=flip}}.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=18\u201320}}\n\nSpecial \"drowned\" vehicle parks were established on the beaches for vehicles affected by water. Most swampings were caused not by faulty waterproofing but by landing craft discharging vehicles into more than {{convert|4|ft|order=flip}} of water. The recovery of vehicles on the beaches was a hazardous enterprise owing to shellfire, mines and aircraft. Some 669 vehicles were brought in for repair by XXX Corps workshops between 8 June and 19 June, of which 509 were repaired, the remainder being written off. I Corps workshops established a \"help yourself\" park of written off vehicles from which spare parts could be salvaged, the process being faster than obtaining them from the Beach Maintenance Packs, where correctly identifying parts was difficult. When the Americans developed the [[Rhino tank|Rhino]] tank attachment, the REME were asked to produce two dozen for British units. These were made in three days from steel salvaged from German beach obstacles.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nSeven British field artillery regiments were equipped with [[M7 Priest]] self-propelled guns, which required scarce American {{nowrap|105 mm}} ammunition and replaced them with [[Sexton (artillery)|Sexton]] 25-pounder self-propelled guns, delivered from Britain by 15 Advanced Ordnance Depot.{{sfn|Fernyhough|Harris|1967|p=290}} For [[Operation Totalize]], the Canadians converted the surplus Priests into [[armoured personnel carrier]]s, known as [[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroos]], by removing the guns and welding over the front apertures. The conversion was carried out by Canadian and REME workshops.{{sfn|Kennett|Tatman|1970|p=233}}\n\n===Subsistence===\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B5813.jpg|thumb|Women of [[Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service]] (QAIMNS) eating in the open at No. 79 General Hospital near Bayeux on 20 June 1944]]\nIn the Overlord planning, the 14-man [[ration pack]] that had proved satisfactory in the North African Campaign was adopted for use after the initial assault until bulk rations could be issued. The problem was how to feed the troops in the first 48 hours, as the assault packs used in [[Battle of Madagascar|Madagascar]] and [[Operation Torch]] had been found to be too heavy and bulky proportional to their nutritional value. A new 24-hour ration pack was therefore devised for Overlord. Two proposed ration packs were tested under field conditions in June 1943 and a new 24-hour ration was produced that combined the merits of both. The resulting 24-hour ration pack was a {{convert|4000|cal|kJ|adj=on|order=flip}} ration that weighed {{convert|35|oz|order=flip}} and at {{convert|90|cuin|order=flip}} could fit into the standard British Army [[mess tin]]. The War Office then ordered 7.5&nbsp;million of them, with a delivery date of 31 March 1944. Only by strenuous efforts was this achieved.{{sfn|Boileau|1954|p=293}}\n\nThe field service (FS) bulk ration was in general use by 21 July, although combat units continued using the ration packs for certain operations. The FS ration was entirely composed of preserved components but it was supplemented by shipments of fresh meat, fruit and vegetables. Hospital patients began to receive fresh bread on 13 June, and it was in general issue by 5 August. The mixture of tea, sugar and powdered milk in the ration packs was widely disliked and advantage was taken of an order authorising the issue of tea, sugar and milk to troops engaged in \"heavy and arduous\" night work. As a result, a surprisingly large proportion of the 21st Army Group became engaged in such activities, unbalancing the reserve ration stocks. There were also large unforeseen demands for [[tommy cooker]]s, compact portable stoves fuelled by [[hexamine fuel tablet|hexamine tablets]] that could provide men in a front line trench with a hot cup of tea.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=287}}\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Supplying Allied Forces After D Day, July 1944 B7186.jpg|thumb|left|GMC two-and-a-half-ton 6 \u00d7 6 lorries (CCKW-353) parked on expanded metal standings, taking on fuel supplies]]\nEngineering works were initially the responsibility of the Chief Engineer, Second Army. Engineer store dumps were established at Tailleville (No. 1 Roadhead), Bayeux (No. 2 Roadhead), [[Ver-sur-Mer]] and [[Luc-sur-Mer]], with the engineer base workshop at Le Bergerie. Some 9,000 construction personnel and {{convert|42000|LT|order=flip}} of engineer stores were earmarked for shipment to Normandy by 25 July, but owing to the Channel storm and lack of demand due to the restricted lodgement area, only 6,000 personnel and {{convert|22000|LT|order=flip}} of engineer stores were landed.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=13}} The main engineering tasks were the rehabilitation of the road network, the construction of airfields, the building of bridges, and the development of the bulk POL installation.{{sfn|Buchanan|1953|p=179}}\n\nBy 26 July, the 21st Army Group had 152,499 vehicles in a lodgement area just {{convert|20|mi}} wide and {{convert|10|mi}} deep.{{sfn|Buchanan|1953|p=179}} Despite little or no maintenance during the war, the roads were found to be in better condition than expected but soon deteriorated under constant heavy military traffic. Potholes were filled in and bypasses constructed around villages with narrow streets that were suitable for one-way traffic only. Some additional bridges were erected to remove bottlenecks.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=13}}\n\nA lack of timber was foreseen by the planners and {{convert|12000|LT|order=flip}} was earmarked for shipment. This included 18,000 piles {{convert|60|to|120|ft|order=flip}} long and 47,000 pieces of squared timber. Five Canadian and two British forestry companies were in Normandy by the end of July, but the only sizeable source of timber in the lodgement area was the [[Cerisy Forest]], where there was about {{convert|5000|acre|ha|order=flip}} of [[beech]] and [[oak]]. As in the Great War, much trouble was experienced with trees that had been hit by shrapnel; mine detectors were used on them with mixed results. By 26 September, the forestry companies had produced {{convert|24000|LT|order=flip}} of sawn timber and {{convert|15000|LT|order=flip}} of firewood; five companies produced {{convert|7000|cuyd|order=flip}} of gravel for construction purposes from ten quarries.{{sfn|Buchanan|1953|pp=181\u2013184}}\n\nFive Royal Engineers airfield construction groups and an RAF airfield construction wing were active by the end of June. By the end of July, they had established seventeen airfields in the lodgement area, of which eight were surfaced with square meshed steel and one with bitumised hessian runways. Thirteen of these airfields were in operation by the RAF on 26 July. Problems were encountered with dust, which caused aircraft not fitted with air intake filters to suffer from excessive engine wear. The problem was largely overcome by wet weather in July.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=13}}\n\n===Salvage===\nA field salvage unit and field collecting unit arrived on 14 June. Prior to that, small dumps of salvaged equipment were established by the beach groups under the direction of the Second Army salvage officer. By 29 June, six salvage dumps were operational and those at No. 2 Roadhead had handled over {{convert|1000|LT|order=flip}} of materiel. The base salvage dump was opened in the RMA on 24 July. A major task was retrieving airborne equipment that lay strewn about the landing and drop zones, including gliders. Souvenir hunters were responsible for the loss of instruments and fittings from many gliders. Large numbers of parachutes were not recovered, owing to their being prized by soldiers and civilians alike for their silk. By 25 July, {{convert|7328|LT|order=flip}} of stores had been returned to ordnance.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=23}}{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=291\u2013292}}\n\n===Casualties===\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B5802.jpg|thumb|An operation is performed at No. 79 General Hospital near Bayeux on 20 June 1944]]\n[[Field ambulance]]s landed with the assault brigades and each beach group had a self-contained medical organisation with two field dressing stations, two field surgical units and a field transfusion unit; most were operational within 90 minutes of [[H-hour (D-day)|H-Hour]]. [[Casualty clearing station]]s and hospitals began arriving on 8 June, and these were concentrated in three medical areas, around [[Hermanville-sur-Mer]], [[Reviers]] and [[Ryes]]. On 12 June the installations in the Hermanville area moved to [[Douvres-la-D\u00e9livrande]] to make way for an expansion of the nearby ammunition depot. In late June the area around Bayeux was developed as the main Line of Communications hospital area. When HQ Line of Communications assumed administrative command on 13 July, it took over the Bayeux and Reviers groups, while responsibility for the D\u00e9livrande group passed to the First Canadian Army.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=24\u201326}}\n\nThe fighting was less severe than anticipated and casualties were lower. By 26 July, 44,503 British and 13,323 Canadian reinforcements had been dispatched to the 21st Army Group. By the same date, 38,581 casualties had been evacuated by sea. Air evacuation began on 13 June and by 26 July 7,719 casualties were evacuated to the UK.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=24\u201326}} Because of doubts about the availability of water in the lodgement area, large quantities of packaged potable water was shipped, particularly for the wounded on the beaches. The lower than expected casualties resulted in an accumulation of filled water containers which were not required.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=276}}\n\nCasualties among the infantry were particularly severe; although infantrymen made only 20 per cent of the 21st Army Group, the infantry suffered 70 per cent of its casualties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/tactics-and-the-cost-of-victory-in-normandy |title=Tactics and the Cost of Victory in Normandy |first=Ian |last=Carter |access-date=10 January 2018 |publisher=Imperial War Memorial }}</ref> On 16 August it was decided to disband the [[59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division]] and the 70th Infantry Brigade of the [[49th (West Riding) Infantry Division]] to provide infantry reinforcements for other units.

Each was staffed to cater for 200 officers and 2,000 [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. The first of these arrived on 7 June, and was employed as a collection and transit centre. The next arrived on 11 June, and established a POW camp near Arromanches. Camps had been established in the UK for up to 25,000 prisoners but only 12,153 were captured by 26 July. Most were German but there were also Russians, Poles and other nationalities. Most were taken to the UK, but some were retained for labour duties. POW escorts were provided by the War Office and were based at [[Southampton]]. They crossed to Normandy on LSTs, collected the prisoners and took them back to the UK. This procedure did not work as well as planned, because the prisoners were not always ready to move when required, and the LSTs were unable to wait for them.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=24\u201326}}\n\nThe first CMP units to arrive landed on D-Day. These were three divisional provost companies, six beach provost companies, and two corps provost companies, which were used for traffic control. During the build-up phase, an additional company arrived with each division; four provost companies, four traffic control (TC) companies, and a vulnerable points (VP) company for each army and seven provost, seven TC and three VP companies for the Line of Communications Area. The VP companies were used to guard POWs. Delays in getting provost units ashore allowed traffic congestion to occur on the first two days, but the Line of Communications Area was established faster than planned when traffic congestion became a problem. One check point saw 18,836 vehicles pass it in a day, roughly one every four seconds. Despite all efforts, key towns like Courseulles and Bayeuex soon became bottlenecks. Bypasses were built, and strict movement control was instituted. Under this regime, operational vehicles operated at night when the volume of administrative traffic was lighter.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=23}} Five movement control groups, Nos 6, 17, 18, 19 and 20, were assigned to 21st Army Group.

[[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]] was captured on 16 August, and three days later the Canadians and Americans linked up, closing the [[Falaise Pocket]]. On 26 August, the 21st Army Group issued orders for an advance to the north to capture [[Antwerp]]. After a rapid advance (The Swan), the British [[Guards Armoured Division]] liberated [[Brussels]] on 3 September and the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]] captured Antwerp the following day.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=31\u201336}}\n\nAs the armies moved forward, No. 3 Army Roadhead was established for the First Canadian Army at [[Lisieux]] on 24 August and No. 4 Army Roadhead for the British Second Army near [[L'Aigle]] on 26 August. This was soon so far behind the advancing units that intermediate dumps known as \"cushions\" were established to which supplies required by the corps were sited forward of the roadhead in the direction in which the next roadhead would be established. The first of these, No. 1 Cushion, was established at Falaise on 21 August to support the First Canadian Army. No. 2 Cushion was established near [[Beauvais]] on 1 September and No. 3 near [[Doullens]] the next day. No. 5 Army Roadhead was sited on the road between [[Dieppe]] and [[Abbeville]] on 3 September, No. 6 Army Roadhead near Brussels on 6 September and No. 7 Army Roadhead near [[B\u00e9thune]] on 15 September. The 21st Army Group headquarters moved to Brussels on 23 September, and SHAEF moved to [[Versailles]] around the same time.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=31\u201336}}\n\nEach army roadhead had a CRASC Supply Unit, who controlled two BSDs, four DIDs and four mobile field bakeries, and a CRASC Petrol Installation, who controlled five petrol depots. About {{convert|26000|LT|order=flip}} of packaged fuel in jerry cans was held at a roadhead.{{sfn|Boileau|1954|pp=341\u2013342}} In mid-September, 12 Line of Communications Area became responsible for logistical activities south of the Seine, while 11 Line of Communications Area became responsible for those to the north.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=40}}\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU177.jpg|thumb|British troops enjoy the attention of French girls after bringing a food convoy to Paris, 29 August 1944.]]\nWith the establishment of No. 6 Army Roadhead, the 21st Army Group line of communications was {{convert|400|mi}} long, with the main depots still at the RMA and few stocks between them and the FMCs. A crucial decision was taken on 30 August to gamble on the early capture of [[Le Havre]], Dieppe and [[Boulogne]], and slash receipts from {{convert|16000|to|7000|LT|order=flip}} per day, to free transport, which would have been used to clear the beaches, for moving supplies forward of the RMA.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=31\u201336}} Vehicle maintenance was neglected but this presented few problems as most of the vehicles were new. An exception was 1,400 [[Austin K5]] three-ton lorries, along with all their replacement engines, which were found to have faulty [[piston]]s and gave trouble.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=47}}\n\nAdditional general transport companies were shipped urgently from the UK and some new companies were formed in Normandy, increasing the number of companies for the British Second Army from six to thirty-nine.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=300}} The War Office agreed to loan another 12 general transport companies to the 21st Army Group but only five had arrived by 26 September.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=304}} These were formed from [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] and Mixed Transport Command.{{sfn|Boileau|1954|p=350}} A new headquarters called TRANCO was created on 10 September and all road and railway transport was withdrawn from the armies and assigned to it, with the mission of moving supplies from the RMA to the army roadheads.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=31\u201336}}\n\nThe First Canadian Army converted a [[tank transporter]] trailer into a load carrier by welding on steel plank normally used for airfield construction to form a base and sides. The experiment was successful and the modified tank transporters could carry {{convert|16.5|LT|order=flip}} of supplies, {{convert|36|LT|order=flip}} of ammunition, or {{convert|10|LT|order=flip}} of POL, except on narrow roads. The British Second Army converted a whole company in this manner.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=303\u2013304}} The 21st Army Group initially had only two companies of tank transporters, and these were required in the UK until additional tank transporters arrived from the United States.{{sfn|Boileau|1954|pp=325\u2013326}}\n\nAnother expedient was to issue 30 additional lorries to four general transport companies that had enough relief drivers to man them. Two 10-ton companies were equipped with surplus 5-ton trailers. There were also eight DUKW companies, one of which was on loan to the US Army, and was involved in working [[Utah Beach]]. Two other companies were retained as DUKW companies and the remaining five were re-equipped with regular 3-ton lorries. In addition to the DUKW company, a 6-ton and a 3-ton general transport company were loaned to the US Army. These two companies were returned to the 21st Army Group on 4 September.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=303\u2013304}}{{sfn|Boileau|1954|pp=349\u2013350}} During the advance from the Seine, the Second Army employed only six of its eight infantry divisions, so the transport of two could be used to help maintain the other six.{{sfn|Ellis|1968|p=72}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU482.jpg|thumb|left|British vehicles enter Brussels on 4 September 1944]]\nWhile the railway lines in northern France and Belgium had suffered damage, this was much less than of the lines south of the Seine. Commencing on 10 September, trains were loaded in the RMA and supplies shipped to a railhead near Beauvais, where they were loaded onto lorries that took them across the Seine. On the other side, they were loaded onto trains for the final journey to No. 6 Army Roadhead. Work began on a new {{convert|529|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} bridge over the Seine at [[Le Manoir, Eure|Le Manoir]] on 8 September and it was opened a fortnight later. Some bridges over the [[Somme (river)|Somme]] were also down but were bypassed by a diversion at Doullens. A bridge at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]] in Belgium was repaired by the Belgian authorities.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=305}}\n\nProvision had been made in the Overlord plans for supply by air. Apart from supplying the Polish 1st Armoured Division for a short time, little use had been made of this, with the RAF freight service accounting for less than {{convert|200|LT|order=flip}} per week. In August, demand doubled from {{convert|12|to|25|LT}} per day. In the week ending 9 September {{convert|1000|LT|order=flip}} of petrol and {{convert|300|LT|order=flip}} of supplies were delivered to airfields around Amiens, [[Vitry-en-Artois]] and [[Douai]]. The following week, {{convert|2200|LT|order=flip}} of ammunition, {{convert|800|LT|order=flip}} of POL and {{convert|300|LT|order=flip}} of supplies were delivered. [[Haren Airport|Evere Airport]], the main airport at Brussels, was brought into use and {{convert|18000|LT|order=flip}} was landed there over the next five weeks.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=31\u201336}}{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=306}}\n\nAfter the [[liberation of Paris]], it had become apparent that the Germans had stripped the capital of its food and other resources for themselves before their capitulation. Many Parisians were desperate and Allied soldiers even used their own meagre rations to help. The [[Civil Affairs]] of SHAEF therefore requested an urgent shipment of {{convert|3000|LT|order=flip}} of food. A supply earmarked for just this purpose had been set aside at [[Bulford]] long before and on 27 August the first {{convert|500|LT|order=flip}} were delivered by RAF. This convoy labelled \"''Vivres Pour Paris''\" entered a day later, following which {{convert|500|ST|order=flip}} were delivered a day by the British. [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Dakotas]] were flown in which also delivered 500 tons a day. Along with French civilians outside Paris bringing in local resources, within ten days the food crisis in Paris was overcome.{{sfn|Coles|Weinberg|1964|pp=744\u2013745 }}\n\nA minor crisis developed due to a shortage of jerry cans. Discipline regarding the return of containers was lax during the advance, resulting in the Second Army's path through France and Belgium becoming strewn with discarded cans, many of which were quickly appropriated by the civilian population. As the advance continued, the time taken for cans to be returned lengthened, and a severe shortage developed which took some time to overcome. The result was a depletion of stocks at the depots, and the imposition of petrol rationing.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=308}}\n\n===Ports===\n[[File:RASC troops stacking ration boxes in the harbour at Dieppe, 14 October 1944. B10867.jpg|thumb|RASC troops stacking ration boxes in the harbour at Dieppe on 14 October 1944]]\nAntwerp was captured on 4 September but the port was unusable until 29 November because the [[Scheldt]] estuary remained in German hands until after the [[Battle of the Scheldt]].{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=312\u2013313}} In the meantime, a port construction and repair company arrived on 12 September and began the rehabilitation of the port. The quays were cleared of obstructions and the Kruisschans Lock was repaired by December.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|pp=74\u201375}} The port was opened to coasters on 26 November and deep draught shipping on 28 November when the Royal Navy completed minesweeping activity.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=71}}\n\nAfter crossing the Seine, I Corps had swung left to take Le Havre. Although [[Saint-Valery-en-Caux]] was captured on 2 September, a full-scale assault was required to take Le Havre on 10 September, with support from the Royal Navy and RAF Bomber Command, which dropped almost {{convert|5000|LT|order=flip}} of bombs. By the time the garrison surrendered on 12 September, the port was badly damaged. Unexpectedly, the port was allocated to the American forces.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=312\u2013313}}\n\n[[Le Tr\u00e9port]] and Dieppe were captured by the Canadians on 1 September. Although the port facilities were almost intact, the approaches were extensively mined and several days of minesweeping were required; the first coaster docked there on 7 September.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|pp=312\u2013313}} The rail link from Dieppe to Amiens was ready to accept traffic the day before.{{sfn|Higham|Knighton|1955|p=380}} By the end of September, it had a capacity of {{convert|6000|to|7000|LT|order=flip}} per day.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=40}} Le Tr\u00e9port became a satellite port of Dieppe.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=332}} Boulogne was captured on 22 September and Calais on 29 September.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=35}} Both were badly damaged and Boulogne was not opened until 12 October. [[Ostend]] was captured on 9 September and in spite of extensive demolitions it was opened on 28 September.{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=332}}\n\n===Salvage===\nEnormous quantities of salvage were left at Falaise, and the HQ of the [[197th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade|197th Infantry Brigade]] was given responsibility for collecting it. Prisoners of war were used for labour. Depots for captured enemy stores were established at [[Cormelles-le-Royal]] for the area south of the Seine and at Amiens for north of the Seine. Top priority for collection was given to collecting jerry cans, which were in short supply. About 5,000 horses were captured, which were given to French farmers. By 26 September, {{convert|21840|LT|order=flip}} of salvage had been collected and turned over to ordnance depots.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=53}}\n\n===Prisoners===\nOnly small numbers of prisoners, mostly medical personnel who were used to care for wounded POWs, were retained for labour by 21st Army Group until August, when HQ Line of Communications was authorised to employ up to 40,000 of them. By 24 August, some 18,135 were being held and this climbed to 27,214 by 4 September. Thousands of prisoners were taken during the rapid pursuit phase and efforts were made to reduce prisoner numbers, shipping them to the UK via Arromanches, and later Dieppe. Numbers continued to increase, and exceeded 50,000 at the end of September, by which time over 90,000 prisoners had been shipped to the UK.{{sfn|21st Army Group|1945|p=56}}\n\n==Outcome==\nBy mid-September, the Allies had liberated most of France and Belgium. During the first seven weeks the advance had been much slower than anticipated, and the short lines of communication had provided an opportunity to accumulate reserves of supplies. This had been followed by a breakout and pursuit in which the advance had been much faster than contemplated and the rapidity of the advance and the length of the line of communications had thrown up severe logistical problems that, together with increased German resistance, threatened to stall the Allied armies.{{sfn|Ellis|1968|pp=1\u20133}}\n\nThe success of the 21st Army Group was in large part due to its logistics. The supply system developed by the British Army in the desert had become standard procedure, and the staffs and units serving the line of communications \"reached a high degree of efficiency in their own particular task\".{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=374}} The support of the army group over the beaches and through the artificial Mulberry port constructed for the purpose was a logistical feat. So too was the rapid advance across France and Belgium, which exploited the success achieved in Normandy. This was made possible only by the enormous capacity and tremendous flexibility of the logistical system. \"No Army or Navy\", Eisenhower wrote, \"was ever supported so generously or so well\".{{sfn|Carter|Kann|1961|p=375}}\n\nThe logistical performance of the 21st Army Group even outstripped that of the neighbouring US 12th Army Group, as the challenges facing the 21st Army Group were not as great; its lines of communications were shorter, fewer divisions were involved and some of the Channel ports had been captured, whereas the Breton ports intended to support the Americans, except for [[Saint-Malo]], had not. Montgomery remained confident that it was still possible to end the war in 1944 but he was wrong.{{sfn|Ellis|1968|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |author=21st Army Group |title=The Administrative History of the Operations of 21 Army Group on the Continent of Europe 6 June 1944 \u2013 8 May 1945 |location=Germany |date=November 1945 |publisher=21st Army Group |oclc=911257199 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Boileau |first=D.

(These lands had been held by the family since before the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086.) This was owing to the fact that her mother Lady Mohun (died 1404) had sold the [[reversion (law)|reversion]] of the estates in 1374 to Lady Elizabeth Luttrell (d.1395), wife of Sir Andrew Luttrell and a daughter of [[Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon]] (1303\u20131377).<ref>[[Henry Maxwell Lyte|Maxwell Lyte, Sir Henry]], ''A History of Dunster and of the Families of Mohun and Luttrell'', Part I (The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., London 1909), [https://archive.org/stream/historyofdunster01lyte#page/n17/mode/2up pp. xii-xiii] (Internet Archive).</ref> The [[Sir Hugh Luttrell|Luttrell family]] and their later descendants in a female line from 1737 owned Dunster Castle until 1976, when it was donated to the [[National Trust]].\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nPhilippa married three times: \n*First to [[Baron Fitzwalter|Walter Fitzwalter, 4th Baron Fitzwalter]] (d. 26 September 1386); this marriage produced one son named Walter, 5th Baron Fitzwalter (d. 1407) mentioned in his mother's will.\n*Secondly to Sir John Golafre (d. 18 November 1396), the bastard son of Sir John Golafre (d.1379) of Sarsden in Oxfordshire, Bury Blunsdon in Wiltshire, Fyfield in Garford and Frilford in Berkshire, eldest son of Sir John Golafre (d.1363), MP.

(These lands had been held by the family since before the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086.) This was owing to the fact that her mother Lady Mohun (died 1404) had sold the [[reversion (law)|reversion]] of the estates in 1374 to Lady Elizabeth Luttrell (d.1395), wife of Sir Andrew Luttrell and a daughter of [[Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon]] (1303\u20131377).<ref>[[Henry Maxwell Lyte|Maxwell Lyte, Sir Henry]], ''A History of Dunster and of the Families of Mohun and Luttrell'', Part I (The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., London 1909), [https://archive.org/stream/historyofdunster01lyte#page/n17/mode/2up pp. xii-xiii] (Internet Archive).</ref> The [[Sir Hugh Luttrell|Luttrell family]] and their later descendants in a female line from 1737 owned Dunster Castle until 1976, when it was donated to the [[National Trust]].\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nPhilippa married three times: \n*First to [[Baron Fitzwalter|Walter Fitzwalter, 4th Baron Fitzwalter]] (d. 26 September 1386); this marriage produced one son named Walter, 5th Baron Fitzwalter (d. 1407) mentioned in his mother's will.\n*Secondly to Sir John Golafre (d. 18 November 1396), the bastard son of Sir John Golafre (d.1379) of Sarsden in Oxfordshire, Bury Blunsdon in Wiltshire, Fyfield in Garford and Frilford in Berkshire, eldest son of Sir John Golafre (d.1363), MP. He was a favoured knight of the chamber of King Richard II (1377\u20131399) and was Constable of [[Wallingford Castle]]. He was a notable jouster.

He also wrestled as '''Stan Dupp''', one of the [[kayfabe]] cousins stable [[The Dupps]] in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW). He's also appeared in WCW, and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA). He is currently working for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nMueller started his career training in Central States Wrestling Alliance,<ref name=\"IGN\"/> in the [[Missouri]] area, in 1997. He then moved on to World League Wrestling (WLW) and [[Harley Race's Wrestling Academy]] training camp in 1999 and began his wrestling career in WLW. On April 11, 2000, as Trevor Rhodes, he won the WLW Heavyweight Championship by defeating [[Tonga Fifita|Meng]]. He then made a name for himself as part of [[The Dupps]], a [[hillbilly]] [[tag team]] consisting of [[kayfabe]] brothers Stan Dupp (Mueller) and [[Bo Dupp]]. As a team, The Dupps wrestled in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW), and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA). While in OVW, Mueller teamed with [[Lance Cade]]. The team was known as [[Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch|TNT]]. Mueller signed a WWE development deal in June 2005.\n\n===World Wrestling Entertainment (2005&ndash;2008)===\n{{Main|Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch}}\nMueller signed a 3-year deal with World Wrestling Entertainment in July, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5018658&sc=emaf|title=Harley Race's Night-School Pro Wrestling Classes|accessdate=|publisher=National Public Radio}}</ref> On August 22, 2005 a promo was shown showcasing Mueller's debut along with the returning [[Lance Cade]]. He was repackaged as Trevor Murdoch (the surname coming from his likeness to wrestling legend [[Dick Murdoch]], though the two are not related), and the team was simply known as [[Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch|Cade and Murdoch]]. Cade, playing a smooth-talking [[cowboy]], while Murdoch appeared to be an angry \"[[white trash]]\" [[Southern United States|southern]] [[Truck driver|trucker]].\n\n[[File:Cade&Murdoch.jpg|thumb|left|Murdoch (left) with [[Lance Cade]] in 2005]]\nCade and Murdoch won their debut match on the September 5, 2005, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''. They defeated [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Champion]]s [[Hurricane and Rosey]] in a non-title match, earning themselves a title match at [[Unforgiven (2005)|Unforgiven]]. During the match, Murdoch delivered an [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Elevated DDT|elevated DDT]] on [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] to the outside, causing The Hurricane to suffer a [[Stinger (medicine)|stinger]]. This allowed Cade and Murdoch to win the World Tag Team Championship. They would eventually lose their title at [[Taboo Tuesday (2005)|Taboo Tuesday]] to [[Big Show and Kane]].\n\nOn November 28 during his match against [[Shelton Benjamin]], commentator [[Joey Styles]] acknowledged that Murdoch and Lance Cade were no longer a tag team. It was revealed on ''WWE Unlimited'', that Trevor Murdoch set his sights on [[Ric Flair]] and the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]]. On ''Unlimited'', Murdoch had been reviewing movies that were, at the time, playing in theaters, such as ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', and ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]''. The first two movie reviews displayed various sexual habits, while the third showed cruelty in his past. The underlying point of all the reviews that Murdoch was trying to convey is that he believes \"city folk\" have quite an easy life, as opposed to his.\n\nAfter breaking up with Cade, he wrestled in singles competition on ''[[WWE Heat|Heat]]'', normally winning most of his matches while still making small appearances on ''Raw''. He would also have a short feud with [[The Heart Throbs]] on ''Heat'' which involved him defeating both of them in singles action and gaining a spot in the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|2006 Royal Rumble]], though he did not win. He then moved on to a short [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Dustin Rhodes|Goldust]] but was unsuccessful in beating him. He would then feud with both Goldust and his tag partner [[Gene Snitsky|Snitsky]]. This led to him helping former partner Cade win his matches and hinted at the two of them reforming their team.\n\nCade and Murdoch later reformed their tag team, with Cade having a new look with long jet black hair. On the September 4 edition of ''Raw'', Murdoch and Cade lost a number one contender's [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat Match]] for the World Tag Team Title at [[Unforgiven (2006)|Unforgiven]]. Murdoch and Cade then starred in a WWE.com skit, parodying a [[KFC]] commercial, where Murdoch mistakenly told Cade he ate the bones, despite eating the boneless original recipe bites.<ref>bpless23.webs.com/segmentsinterviews.htm</ref> [[The Highlanders (professional wrestling)|The Highlanders]] won the match when they pinned [[Charlie Haas]] who was teamed with [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Murdoch and Cade then joined forces with [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] to oppose [[D-Generation X]] ([[Triple H]] and [[Shawn Michaels]]).\n\n[[Image:WWE-Triple-Threat-Tag-Title-Match,-RLA-Melb-10.11.2007.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Murdoch (holding the belt) stirs-up his opponents prior to a tag-title match]]\nCade and Murdoch began a feud in April with World Tag Team Champions [[Hardy Boyz|The Hardys]], leading to their title match at [[Backlash (2007)|Backlash]], which The Hardys won. Cade and Murdoch suddenly gained a great deal of respect for The Hardys and began to praise their abilities. The Hardys then began an alliance with Cade and Murdoch. Despite the alliance, Cade and Murdoch faced The Hardys in a rematch at [[Judgment Day (2007)|Judgment Day]] which The Hardys won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/cademurdochlight|title=Cade & Murdoch on path of right after \u2018seeing the light\u2019|publisher=WWE}}</ref> On the June 4 edition of ''Raw'', Cade and Murdoch were given another shot at the World Tag Team Championship against The Hardys. Cade and Murdoch were finally successful, becoming two time World Tag Team Champions. When Cade made the pin on [[Jeff Hardy]], Hardy's foot was on the ropes but was pushed off by Murdoch. After the match, when [[Matt Hardy]] argued with Cade and Murdoch, they attacked Matt and Jeff with the tag belts, becoming heels once again. They successfully defended their titles against The Hardys at [[Vengeance: Night of Champions]] after Cade pinned Jeff and claimed they retained their belts \"all by the rules\". After that Cade and Murdoch appeared on ''Raw'' and ''Heat'' in matches against [[Paul London and Brian Kendrick|London and Kendrick]], [[The Highlanders (professional wrestling)|The Highlanders]], and [[Cryme Tyme]]. On July 23 on ''Raw'', Cade and Murdoch teamed up with [[Eddie Fatu|Umaga]] to face [[John Cena]] and [[Candice Michelle|Candice]] in a Champions-only handicap tag team match. During the match, Cade and Murdoch trapped Candice in order to set her up for Umaga to attack, until [[Jeff Hardy]] came out and attacked Umaga with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Chair shot|steel chair]]. After Candice left scared, and Umaga was chased to the back by Jeff, Cade & Murdoch were left to square off against John Cena. Cena defeated them when he threw Cade out of the ring and gave Murdoch an [[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|FU]].<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/07232007/ WWE: TV Shows > Raw > Archive > 07/23/2007]</ref> Murdoch, along with Cade lost the titles at a [[house show]] on September 5 to Paul London and Brian Kendrick,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/|title=History of the World Tag Team Championship|accessdate=|publisher=WWE}}</ref> but beat them to take the titles back on the last day of the tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2006/1189056627.shtml|title=WWE Raw House Show Results - 9/5/07|accessdate=|publisher=wrestleview.com}}</ref><!-- Please do NOT revert per discussion at [[WP:PW]]. --> Murdoch and Cade remained champions until the Raw XV Anniversary show, losing the World Tag Team Championships to the team of [[Bob Holly|Hardcore Holly]] and [[Cody Rhodes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/12102007/|title=Rhodes and Holly golden on Raw\u2019s 15th Anniversary|accessdate=|publisher=WWE}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/|title=History Of The World Tag Team Championship|publisher=WWE}}</ref>\n\nLate in April 2008, Murdoch began to develop a [[country music|country singing gimmick]].

On October 18, Murdoch returned to World League Wrestling facing [[Chris Masters]] and [[Go Shiozaki]] in a match for the WLW Heavyweight Championship. Murdoch participated in Revolution Strong Style Tournament and Candido Cup and lost both.

He also wrestled as '''Stan Dupp''', one of the [[kayfabe]] cousins stable [[The Dupps]] in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW). He's also appeared in WCW, and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA). He is currently working for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nMueller started his career training in Central States Wrestling Alliance,<ref name=\"IGN\"/> in the [[Missouri]] area, in 1997. He then moved on to World League Wrestling (WLW) and [[Harley Race's Wrestling Academy]] training camp in 1999 and began his wrestling career in WLW. On April 11, 2000, as Trevor Rhodes, he won the WLW Heavyweight Championship by defeating [[Tonga Fifita|Meng]]. He then made a name for himself as part of [[The Dupps]], a [[hillbilly]] [[tag team]] consisting of [[kayfabe]] brothers Stan Dupp (Mueller) and [[Bo Dupp]]. As a team, The Dupps wrestled in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW), and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA). While in OVW, Mueller teamed with [[Lance Cade]]. The team was known as [[Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch|TNT]]. Mueller signed a WWE development deal in June 2005.\n\n===World Wrestling Entertainment (2005&ndash;2008)===\n{{Main|Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch}}\nMueller signed a 3-year deal with World Wrestling Entertainment in July, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5018658&sc=emaf|title=Harley Race's Night-School Pro Wrestling Classes|accessdate=|publisher=National Public Radio}}</ref> On August 22, 2005 a promo was shown showcasing Mueller's debut along with the returning [[Lance Cade]]. He was repackaged as Trevor Murdoch (the surname coming from his likeness to wrestling legend [[Dick Murdoch]], though the two are not related), and the team was simply known as [[Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch|Cade and Murdoch]]. Cade, playing a smooth-talking [[cowboy]], while Murdoch appeared to be an angry \"[[white trash]]\" [[Southern United States|southern]] [[Truck driver|trucker]].\n\n[[File:Cade&Murdoch.jpg|thumb|left|Murdoch (left) with [[Lance Cade]] in 2005]]\nCade and Murdoch won their debut match on the September 5, 2005, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''. They defeated [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Champion]]s [[Hurricane and Rosey]] in a non-title match, earning themselves a title match at [[Unforgiven (2005)|Unforgiven]]. During the match, Murdoch delivered an [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Elevated DDT|elevated DDT]] on [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] to the outside, causing The Hurricane to suffer a [[Stinger (medicine)|stinger]]. This allowed Cade and Murdoch to win the World Tag Team Championship. They would eventually lose their title at [[Taboo Tuesday (2005)|Taboo Tuesday]] to [[Big Show and Kane]].\n\nOn November 28 during his match against [[Shelton Benjamin]], commentator [[Joey Styles]] acknowledged that Murdoch and Lance Cade were no longer a tag team. It was revealed on ''WWE Unlimited'', that Trevor Murdoch set his sights on [[Ric Flair]] and the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]]. On ''Unlimited'', Murdoch had been reviewing movies that were, at the time, playing in theaters, such as ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', and ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]''. The first two movie reviews displayed various sexual habits, while the third showed cruelty in his past. The underlying point of all the reviews that Murdoch was trying to convey is that he believes \"city folk\" have quite an easy life, as opposed to his.\n\nAfter breaking up with Cade, he wrestled in singles competition on ''[[WWE Heat|Heat]]'', normally winning most of his matches while still making small appearances on ''Raw''. He would also have a short feud with [[The Heart Throbs]] on ''Heat'' which involved him defeating both of them in singles action and gaining a spot in the [[Royal Rumble (2006)|2006 Royal Rumble]], though he did not win. He then moved on to a short [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Dustin Rhodes|Goldust]] but was unsuccessful in beating him. He would then feud with both Goldust and his tag partner [[Gene Snitsky|Snitsky]]. This led to him helping former partner Cade win his matches and hinted at the two of them reforming their team.\n\nCade and Murdoch later reformed their tag team, with Cade having a new look with long jet black hair. On the September 4 edition of ''Raw'', Murdoch and Cade lost a number one contender's [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat Match]] for the World Tag Team Title at [[Unforgiven (2006)|Unforgiven]]. Murdoch and Cade then starred in a WWE.com skit, parodying a [[KFC]] commercial, where Murdoch mistakenly told Cade he ate the bones, despite eating the boneless original recipe bites.<ref>bpless23.webs.com/segmentsinterviews.htm</ref> [[The Highlanders (professional wrestling)|The Highlanders]] won the match when they pinned [[Charlie Haas]] who was teamed with [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Murdoch and Cade then joined forces with [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] to oppose [[D-Generation X]] ([[Triple H]] and [[Shawn Michaels]]).\n\n[[Image:WWE-Triple-Threat-Tag-Title-Match,-RLA-Melb-10.11.2007.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Murdoch (holding the belt) stirs-up his opponents prior to a tag-title match]]\nCade and Murdoch began a feud in April with World Tag Team Champions [[Hardy Boyz|The Hardys]], leading to their title match at [[Backlash (2007)|Backlash]], which The Hardys won. Cade and Murdoch suddenly gained a great deal of respect for The Hardys and began to praise their abilities. The Hardys then began an alliance with Cade and Murdoch. Despite the alliance, Cade and Murdoch faced The Hardys in a rematch at [[Judgment Day (2007)|Judgment Day]] which The Hardys won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/cademurdochlight|title=Cade & Murdoch on path of right after \u2018seeing the light\u2019|publisher=WWE}}</ref> On the June 4 edition of ''Raw'', Cade and Murdoch were given another shot at the World Tag Team Championship against The Hardys. Cade and Murdoch were finally successful, becoming two time World Tag Team Champions. When Cade made the pin on [[Jeff Hardy]], Hardy's foot was on the ropes but was pushed off by Murdoch. After the match, when [[Matt Hardy]] argued with Cade and Murdoch, they attacked Matt and Jeff with the tag belts, becoming heels once again. They successfully defended their titles against The Hardys at [[Vengeance: Night of Champions]] after Cade pinned Jeff and claimed they retained their belts \"all by the rules\". After that Cade and Murdoch appeared on ''Raw'' and ''Heat'' in matches against [[Paul London and Brian Kendrick|London and Kendrick]], [[The Highlanders (professional wrestling)|The Highlanders]], and [[Cryme Tyme]]. On July 23 on ''Raw'', Cade and Murdoch teamed up with [[Eddie Fatu|Umaga]] to face [[John Cena]] and [[Candice Michelle|Candice]] in a Champions-only handicap tag team match. During the match, Cade and Murdoch trapped Candice in order to set her up for Umaga to attack, until [[Jeff Hardy]] came out and attacked Umaga with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Chair shot|steel chair]]. After Candice left scared, and Umaga was chased to the back by Jeff, Cade & Murdoch were left to square off against John Cena. Cena defeated them when he threw Cade out of the ring and gave Murdoch an [[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|FU]].<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/07232007/ WWE: TV Shows > Raw > Archive > 07/23/2007]</ref> Murdoch, along with Cade lost the titles at a [[house show]] on September 5 to Paul London and Brian Kendrick,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/|title=History of the World Tag Team Championship|accessdate=|publisher=WWE}}</ref> but beat them to take the titles back on the last day of the tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2006/1189056627.shtml|title=WWE Raw House Show Results - 9/5/07|accessdate=|publisher=wrestleview.com}}</ref><!-- Please do NOT revert per discussion at [[WP:PW]]. --> Murdoch and Cade remained champions until the Raw XV Anniversary show, losing the World Tag Team Championships to the team of [[Bob Holly|Hardcore Holly]] and [[Cody Rhodes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/12102007/|title=Rhodes and Holly golden on Raw\u2019s 15th Anniversary|accessdate=|publisher=WWE}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/|title=History Of The World Tag Team Championship|publisher=WWE}}</ref>\n\nLate in April 2008, Murdoch began to develop a [[country music|country singing gimmick]].
