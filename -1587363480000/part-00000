Though initial hostilities between the sides started in [[1770s]], the actual warfare began on February 1785 and ended in 1787. It is widely believed that the war broke out as a result of the desire of the ever-expanding Marathas to recover lost territories from the state of Mysore.\n\n== Situation on the Indian subcontinent in the 18th century == \n\n18th century saw a steady decline of once a dominant power on the whole subcontinent \u2013 [[Mughal Empire]]. Apart from the [[Nader Shah's invasion of India|disastrous invasion by the Afsharid ruler of Iran, Nader Shah]] in 1739, Mughals were successfully contested by Maratha Empire, which is largely credited for ending Mughal\u2019s rule in India<ref>{{cite journal |first=M.

Meanwhile, British East India Company was asserting its influence in India and was engaged in a series of wars with Mysore which weakened the latter to the point that it ceased to exist as an independen kingdom by the end of the century<ref>Chopra et al. (2003), pp. 79\u201380; Kamath (2001), pp. 233\u2013234</ref>.\n\n== Mysore wars with the British == \n\nMysore was a relatively small kingdom in the beginning of 1700s. However, able rulers such as [[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] transformed the kingdom and [[Westernization|westernized]] the army that it soon turned into a military threat both to the British and Maratha Empire<ref>Roy Kaushik, \"War, Culture and Society in Early Modern South Asia, 1740-1849\"; 2011; Routledge; p. 70 </ref>. Upon Haidar Ali\u2019s death, Mysore covered 80,000 sq. miles and had a population of approximately 6 million<ref>Roy Kaushik, \"War, Culture and Society in Early Modern South Asia, 1740-1849\"; 2011; Routledge; p. 74</ref>. \n\nStarting from 1767, Kingdom of Mysore had overall had four military confrontations (1767\u201369; 1780\u201384; 1790\u201392; and 1799) with the British until 1799<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/event/Mysore-Wars</ref>, all of which were largely unsuccessful and the outcome \u2013 disastrous.\n\nAbout 1761, commander in chief of the state of Mysore, Hyder Ali proclaimed himself absolute ruler of the Kingdom and started military campaigns to expand the territory of the state. In 1766, [[British East India Company]] joined forces with the local ruler of [[Hyderabad]] against Hyder Ali, but by 1769, the British were left alone in a war with Mysore Kingdom. In 1769 Hyder Ali made his way to [[Madras]] (location of the Company's government) and demanded a [[peace treaty]]<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/event/Mysore-Wars</ref>.\n\nIn the second war, Hyder Ali made an alliance with the Marathas and invaded [[Karnataka]] in 1780, which triggered corresponding actions form the British. The Company gained an upper hand with the arrival of supplementary troops from [[Calcutta]], and by coincidence, the death of Hyder Ali in 1782. As a result, peace was concluded with Hyder Ali's son Tippu Sultan in 1784.\n\nThe third war started in 1790, and ended with Tippu Sultan ceding half of his dominions in 1792.\n\nThe final war was initiated by [[Lord Mornington|Governor-General Lord Mornington]] who suspected that Tippu was receiving the French aid and was preparing for yet another war. British troops invaded the Kingdom of Mysore in May 1799.\n\n== Maratha-Mysore Wars ==\n\nAlthough clashes between the Mysore ruler [[Hyder Ali]] and Marathas had taken place occasionally before 1785, the actual warfare started in February 1785.\n\nAfter the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the ruler of Mysore Tipu Sultan sought to keep offensive moves by the Marathas at bay. Marathas had established a military alliance with the ruler of Hyderabad with a common purpose of recovering territories both had lost to Mysore in previous conflicts. Much of the desired territory was subject to marches, countermarches, and sieges of fortified points. The Marathas also attempted to draw the British East India Company into the pending conflict, but a neutrality policy implemented by the new governor-general, Lord Charles Cornwallis made its participation impossible.\n\n== Outcome ==\n\nThe Maratha-Mysore War ended after the final conflict during the siege of Bahadur Benda in January 1787, and later settled for peace with the kingdom of Mysore, to which Tipu Sultan obliged with the signing of the treaty of Gajendragad in April 1787. Tipu had to pay an annual tribute of 12 lakhs per year to the Marathas, thus ending hostilities with them, which allowed him to focus on his rivalry with the British.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=hkbJ6xA1_jEC&pg=PA105#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=History of Tipu Sultan| isbn=9788187879572| last1=Hasan| first1=Mohibbul| year=2005}}</ref><ref name=Naravane>{{Cite book |last=Naravane |first=M.S. |title=Battles of the Honorourable East India Company |publisher=A.P.H.

A [[Hindi]] remake of the film was also released in 2010, followed by a [[Pusher (2012 film)|British remake]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Movie Trailer: The Hindi Remake of \u2018Pusher\u2019|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/movie-trailer-the-hindi-remake-of-pusher/|work=/FILM|publisher=/FILM|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Russ Fischer|date=28 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins in [[Copenhagen]] with a low-level [[drug dealer]] Frank ([[Kim Bodnia]]) going to a [[heroin]] deal with his sidekick Tonny ([[Mads Mikkelsen]]). The pair only manage to sell some of their product, and then waste time about town. Frank then visits his friend Vic ([[Laura Drasb\u00e6k]]), a [[prostitution|prostitute]] who holds some of Frank's stash for a fee. Vic wants to have a serious relationship with Frank, but Frank prefers to keep it purely casual.\n\nFrank is visited by a former cell mate, a [[Swedish people|Swede]] named Hasse ([[Peter Andersson (actor)|Peter Andersson]]), and the pair set up a large drug deal. Frank visits his supplier, the [[Serbs|Serbian]] local [[drug lord]] Milo ([[Zlatko Buri\u0107]]), to get the heroin. Already owing Milo some money, Frank cannot cover the cost of the heroin, but Milo allows him to take the drugs provided that he immediately returns with the money.\n\nThe deal goes bad, however, when police arrive. In the process of evading the police, Frank dumps the heroin in a lake. At the [[Police station|station]], police officers convince Frank that Tonny has delivered a confession that implicates Frank, but he still does not admit to anything. When Frank is released after 24 hours he returns to Milo to explain how he lost the money and the drugs. Milo does not believe Frank's story and demands that he pay back even more than he already owes. Frank then immediately seeks Tonny out and savagely beats him with a [[baseball bat]].\n\nMilo's [[henchman]] Radovan ([[Slavko Labovi\u0107]]) accompanies Frank to help him collect on some of his own debts to use toward his debt with Milo. The pair have a friendly conversation and Radovan shares his secret desire to open a restaurant. Radovan tries to force an [[drug addiction|addict]] customer of Frank's to rob a bank to cover his debt, but the addict commits [[suicide]] in front of them. As Frank makes other disastrous attempts to earn money, Vic becomes increasingly insistent that they behave as a couple. He takes her to several clubs and makes plans to drive her to the [[veterinarian]] to see her sick dog.\n\nFrank finally makes a deal, but his [[Mule (smuggling)|drug mule]] betrays him and switches the heroin for [[baking soda]]. Radovan drops his friendly demeanour and begins threatening Frank with serious injury should he fail to pay up soon. Frank goes on a desperate rampage, stealing some money and drugs from the gym of some drug-dealing [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilders]], but he is soon picked up by Radovan and [[torture]]d. Frank manages to escape and makes plans to flee with Vic to [[Spain]]. After successfully making his final deal in Copenhagen, Frank receives a call from Milo, who promises to accept a token payment to put an end to their [[feud]]. When Frank bluntly informs Vic that their plans to flee are cancelled, she steals his stash of money and runs off.\n\nThe film ends with Frank grimly catching his breath as his enemies throughout the city prepare to dispose of him.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Kim Bodnia]] as Frank, a low-level drug-dealer\n*[[Zlatko Buri\u0107]] as Milo, a powerful Serb drug lord, with a fondness for baking\n*[[Laura Drasb\u00e6k]] as Vic, a high-class prostitute and Frank's girlfriend\n*[[Slavko Labovi\u0107]] as Radovan, Milo's enforcer and aspiring restaurateur\n*[[Mads Mikkelsen]] as Tonny, Frank's cheerful but manic partner\n*Vanja Baji\u010di\u0107 as Branko, Radovan's cousin and Milo's thug\n*[[Peter Andersson (actor)|Peter Andersson]] as Hasse, a Swedish drug-dealer\n*Lisbeth Rasmussen as Rita, Frank's untrustworthy drug mule\n*Levino Jensen as Mike, a bodybuilding drug-dealer\n*[[Thomas Bo Larsen]] as a drug addict who owes Frank money\n*[[Lars Bom]] as one of the officers who interrogates Frank\n*[[Nicolas Winding Refn]] as Brian, a young man who buys drugs from Frank and Tonny\n*Gordon Kennedy as Scorpion, a customer of Frank, whom Frank bullies during a drug deal\n*Jesper Lohmann as Mikkel\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe movie began as a five-minute \"[[Short film|short]]\" that Winding Refn had made as an application to a Danish [[film school]]. Refn turned down the offer he subsequently received, instead deciding to transform ''Pusher'' into a feature-length [[independent film]] utilizing a nominal amount of funding that he had managed to acquire.<ref name=\"Reverse\">{{cite web|title=Crime Pays: An Interview with Nicolas Winding Refn|url=http://reverseshot.com/article/refn_interview|work=Reverse Shot|publisher=ReverseShot.com|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Brad Westcott|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nRefn partnered with film student Jens Dahl to write the film's [[screenplay]]. His goal was to tell the story of a man under pressure, without glamorizing the lifestyle of a [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]]. Refn organized the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]'s events according to the days of the week in his notes and this was subsequently established in the final product. Refn's major inspirations for the film were ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'', ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', ''[[The Killing of a Chinese Bookie]]'' and ''[[Mean Streets]]''.\n\n===Filming===\nDuring rehearsal, Winding Refn became dissatisfied with the actor he had cast as Frank, thinking him too placid and boring. Two weeks before shooting was to begin, Winding Refn fired the actor without a replacement in line. Winding Refn approached [[Kim Bodnia]], who was an established actor at the time, and Bodnia accepted. Though the other primary roles were mostly filled with experienced actors, many of the minor roles were filled by Winding Refn's friends or people accustomed to the street life.\n\nBodnia brought a greater degree of intensity and aggressiveness to the part that some actors were not prepared for. Winding Refn claimed that the surprised reactions of some actors are genuine, as they had not rehearsed with Bodnia beforehand and were expecting the previous actor's more sedate performances.\n\nSlavko Labovi\u0107, who played the Serbian thug Radovan, was a friend of Serbian war criminal [[\u017deljko Ra\u017enatovi\u0107]]. He provided a poster of Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 to use as a prop in Milo's headquarters. The actor playing Milo, Zlatko Buri\u0107, is actually a Croat. Winding Refn became concerned when violence flared between Serbs and Croats during filming, but the events did not cause problems on set.\n\nThe film was shot using Danish union rules, which allowed no more than 8 hours of filming per day, and no filming on weekends. The rules, combined with the high cost of filming permits, caused time and budget constraints. The film was shot entirely using hand-held cameras. Winding Refn wanted to capture a realistic, documentary feel to the film. This caused problems with the time constraints of the shooting schedule and Winding Refn's desire to keep the film shadowy. Actors are often backlit or difficult to see due to the low levels of lighting used.\n\nThe film was shot almost completely in chronological order. Winding Refn later admitted that shooting scenes out of order was confusing to him; however, some scenes were reshot or added later. The scene in which Frank shoots at Milo's thugs was originally filmed without special effects, but Winding Refn was dissatisfied with the results and reshot the scene using squibs. The scene with the junkie was shot after shooting had completed to replace a previous scene that Refn discarded because it dealt with an outdated vision of Frank's character.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{infobox album\n| name = Pusher: Soundtrack\n| type = soundtrack\n| artist = [[Peter Peter (Danish musician)|Peter Peter]] and Povl \nKristian\n| released = 1996\n| genre = Punk rock\n| label = [[Sony Music Records]]\n}}\nPunk rocker Peter Peter and composer Povl Kristian composed the score and formed the temporary band ''Prisoner'' to perform the score: Peter playing guitar and Kristian playing the clavier. Kristian also composed the song \"''Summers got the colour''\" with text by Lars K. Andersen which was sung by Aud Wilken. Although Povl Kristian did not return to work on the sequels, the \"''Pusher theme''\" he wrote with Peter Peter was used in all of the following films.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was considered the first Danish-language gangster film and became a break-through success for Winding Refn and several of the lead actors.

A [[Hindi]] remake of the film was also released in 2010, followed by a [[Pusher (2012 film)|British remake]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Movie Trailer: The Hindi Remake of \u2018Pusher\u2019|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/movie-trailer-the-hindi-remake-of-pusher/|work=/FILM|publisher=/FILM|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Russ Fischer|date=28 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins in [[Copenhagen]] with a low-level [[drug dealer]] Frank ([[Kim Bodnia]]) going to a [[heroin]] deal with his sidekick Tonny ([[Mads Mikkelsen]]). The pair only manage to sell some of their product, and then waste time about town. Frank then visits his friend Vic ([[Laura Drasb\u00e6k]]), a [[prostitution|prostitute]] who holds some of Frank's stash for a fee. Vic wants to have a serious relationship with Frank, but Frank prefers to keep it purely casual.\n\nFrank is visited by a former cell mate, a [[Swedish people|Swede]] named Hasse ([[Peter Andersson (actor)|Peter Andersson]]), and the pair set up a large drug deal. Frank visits his supplier, the [[Serbs|Serbian]] local [[drug lord]] Milo ([[Zlatko Buri\u0107]]), to get the heroin. Already owing Milo some money, Frank cannot cover the cost of the heroin, but Milo allows him to take the drugs provided that he immediately returns with the money.\n\nThe deal goes bad, however, when police arrive. In the process of evading the police, Frank dumps the heroin in a lake. At the [[Police station|station]], police officers convince Frank that Tonny has delivered a confession that implicates Frank, but he still does not admit to anything. When Frank is released after 24 hours he returns to Milo to explain how he lost the money and the drugs. Milo does not believe Frank's story and demands that he pay back even more than he already owes. Frank then immediately seeks Tonny out and savagely beats him with a [[baseball bat]].\n\nMilo's [[henchman]] Radovan ([[Slavko Labovi\u0107]]) accompanies Frank to help him collect on some of his own debts to use toward his debt with Milo. The pair have a friendly conversation and Radovan shares his secret desire to open a restaurant. Radovan tries to force an [[drug addiction|addict]] customer of Frank's to rob a bank to cover his debt, but the addict commits [[suicide]] in front of them. As Frank makes other disastrous attempts to earn money, Vic becomes increasingly insistent that they behave as a couple. He takes her to several clubs and makes plans to drive her to the [[veterinarian]] to see her sick dog.\n\nFrank finally makes a deal, but his [[Mule (smuggling)|drug mule]] betrays him and switches the heroin for [[baking soda]]. Radovan drops his friendly demeanour and begins threatening Frank with serious injury should he fail to pay up soon. Frank goes on a desperate rampage, stealing some money and drugs from the gym of some drug-dealing [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilders]], but he is soon picked up by Radovan and [[torture]]d. Frank manages to escape and makes plans to flee with Vic to [[Spain]]. After successfully making his final deal in Copenhagen, Frank receives a call from Milo, who promises to accept a token payment to put an end to their [[feud]]. When Frank bluntly informs Vic that their plans to flee are cancelled, she steals his stash of money and runs off.\n\nThe film ends with Frank grimly catching his breath as his enemies throughout the city prepare to dispose of him.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Kim Bodnia]] as Frank, a low-level drug-dealer\n*[[Zlatko Buri\u0107]] as Milo, a powerful Serb drug lord, with a fondness for baking\n*[[Laura Drasb\u00e6k]] as Vic, a high-class prostitute and Frank's girlfriend\n*[[Slavko Labovi\u0107]] as Radovan, Milo's enforcer and aspiring restaurateur\n*[[Mads Mikkelsen]] as Tonny, Frank's cheerful but manic partner\n*Vanja Baji\u010di\u0107 as Branko, Radovan's cousin and Milo's thug\n*[[Peter Andersson (actor)|Peter Andersson]] as Hasse, a Swedish drug-dealer\n*Lisbeth Rasmussen as Rita, Frank's untrustworthy drug mule\n*Levino Jensen as Mike, a bodybuilding drug-dealer\n*[[Thomas Bo Larsen]] as a drug addict who owes Frank money\n*[[Lars Bom]] as one of the officers who interrogates Frank\n*[[Nicolas Winding Refn]] as Brian, a young man who buys drugs from Frank and Tonny\n*Gordon Kennedy as Scorpion, a customer of Frank, whom Frank bullies during a drug deal\n*Jesper Lohmann as Mikkel\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe movie began as a five-minute \"[[Short film|short]]\" that Winding Refn had made as an application to a Danish [[film school]]. Refn turned down the offer he subsequently received, instead deciding to transform ''Pusher'' into a feature-length [[independent film]] utilizing a nominal amount of funding that he had managed to acquire.<ref name=\"Reverse\">{{cite web|title=Crime Pays: An Interview with Nicolas Winding Refn|url=http://reverseshot.com/article/refn_interview|work=Reverse Shot|publisher=ReverseShot.com|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Brad Westcott|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nRefn partnered with film student Jens Dahl to write the film's [[screenplay]]. His goal was to tell the story of a man under pressure, without glamorizing the lifestyle of a [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]]. Refn organized the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]'s events according to the days of the week in his notes and this was subsequently established in the final product. Refn's major inspirations for the film were ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'', ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', ''[[The Killing of a Chinese Bookie]]'' and ''[[Mean Streets]]''.\n\n===Filming===\nDuring rehearsal, Winding Refn became dissatisfied with the actor he had cast as Frank, thinking him too placid and boring. Two weeks before shooting was to begin, Winding Refn fired the actor without a replacement in line. Winding Refn approached [[Kim Bodnia]], who was an established actor at the time, and Bodnia accepted. Though the other primary roles were mostly filled with experienced actors, many of the minor roles were filled by Winding Refn's friends or people accustomed to the street life.\n\nBodnia brought a greater degree of intensity and aggressiveness to the part that some actors were not prepared for. Winding Refn claimed that the surprised reactions of some actors are genuine, as they had not rehearsed with Bodnia beforehand and were expecting the previous actor's more sedate performances.\n\nSlavko Labovi\u0107, who played the Serbian thug Radovan, was a friend of Serbian war criminal [[\u017deljko Ra\u017enatovi\u0107]]. He provided a poster of Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 to use as a prop in Milo's headquarters. The actor playing Milo, Zlatko Buri\u0107, is actually a Croat. Winding Refn became concerned when violence flared between Serbs and Croats during filming, but the events did not cause problems on set.\n\nThe film was shot using Danish union rules, which allowed no more than 8 hours of filming per day, and no filming on weekends. The rules, combined with the high cost of filming permits, caused time and budget constraints. The film was shot entirely using hand-held cameras. Winding Refn wanted to capture a realistic, documentary feel to the film. This caused problems with the time constraints of the shooting schedule and Winding Refn's desire to keep the film shadowy. Actors are often backlit or difficult to see due to the low levels of lighting used.\n\nThe film was shot almost completely in chronological order. Winding Refn later admitted that shooting scenes out of order was confusing to him; however, some scenes were reshot or added later. The scene in which Frank shoots at Milo's thugs was originally filmed without special effects, but Winding Refn was dissatisfied with the results and reshot the scene using squibs. The scene with the junkie was shot after shooting had completed to replace a previous scene that Refn discarded because it dealt with an outdated vision of Frank's character.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{infobox album\n| name = Pusher: Soundtrack\n| type = soundtrack\n| artist = [[Peter Peter]] and Povl \nKristian\n| released = 1996\n| genre = Punk rock\n| label = [[Sony Music Records]]\n}}\nPunk rocker Peter Peter and composer Povl Kristian composed the score and formed the temporary band ''Prisoner'' to perform the score: Peter playing guitar and Kristian playing the clavier. Kristian also composed the song \"''Summers got the colour''\" with text by Lars K. Andersen which was sung by Aud Wilken. Although Povl Kristian did not return to work on the sequels, the \"''Pusher theme''\" he wrote with Peter Peter was used in all of the following films.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was considered the first Danish-language gangster film and became a break-through success for Winding Refn and several of the lead actors. Winding Refn claimed that the film inspired cults of highly dedicated fans and influenced Danish fashion to emulate certain costumes worn by the characters. Kim Bodnia launched a very successful career as a leading man in Danish cinema largely due to the success of the movie. Zlatko Buri\u0107 was given a [[Bodil Awards|Bodil Award]] in 1997 for his performance as Milo.\n\nThe film holds a score of 81% positive reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with the average score of 6.9/10.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pusher 3|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/Pusher/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> The review aggregator site [[Metacritic]] has given the movie an average score of 72 out of 100, which means \"Generally favorable reviews\".<ref>http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pusher</ref>\n\n==Sequels==\n{{main|Pusher trilogy}}\nTwo sequels followed, focusing on different characters from the same \"underworld\" milieu of Copenhagen.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Nathan|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2DE153EF93BA2575BC0A9609C8B63|title=Film in Review; The Pusher Trilogy|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 18, 2006}}</ref>\n\n''[[Pusher II]]'' follows Frank's former partner, Tonny.<ref name=NYT/> Tonny struggles with his relationship with his father following his release from prison; Tonny concurrently negotiates the prospect of becoming a father himself and the discovery that his mother had died while he was incarcerated.\n\n''[[Pusher 3]]'' follows drug lord, Milo.<ref name=NYT/> Milo is followed through the course of a hectic day, as he struggles with his attempt at sobriety, a series of problematic criminal deals, and his daughter's birthday celebration for which he is the chef.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Amg movie|154801|Pusher}}\n*{{IMDb title|0117407|Pusher}}\n\n{{Nicolas Winding Refn}}\n\n[[Category:1996 films]]\n[[Category:1990s crime thriller films]]\n[[Category:Danish crime films]]\n[[Category:Danish films]]\n[[Category:Danish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about organized crime in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Films about the illegal drug trade]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Nicolas Winding Refn]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Films set in Copenhagen]]\n[[Category:Gangster films]]\n[[Category:1996 directorial debut films]]\n", "name_user": "Cnwilliams", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Peter Peter\u2192Peter Peter (Danish musician)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pusher_(1996_film)"}
