The same precautions apply to outdoor sandboxes, which should be covered when not in use. Cat feces should never be flushed down a toilet.\n\nFurthermore, pregnant or [[immunocompromised]] people are at higher risk of becoming infected or transmitting the parasite to their fetus. Because of this, they should not change or handle cat litter boxes. Ideally, cats should be kept indoors and fed only food that has low to no risk of carrying oocysts, such as commercial cat food or well-cooked table food.\n\n=== Vaccination ===\nAs of 2016, no approved human vaccine exists against ''Toxoplasma gondii''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Verma R, Khanna P | title = Development of Toxoplasma gondii vaccine: A global challenge | journal = Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 291\u20133 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23111123 | pmc = 3859749 | doi = 10.4161/hv.22474 }}</ref> Research on human vaccines is ongoing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/151498_en.html |title=TOXPOX Result In Brief - Vaccine against Toxoplasmosis |publisher=CORDIS, European Commission |date=2015-01-14 |accessdate=2015-12-11}}</ref>\n\nFor [[sheep]], an approved live vaccine sold as Toxovax ([[Merck & Co.|MSD Animal Health]]) provides lifetime protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheepvax.co.nz/risk-factors/risk-factors-for-toxoplasmosis/ |title=TOXOVAX\u00ae |publisher=MSD Animal Health |accessdate=2015-11-10}}</ref>\n\n== Genome ==\nThe [[genome]]s of more than 60 [[Genome|strains]] of ''T. gondii'' have been sequenced.

The new genus name ''Toxoplasma'' is a reference to its morphology: ''Toxo'', from Greek {{lang|grc|{{linktext|\u03c4\u03cc\u03be\u03bf\u03bd}}}} (''{{transl|grc|toxon}}'', \"arc, bow\"), and {{lang|grc|{{linktext|\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1}}}} (''{{transl|grc|plasma}}'', \"shape, form\") and the host in which it was discovered, the [[gundi]] (gondii). The same year Nicolle and Mancaeux discovered ''T. gondii'', Alfonso Splendore identified the same organism in a [[rabbit]] in [[Brazil]]. However, he did not give it a name.<ref name=Dubey2009History />\n\nThe first conclusive identification of ''T. gondii'' in humans was in an infant girl delivered full term by [[Caesarean section]] on May 23, 1938, at [[Babies' Hospital]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=Dubey2009History />  The girl began having [[seizure]]s at three days of age, and doctors identified [[lesion]]s in the [[Macula of retina|maculae]] of both of her eyes. When she died at one month of age, an [[autopsy]] was performed. [[Lesion]]s discovered in her brain and eye tissue were found to have both free and intracellular ''T. gondii'''.<ref name=Dubey2009History /> Infected tissue from the girl was [[Homogenization (biology)|homogenized]] and [[inoculate]]d intracerebrally into rabbits and mice; the animals subsequently developed [[encephalitis]]. Later, [[congenital]] transmission was found to occur in numerous other species, particularly in sheep and rodents.\n\nThe possibility of ''T. gondii'' transmission via consumption of undercooked meat was first proposed by D. Weinman and A.H Chandler in 1954.<ref name=Dubey2009History/> In 1960, the cyst wall of tissue cysts was shown to dissolve in the proteolytic enzymes found in the stomach, releasing infectious bradyzoites into the stomach (and subsequently into the intestine). The hypothesis of transmission via consumption of undercooked meat was tested in an [[orphanage]] in [[Paris]] in 1965; yearly acquisition rates of ''T. gondii'' rose from 10% to 50% after adding two portions of barely cooked beef or horse meat to the orphans' daily diets, and to 100% after adding barely cooked lamb chops.<ref name=Dubey2009History />\n\nIn 1959, a study in [[Bombay]] found the prevalence of ''T. gondii'' in strict [[vegetarians]] to be similar to that found in nonvegetarians. This raised the possibility of a third major route of infection, beyond congenital and carnivorous transmission.<ref name=Dubey2009History /> In 1970, oocysts were found in cat feces, and the [[fecal-oral route]] of infection via oocysts was demonstrated.<ref name=Dubey2009History />\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, a vast number of species were tested for ability to shed oocysts upon infection. At least 17 species of [[felid]]s have been confirmed to shed oocysts, but no non-felid has been shown to allow ''T. gondii'' sexual reproduction and subsequent oocyst shedding.<ref name=Dubey2009History />\n\n== Behavioral differences of infected hosts ==\n\nThere are many instances where behavioural changes were reported in rodents with ''T. gondii''. The changes seen were a reduction in their innate dislike of cats, which made it easier for cats to prey on the rodents. In an experiment conducted by Berdoy and colleagues, the infected rats showed preference for the cat odour area versus the area with the rabbit scent, therefore making it easier for the parasite to take its final step in its definitive feline host.<ref name=\"Berdoy2000\"/> This is an example of the [[extended phenotype]] concept, that is, the idea that the behaviour of the infected animal changes in order to maximize survival of the genes that increase predation of the intermediate rodent host.<ref name=\"McConkey2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = McConkey GA, Martin HL, Bristow GC, Webster JP | title = Toxoplasma gondii infection and behaviour - location, location, location? | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 216 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 113\u20139 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23225873 | pmc = 3515035 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.074153 }}</ref>\n\nDifferences in sex-dependent behavior observed in infected hosts compared to non-infected individuals can be attributed to differences in testosterone.

It is also important to mention that in 2016 a population-representative birth cohort study which was done, to test a hypothesis that [[toxoplasmosis]] is related to impairment in brain and behaviour measured by a range of phenotypes including neuropsychiatric disorders, poor impulse control, personality and neurocognitive deficits. The results of this study did not support the results in the previously mentioned studies, more than marginally. None of the P-values showed significance for any outcome measure. Thus, according to this study, the presence of ''T. gondii'' antibodies is not correlated to increase susceptibility to any of the behaviour phenotypes (except possibly to a higher rate of unsuccessful attempted suicide). This team did not observe any significant association between ''T. gondii'' seropositivity and [[schizophrenia]]. The team notes that the null findings might be a false negative due to low statistical power because of small sample sizes, but against this weights that their set-up should avoid some possibilities for errors in the about 40 studies that did show a positive correlation.

Other unsafe practices such as drinking unpasteurized milk or untreated water can increase odds of infection.<ref name=CDCPrevention/> Because ''T. gondii'' is typically transmitted through cysts that reside in the tissues of infected animals, meat that is not properly prepared can present an increased risk of infection.

After cooking, a rest period of 3 min should be allowed before consumption. However, ground meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 160&nbsp;\u00b0F (71&nbsp;\u00b0C) with no rest period. All poultry should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 165&nbsp;\u00b0F (74&nbsp;\u00b0C). After cooking, a rest period of 3 min should be allowed before consumption.\n\n=== From environment ===\nOocysts in cat feces take at least a day to [[sporulate]] and become infectious after they are shed, so disposing of cat litter daily greatly reduces the chances of infectious oocysts being present in litter. As infectious oocysts from cat feces can spread and survive in the environment for months, humans should wear gloves when gardening or working with soil, and should wash their hands promptly after disposing of cat litter. The same precautions apply to outdoor sandboxes, which should be covered when not in use. Cat feces should never be flushed down a toilet.\n\nFurthermore, pregnant or [[immunocompromised]] people are at higher risk of becoming infected or transmitting the parasite to their fetus. Because of this, they should not change or handle cat litter boxes. Ideally, cats should be kept indoors and fed only food that has low to no risk of carrying oocysts, such as commercial cat food or well-cooked table food.\n\n=== Vaccination ===\nAs of 2016, no approved human vaccine exists against ''Toxoplasma gondii''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Verma R, Khanna P | title = Development of Toxoplasma gondii vaccine: A global challenge | journal = Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 291\u20133 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23111123 | pmc = 3859749 | doi = 10.4161/hv.22474 }}</ref> Research on human vaccines is ongoing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/151498_en.html |title=TOXPOX Result In Brief - Vaccine against Toxoplasmosis |publisher=CORDIS, European Commission |date=2015-01-14 |accessdate=2015-12-11}}</ref>\n\nFor [[sheep]], an approved live vaccine sold as Toxovax ([[Merck & Co.|MSD Animal Health]]) provides lifetime protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheepvax.co.nz/risk-factors/risk-factors-for-toxoplasmosis/ |title=TOXOVAX\u00ae |publisher=MSD Animal Health |accessdate=2015-11-10}}</ref>\n\n== Genome ==\nThe [[genome]]s of more than 60 [[Genome|strains]] of ''T. gondii'' have been sequenced.

The new genus name ''Toxoplasma'' is a reference to its morphology: ''Toxo'', from Greek {{lang|grc|{{linktext|\u03c4\u03cc\u03be\u03bf\u03bd}}}} (''{{transl|grc|toxon}}'', \"arc, bow\"), and {{lang|grc|{{linktext|\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1}}}} (''{{transl|grc|plasma}}'', \"shape, form\") and the host in which it was discovered, the [[gundi]] (gondii). The same year Nicolle and Mancaeux discovered ''T. gondii'', Alfonso Splendore identified the same organism in a [[rabbit]] in [[Brazil]]. However, he did not give it a name.<ref name=Dubey2009History />\n\nThe first conclusive identification of ''T. gondii'' in humans was in an infant girl delivered full term by [[Caesarean section]] on May 23, 1938, at [[Babies' Hospital]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=Dubey2009History />  The girl began having [[seizure]]s at three days of age, and doctors identified [[lesion]]s in the [[Macula of retina|maculae]] of both of her eyes. When she died at one month of age, an [[autopsy]] was performed. [[Lesion]]s discovered in her brain and eye tissue were found to have both free and intracellular ''T. gondii'''.<ref name=Dubey2009History /> Infected tissue from the girl was [[Homogenization (biology)|homogenized]] and [[inoculate]]d intracerebrally into rabbits and mice; the animals subsequently developed [[encephalitis]]. Later, [[congenital]] transmission was found to occur in numerous other species, particularly in sheep and rodents.\n\nThe possibility of ''T. gondii'' transmission via consumption of undercooked meat was first proposed by D. Weinman and A.H Chandler in 1954.<ref name=Dubey2009History/> In 1960, the cyst wall of tissue cysts was shown to dissolve in the proteolytic enzymes found in the stomach, releasing infectious bradyzoites into the stomach (and subsequently into the intestine). The hypothesis of transmission via consumption of undercooked meat was tested in an [[orphanage]] in [[Paris]] in 1965; yearly acquisition rates of ''T. gondii'' rose from 10% to 50% after adding two portions of barely cooked beef or horse meat to the orphans' daily diets, and to 100% after adding barely cooked lamb chops.<ref name=Dubey2009History />\n\nIn 1959, a study in [[Bombay]] found the prevalence of ''T. gondii'' in strict [[vegetarians]] to be similar to that found in nonvegetarians. This raised the possibility of a third major route of infection, beyond congenital and carnivorous transmission.<ref name=Dubey2009History /> In 1970, oocysts were found in cat feces, and the [[fecal-oral route]] of infection via oocysts was demonstrated.<ref name=Dubey2009History />\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, a vast number of species were tested for ability to shed oocysts upon infection. At least 17 species of [[felid]]s have been confirmed to shed oocysts, but no non-felid has been shown to allow ''T. gondii'' sexual reproduction and subsequent oocyst shedding.<ref name=Dubey2009History />\n\n== Behavioral differences of infected hosts ==\n\nThere are many instances where behavioural changes were reported in rodents with ''T. gondii''. The changes seen were a reduction in their innate dislike of cats, which made it easier for cats to prey on the rodents. In an experiment conducted by Berdoy and colleagues, the infected rats showed preference for the cat odour area versus the area with the rabbit scent, therefore making it easier for the parasite to take its final step in its definitive feline host.<ref name=\"Berdoy2000\"/> This is an example of the [[extended phenotype]] concept, that is, the idea that the behaviour of the infected animal changes in order to maximize survival of the genes that increase predation of the intermediate rodent host.<ref name=\"McConkey2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = McConkey GA, Martin HL, Bristow GC, Webster JP | title = Toxoplasma gondii infection and behaviour - location, location, location? | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 216 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 113\u20139 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23225873 | pmc = 3515035 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.074153 }}</ref>\n\nDifferences in sex-dependent behavior observed in infected hosts compared to non-infected individuals can be attributed to differences in testosterone.

It is also important to mention that in 2016 a population-representative birth cohort study which was done, to test a hypothesis that [[toxoplasmosis]] is related to impairment in brain and behaviour measured by a range of phenotypes including neuropsychiatric disorders, poor impulse control, personality and neurocognitive deficits. The results of this study did not support the results in the previously mentioned studies, more than marginally. None of the P-values showed significance for any outcome measure. Thus, according to this study, the presence of ''T. gondii'' antibodies is not correlated to increase susceptibility to any of the behaviour phenotypes (except possibly to a higher rate of unsuccessful attempted suicide). This team did not observe any significant association between ''T. gondii'' seropositivity and [[schizophrenia]].

This generation includes the [[Macintosh]], [[Amiga]], [[Apple IIGS]], and in some markets the [[Acorn Archimedes]]. \"ST\" officially stands for \"Sixteen/Thirty-two\",<ref>{{cite web|title=The Future of Atari Computing|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv4n5/the_future.html|date=December 1989|work=[[STart Magazine]]|accessdate=2006-06-23}}</ref> which refers to the [[Motorola 68000]]'s [[16-bit]] external bus and [[32-bit]] internals. The hardware was so similar to Apple's Macintosh at the time that with the addition of the [[Spectre GCR]] the ST was able to run Macintosh software faster than an actual Mac Plus at the time (since the Atari's clock speed was higher) and with a larger and higher resolution display. In fact, the Stacy (the laptop version of the Atari ST) was the first and only way to own a laptop running Mac OS at the time since Apple did not offer one until much later.\n\nThe ST was sold with either Atari's color monitor or the less expensive [[monochrome monitor]]. The system's two color graphics modes are only available on the former while the highest-resolution mode needs the monochrome monitor.\n\nIn some markets, particularly [[Germany]], the machine gained a strong foothold as a [[small business]] machine for [[CAD]] and [[desktop publishing]] work. Thanks to its built-in [[MIDI]] ports, the ST enjoyed success for running [[music sequencer]] software and as a [[MIDI controller|controller]] of [[musical instrument]]s among amateurs and well-known musicians alike.\n\nThe ST was superseded by the [[Atari STE]], [[Atari TT]], [[Atari MEGA STE]], and [[Atari Falcon|Falcon]] computers.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe Atari ST was born from the rivalry between home-computer makers [[Atari, Inc.]] and [[Commodore International]].\n\n=== Amiga contract ===\n[[Jay Miner]], one of the original designers for the custom chips found in the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 8-bit family]], tried to convince Atari management to create a new chipset for a video game console and computer. When his idea was rejected, Miner left Atari to form a small [[think tank]] called Hi-Toro in 1982 and began designing the new \"Lorraine\" chipset. The company, which was later renamed [[Amiga Corporation]], was pretending to sell video game controllers to deceive competition while it developed a Lorraine-based computer.<ref>{{YouTube|VCREhVvHXL4|\"History of Amiga video\"}} (2008-02-18). Retrieved on 2013-04-22.</ref>\n\nAmiga ran out of capital to complete Lorraine's development, and Atari, owned by [[Warner Communications]], paid Amiga to continue development work. In return Atari received exclusive use of the Lorraine design for one year as a video game console. After one year Atari would have the right to add a keyboard and market the complete computer, designated the 1850XLD. As Atari was heavily involved with Disney at the time, it was later code-named \"Mickey\", and the 256K memory expansion board was codenamed \"Minnie\".<ref>[http://archives.atarimuseum.com/archives/archives.html \"Confidential Atari-Amiga Agreement\" and \"Afterthoughts: The Atari 1600XL Rumor\"].

The company initially considered the [[National Semiconductor]] [[NS320xx]] microprocessor but was disappointed with its performance.{{r|3years}}{{r|chin19850128}} This started the move to the 68000.

He secured funding and bought Atari's Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) in July. As executives and engineers left Commodore to join Tramel Technology, Commodore responded by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets.\n\nThe Tramiels did not purchase the employee contracts when they bought the assets of Atari Inc., so one of their first acts was to interview Atari Inc. employees to decide whom to hire at what was essentially a brand new company. At the time of the purchase of Atari Inc's assets, there were roughly 900 employees remaining from a high point of 10,000. After the interviews, approximately 100 employees were hired to work at Tramel Technology, which soon changed its name to [[Atari Corporation]].\n\nAt one point a custom sound processor called AMY was a planned component for the new ST computer design, but the chip needed more time to complete, so AMY was dropped in favor of an off-the-shelf Yamaha sound chip.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIt was during this time in late July/early August that Leonard Tramiel discovered the original Amiga contract, which required Amiga Corporation to deliver the Lorraine chipset to Atari on June 30, 1984. Amiga Corp. had sought more monetary support from investors in spring 1984 (among them Tramel<!--*Not* \"Tramiel\"--> Technology, which wished to replace nearly everyone at Amiga).\n\n=== Commodore and Amiga ===\nHaving heard rumors that Tramiel was negotiating to buy Atari, Amiga Corp. entered into discussions with Commodore. The discussions led to Commodore wanting to purchase Amiga Corporation outright, which Commodore believed would cancel any outstanding contracts, including Atari's. Instead of Amiga Corp. delivering Lorraine to Atari, Commodore delivered a check of $500,000 to Atari on Amiga's behalf, in effect returning the funds Atari invested into Amiga for the chipset. Tramiel countersued Amiga Corp. on August 13, 1984. He sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing anything with its technology.\n\nAt Commodore, the Amiga team was in limbo during the summer of 1984 because of the lawsuit. No word on the status of the chipset, the Lorraine computer, or the team's fate was known. In the fall of 1984, Commodore informed the team that the Lorraine project was active again, the chipset was to be improved, the [[operating system]] (OS) developed, and the hardware design completed. While Commodore announced the [[Amiga 1000]] with the Lorraine chipset in July 1985, the delay gave Atari, with its many former Commodore engineers, time to deliver the first Atari ST units in June 1985. In March 1987, the two companies settled the dispute out of court in a closed decision.<ref name=\"3years\">{{cite news |first = Jeffrey |last = Daniels |title = 3 Years With the ST |url = http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n1/threeyearsofst.html |work = START Magazine |publisher = James Capparell |page = 22 |date = Summer 1988 |accessdate = 2010-05-15 }}</ref><ref name=\"jayminer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.heartbone.com/comphist/JayMiner.html |title=Jay G.

Soon after the Atari buyout, [[Microsoft]] approached Tramiel with the suggestion that they port [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] to the platform, but the delivery date was out by two years, far too long for their needs. Another possibility was [[Digital Research]], who was working on a new GUI-based system then known as Crystal, soon to become [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]]. Another option was to write a new operating system in-house, but this was rejected as Atari management was unsure whether the company had the required expertise to do so.<ref name=\"3years\"/>\n\nDigital Research was fully committed to the Intel platform, so a team from Atari was sent to the Digital Research headquarters to work with the \"Monterey Team\" which comprised a mixture of Atari and Digital Research engineers. Atari's Leonard Tramiel was the Atari person overseeing \"Project Jason\" (a.k.a. The Operating System) for the Atari ST line of computers. The name came from the original designer and developer, Jason Loveman.<ref name=\"oren\">{{cite web|last1=Oren|first1=Tim|title=Professional GEM Column #15|url=http://cd.textfiles.com/crawlycrypt1/program/books/progem/gemdos.15|website=textfiles.com|publisher=Antic Publishing|date=1986}}</ref>\n\nGEM was based on CP/M-68K, essentially a direct port of [[CP/M]] to the 68000. By 1985, CP/M was becoming increasingly outdated; it did not support sub-directories, for example. Digital Research was also in the process of building a new [[DOS]]-like operating system specifically for GEM, ''GEMDOS'', and there was some discussion of whether or not a port of GEMDOS could be completed in time for product delivery in June. The decision was eventually taken to port it, resulting in a GEMDOS file system which became part of [[Atari TOS]] (''The Operating System'' and colloquially known as the ''Tramiel Operating System''). This gave the ST a fast, hierarchical file system, essential for hard drives, plus programmers had function calls similar to [[IBM PC DOS]]. The [[Atari ST character set|character set]] is based on [[codepage 437]].\n\nBesides the original TOS operating system, a number of third-party OSes were developed for, or ported to, the Atari ST. Among Unix clones, [[Idris (operating system)|Idris]], [[Minix]] had an Atari ST port and the [[MiNT|Mint]] OS was developed specifically for the Atari ST.\n\n== Debut and release ==\nAfter six months of intensive effort following Tramiel's takeover, Atari announced the 520ST at the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in January 1985.<ref name=\"3years\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Winter CES 1985 Report|url=http://obligement.free.fr/articles_traduction/winter_ces_1985_en.php}}</ref> ''InfoWorld'' described prototypes shown at computer shows as a \"typical Commodore-64-style, corner-cutting, low-cost Jack Tramiel product\",<ref name=\"iw19850415\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA13&ots=a_Fs_n1Np8&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=GEM on ROM for the Atari ST | work=InfoWorld | date=1985-04-15 | accessdate=4 February 2015 | pages=13 | editor=McCarthy, Michael}}</ref> but Atari unexpectedly displayed the ST at Atlanta [[COMDEX]] in May.<ref name=\"sanger19850513\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/13/business/atari-is-facing-new-doubts.html |title=Atari is Facing New Doubts |last=Sanger, David E. |date=1985-05-13 |work=The New York Times |access-date=5 January 2015}}</ref> Due to its similarities to the original [[Macintosh]] and Tramiel's role in its development, it was quickly nicknamed the '''Jackintosh'''.<ref name=chin19850128>{{cite news|author=Chin, Kathy|title=Atari Announces Six New Computers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6i4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false|work=InfoWorld|publisher=IDG|date=1985-01-28|accessdate=2011-03-19|pages=15\u201316}}</ref> Atari's rapid development of the ST amazed many,<ref name=\"3years\"/><ref name=\"chin19850128\" /> but others were more skeptical, citing the ST's \"cheap\" appearance, Atari's uncertain financial health, and the poor relations the Tramiel-led Commodore had with software developers.<ref name=\"chin19850128\" /><ref name=\"sanger19850513\" /><ref name=\"chinsoft19850128\" />\n\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that Tramiel's poor pre-Atari reputation likely made computer stores reluctant to deal with the company, hurting its distribution of the ST.<ref name=\"oxner198605\">{{cite magazine | title=Hobby & Industry News | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=28 | date=May 1986 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_28.pdf | accessdate=17 April 2016 | last=Oxner | first=Bill | pages=4}}</ref> One retailer said, \"If you can believe [[Lucy Van Pelt|Lucy]] when she holds the football for [[Charlie Brown]], you can believe Jack Tramiel\",<ref name=\"steele19850709\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SprPDrQRvM8C&lpg=PA51&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=COMDEX: Nothing New Under the Georgia Sun | work=PC Magazine | date=1985-07-09 | accessdate=28 October 2013 | author=Steele, William | pages=34}}</ref> and another said that because of its experience with Tramiel \"Our interest in Atari is zero, zilch\".<ref name=\"maremaa19850603\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8C4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Atari Ships New 520 ST | work=InfoWorld | date=1985-06-03 | accessdate=19 July 2014 | author=Maremaa, Tom | pages=23}}</ref> Neither Atari nor Commodore was able to persuade large chains like [[ComputerLand]] or BusinessLand to sell their products,<ref name=\"nyt19851216\" /> but observers criticized Atari's erratic discussion of its stated plans for the new computer, quickly shifting from using [[mass merchandiser]]s to specialty computer stores to both; Atari executives could not name any computer stores that would carry the ST when asked at COMDEX.

By late 1985 the machines were also upgraded with the addition of an [[RF modulator]] (for TV display), a version known as the 520ST<sup>M</sup>. ST systems before the Mega ST range have no battery-backed clock, although third party boards that went between the 6301 socket and the 6301 chip which was used for the keyboard and clock could be connected to a rechargeable battery pack to provide a battery-backed clock. <ref>http://rcgldr.net/atarist/tmsvr.jpg</ref>\n\nAtari originally intended to include GEM's GDOS (Graphical Device Operating System), which allowed programs to send GEM VDI ([[Virtual Device Interface]]) commands to drivers loaded by GDOS. This allowed developers to send VDI instructions to other [[Device file|devices]] simply by pointing to it. However, GDOS was not ready at the time the ST started shipping and was included in software packages and later ST machines. Later versions of GDOS supported vector fonts.\n\n[[File:ST BASIC - J.R.

Indeed, the company's English advertising strapline of the era was \"power without the price.\" In fact, an Atari ST and [[terminal emulation]] software was much cheaper than a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital]] [[VT220]] terminal, which was commonly needed by offices with central computers.\n\n== Design ==\n=== Original housing ===\n[[File:Atari-520ST.jpg|thumb|The Atari 520ST]]\n\nThe original 520ST case design was created by Ira Velinsky{{snd}} Atari's chief Industrial Designer.<ref name=\"case\">{{cite web|title=Bold plans for new Atari|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=si4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=ira+velinsky#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=December 1984|work=[[InfoWorld]]|accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref> The ST is wedge-shaped, featuring bold angular lines and a series of grilles cut into the rear for airflow. The keyboard has soft tactile feedback and rhomboid-shaped function keys across the top. The 520ST is an all-in-one unit, similar to earlier home computers like the [[Commodore 64]], but with a larger keyboard with cursor keys and a numeric keypad.\n\nThe 520ST uses an external [[power brick]].\n\n=== Port connections ===\n[[File:Atari520ST Interface.jpg|thumb|Atari 520ST ports]]\n[[File:Atari st mouse.jpg|thumb|Atari ST mouse (2000)]]\n\nThe 520ST features a large number of ports mounted at the rear of the machine that remained largely unchanged over the ST's history.\n\n* Standard ports:\n** [[RS-232]]c serial port ([[D-subminiature|DB25]] male, operating as basic 9-conductor DTE)\n** [[Centronics printer port]] ([[D-subminiature|DB25]] female, officially compliant only with the most basic unidirectional standard with a single, \"Busy\" input line; unofficially offering some bidirectional capabilities)\n** [[Atari joystick port]]s ([[D-subminiature|DE-9]] male) for the mouse and game controllers\n** 2 [[MIDI]] ports (5-pin [[DIN connector|DIN]], \"IN\" and \"OUT\")<ref name=\"midi\">{{cite web |title=Atari ST Interfaces & Connectors |url=http://info-coach.fr/atari/hardware/interfaces.php |website=info-coach.fr |accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref>\n* ST-specific ports:\n** Monitor port (custom 13-pin [[DIN connector|DIN]], 12 of the pins in a rectangular pattern, carrying signals for both RGB and monochrome monitors, monophonic audio and, in later models, composite video)\n** ACSI (similar to [[SCSI]]) DMA port (custom-sized 19-pin D-sub, for hard disks and laser printers, capable of up to 2&nbsp;MByte/s with efficient programming)\n** Floppy port (standard{{snd}} if rare{{snd}} 14-pin DIN, listed as operating at 250 kbit/s)\n** ST cartridge port (double-sided 40-contact edge connector socket, for 128&nbsp;KB [[ROM cartridge]]s)\n\nBecause of its [[parallel communication|bi-directional]] design, the Centronics printer port can be used for joystick input, and several games make use of available adaptors that plugged into the printer socket, providing two additional 9-pin joystick ports.\n\n===Monitor===\nThe ST supports a [[monochrome monitor|monochrome]] or color monitor. The color hardware supports two different resolutions, 320 \u00d7 200 with 16 out of 512 colors, or 640 \u00d7 200 with 4 out of 512 colors. The monochrome monitor was less expensive and has a single resolution of 640 \u00d7 400 at 71.25&nbsp;Hz. The attached monitor determines available resolutions, so software either supports both types of monitors or only works with one.<ref name=\"byte198601\">{{cite magazine | title=The Atari ST | magazine=[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] | volume=11 | issue=1 | date=January 1986 | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-01/1986_01_BYTE_11-01_Robotics#page/n85/mode/2up | accessdate=17 April 2016 | last1=Edwards | first1=Jon R. | last2=Robinson | first2=Phillip | last3=McLaughlin | first3=Brenda | pages=84}}</ref> Color is required by a majority of games.\n\n===Floppy drive===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nAtari initially used single-sided 3.5 inch [[floppy disk|disk drives]] that could store up to 360&nbsp;kB.<!-- Is this 360x10^3 bytes, or 360x2^10? --> Later drives were double-sided and stored 720&nbsp;kB. Some commercial software, particularly games, shipped by default on single-sided disks, even supplying two 360kB floppies instead of a single double-sided one, for fear of alienating [[early adopter]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nAnother sticking point with the ST's floppy drives was that, whilst double-sided drive equipped STs could happily read discs formatted under [[MS-DOS]] on IBM PCs, PCs could not themselves read Atari disks, because the initial versions of TOS could recognise, read, and write to{{snd}} but not themselves create{{snd}} discs in the same particular specification used and indeed demanded by MS-DOS because of differences in the layout of data on track 0. Atari ST native format uses 5 sectors for FAT12 entries, while MSDOS uses 3 sectors for double sided floppies and 2 sectors for single sided floppies. Although the number of sectors for the FAT12 entries is included on track 0, MSDOS ignores it and assumes 2 (single sided) or 3 sectors (double sided). The Atari ST uses that info, so it can operate with floppies formatted either way. Achieving successful data interchange between the two platforms normally meant using floppies formatted by MSDOS, or by third party formatting utilities that were later released for the Atari ST. Conversion utilities such as MOSDOS.TOS could convert a native ST formatted floppy to a MSDOS compatible floppy. Other utilities allowed for transfer with unusual formats, such as the Commodor Amiga. Atari's own version 1.4 (and later) TOS upgrades, switched to formatting MSDOS compatible floppies.\n\n=== STF and STFM models ===\n[[File:Atari ST 1040.jpg|thumb|Atari 1040ST<sup>F</sup>]]\n\nAtari later upgraded the basic design in 1986 with the ''1040ST<sup>F</sup>'' (also written ''STF''). The machine is generally similar to the earlier 520ST, but moved the power supply and a double-sided [[floppy drive]] into the rear of the housing of the computer, as opposed to being external. This added to the size of the machine, but reduced cable clutter in the back. The joystick/mouse ports, formerly on the right side of the machine where the disk drive now sat, were moved to a niche underneath the keyboard.\n\nThe ''1040ST'' was the first personal computer shipped with a base RAM configuration of 1&nbsp;MB. When the list price was reduced to $999 in the U.S. it appeared on the cover of ''[[Byte Magazine|BYTE]]'' in March 1986 as the first computer to break the $1000/megabyte price barrier;<ref name=\"byte198603\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-03/1986_03_BYTE_11-03_Homebound_Computing#page/n91/mode/2up | title=The Atari 1040ST | work=BYTE | date=March 1986 | accessdate=4 July 2014 |author1=Robinson, Philip |author2=Edwards, Jon R. | pages=84}}</ref><ref name=\"3years\"/> ''[[Compute!]]'' noted that, in fact, the ''1040ST'' was the first computer to break the $2500/megabyte price barrier.<ref name=\"halfhilll198604\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-04-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_071_1986_Apr#page/n31/mode/2up | title=A Turning Point For Atari? | work=Compute! | date=April 1986 | accessdate=8 November 2013 | author=Halfhill, Tom R. | pages=30}}</ref> However, the ST remained generally the same internally over the majority of its several-year lifespan. The choice of model numbers was inherited from the model numbers of the ''XE series'' of the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers. A limited number of 1040STFs shipped with a single-sided floppy drive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nThe same basic design was also used for a cut-down version, the 512 kB ''520STFM'', which replaced the earlier 520ST models in the market. The early 'STF' machines lack the 'M' modulator that allows a TV to be used and will only work with a monitor.\n\n=== Mega models ===\nInitial sales were strong, especially in Europe where Atari sold 75% of its computers. Germany became Atari's strongest market,<ref name=\"3years\"/> with small business users using them for desktop publishing and CAD.\n\nTo address this growing market segment, Atari came up with the ''ST1''. Debuted at Comdex in 1986, it was received favorably. Renamed the ''Mega'', this new machine includes a high-quality detached keyboard, a stronger case to support the weight of a monitor, and an internal bus expansion connector. A 20 MB hard drive called the SH204 could be purchased as an option and stacked below or above the main case of the Mega. The upcoming SLM804 [[laser printer]] would not come with a processor or memory, reducing costs. It attached to the Mega through the ST DMA port and required the Mega computer to render the pages. As TOS was not a [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] OS, this meant the computer could not be used while printing. Initially equipped with 2 or 4 MB (a 1 MB version, the ''Mega 1'' would later follow), the Mega machines would complement the Atari laser printer for a low-cost desktop publishing package, which received acclaim and was featured on the cover of Computer Shopper magazine.\n\nA custom [[blitter]] co-processor was to be included to speed the performance of some graphics operations on the screen, but due to delays it was eventually released on the ''Mega 2'' and ''Mega 4'' machines. Developers wanting to use it had to detect for it in their programs because it was not present on all machines. However, properly written programs using the screen VDI commands can use the blitter seamlessly, since GEM [[Application programming interface|API]] is a higher-level interface to ''TOS''.\n\n== Later models ==\n\n=== STE models ===\nIn late 1989, [[Atari]] released the 520ST<sup>E</sup> and 1040ST<sup>E</sup> (also written STE), enhanced version of the ST with improvements to the multimedia hardware and operating system. It features an increased color palette of 4,096 colors from the ST's 512 (though the maximum displayable palette of these without programming tricks was still limited to 16 in the lowest 320x200 resolution, and even fewer in higher resolutions), [[Genlock]] support, and a [[blitter]] co-processor (stylized as \"BLiTTER\") which can quickly move large blocks of data (most particularly, graphics data) around in RAM.  The STE was the first Atari with PCM audio; using a new chip, it added the ability to play back 8-bit (signed) samples at 6258&nbsp;Hz, 12517&nbsp;Hz, 25033&nbsp;Hz and even 50066&nbsp;Hz, via [[Direct memory access|DMA]] (Direct Memory Access). The channels are arranged as either a mono track or a track of LRLRLRLR... bytes.  RAM was now much more simply upgradable via [[SIMM]]s.\n\nTwo enhanced joystick ports were added (two normal joysticks can be plugged into each port with an adapter), with the new connectors placed in more easily accessed locations on the side of the case. The enhanced joystick ports were re-used in Atari's [[Atari Jaguar|Jaguar]] console and are compatible.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe STE models initially had software and hardware conflicts resulting in some [[Application software|applications]] and video games written for the ST line being unstable or even completely unusable, primarily caused by programming direct hardware calls which bypassed the operating system. Furthermore, even having a joystick plugged in would sometimes cause strange behavior with a few applications (such as the [[WYSIWYG]] word-processor application [[1st Word/1st Word Plus|1st Word Plus]]). Very little use was made of the extra features of the STE: STE-enhanced and STE-only software was rare.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe last STE machine, the ''[[Atari MEGA STE|Mega STE]]'', is an STE in a grey [[Atari TT030|Atari TT]] case that had a switchable 16&nbsp;MHz, dual-bus design (16-bit external, 32-bit internal), optional [[Motorola 68881]] [[floating point unit|FPU]], built-in 3\u00bd-inch floppy disk drive, [[VMEbus|VME]] expansion slot, a network port (very similar to that used by Apple's [[LocalTalk]]) and an optional built-in 3\u00bd\" hard drive. It also shipped with TOS 2.00 (better support for hard drives, enhanced desktop interface, memory test, 1.44&nbsp;MB floppy support, bug fixes). It was marketed as more affordable than a TT but more powerful than an ordinary ST.\n\n=== Atari TT ===\n{{Main|Atari TT030}}\n\nIn 1990, Atari released the high-end workstation-oriented ''Atari TT030'', based on a 32&nbsp;MHz [[Motorola 68030]] processor. The \"TT\" name (\"Thirty-two/Thirty-two\") continued the nomenclature system as the 68030 chip had full 32-bit wide buses both internally and externally. Originally planned with a 68020 CPU, the TT included improved graphics and more powerful support chips. The case was a new design with an integrated hard-drive enclosure.\n\n=== Atari Falcon ===\n{{Main|Atari Falcon}}\n[[File:Atari Falcon 030 (white bg).jpg|thumb|right|The Falcon case closely resembled that of the ST<sup>F</sup> and ST<sup>E</sup>, albeit with a slightly altered colour scheme.]]\n\nThe final ST computer is the multimedia-capable ''Atari Falcon030''. Like the TT, this was also 68030-based, operating at 16&nbsp;MHz, but with improved video modes and an on-board [[Motorola 56000|Motorola 56001]] audio [[digital signal processor]]. The Falcon, like the [[Atari STE]], supports sampling frequencies above 44.1&nbsp;kHz; the sampling master clock is 98340&nbsp;Hz, which can be divided by a number between 2 and 16 to get the actual sampling frequencies. Apart from these frequencies, it is also able to play the STE sample frequencies (up to 50066&nbsp;Hz) in 8 or 16 bit, mono/stereo, all by using the same DMA interface as the STE, with a few additions. The Falcon can both play back and record samples; it has 8 mono channels / 4 stereo channels; thus this allowed musicians to use the computer for harddisk recording. Although the 68030 microprocessor is capable of using 32-bit memory, the Falcon uses a 16-bit bus which affects performance, but also served to reduce its cost. In another cost-reduction measure, Atari shipped the Falcon in an inexpensive case much like that of the ST<sup>F</sup> and ST<sup>E</sup>. Aftermarket upgrade kits were available that allowed the Falcon to be put in a desktop or rack-mount case, with the keyboard separate.\n\nReleased in 1992, the Falcon was discontinued by Atari the following year. In Europe, C-Lab licensed the Falcon design from Atari, and released the C-Lab Falcon Mk I (the same as Atari's Falcon except for some slight modifications to the audio circuitry), Mk II (as Mk I but with an internal 500 MB SCSI hard disk) and Mk X (as Mk II but in a desktop case). The C-Lab Falcons were also imported to the US by at least some Atari dealers.\n\n== Software ==\nAs with the Atari 8-bit computers,<ref name=\"cgw198604\">{{cite magazine | title=Survey of Game Manufacturers | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=27 | date=April 1986 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_27.pdf | accessdate=April 17, 2016 | pages=32}}</ref><ref name=\"williams198610\">{{cite magazine | title=Atari Playfield | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=31 | date=September\u2013October 1986 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_31.pdf | accessdate=April 17, 2016 | last=Williams | first=Gregg | pages=35}}</ref><ref name=\"brooks198705\">{{cite magazine | title=Computer Wargaming 1988-1992 | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=37 | date=May 1987 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_37.pdf | accessdate=April 17, 2016 | last=Brooks | first=M.

Because the ST market was smaller than that for the IBM PC it was more vulnerable to piracy which, Louie said, seemed to be better organized and more widely accepted for the ST. He reported that the Amiga version sold in six weeks twice as much as the ST version in nine weeks, and that the Mac and PC versions had four times the sales.

The popular Windows/Macintosh applications ''[[Cubase]]'' and ''[[Logic Pro]]'' originated on the Atari ST (the latter as ''Notator Logic'', preceded by ''Creator'', ''Notator'' and ''Notator-SL''). Another popular and powerful ST music sequencer application, Dr. T's ''KCS'', contains a \"Multi-Program Environment\" that allows ST users to run other applications, such as the synthesizer patch editing software XoR (now known as Unisyn on the Macintosh), from within the sequencer application.<ref>[http://tamw.atari-users.net/omega.htm Dr T'S Kcs And Tiger Cub]. Tamw.atari-users.net. Retrieved on 2013-04-22.</ref>\n\nMusic [[Tracker (music software)|tracker]] software was popular on the ST, such as the ''TCB Tracker'', aiding the production of quality music from the Yamaha synthesizer ('chiptunes').\n\nAn innovative music composition program that combines the sample playing abilities of a tracker with conventional music notation (which was usually only found in MIDI software) is called ''Quartet'' (after its four-note polyphonic tracker, which displays one monophonic stave at a time on color screens).\n\nDue to the ST having comparatively large amounts of memory for the time, sound sampling packages became a realistic proposition. The Microdeal ''[[Replay Professional]]'' product features a sound sampler that cleverly uses the ST cartridge port to read in parallel from the cartridge port from the [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]. For output of digital sound, it uses the on-board frequency output, sets it to 128&nbsp;kHz (inaudible) and then modulates the amplitude of that.\n\nAnother program that had success on the ST platform is ''[[MasterTracks Pro (software)|MasterTracks Pro]]'' from Passport Designs, of Half Moon Bay, CA., that was first put out by Don Williams for the Macintosh. When the ST died, a PC version continued that one could port MIDI to using the generic .MID format. GVox bought out Passport, and continues the program for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] along with the other Passport product, the notation program ''[[Encore (software)|Encore]]'', which is as of 2013 marketed and maintained by a new iteration, Passport Music Software, LLC.\n\n=== Software titles ===\n\n[[File:Degas elite batteries included.png|thumb|Degas Elite by [[Batteries Included (company)|Batteries Included]] ]]\n\nAlso popular on the ST was professional [[desktop publishing]] software, such as ''[[PageStream]]'' and ''[[Calamus (DTP)|Calamus]]''; office tools such as word processors (''[[WordPerfect]]'', ''[[Microsoft Write]]'', ''AtariWorks'', ''WordWriter ST'', First Word <small>[shipped with the machine]</small> and its Plus continuation, and others); spreadsheets (''[[3D-Calc]]'', ''LDW Power'', ''LDW Power 2'', ''LOGiSTiX Senior'', ''PowerLedger ST'', ''SwiftCalc ST'', ''VIP Professional'', and others); turnkey programs (''Mail-Pro'', ''Sales-Pro 6'', ''Video-Pro'', and others); database programs (''A-Calc Prime'', ''Data Manager'', ''Data Manager Professional'', ''DBMan V'', ''Base Two'', ''H&DBase'', ''Informer II'', ''DB Master One'', ''SBT Database Accounting Library'' (''dLedger'', ''dInvoice'', ''dOrder'', ''dPurchases'', and ''dPayables)'', ''Superbase Personal'', ''Superbase Professional'', ''Tracker ST'', [[Zoomracks]] and others); and various CAD and CAM tools from amateur hobbyist to professional grade (Campus CAD, DynaCADD, Leonard ST, Technobox CAD/2...): all being largely targeted at, or even limited to owners of high-resolution monochrome monitors.\n\nGraphics programs such as ''[[NEOchrome]]'', [[DEGAS (software)|Degas & Degas Elite]], ''Canvas'', ''[[Deluxe Paint]]'', and ''Cyber Paint'' (which author [[Jim Kent]] would later evolve into ''[[Autodesk Animator]]'')<ref name=\"asterius\">[http://www.asterius.com/atari/cyberpaint.html The Antic Cyber Graphics Software and the Pre-History of Autodesk 3D Studio and Discreet 3ds max].

It does not feature the Atari ST's GEM graphical user interface but, instead, features an application specific graphical user interface and widget framework which he developed using, in part, the [[Neochrome]] paint program.\n\n=== Software development ===\nThe initial development kit from Atari included a computer and manuals. The $5,000 cost discouraged many from developing software for the ST. Later, the Atari Developer's Kit consisted of software and manuals (but no hardware) for $300. Included with the kit were a resource kit, C compiler (first Alcyon C, then Mark Williams C), debugger, and 68000 assembler (plus the non-disclosure agreement). The third-party [[Megamax C]] development package reduced the cost of entry to $200.\n\nThe ST came bundled with a system disk that contained [[ST BASIC]], the first BASIC for the ST. However, due to its poor performance, users favored other BASICs, such as HiSoft BASIC, [[GFA BASIC]], FaST BASIC (notable for being one of the few programs to be supplied as a ROM cartridge), [[DTACK Grounded|DBASIC]], LDW BASIC and ''[[STOS BASIC programming language|STOS]]'', which then inspired and led to the creation of AMOS on the Amiga,<ref>{{Diff|en:AMOS_(programming_language)|diff=|oldid=905928471|label=en:AMOS_(programming_language),   oldid 905928471}}{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}}</ref> and was powerful enough that it was used (with a compiler, opposed to its usual runtime interpreter) for the production of at least two commercial titles and a host of good quality shareware and public domain games. In the late years of the Atari ST Omikron Basic was bundled with it in Germany.\n\nOther development tools include 68000 assemblers (MadMac from Atari Corp, [[HiSoft Systems]]'s Devpac, TurboAss, GFA-Assembler), Pascal (OSS Personal Pascal, Maxon Pascal, PurePascal), [[Modula-2]], C compilers ([[Lattice C]], [[Megamax C]], [[GNU Compiler Collection|GNU C]], Aztec C, AHCC), [[LISP]], [[Prolog]], [[Logo programming language|Logo]], and others.\n\n=== Games ===\n{{see also|List of Atari ST games|Category:Atari ST games}}\nThe ST enjoyed success in gaming due to the low cost, fast performance, and colorful graphics. Notable individuals who developed games on the ST include [[Peter Molyneux]], [[Doug Bell]], [[Jeff Minter]], [[\u00c9ric Chahi]], [[Jez San]], and [[David Braben]].\n\nThe realtime pseudo-3D [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]]'', was developed and released first on the ST, and was the best-selling software ever produced for the platform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamesnostalgia.com/game/dungeon-master|title=Dungeon Master (Amiga) Game Download|website=GamesNostalgia|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> Simulation games like ''[[Falcon (video game)|Falcon]]'' and ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator#History|Flight Simulator II]]'' made use of the ST's graphics, as did many arcade ports. Proto first person shooter ''[[MIDI Maze]]'', uses the [[MIDI]] ports to connect up to 16 machines for networked deathmatch play. The critically acclaimed ''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]]'' was originally released for ST and Amiga in 1991 with the engine developed on the ST and the rotoscoped animations created on the Amiga. Games simultaneously released on the Amiga that didn't use the Amiga's superior graphics and sound capabilities were often accused by video game magazines of simply being ST ports.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[Garry Kasparov]] became the first player to register the commercial ''[[ChessBase]]'', a popular commercial database program produced for storing and searching records of games of chess. The first version was built for Atari ST with his collaboration in January 1987.<ref>Chessdatabase and Gary Kasparov http://en.chessbase.com/home/TabId/211/PostId/4007229</ref> In his autobiography ''Child of Change'', he regards this facility as \"the most important development in chess research since printing.\"\n\n=== Emulators ===\n[[Spectre GCR]] lets the ST emulate the [[Macintosh]]. There were also MS-DOS emulators released in the late 1980s. ''PC-Ditto'' came in two versions: software-only, and a hardware version that plugs into the cartridge slot or kludges internally. After running the PC-Ditto software, a DOS boot disk is required to load the system. Both allow users to run DOS programs in [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] mode, though much more slowly than on an [[IBM PC]]. Other options are the ''PC-Speed'' ([[NEC V30]]), ''AT-Speed'' ([[Intel 80286]]) and ''ATonce-386SX'' ([[80386SX|Intel 80386sx]]) hardware emulator boards.\n\n==Popularity with musicians==\nThe ST's low cost, built-in MIDI ports, and fast, low-latency response times made it a favorite with musicians:\n\n* German electronic music pioneers [[Tangerine Dream]] relied heavily on the Atari ST in the studio and for live performances during the late 1980s and 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n3/tangerinedream.html|title=Making Tracks With MIDI - A Profile of Tangerine Dream|author=Mard Naman|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\n* The album notes for [[Mike Oldfield]]'s ''[[Earth Moving]]'' state that it was recorded using an Atari ST and C-Lab MIDI software.\n* The [[Fatboy Slim]] album ''You've Come A Long Way, Baby'' has an Atari ST in the large foldout picture of Fatboy Slim's studio.\n* [[Electronic music]] artists [[Mike Paradinas]] and [[Luke Vibert]] started out writing music on Atari STs.\n* In the Paris performance of [[Jean Michel Jarre]]'s album ''Waiting for Cousteau'', musicians have attached Atari ST machines with unidentified MIDI software to their keyboards, as could be seen in the TV live show and video recordings.\n* [[White Town]]'s \"[[Your Woman]]\", which reached #1 in the UK singles charts, was created using an Atari ST.<ref>[http://www.whitetown.co.uk/faq/ White Town \u2013 Your Questions Answered!].

This early version of TOS was bootstrapped from a very small core boot ROM, but this was quickly replaced with (expanded capacity) [[Read-only memory|ROM]] versions of TOS 1.0 when it was ready. (This change was also greatly welcomed as older ST machines with memory below 512 kB suffered, as GEM loaded its entire 192 kB code into RAM when booting the desktop). Having the OS loaded from disk was due to Atari trying to rush the machines to market without ironing out all the bugs in the OS. Soon after this change, most production models became ST<sup>F</sup>s, with an integrated single- (520STF/512 kB RAM) or double-sided (1040STF/1024 kB RAM) double density floppy disk drive built-in, but no other changes. The next later models used an upgraded version of TOS: 1.02 (also known as TOS 1.2). Another early addition (after about 6 months) was an [[RF Modulator]] that allows the machine to be hooked to a color TV when run in its low or medium resolution (525/625 line 60/50&nbsp;Hz interlace, even on RGB monitors) modes, greatly enhancing the machine's saleability and perceived value (no need to buy a prohibitively expensive, even if exceptionally crisp and clear, monitor). These models were known as the ''520ST<sup>M</sup>'' (or ''520STM''). Later ''F'' and ''FM'' models of the 520 had a built-in [[double-sided disk]] drive instead of a single-sided one.\n\n=== ST<sup>E</sup> ===\nAs originally released in the ''520ST<sup>E</sup>/1040ST<sup>E</sup>'':\n\n* All of the features of the 520STFM/1040STFM\n* Extended palette of 4,096 available colors to choose from\n* [[BLiTTER]] chip to copy/fill/clear large data blocks in memory (with a max write rate of 4 Mbit/s)\n* Hardware support for horizontal and vertical fine scrolling and split screen (using the Shifter video chip)\n* DMA [[sound chip]] with 2-channels stereo 8-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] sound at 6.25/12.5/25/50&nbsp;kHz and stereo RCA audio-out jacks (using enhancements to the Shifter video chip to support audio shifting)\n* National LMC 1992 audio controller chip, allowing adjustable left/right/master volume and bass and treble EQ via a [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus#Microwire|Microwire]] interface\n* Memory: 30-pin [[SIMM]] memory slots ([[SIPP memory|SIPP]] packages in earliest versions) allowing upgrades up to 4 MB Allowable memory sizes including only 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and 4.0 MB due to configuration restraints (however, 2.5 MB is not officially supported and has compatibility problems). Later third-party upgrade kits allow a maximum of 14MB [http://www.stcarchiv.de/stc1997/03/magnum-st w/Magnum-ST], bypassing the stock [[Memory management unit|MMU]] with a replacement unit and the additional chips on a separate board fitting over it.\n* Ability to synchronise the video timings with an external device so that a video [[Genlock]] device can be used without having to make any modifications to computer's hardware\n* Analogue joypad ports (2), with support for devices such as paddles and light pens in addition to joysticks/joypads.

The early models had only a bootstrap ROM and TOS had to be loaded from disk.\n; 520ST+: early 520STs with 1&nbsp;MB of RAM, but without floppy disk\n; 260ST: originally intended to be a 256&nbsp;kB variant, but actually sold in small quantities in Europe with 512&nbsp;KB. Used after the release of the 520ST+ to differentiate the cheaper 512&nbsp;KB models from the 1&nbsp;MB models. Because the early 520ST's were sold with TOS on disk, but this used up 192&nbsp;KB or RAM so the machine only had around 256KB left.\n; 520ST<sup>M</sup>: a 520ST with a built-in modulator for TV output and 512&nbsp;KB RAM.\n; 520ST<sup>FM</sup>: a 520STM with a newly redesigned motherboard in a larger case with a built-in floppy disk drive (in some cases a single sided drive only), and 512&nbsp;KB RAM.\n; 1040ST<sup>F</sup>: a 520STFM with 1&nbsp;MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive, but without RF modulator\n; 1040ST<sup>FM</sup>: a 520STFM with 1&nbsp;MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive with RF modulator\n; Mega ST (MEGA 1, MEGA 2, MEGA 4): redesigned motherboard with 1, 2 or 4&nbsp;MB of RAM, respectively, in a much improved \"[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]\" case with a detached keyboard. All MEGA mainboards have a PLCC socket for the BLiTTER chip and some early models did not include the BLiTTER chip. They also included a real-time clock and internal expansion connector. Some early MEGA 2 had a MEGA 4 mainboard with half of the memory chip places unpopulated and the MEGA 2 can be upgraded by adding the additional DRAM chips and some resistors for the control lines. The MEGA 1 mainboards had a redesigned memory chip area and could not be upgraded in this way as there are only places for the 1&nbsp;MByte DRAM chips.\n; 520ST<sup>E</sup> and 1040ST<sup>E</sup>: a 520STFM/1040STFM with enhanced sound, a BLiTTER chip, and a 4096-color palette, in the older 1040-style all-in-one case\n; [[Atari MEGA STE|Mega STE]]: same hardware as 1040STE except for a faster 16&nbsp;MHz processor with 16K cache, an onboard SCSI controller, additional faster RS232 port, VME expansion port, in an ST gray version of the TT case\n; [[STacy]]: a [[portable computer|portable]] (but definitely not [[laptop]]) version of the ST with the complete ST keyboard, an LCD screen simulating 640x400 hi-res, and a mini-trakball intended mostly for travellers and musicians because of the backlit screen and its built-in midi ports. Originally designed to operate on 12 standard [[C battery|C cell]] flashlight batteries for portability, when Atari finally realized how quickly the machine would use up a set of batteries (especially when rechargeable batteries of the time supplied insufficient power compared to the intended alkalines), they simply glued the lid of the battery compartment shut.\n; [[ST BOOK]]: a later portable ST, more portable than the STacy, but sacrificing several features in order to achieve this{{snd}} notably the backlight and internal floppy disk drive. Files were meant to be stored on a small amount (one megabyte) of internal [[flash memory]] 'on the road' and transferred using serial or parallel links, memory flashcards or external (and externally powered) floppy disk to a desktop ST once back indoors. The screen is highly reflective for the time, but still hard to use indoors or in low light, it is fixed to the 640 \u00d7 400 1-bit mono mode, and no external video port was provided. Despite its limitations, it gained some popularity, particularly amongst musicians.\n\n=== Unreleased ===\nThe 130ST was intended to be a 128&nbsp;KB variant. It was announced at the 1985 CES alongside the 520ST but never produced. The 4160ST<sup>E</sup> was a 1040ST<sup>E</sup>, but with 4&nbsp;MB of RAM. A small quantity of development units were produced, but the system was never officially released. Atari did produce a quantity of 4160STE metallic case badges which found their way to dealers, so it's not uncommon to find one attached to systems which were originally 520/1040STE. No such labels were produced for the base of the systems.\n\n=== Related systems ===\n[[Atari Transputer Workstation]] is a standalone machine developed in conjunction with Perihelion Hardware, containing modified ST hardware and up to 17 [[transputer]]s capable of [[massively parallel]] operations for tasks such as ray tracing.\n\n=== Clones ===\nFollowing Atari's exit from the computer market, both Medusa Computer Systems and Milan Computer manufactured Atari Falcon/TT-compatible machines that used [[Motorola 68040|68040]] and [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processors.

The hardware was so similar to Apple's Macintosh at the time that with the addition of the [[Spectre GCR]] the ST was able to run Macintosh software faster than an actual Mac Plus at the time (since the Atari's clock speed was higher) and with a larger and higher resolution display. In fact, the Stacy (the laptop version of the Atari ST) was the first and only way to own a laptop running Mac OS at the time since Apple did not offer one until much later.\n\nThe ST was sold with either Atari's color monitor or the less expensive [[monochrome monitor]]. The system's two color graphics modes are only available on the former while the highest-resolution mode needs the monochrome monitor.\n\nIn some markets, particularly [[Germany]], the machine gained a strong foothold as a [[small business]] machine for [[CAD]] and [[desktop publishing]] work. Thanks to its built-in [[MIDI]] ports, the ST enjoyed success for running [[music sequencer]] software and as a [[MIDI controller|controller]] of [[musical instrument]]s among amateurs and well-known musicians alike.\n\nThe ST was superseded by the [[Atari STE]], [[Atari TT]], [[Atari MEGA STE]], and [[Atari Falcon|Falcon]] computers.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe Atari ST was born from the rivalry between home-computer makers [[Atari, Inc.]] and [[Commodore International]].\n\n=== Amiga contract ===\n[[Jay Miner]], one of the original designers for the custom chips found in the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 8-bit family]], tried to convince Atari management to create a new chipset for a video game console and computer. When his idea was rejected, Miner left Atari to form a small [[think tank]] called Hi-Toro in 1982 and began designing the new \"Lorraine\" chipset. The company, which was later renamed [[Amiga Corporation]], was pretending to sell video game controllers to deceive competition while it developed a Lorraine-based computer.<ref>{{YouTube|VCREhVvHXL4|\"History of Amiga video\"}} (2008-02-18). Retrieved on 2013-04-22.</ref>\n\nAmiga ran out of capital to complete Lorraine's development, and Atari, owned by [[Warner Communications]], paid Amiga to continue development work. In return Atari received exclusive use of the Lorraine design for one year as a video game console. After one year Atari would have the right to add a keyboard and market the complete computer, designated the 1850XLD. As Atari was heavily involved with Disney at the time, it was later code-named \"Mickey\", and the 256K memory expansion board was codenamed \"Minnie\".<ref>[http://archives.atarimuseum.com/archives/archives.html \"Confidential Atari-Amiga Agreement\" and \"Afterthoughts: The Atari 1600XL Rumor\"].

The company initially considered the [[National Semiconductor]] [[NS320xx]] microprocessor but was disappointed with its performance.{{r|3years}}{{r|chin19850128}} This started the move to the 68000.

He secured funding and bought Atari's Consumer Division (which included the console and home computer departments) in July. As executives and engineers left Commodore to join Tramel Technology, Commodore responded by filing lawsuits against four former engineers for theft of trade secrets.\n\nThe Tramiels did not purchase the employee contracts when they bought the assets of Atari Inc., so one of their first acts was to interview Atari Inc. employees to decide whom to hire at what was essentially a brand new company. At the time of the purchase of Atari Inc's assets, there were roughly 900 employees remaining from a high point of 10,000. After the interviews, approximately 100 employees were hired to work at Tramel Technology, which soon changed its name to [[Atari Corporation]].\n\nAt one point a custom sound processor called AMY was a planned component for the new ST computer design, but the chip needed more time to complete, so AMY was dropped in favor of an off-the-shelf Yamaha sound chip.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIt was during this time in late July/early August that Leonard Tramiel discovered the original Amiga contract, which required Amiga Corporation to deliver the Lorraine chipset to Atari on June 30, 1984. Amiga Corp. had sought more monetary support from investors in spring 1984 (among them Tramel<!--*Not* \"Tramiel\"--> Technology, which wished to replace nearly everyone at Amiga).\n\n=== Commodore and Amiga ===\nHaving heard rumors that Tramiel was negotiating to buy Atari, Amiga Corp. entered into discussions with Commodore. The discussions led to Commodore wanting to purchase Amiga Corporation outright, which Commodore believed would cancel any outstanding contracts, including Atari's. Instead of Amiga Corp. delivering Lorraine to Atari, Commodore delivered a check of $500,000 to Atari on Amiga's behalf, in effect returning the funds Atari invested into Amiga for the chipset. Tramiel countersued Amiga Corp. on August 13, 1984. He sought damages and an injunction to bar Amiga (and effectively Commodore) from producing anything with its technology.\n\nAt Commodore, the Amiga team was in limbo during the summer of 1984 because of the lawsuit. No word on the status of the chipset, the Lorraine computer, or the team's fate was known. In the fall of 1984, Commodore informed the team that the Lorraine project was active again, the chipset was to be improved, the [[operating system]] (OS) developed, and the hardware design completed. While Commodore announced the [[Amiga 1000]] with the Lorraine chipset in July 1985, the delay gave Atari, with its many former Commodore engineers, time to deliver the first Atari ST units in June 1985. In March 1987, the two companies settled the dispute out of court in a closed decision.<ref name=\"3years\">{{cite news |first = Jeffrey |last = Daniels |title = 3 Years With the ST |url = http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n1/threeyearsofst.html |work = START Magazine |publisher = James Capparell |page = 22 |date = Summer 1988 |accessdate = 2010-05-15 }}</ref><ref name=\"jayminer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.heartbone.com/comphist/JayMiner.html |title=Jay G.

Soon after the Atari buyout, [[Microsoft]] approached Tramiel with the suggestion that they port [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] to the platform, but the delivery date was out by two years, far too long for their needs. Another possibility was [[Digital Research]], who was working on a new GUI-based system then known as Crystal, soon to become [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]]. Another option was to write a new operating system in-house, but this was rejected as Atari management was unsure whether the company had the required expertise to do so.<ref name=\"3years\"/>\n\nDigital Research was fully committed to the Intel platform, so a team from Atari was sent to the Digital Research headquarters to work with the \"Monterey Team\" which comprised a mixture of Atari and Digital Research engineers. Atari's Leonard Tramiel was the Atari person overseeing \"Project Jason\" (a.k.a. The Operating System) for the Atari ST line of computers. The name came from the original designer and developer, Jason Loveman.<ref name=\"oren\">{{cite web|last1=Oren|first1=Tim|title=Professional GEM Column #15|url=http://cd.textfiles.com/crawlycrypt1/program/books/progem/gemdos.15|website=textfiles.com|publisher=Antic Publishing|date=1986}}</ref>\n\nGEM was based on CP/M-68K, essentially a direct port of [[CP/M]] to the 68000. By 1985, CP/M was becoming increasingly outdated; it did not support sub-directories, for example. Digital Research was also in the process of building a new [[DOS]]-like operating system specifically for GEM, ''GEMDOS'', and there was some discussion of whether or not a port of GEMDOS could be completed in time for product delivery in June. The decision was eventually taken to port it, resulting in a GEMDOS file system which became part of [[Atari TOS]] (''The Operating System'' and colloquially known as the ''Tramiel Operating System''). This gave the ST a fast, hierarchical file system, essential for hard drives, plus programmers had function calls similar to [[IBM PC DOS]]. The [[Atari ST character set|character set]] is based on [[codepage 437]].\n\nBesides the original TOS operating system, a number of third-party OSes were developed for, or ported to, the Atari ST. Among Unix clones, [[Idris (operating system)|Idris]], [[Minix]] had an Atari ST port and the [[MiNT|Mint]] OS was developed specifically for the Atari ST.\n\n== Debut and release ==\nAfter six months of intensive effort following Tramiel's takeover, Atari announced the 520ST at the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in January 1985.<ref name=\"3years\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Winter CES 1985 Report|url=http://obligement.free.fr/articles_traduction/winter_ces_1985_en.php}}</ref> ''InfoWorld'' described prototypes shown at computer shows as a \"typical Commodore-64-style, corner-cutting, low-cost Jack Tramiel product\",<ref name=\"iw19850415\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA13&ots=a_Fs_n1Np8&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=GEM on ROM for the Atari ST | work=InfoWorld | date=1985-04-15 | accessdate=4 February 2015 | pages=13 | editor=McCarthy, Michael}}</ref> but Atari unexpectedly displayed the ST at Atlanta [[COMDEX]] in May.<ref name=\"sanger19850513\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/13/business/atari-is-facing-new-doubts.html |title=Atari is Facing New Doubts |last=Sanger, David E. |date=1985-05-13 |work=The New York Times |access-date=5 January 2015}}</ref> Due to its similarities to the original [[Macintosh]] and Tramiel's role in its development, it was quickly nicknamed the '''Jackintosh'''.<ref name=chin19850128>{{cite news|author=Chin, Kathy|title=Atari Announces Six New Computers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6i4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false|work=InfoWorld|publisher=IDG|date=1985-01-28|accessdate=2011-03-19|pages=15\u201316}}</ref> Atari's rapid development of the ST amazed many,<ref name=\"3years\"/><ref name=\"chin19850128\" /> but others were more skeptical, citing the ST's \"cheap\" appearance, Atari's uncertain financial health, and the poor relations the Tramiel-led Commodore had with software developers.<ref name=\"chin19850128\" /><ref name=\"sanger19850513\" /><ref name=\"chinsoft19850128\" />\n\nAfter purchasing Atari, ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that Tramiel's poor reputation likely made computer stores reluctant to deal with the company, hurting its distribution of the ST.<ref name=\"oxner198605\">{{cite magazine | title=Hobby & Industry News | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=28 | date=May 1986 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_28.pdf | accessdate=17 April 2016 | last=Oxner | first=Bill | pages=4}}</ref> One retailer said, \"If you can believe [[Lucy Van Pelt|Lucy]] when she holds the football for [[Charlie Brown]], you can believe Jack Tramiel\",<ref name=\"steele19850709\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SprPDrQRvM8C&lpg=PA51&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=COMDEX: Nothing New Under the Georgia Sun | work=PC Magazine | date=1985-07-09 | accessdate=28 October 2013 | author=Steele, William | pages=34}}</ref> and another said that because of its experience with Tramiel \"Our interest in Atari is zero, zilch\".<ref name=\"maremaa19850603\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8C4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Atari Ships New 520 ST | work=InfoWorld | date=1985-06-03 | accessdate=19 July 2014 | author=Maremaa, Tom | pages=23}}</ref> Neither Atari nor Commodore was able to persuade large chains like [[ComputerLand]] or BusinessLand to sell their products,<ref name=\"nyt19851216\" /> but observers criticized Atari's erratic discussion of its stated plans for the new computer, quickly shifting from using [[mass merchandiser]]s to specialty computer stores to both; Atari executives could not name any computer stores that would carry the ST when asked at COMDEX.

By late 1985 the machines were also upgraded with the addition of an [[RF modulator]] (for TV display), a version known as the 520ST<sup>M</sup>. ST systems before the Mega ST range have no battery-backed clock, although third party boards that went between the 6301 socket and the 6301 chip which was used for the keyboard and clock could be connected to a rechargeable battery pack to provide a battery-backed clock. <ref>http://rcgldr.net/atarist/tmsvr.jpg</ref>\n\nAtari originally intended to include GEM's GDOS (Graphical Device Operating System), which allowed programs to send GEM VDI ([[Virtual Device Interface]]) commands to drivers loaded by GDOS. This allowed developers to send VDI instructions to other [[Device file|devices]] simply by pointing to it. However, GDOS was not ready at the time the ST started shipping and was included in software packages and later ST machines. Later versions of GDOS supported vector fonts.\n\n[[File:ST BASIC - J.R.

Indeed, the company's English advertising strapline of the era was \"power without the price.\" In fact, an Atari ST and [[terminal emulation]] software was much cheaper than a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|Digital]] [[VT220]] terminal, which was commonly needed by offices with central computers.\n\n== Design ==\n=== Original housing ===\n[[File:Atari-520ST.jpg|thumb|The Atari 520ST]]\n\nThe original 520ST case design was created by Ira Velinsky{{snd}} Atari's chief Industrial Designer.<ref name=\"case\">{{cite web|title=Bold plans for new Atari|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=si4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=ira+velinsky#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=December 1984|work=[[InfoWorld]]|accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref> The ST is wedge-shaped, featuring bold angular lines and a series of grilles cut into the rear for airflow. The keyboard has soft tactile feedback and rhomboid-shaped function keys across the top. The 520ST is an all-in-one unit, similar to earlier home computers like the [[Commodore 64]], but with a larger keyboard with cursor keys and a numeric keypad.\n\nThe 520ST uses an external [[power brick]].\n\n=== Port connections ===\n[[File:Atari520ST Interface.jpg|thumb|Atari 520ST ports]]\n[[File:Atari st mouse.jpg|thumb|Atari ST mouse (2000)]]\n\nThe 520ST features a large number of ports mounted at the rear of the machine that remained largely unchanged over the ST's history.\n\n* Standard ports:\n** [[RS-232]]c serial port ([[D-subminiature|DB25]] male, operating as basic 9-conductor DTE)\n** [[Centronics printer port]] ([[D-subminiature|DB25]] female, officially compliant only with the most basic unidirectional standard with a single, \"Busy\" input line; unofficially offering some bidirectional capabilities)\n** [[Atari joystick port]]s ([[D-subminiature|DE-9]] male) for the mouse and game controllers\n** 2 [[MIDI]] ports (5-pin [[DIN connector|DIN]], \"IN\" and \"OUT\")<ref name=\"midi\">{{cite web |title=Atari ST Interfaces & Connectors |url=http://info-coach.fr/atari/hardware/interfaces.php |website=info-coach.fr |accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref>\n* ST-specific ports:\n** Monitor port (custom 13-pin [[DIN connector|DIN]], 12 of the pins in a rectangular pattern, carrying signals for both RGB and monochrome monitors, monophonic audio and, in later models, composite video)\n** ACSI (similar to [[SCSI]]) DMA port (custom-sized 19-pin D-sub, for hard disks and laser printers, capable of up to 2&nbsp;MByte/s with efficient programming)\n** Floppy port (standard{{snd}} if rare{{snd}} 14-pin DIN, listed as operating at 250 kbit/s)\n** ST cartridge port (double-sided 40-contact edge connector socket, for 128&nbsp;KB [[ROM cartridge]]s)\n\nBecause of its [[parallel communication|bi-directional]] design, the Centronics printer port can be used for joystick input, and several games make use of available adaptors that plugged into the printer socket, providing two additional 9-pin joystick ports.\n\n===Monitor===\nThe ST supports a [[monochrome monitor|monochrome]] or color monitor. The color hardware supports two different resolutions, 320 \u00d7 200 with 16 out of 512 colors, or 640 \u00d7 200 with 4 out of 512 colors. The monochrome monitor was less expensive and has a single resolution of 640 \u00d7 400 at 71.25&nbsp;Hz. The attached monitor determines available resolutions, so software either supports both types of monitors or only works with one.<ref name=\"byte198601\">{{cite magazine | title=The Atari ST | magazine=[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]] | volume=11 | issue=1 | date=January 1986 | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-01/1986_01_BYTE_11-01_Robotics#page/n85/mode/2up | accessdate=17 April 2016 | last1=Edwards | first1=Jon R. | last2=Robinson | first2=Phillip | last3=McLaughlin | first3=Brenda | pages=84}}</ref> Color is required by a majority of games.\n\n===Floppy drive===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nAtari initially used single-sided 3.5 inch [[floppy disk|disk drives]] that could store up to 360&nbsp;kB.<!-- Is this 360x10^3 bytes, or 360x2^10? --> Later drives were double-sided and stored 720&nbsp;kB. Some commercial software, particularly games, shipped by default on single-sided disks, even supplying two 360kB floppies instead of a single double-sided one, for fear of alienating [[early adopter]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nAnother sticking point with the ST's floppy drives was that, whilst double-sided drive equipped STs could happily read discs formatted under [[MS-DOS]] on IBM PCs, PCs could not themselves read Atari disks, because the initial versions of TOS could recognise, read, and write to{{snd}} but not themselves create{{snd}} discs in the same particular specification used and indeed demanded by MS-DOS because of differences in the layout of data on track 0. Atari ST native format uses 5 sectors for FAT12 entries, while MSDOS uses 3 sectors for double sided floppies and 2 sectors for single sided floppies. Although the number of sectors for the FAT12 entries is included on track 0, MSDOS ignores it and assumes 2 (single sided) or 3 sectors (double sided). The Atari ST uses that info, so it can operate with floppies formatted either way. Achieving successful data interchange between the two platforms normally meant using floppies formatted by MSDOS, or by third party formatting utilities that were later released for the Atari ST. Conversion utilities such as MOSDOS.TOS could convert a native ST formatted floppy to a MSDOS compatible floppy. Other utilities allowed for transfer with unusual formats, such as the Commodor Amiga. Atari's own version 1.4 (and later) TOS upgrades, switched to formatting MSDOS compatible floppies.\n\n=== STF and STFM models ===\n[[File:Atari ST 1040.jpg|thumb|Atari 1040ST<sup>F</sup>]]\n\nAtari later upgraded the basic design in 1986 with the ''1040ST<sup>F</sup>'' (also written ''STF''). The machine is generally similar to the earlier 520ST, but moved the power supply and a double-sided [[floppy drive]] into the rear of the housing of the computer, as opposed to being external. This added to the size of the machine, but reduced cable clutter in the back. The joystick/mouse ports, formerly on the right side of the machine where the disk drive now sat, were moved to a niche underneath the keyboard.\n\nThe ''1040ST'' was the first personal computer shipped with a base RAM configuration of 1&nbsp;MB. When the list price was reduced to $999 in the U.S. it appeared on the cover of ''[[Byte Magazine|BYTE]]'' in March 1986 as the first computer to break the $1000/megabyte price barrier;<ref name=\"byte198603\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1986-03/1986_03_BYTE_11-03_Homebound_Computing#page/n91/mode/2up | title=The Atari 1040ST | work=BYTE | date=March 1986 | accessdate=4 July 2014 |author1=Robinson, Philip |author2=Edwards, Jon R. | pages=84}}</ref><ref name=\"3years\"/> ''[[Compute!]]'' noted that, in fact, the ''1040ST'' was the first computer to break the $2500/megabyte price barrier.<ref name=\"halfhilll198604\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-04-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_071_1986_Apr#page/n31/mode/2up | title=A Turning Point For Atari? | work=Compute! | date=April 1986 | accessdate=8 November 2013 | author=Halfhill, Tom R. | pages=30}}</ref> However, the ST remained generally the same internally over the majority of its several-year lifespan. The choice of model numbers was inherited from the model numbers of the ''XE series'' of the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers. A limited number of 1040STFs shipped with a single-sided floppy drive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nThe same basic design was also used for a cut-down version, the 512 kB ''520STFM'', which replaced the earlier 520ST models in the market. The early 'STF' machines lack the 'M' modulator that allows a TV to be used and will only work with a monitor.\n\n=== Mega models ===\nInitial sales were strong, especially in Europe where Atari sold 75% of its computers. Germany became Atari's strongest market,<ref name=\"3years\"/> with small business users using them for desktop publishing and CAD.\n\nTo address this growing market segment, Atari came up with the ''ST1''. Debuted at Comdex in 1986, it was received favorably. Renamed the ''Mega'', this new machine includes a high-quality detached keyboard, a stronger case to support the weight of a monitor, and an internal bus expansion connector. A 20 MB hard drive called the SH204 could be purchased as an option and stacked below or above the main case of the Mega. The upcoming SLM804 [[laser printer]] would not come with a processor or memory, reducing costs. It attached to the Mega through the ST DMA port and required the Mega computer to render the pages. As TOS was not a [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] OS, this meant the computer could not be used while printing. Initially equipped with 2 or 4 MB (a 1 MB version, the ''Mega 1'' would later follow), the Mega machines would complement the Atari laser printer for a low-cost desktop publishing package, which received acclaim and was featured on the cover of Computer Shopper magazine.\n\nA custom [[blitter]] co-processor was to be included to speed the performance of some graphics operations on the screen, but due to delays it was eventually released on the ''Mega 2'' and ''Mega 4'' machines. Developers wanting to use it had to detect for it in their programs because it was not present on all machines. However, properly written programs using the screen VDI commands can use the blitter seamlessly, since GEM [[Application programming interface|API]] is a higher-level interface to ''TOS''.\n\n== Later models ==\n\n=== STE models ===\nIn late 1989, [[Atari]] released the 520ST<sup>E</sup> and 1040ST<sup>E</sup> (also written STE), enhanced version of the ST with improvements to the multimedia hardware and operating system. It features an increased color palette of 4,096 colors from the ST's 512 (though the maximum displayable palette of these without programming tricks was still limited to 16 in the lowest 320x200 resolution, and even fewer in higher resolutions), [[Genlock]] support, and a [[blitter]] co-processor (stylized as \"BLiTTER\") which can quickly move large blocks of data (most particularly, graphics data) around in RAM.  The STE was the first Atari with PCM audio; using a new chip, it added the ability to play back 8-bit (signed) samples at 6258&nbsp;Hz, 12517&nbsp;Hz, 25033&nbsp;Hz and even 50066&nbsp;Hz, via [[Direct memory access|DMA]] (Direct Memory Access). The channels are arranged as either a mono track or a track of LRLRLRLR... bytes.  RAM was now much more simply upgradable via [[SIMM]]s.\n\nTwo enhanced joystick ports were added (two normal joysticks can be plugged into each port with an adapter), with the new connectors placed in more easily accessed locations on the side of the case. The enhanced joystick ports were re-used in Atari's [[Atari Jaguar|Jaguar]] console and are compatible.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe STE models initially had software and hardware conflicts resulting in some [[Application software|applications]] and video games written for the ST line being unstable or even completely unusable, primarily caused by programming direct hardware calls which bypassed the operating system. Furthermore, even having a joystick plugged in would sometimes cause strange behavior with a few applications (such as the [[WYSIWYG]] word-processor application [[1st Word/1st Word Plus|1st Word Plus]]). Very little use was made of the extra features of the STE: STE-enhanced and STE-only software was rare.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe last STE machine, the ''[[Atari MEGA STE|Mega STE]]'', is an STE in a grey [[Atari TT030|Atari TT]] case that had a switchable 16&nbsp;MHz, dual-bus design (16-bit external, 32-bit internal), optional [[Motorola 68881]] [[floating point unit|FPU]], built-in 3\u00bd-inch floppy disk drive, [[VMEbus|VME]] expansion slot, a network port (very similar to that used by Apple's [[LocalTalk]]) and an optional built-in 3\u00bd\" hard drive. It also shipped with TOS 2.00 (better support for hard drives, enhanced desktop interface, memory test, 1.44&nbsp;MB floppy support, bug fixes). It was marketed as more affordable than a TT but more powerful than an ordinary ST.\n\n=== Atari TT ===\n{{Main|Atari TT030}}\n\nIn 1990, Atari released the high-end workstation-oriented ''Atari TT030'', based on a 32&nbsp;MHz [[Motorola 68030]] processor. The \"TT\" name (\"Thirty-two/Thirty-two\") continued the nomenclature system as the 68030 chip had full 32-bit wide buses both internally and externally. Originally planned with a 68020 CPU, the TT included improved graphics and more powerful support chips. The case was a new design with an integrated hard-drive enclosure.\n\n=== Atari Falcon ===\n{{Main|Atari Falcon}}\n[[File:Atari Falcon 030 (white bg).jpg|thumb|right|The Falcon case closely resembled that of the ST<sup>F</sup> and ST<sup>E</sup>, albeit with a slightly altered colour scheme.]]\n\nThe final ST computer is the multimedia-capable ''Atari Falcon030''. Like the TT, this was also 68030-based, operating at 16&nbsp;MHz, but with improved video modes and an on-board [[Motorola 56000|Motorola 56001]] audio [[digital signal processor]]. The Falcon, like the [[Atari STE]], supports sampling frequencies above 44.1&nbsp;kHz; the sampling master clock is 98340&nbsp;Hz, which can be divided by a number between 2 and 16 to get the actual sampling frequencies. Apart from these frequencies, it is also able to play the STE sample frequencies (up to 50066&nbsp;Hz) in 8 or 16 bit, mono/stereo, all by using the same DMA interface as the STE, with a few additions. The Falcon can both play back and record samples; it has 8 mono channels / 4 stereo channels; thus this allowed musicians to use the computer for harddisk recording. Although the 68030 microprocessor is capable of using 32-bit memory, the Falcon uses a 16-bit bus which affects performance, but also served to reduce its cost. In another cost-reduction measure, Atari shipped the Falcon in an inexpensive case much like that of the ST<sup>F</sup> and ST<sup>E</sup>. Aftermarket upgrade kits were available that allowed the Falcon to be put in a desktop or rack-mount case, with the keyboard separate.\n\nReleased in 1992, the Falcon was discontinued by Atari the following year. In Europe, C-Lab licensed the Falcon design from Atari, and released the C-Lab Falcon Mk I (the same as Atari's Falcon except for some slight modifications to the audio circuitry), Mk II (as Mk I but with an internal 500 MB SCSI hard disk) and Mk X (as Mk II but in a desktop case). The C-Lab Falcons were also imported to the US by at least some Atari dealers.\n\n== Software ==\nAs with the Atari 8-bit computers,<ref name=\"cgw198604\">{{cite magazine | title=Survey of Game Manufacturers | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=27 | date=April 1986 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_27.pdf | accessdate=April 17, 2016 | pages=32}}</ref><ref name=\"williams198610\">{{cite magazine | title=Atari Playfield | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=31 | date=September\u2013October 1986 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_31.pdf | accessdate=April 17, 2016 | last=Williams | first=Gregg | pages=35}}</ref><ref name=\"brooks198705\">{{cite magazine | title=Computer Wargaming 1988-1992 | magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]] | issue=37 | date=May 1987 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_37.pdf | accessdate=April 17, 2016 | last=Brooks | first=M.

Retrieved on 2013-04-22.</ref>\n\nMusic [[Tracker (music software)|tracker]] software was popular on the ST, such as the ''TCB Tracker'', aiding the production of quality music from the Yamaha synthesizer ('chiptunes').\n\nAn innovative music composition program that combines the sample playing abilities of a tracker with conventional music notation (which was usually only found in MIDI software) is called ''Quartet'' (after its four-note polyphonic tracker, which displays one monophonic stave at a time on color screens).\n\nDue to the ST having comparatively large amounts of memory for the time, sound sampling packages became a realistic proposition. The Microdeal ''[[Replay Professional]]'' product features a sound sampler that cleverly uses the ST cartridge port to read in parallel from the cartridge port from the [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]]. For output of digital sound, it uses the on-board frequency output, sets it to 128&nbsp;kHz (inaudible) and then modulates the amplitude of that.\n\nAnother program that had success on the ST platform is ''[[MasterTracks Pro (software)|MasterTracks Pro]]'' from Passport Designs, of Half Moon Bay, CA., that was first put out by Don Williams for the Macintosh. When the ST died, a PC version continued that one could port MIDI to using the generic .MID format. GVox bought out Passport, and continues the program for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] along with the other Passport product, the notation program ''[[Encore (software)|Encore]]'', which is as of 2013 marketed and maintained by a new iteration, Passport Music Software, LLC.\n\n=== Software titles ===\n\n[[File:Degas elite batteries included.png|thumb|Degas Elite by [[Batteries Included (company)|Batteries Included]] ]]\n\nAlso popular on the ST was professional [[desktop publishing]] software, such as ''[[PageStream]]'' and ''[[Calamus (DTP)|Calamus]]''; office tools such as word processors (''[[WordPerfect]]'', ''[[Microsoft Write]]'', ''AtariWorks'', ''WordWriter ST'', First Word <small>[shipped with the machine]</small> and its Plus continuation, and others); spreadsheets (''[[3D-Calc]]'', ''LDW Power'', ''LDW Power 2'', ''LOGiSTiX Senior'', ''PowerLedger ST'', ''SwiftCalc ST'', ''VIP Professional'', and others); turnkey programs (''Mail-Pro'', ''Sales-Pro 6'', ''Video-Pro'', and others); database programs (''A-Calc Prime'', ''Data Manager'', ''Data Manager Professional'', ''DBMan V'', ''Base Two'', ''H&DBase'', ''Informer II'', ''DB Master One'', ''SBT Database Accounting Library'' (''dLedger'', ''dInvoice'', ''dOrder'', ''dPurchases'', and ''dPayables)'', ''Superbase Personal'', ''Superbase Professional'', ''Tracker ST'', [[Zoomracks]] and others); and various CAD and CAM tools from amateur hobbyist to professional grade (Campus CAD, DynaCADD, Leonard ST, Technobox CAD/2...): all being largely targeted at, or even limited to owners of high-resolution monochrome monitors.\n\nGraphics programs such as ''[[NEOchrome]]'', [[DEGAS (software)|Degas & Degas Elite]], ''Canvas'', ''[[Deluxe Paint]]'', and ''Cyber Paint'' (which author [[Jim Kent]] would later evolve into ''[[Autodesk Animator]]'')<ref name=\"asterius\">[http://www.asterius.com/atari/cyberpaint.html The Antic Cyber Graphics Software and the Pre-History of Autodesk 3D Studio and Discreet 3ds max].

It does not feature the Atari ST's GEM graphical user interface but, instead, features an application specific graphical user interface and widget framework which he developed using, in part, the [[Neochrome]] paint program.\n\n=== Software development ===\nThe initial development kit from Atari included a computer and manuals. The $5,000 cost discouraged many from developing software for the ST. Later, the Atari Developer's Kit consisted of software and manuals (but no hardware) for $300. Included with the kit were a resource kit, C compiler (first Alcyon C, then Mark Williams C), debugger, and 68000 assembler (plus the non-disclosure agreement). The third-party [[Megamax C]] development package reduced the cost of entry to $200.\n\nThe ST came bundled with a system disk that contained [[ST BASIC]], the first BASIC for the ST. However, due to its poor performance, users favored other BASICs, such as HiSoft BASIC, [[GFA BASIC]], FaST BASIC (notable for being one of the few programs to be supplied as a ROM cartridge), [[DTACK Grounded|DBASIC]], LDW BASIC and ''[[STOS BASIC programming language|STOS]]'', which then inspired and led to the creation of AMOS on the Amiga,<ref>{{Diff|en:AMOS_(programming_language)|diff=|oldid=905928471|label=en:AMOS_(programming_language),   oldid 905928471}}{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}}</ref> and was powerful enough that it was used (with a compiler, opposed to its usual runtime interpreter) for the production of at least two commercial titles and a host of good quality shareware and public domain games. In the late years of the Atari ST Omikron Basic was bundled with it in Germany.\n\nOther development tools include 68000 assemblers (MadMac from Atari Corp, [[HiSoft Systems]]'s Devpac, TurboAss, GFA-Assembler), Pascal (OSS Personal Pascal, Maxon Pascal, PurePascal), [[Modula-2]], C compilers ([[Lattice C]], [[Megamax C]], [[GNU Compiler Collection|GNU C]], Aztec C, AHCC), [[LISP]], [[Prolog]], [[Logo programming language|Logo]], and others.\n\n=== Games ===\n{{see also|List of Atari ST games|Category:Atari ST games}}\nThe ST enjoyed success in gaming due to the low cost, fast performance, and colorful graphics. Notable individuals who developed games on the ST include [[Peter Molyneux]], [[Doug Bell]], [[Jeff Minter]], [[\u00c9ric Chahi]], [[Jez San]], and [[David Braben]].\n\nThe realtime pseudo-3D [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]]'', was developed and released first on the ST, and was the best-selling software ever produced for the platform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gamesnostalgia.com/game/dungeon-master|title=Dungeon Master (Amiga) Game Download|website=GamesNostalgia|language=en|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> Simulation games like ''[[Falcon (video game)|Falcon]]'' and ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator#History|Flight Simulator II]]'' made use of the ST's graphics, as did many arcade ports. Proto first person shooter ''[[MIDI Maze]]'', uses the [[MIDI]] ports to connect up to 16 machines for networked deathmatch play. The critically acclaimed ''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]]'' was originally released for ST and Amiga in 1991 with the engine developed on the ST and the rotoscoped animations created on the Amiga. Games simultaneously released on the Amiga that didn't use the Amiga's superior graphics and sound capabilities were often accused by video game magazines of simply being ST ports.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[Garry Kasparov]] became the first player to register the commercial ''[[ChessBase]]'', a popular commercial database program produced for storing and searching records of games of chess. The first version was built for Atari ST with his collaboration in January 1987.<ref>Chessdatabase and Gary Kasparov http://en.chessbase.com/home/TabId/211/PostId/4007229</ref> In his autobiography ''Child of Change'', he regards this facility as \"the most important development in chess research since printing.\"\n\n=== Emulators ===\n[[Spectre GCR]] lets the ST emulate the [[Macintosh]]. There were also MS-DOS emulators released in the late 1980s. ''PC-Ditto'' came in two versions: software-only, and a hardware version that plugs into the cartridge slot or kludges internally. After running the PC-Ditto software, a DOS boot disk is required to load the system. Both allow users to run DOS programs in [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] mode, though much more slowly than on an [[IBM PC]]. Other options are the ''PC-Speed'' ([[NEC V30]]), ''AT-Speed'' ([[Intel 80286]]) and ''ATonce-386SX'' ([[80386SX|Intel 80386sx]]) hardware emulator boards.\n\n==Popularity with musicians==\nThe ST's low cost, built-in MIDI ports, and fast, low-latency response times made it a favorite with musicians:\n\n* German electronic music pioneers [[Tangerine Dream]] relied heavily on the Atari ST in the studio and for live performances during the late 1980s and 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n3/tangerinedream.html|title=Making Tracks With MIDI - A Profile of Tangerine Dream|author=Mard Naman|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref>\n* The album notes for [[Mike Oldfield]]'s ''[[Earth Moving]]'' state that it was recorded using an Atari ST and C-Lab MIDI software.\n* The [[Fatboy Slim]] album ''You've Come A Long Way, Baby'' has an Atari ST in the large foldout picture of Fatboy Slim's studio.\n* [[Electronic music]] artists [[Mike Paradinas]] and [[Luke Vibert]] started out writing music on Atari STs.\n* In the Paris performance of [[Jean Michel Jarre]]'s album ''Waiting for Cousteau'', musicians have attached Atari ST machines with unidentified MIDI software to their keyboards, as could be seen in the TV live show and video recordings.\n* [[White Town]]'s \"[[Your Woman]]\", which reached #1 in the UK singles charts, was created using an Atari ST.<ref>[http://www.whitetown.co.uk/faq/ White Town \u2013 Your Questions Answered!].

This early version of TOS was bootstrapped from a very small core boot ROM, but this was quickly replaced with (expanded capacity) [[Read-only memory|ROM]] versions of TOS 1.0 when it was ready. (This change was also greatly welcomed as older ST machines with memory below 512 kB suffered, as GEM loaded its entire 192 kB code into RAM when booting the desktop). Having the OS loaded from disk was due to Atari trying to rush the machines to market without ironing out all the bugs in the OS. Soon after this change, most production models became ST<sup>F</sup>s, with an integrated single- (520STF/512 kB RAM) or double-sided (1040STF/1024 kB RAM) double density floppy disk drive built-in, but no other changes. The next later models used an upgraded version of TOS: 1.02 (also known as TOS 1.2). Another early addition (after about 6 months) was an [[RF Modulator]] that allows the machine to be hooked to a color TV when run in its low or medium resolution (525/625 line 60/50&nbsp;Hz interlace, even on RGB monitors) modes, greatly enhancing the machine's saleability and perceived value (no need to buy a prohibitively expensive, even if exceptionally crisp and clear, monitor). These models were known as the ''520ST<sup>M</sup>'' (or ''520STM''). Later ''F'' and ''FM'' models of the 520 had a built-in [[double-sided disk]] drive instead of a single-sided one.\n\n=== ST<sup>E</sup> ===\nAs originally released in the ''520ST<sup>E</sup>/1040ST<sup>E</sup>'':\n\n* All of the features of the 520STFM/1040STFM\n* Extended palette of 4,096 available colors to choose from\n* [[BLiTTER]] chip to copy/fill/clear large data blocks in memory (with a max write rate of 4 Mbit/s)\n* Hardware support for horizontal and vertical fine scrolling and split screen (using the Shifter video chip)\n* DMA [[sound chip]] with 2-channels stereo 8-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] sound at 6.25/12.5/25/50&nbsp;kHz and stereo RCA audio-out jacks (using enhancements to the Shifter video chip to support audio shifting)\n* National LMC 1992 audio controller chip, allowing adjustable left/right/master volume and bass and treble EQ via a [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus#Microwire|Microwire]] interface\n* Memory: 30-pin [[SIMM]] memory slots ([[SIPP memory|SIPP]] packages in earliest versions) allowing upgrades up to 4 MB Allowable memory sizes including only 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5 and 4.0 MB due to configuration restraints (however, 2.5 MB is not officially supported and has compatibility problems). Later third-party upgrade kits allow a maximum of 14MB [http://www.stcarchiv.de/stc1997/03/magnum-st w/Magnum-ST], bypassing the stock [[Memory management unit|MMU]] with a replacement unit and the additional chips on a separate board fitting over it.\n* Ability to synchronise the video timings with an external device so that a video [[Genlock]] device can be used without having to make any modifications to computer's hardware\n* Analogue joypad ports (2), with support for devices such as paddles and light pens in addition to joysticks/joypads. The [[Atari Jaguar]] joypads and Power Pad joypads (gray version of Jaguar joypads marketed for the ST<sup>E</sup> and [[Atari Falcon|Falcon]]) can be used without an adapter. Two standard Atari-style digital joysticks could be plugged into each analogue port with an adapter.\n* [[Atari TOS|TOS]] 1.06 (also known as TOS 1.6) or TOS 1.62 (which fixed some major backwards-compatibility bugs in TOS 1.6) in two socketed 128 kB ROM chips.\n* Socketed [[Plastic leaded chip carrier|PLCC]] [[68000]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]]\n\n== Models ==\nThe members of the ST family are listed below, in roughly chronological order:\n\n; 520ST: Original model with 512&nbsp;KB RAM, external power supply, no floppy disk drive. The early models had only a bootstrap ROM and TOS had to be loaded from disk.\n; 520ST+: early 520STs with 1&nbsp;MB of RAM, but without floppy disk\n; 260ST: originally intended to be a 256&nbsp;kB variant, but actually sold in small quantities in Europe with 512&nbsp;KB. Used after the release of the 520ST+ to differentiate the cheaper 512&nbsp;KB models from the 1&nbsp;MB models. Because the early 520ST's were sold with TOS on disk, but this used up 192&nbsp;KB or RAM so the machine only had around 256KB left.\n; 520ST<sup>M</sup>: a 520ST with a built-in modulator for TV output and 512&nbsp;KB RAM.\n; 520ST<sup>FM</sup>: a 520STM with a newly redesigned motherboard in a larger case with a built-in floppy disk drive (in some cases a single sided drive only), and 512&nbsp;KB RAM.\n; 1040ST<sup>F</sup>: a 520STFM with 1&nbsp;MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive, but without RF modulator\n; 1040ST<sup>FM</sup>: a 520STFM with 1&nbsp;MB of RAM and a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive with RF modulator\n; Mega ST (MEGA 1, MEGA 2, MEGA 4): redesigned motherboard with 1, 2 or 4&nbsp;MB of RAM, respectively, in a much improved \"[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]\" case with a detached keyboard. All MEGA mainboards have a PLCC socket for the BLiTTER chip and some early models did not include the BLiTTER chip. They also included a real-time clock and internal expansion connector. Some early MEGA 2 had a MEGA 4 mainboard with half of the memory chip places unpopulated and the MEGA 2 can be upgraded by adding the additional DRAM chips and some resistors for the control lines. The MEGA 1 mainboards had a redesigned memory chip area and could not be upgraded in this way as there are only places for the 1&nbsp;MByte DRAM chips.\n; 520ST<sup>E</sup> and 1040ST<sup>E</sup>: a 520STFM/1040STFM with enhanced sound, a BLiTTER chip, and a 4096-color palette, in the older 1040-style all-in-one case\n; [[Atari MEGA STE|Mega STE]]: same hardware as 1040STE except for a faster 16&nbsp;MHz processor with 16K cache, an onboard SCSI controller, additional faster RS232 port, VME expansion port, in an ST gray version of the TT case\n; [[STacy]]: a [[portable computer|portable]] (but definitely not [[laptop]]) version of the ST with the complete ST keyboard, an LCD screen simulating 640x400 hi-res, and a mini-trakball intended mostly for travellers and musicians because of the backlit screen and its built-in midi ports. Originally designed to operate on 12 standard [[C battery|C cell]] flashlight batteries for portability, when Atari finally realized how quickly the machine would use up a set of batteries (especially when rechargeable batteries of the time supplied insufficient power compared to the intended alkalines), they simply glued the lid of the battery compartment shut.\n; [[ST BOOK]]: a later portable ST, more portable than the STacy, but sacrificing several features in order to achieve this{{snd}} notably the backlight and internal floppy disk drive. Files were meant to be stored on a small amount (one megabyte) of internal [[flash memory]] 'on the road' and transferred using serial or parallel links, memory flashcards or external (and externally powered) floppy disk to a desktop ST once back indoors. The screen is highly reflective for the time, but still hard to use indoors or in low light, it is fixed to the 640 \u00d7 400 1-bit mono mode, and no external video port was provided. Despite its limitations, it gained some popularity, particularly amongst musicians.\n\n=== Unreleased ===\nThe 130ST was intended to be a 128&nbsp;KB variant. It was announced at the 1985 CES alongside the 520ST but never produced. The 4160ST<sup>E</sup> was a 1040ST<sup>E</sup>, but with 4&nbsp;MB of RAM. A small quantity of development units were produced, but the system was never officially released. Atari did produce a quantity of 4160STE metallic case badges which found their way to dealers, so it's not uncommon to find one attached to systems which were originally 520/1040STE. No such labels were produced for the base of the systems.\n\n=== Related systems ===\n[[Atari Transputer Workstation]] is a standalone machine developed in conjunction with Perihelion Hardware, containing modified ST hardware and up to 17 [[transputer]]s capable of [[massively parallel]] operations for tasks such as ray tracing.\n\n=== Clones ===\nFollowing Atari's exit from the computer market, both Medusa Computer Systems and Milan Computer manufactured Atari Falcon/TT-compatible machines that used [[Motorola 68040|68040]] and [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processors.

The organization is responsible for the daily news and information gathering of its news programs.\n\nIt serves the main [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]], the Regional Network Group, the UHF sports channel [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|S+A]], the cable channels [[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]] and [[DZMM TeleRadyo]], the international channel [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]], the flagship radio station [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] and the regional radio networks [[DYAP-AM|DYAP 765 Palawan]], [[DYAB-AM|DYAB 1512 Cebu]] and [[DXAB|DXAB 1296 Davao]] and news websites [[ABS-CBNnews.com|news.abs-cbn.com]] and patrol.ph.\n\n==History==\n===News division===\nThe oldest of the two components, the news division began as the news section of two radio stations - DZBC (opened 1949) and DZAQ (opened 1950) both in the Manila area, and DZRI (opened 1951) in Pangasinan, all under the Bolinao Electronics Corporation and later under the Alto Broadcasting System, which broadcast news programs and commentary as part of their programming schedules. In 1956, the Chronicle Broadcasting Network, together with the first news broadcasts on DZXL, started the shortlived 24-hour station DZQL ''Radyo Reloj'' broadcasting news and current affairs until late 1959, the first station of its kind in the country. When the two networks merged in 1957, first as part of Bolinao Electronics Corporation and later on in 1961 adopting the ABS-CBN brand (which it changed its corporate name to ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation in 1967 and ABS-CBN Corporation in 2010), the news services of these four Manila stations, later reduced to three, were combined into a unified news service but then with separate programs, as the network began expanding with the purchase and later opening of additional stations, first in the Ilocos region and the Cordillera, and then into the Visayas islands, Mindanao, and southern parts of Luzon, with the national radio service broadcasting from the Chronicle Building along Aduana street, Intramuros, Manila, which began broadcasting the two Manila stations in 1958. Alongside them was a small television news service on DZAQ-TV 3 and DZXL-TV 9 with updates broadcast daily, owing to the lack of proper news programs from the beginning of broadcasts in late 1953, with both stations' news bureaus based in the television studios in Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City (opened in 1958).\n\nProper news programming on TV, however, would begin in 1960 when news coverage for the national elections began, followed by the first Filipino-language TV newscast, ''[[Balita Ngayon]]'', in 1966 on Channel 3 and in the following year with the English-language newscast ''[[The World Tonight (Philippine TV series)|The World Tonight]]'' on late nights, which is today the longest running English-language national newscast. Channel 9 followed suit with the long-running ''[[Newsbreak (TV program)|Newsbreak]]'' as well. By 1968, following the aftermath of the [[1968 Casiguran earthquake|magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Casiguran]] (in which [[Manila]] was severely affected by the quake), leading to the collapse of the Ruby Tower in August that same year, the joint radio and color television coverage of which was the first time ever for a Philippine media company to do so, DZAQ was later converted into a 24-hour Filipino language news and current affairs radio station, adopting the ''DZAQ Radyo Patrol 960'' branding under the initiative of former station manager [[Orly Mercado]], veteran broadcaster [[Joe Taruc]], Ben Aniceto, the then ABS-CBN program director and [[Chief engineer|Chief Engr.]] Emil Solidum, whose efforts led to the recruitment of the first generation of mobile field reporters for news coverage and flash reports, a first for any radio station at that time. The station would prove to be a leading source of breaking news stories in the late 1960s and before Martial Law stopped broadcasts in September 1972, Radyo Patrol services were operational in select regional stations, alongside an active service of regional programming in all provincial TV stations in addition to occasional nationwide broadcasts via satellite, the first for any station by then.\n\nIn July of 1986, the news services of ABS-CBN were officially reactivated as part of the network's return to former owners, when DZMM was offically relaunched that month from the Benpres Building in the [[Ortigas Center]] District of Pasig City. The new station broadcast its newscasts twice daily, Mondays to Saturdays, with a Sunday midday news program.\n\n===Current affairs division===\nThe division traces its roots to the current affairs and commentary programming that both DZAQ and later on DZXL aired beginning in the mid-1950s in both Filipino and English, keeping listeners informed of the latest issues that affect Filipinos.\n\n==Divisions==\nThe division operates mainly and headquartered at ABS-CBN Broadcast Complex in [[Quezon City]] while the ABS-CBN regional stations also have their local news divisions, which is a big help in newsgathering for the whole network. It also has news bureaus in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia-Pacific]] and the [[Middle East]] with the help of [[The Filipino Channel]] (owned by ABS-CBN Global, Ltd.), these make ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs ahead among the other news organizations in the country as they were the largest and the most comprehensive when it comes to local and international newsgathering.\n\nThe division is currently headed by long-time journalist and former ABS-CBN\u2019s North America Bureau Chief, and now ABS-CBN's Senior Vice President for News and Current Affairs Ging Reyes. It is further subdivided into different subgroups:\n* '''Integrated News Operations Group''', headed by veteran ABS-CBN journalist and former DZMM Radyo Patrol Sais Trenta reporter, Claude Vitug.\n* '''News Gathering Group''', headed by veteran ABS-CBN journalist, former DZMM Radyo Patrol Sais Trenta reporter and former Middle East News Bureau chief, Dindo Amparo.\n* '''Current Affairs Group''', headed by experienced news department staff, Dondi Ocampo.\n* '''News Production Group''', headed by Marielle Gaceta-Catbagan.\n* '''Investigative and Research Group''', headed by experienced news department staff and former reporter for Manila Standard Today, Chi Almario-Gonzales.\n* '''ABS-CBN News Channel''', headed by its Chief Operating Officer and veteran ABS-CBN News correspondent and former ABS-CBN News North America Bureau Chief, Nadia Trinidad.\n* '''Regional Network Group News and Current Affairs''', headed by television journalist and former Head of News for ABS-CBN Iloilo, [[Stanley Palisada]].\n* '''Global News Bureaus''', headed by Alcuin Papa.\n* '''ABS-CBN News Digital''', headed by its executive editor and veteran ABS-CBN journalist, former senior political correspondent and former ABS-CBN News chief of reporters, Lynda Jumilla. \n* '''ABS-CBN Weather Center''' is the [[weather forecasting]] division of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs.\n* '''[[DZMM-AM|DZMM Radyo Patrol 630]],''' ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station headed by station manager, Marah Faner-Capuyan.\n* '''[[DZMM TeleRadyo]],''' ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station on Television headed by station manager, Marah Faner-Capuyan.\n* ''DocuCentral'' is the producer of highly acclaimed documentaries shown on ABS-CBN's platforms.\n\nAside from regular programming, it also operates the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] (ANC), the first and the only 24-hour [[English language]] news channel in the country. The division also operates a news website [[ABS-CBNnews.com]] in partnership with ''[[BusinessMirror]]''.\n\n[[File:ABS-CBN News & Current Affairs.png|thumb|right|200px|Logo used from 2000 to

The organization is responsible for the daily news and information gathering of its news programs.\n\nIt serves the main [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]], the Regional Network Group, the UHF sports channel [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|S+A]], the cable channels [[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]] and [[DZMM TeleRadyo]], the international channel [[The Filipino Channel|TFC]], the flagship radio station [[DZMM-AM|DZMM]] and the regional radio networks [[DYAP-AM|DYAP 765 Palawan]], [[DYAB-AM|DYAB 1512 Cebu]] and [[DXAB|DXAB 1296 Davao]] and news websites [[ABS-CBNnews.com|news.abs-cbn.com]] and patrol.ph.\n\n==History==\n===News division===\nThe oldest of the two components, the news division began as the news section of two radio stations - DZBC (opened 1949) and DZAQ (opened 1950) both in the Manila area, and DZRI (opened 1951) in Pangasinan, all under the Bolinao Electronics Corporation and later under the Alto Broadcasting System, which broadcast news programs and commentary as part of their programming schedules. In 1956, the Chronicle Broadcasting Network, together with the first news broadcasts on DZXL, started the shortlived 24-hour station DZQL ''Radyo Reloj'' broadcasting news and current affairs until late 1959, the first station of its kind in the country. When the two networks merged in 1957, first as part of Bolinao Electronics Corporation and later on in 1961 adopting the ABS-CBN brand (which it changed its corporate name to ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation in 1967 and ABS-CBN Corporation in 2010), the news services of these four Manila stations, later reduced to three, were combined into a unified news service but then with separate programs, as the network began expanding with the purchase and later opening of additional stations, first in the Ilocos region and the Cordillera, and then into the Visayas islands, Mindanao, and southern parts of Luzon, with the national radio service broadcasting from the Chronicle Building along Aduana street, Intramuros, Manila, which began broadcasting the two Manila stations in 1958. Alongside them was a small television news service on DZAQ-TV 3 and DZXL-TV 9 with updates broadcast daily, owing to the lack of proper news programs from the beginning of broadcasts in late 1953, with both stations' news bureaus based in the television studios in Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City (opened in 1958).\n\nProper news programming on TV, however, would begin in 1960 when news coverage for the national elections began, followed by the first Filipino-language TV newscast, ''[[Balita Ngayon]]'', in 1966 on Channel 3 and in the following year with the English-language newscast ''[[The World Tonight (Philippine TV series)|The World Tonight]]'' on late nights, which is today the longest running English-language national newscast. Channel 9 followed suit with the long-running ''[[Newsbreak (TV program)|Newsbreak]]'' as well. By 1968, following the aftermath of the [[1968 Casiguran earthquake|magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Casiguran]] (in which [[Manila]] was severely affected by the quake), leading to the collapse of the Ruby Tower in August that same year, the joint radio and color television coverage of which was the first time ever for a Philippine media company to do so, DZAQ was later converted into a 24-hour Filipino language news and current affairs radio station, adopting the ''DZAQ Radyo Patrol 960'' branding under the initiative of former station manager [[Orly Mercado]], veteran broadcaster [[Joe Taruc]], Ben Aniceto, the then ABS-CBN program director and [[Chief engineer|Chief Engr.]] Emil Solidum, whose efforts led to the recruitment of the first generation of mobile field reporters for news coverage and flash reports, a first for any radio station at that time. The station would prove to be a leading source of breaking news stories in the late 1960s and before Martial Law stopped broadcasts in September 1972, Radyo Patrol services were operational in select regional stations, alongside an active service of regional programming in all provincial TV stations in addition to occasional nationwide broadcasts via satellite, the first for any station by then.\n\nIn July of 1986, the news services of ABS-CBN were officially reactivated as part of the network's return to former owners, when DZMM was offically relaunched that month from the Benpres Building in the [[Ortigas Center]] District of Pasig City. The new station broadcast its newscasts twice daily, Mondays to Saturdays, with a Sunday midday news program.\n\n===Current affairs division===\nThe division traces its roots to the current affairs and commentary programming that both DZAQ and later on DZXL aired beginning in the mid-1950s in both Filipino and English, keeping listeners informed of the latest issues that affect Filipinos.\n\n==Divisions==\nThe division operates mainly and headquartered at ABS-CBN Broadcast Complex in [[Quezon City]] while the ABS-CBN regional stations also have their local news divisions, which is a big help in newsgathering for the whole network. It also has news bureaus in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Asia-Pacific]] and the [[Middle East]] with the help of [[The Filipino Channel]] (owned by ABS-CBN Global, Ltd.), these make ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs ahead among the other news organizations in the country as they were the largest and the most comprehensive when it comes to local and international newsgathering.\n\nThe division is currently headed by long-time journalist and former ABS-CBN\u2019s North America Bureau Chief, and now ABS-CBN's Senior Vice President for News and Current Affairs Ging Reyes. It is further subdivided into different subgroups:\n* '''Integrated News Operations Group''', headed by veteran ABS-CBN journalist and former DZMM Radyo Patrol Sais Trenta reporter, Claude Vitug.\n* '''News Gathering Group''', headed by veteran ABS-CBN journalist, former DZMM Radyo Patrol Sais Trenta reporter and former Middle East News Bureau chief, Dindo Amparo.\n* '''Current Affairs Group''', headed by experienced news department staff, Dondi Ocampo.\n* '''News Production Group''', headed by Marielle Gaceta-Catbagan.\n* '''Investigative and Research Group''', headed by experienced news department staff and former reporter for Manila Standard Today, Chi Almario-Gonzales.\n* '''ABS-CBN News Channel''', headed by its Chief Operating Officer and veteran ABS-CBN News correspondent and former ABS-CBN News North America Bureau Chief, Nadia Trinidad.\n* '''Regional Network Group News and Current Affairs''', headed by television journalist and former Head of News for ABS-CBN Iloilo, [[Stanley Palisada]].\n* '''Global News Bureaus''', headed by Alcuin Papa.\n* '''ABS-CBN News Digital''', headed by its executive editor and veteran ABS-CBN journalist, former senior political correspondent and former ABS-CBN News chief of reporters, Lynda Jumilla. \n* '''ABS-CBN Weather Center''' is the [[weather forecasting]] division of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs.\n* '''[[DZMM-AM|DZMM Radyo Patrol 630]],''' ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station headed by station manager, Marah Faner-Capuyan.\n* '''[[DZMM TeleRadyo]],''' ABS-CBN's flagship AM radio station on Television headed by station manager, Marah Faner-Capuyan.\n* ''DocuCentral'' is the producer of highly acclaimed documentaries shown on ABS-CBN's platforms.\n\nAside from regular programming, it also operates the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]] (ANC), the first and the only 24-hour [[English language]] news channel in the country. The division also operates a news website [[ABS-CBNnews.com]] in partnership with ''[[BusinessMirror]]''.\n\n[[File:ABS-CBN News & Current Affairs.png|thumb|right|200px|Logo used from 2000 to

It was notable for being the country's first local [[High-definition television|high-definition]] TV channel. It was owned and operated by [[ABS-CBN]]'s subsidiary [[ABS-CBN Cable Channels]]. The network shows notable sports broadcasts from the Philippines and abroad, as well as other sports related programming. Its local programming were produced and licensed by [[ABS-CBN Sports]].\n\n==Background==\nBalls was officially launched on 1 January 2008, the same day that fellow ABS-CBN subsidiary [[Sky Cable]] dropped the channels of [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]] (including the sports channels [[Solar Sports]] and [[Basketball TV]]) from its lineup. These channels were replaced by a group of new channels owned by ABS-CBN's subsidiary Creative Programs Inc. (now [[ABS-CBN Cable Channels]]), which include [[Maxxx]] and [[Velvet (TV channel)|Velvet]]. While SkyCable officials stated that the channels were being replaced to reduce redundancy in SkyCable's lineup and introduce new programming to the service, reports surfaced that the two companies had failed to reach a carriage deal since ABS-CBN had accused Solar of cannibalizing the revenue of its over-the-air networks.<ref name=gmanews-skycablediscute>{{cite web|title=Cable company dropping Solar channels effective Jan.1|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/62112/economy/cable-company-dropping-solar-channels-effective-jan-1|publisher=GMA News|accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> Some reports says that the dispute has to do with [[Manny Pacquiao]]'s exclusive contract with ABS-CBN's main competitor [[GMA Network]], which Solar has partnered for free TV airing of its boxing matches.\n\nAlthough Balls was intended to effectively replace it, Basketball TV was restored to the SkyCable lineup in time for the [[2008\u201309 NBA season]] in October 2008, and other Solar channels also returned to the lineup afterward.\n\nIt was announced that Balls and Balls HD will cease their broadcast on 31 December 2015. Its HD channel, as well as the entire channel's content (except the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] which the broadcast rights was acquired by [[TV5 Network (company)|TV5]]'s sports division, [[Sports5]]) will be absorbed to the [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|Sports + Action]] brand and renamed as ABS-CBN Sports + Action HD.<ref>http://www.mysky.com.ph/Cebu/updates/277/2015/12/15/balls-to-cease-airing</ref> \n\nThe last program to air on this channel was a replay of ''[[UFC 194|UFC 194: Aldo vs. McGregor]]'' on 31 December 2015 before signing off at 12:00 a.m. midnight on 1 January 2016. Cable providers still receiving Balls would see an imaging card that reads \"''Balls is now signing off''\" until the provider can replace it with another channel, while other providers like [[Sky Cable]] (in [[Metro Manila]] and in select metropolitan and large cities) have replaced this channel with a reserved channel or with another channel.\n\n==High-definition feed==\nOn 11 July 2009, the channel launched its own [[High-definition television|high-definition]] feed on [[Sky Cable]], marking the Philippines' first ever local high-definition television channel. On the same day, Balls also televised the country's first locally produced programs in HD, which included a UAAP college basketball game, followed by an NCAA game the following Monday, all produced by [[ABS-CBN Sports]] using the recently acquired [[Sony]] high-definition professional video cameras and a state-of-the-art [[Outside broadcasting|HD OB van]] with technologies developed by [[EVS Broadcast Equipment]], [[Snell Limited|Snell]], and [[Avid Technology]].<ref name=mb-ballshd>{{cite web|title=ABS-CBN airs UAAP on high-definition|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/210146/ab|publisher=Manila Bulletin|accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> Balls HD was in hibernation from December 28, 2009 until 2013.\n\n==Programming==\nBalls' initial lineup focused on [[ball sport]]s such as [[american football|football]], [[basketball]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], and [[volleyball]] (as suggested by its name). Also Balls aired 2 of 4 Tennis [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] Tournament which is [[French Open]] (2008\u20132013; transferred to [[Fox Sports Asia]]) and [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] (2007\u20132015).

It was notable for being the country's first local [[High-definition television|high-definition]] TV channel. It was owned and operated by [[ABS-CBN]]'s subsidiary [[ABS-CBN Cable Channels]]. The network shows notable sports broadcasts from the Philippines and abroad, as well as other sports related programming. Its local programming were produced and licensed by [[ABS-CBN Sports]].\n\n==Background==\nBalls was officially launched on 1 January 2008, the same day that fellow ABS-CBN subsidiary [[Sky Cable]] dropped the channels of [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]] (including the sports channels [[Solar Sports]] and [[Basketball TV]]) from its lineup. These channels were replaced by a group of new channels owned by ABS-CBN's subsidiary Creative Programs Inc. (now [[ABS-CBN Cable Channels]]), which include [[Maxxx]] and [[Velvet (TV channel)|Velvet]]. While SkyCable officials stated that the channels were being replaced to reduce redundancy in SkyCable's lineup and introduce new programming to the service, reports surfaced that the two companies had failed to reach a carriage deal since ABS-CBN had accused Solar of cannibalizing the revenue of its over-the-air networks.<ref name=gmanews-skycablediscute>{{cite web|title=Cable company dropping Solar channels effective Jan.1|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/62112/economy/cable-company-dropping-solar-channels-effective-jan-1|publisher=GMA News|accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> Some reports says that the dispute has to do with [[Manny Pacquiao]]'s exclusive contract with ABS-CBN's main competitor [[GMA Network]], which Solar has partnered for free TV airing of its boxing matches.\n\nAlthough Balls was intended to effectively replace it, Basketball TV was restored to the SkyCable lineup in time for the [[2008\u201309 NBA season]] in October 2008, and other Solar channels also returned to the lineup afterward.\n\nIt was announced that Balls and Balls HD will cease their broadcast on 31 December 2015. Its HD channel, as well as the entire channel's content (except the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] which the broadcast rights was acquired by [[TV5 Network (company)|TV5]]'s sports division, [[Sports5]]) will be absorbed to the [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|Sports + Action]] brand and renamed as ABS-CBN Sports + Action HD.<ref>http://www.mysky.com.ph/Cebu/updates/277/2015/12/15/balls-to-cease-airing</ref> \n\nThe last program to air on this channel was a replay of ''[[UFC 194|UFC 194: Aldo vs. McGregor]]'' on 31 December 2015 before signing off at 12:00 a.m. midnight on 1 January 2016. Cable providers still receiving Balls would see an imaging card that reads \"''Balls is now signing off''\" until the provider can replace it with another channel, while other providers like [[Sky Cable]] (in [[Metro Manila]] and in select metropolitan and large cities) have replaced this channel with a reserved channel or with another channel.\n\n==High-definition feed==\nOn 11 July 2009, the channel launched its own [[High-definition television|high-definition]] feed on [[Sky Cable]], marking the Philippines' first ever local high-definition television channel. On the same day, Balls also televised the country's first locally produced programs in HD, which included a UAAP college basketball game, followed by an NCAA game the following Monday, all produced by [[ABS-CBN Sports]] using the recently acquired [[Sony]] high-definition professional video cameras and a state-of-the-art [[Outside broadcasting|HD OB van]] with technologies developed by [[EVS Broadcast Equipment]], [[Snell Limited|Snell]], and [[Avid Technology]].<ref name=mb-ballshd>{{cite web|title=ABS-CBN airs UAAP on high-definition|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/210146/ab|publisher=Manila Bulletin|accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> Balls HD was in hibernation from December 28, 2009 until 2013.\n\n==Programming==\nBalls' initial lineup focused on [[ball sport]]s such as [[american football|football]], [[basketball]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], and [[volleyball]] (as suggested by its name). Also Balls aired 2 of 4 Tennis [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] Tournament which is [[French Open]] (2008\u20132013; transferred to [[Fox Sports Asia]]) and [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] (2007\u20132015).

In 1919, he joined the [[Bolsheviks]] and served in the [[Red Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. After graduating from [[Frunze Military Academy]] in 1926, Konev gradually rose through the ranks of the Soviet military. By 1939, he had become a candidate to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]].\n\nFollowing the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, Konev took part in a series of major campaigns, including the battles of [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]] and [[Battle of Rzhev, Summer 1942|Rzhev]]. Konev further commanded forces in major Soviet offensives at [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]], in the [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive|Dnieper-Carpathian]] and [[Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive|Vistula-Oder]] offensives. In February 1944, he was made a [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]]. In the eve of German defeat, Konev's [[1st Ukrainian Front]] was pitted against the armies of [[Georgy Zhukov]] in the [[Race to Berlin]]. Konev was the first Allied commander to enter [[Prague]], the capital of [[Czechoslovakia]], after the [[Prague uprising]].\n\nAfter the war, Konev replaced Zhukov as commander of Soviet ground forces. In 1956, he was appointed [[Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization|commander of the Warsaw Pact armed forces]], and led the violent suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]]. Konev remained a popular military figure in the Soviet Union until his death in 1973.\n\n==Early life==\nKonev was born December 28, 1897 in the village of [[Podosinovsky District|Lodeyno]] to a peasant family of Russian ethnicity. Konev graduated from a parish school in the village of Yakovlevskaya Gora in 1906, and later the Nikolo-Pushemsky Zemstvo School in the neighboring village of Schetkino in 1912. At the age of 15, he found work as a forester and lumberjack at [[Podosinovets]] and [[Arkhangelsk]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Military career==\n[[File:Ivan Stepanovich Konev 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Konev as a regimental commander]]\nIn the spring of 1916, he was conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army. Konev was sent to the 2nd Heavy Artillery Brigade at Moscow and then graduated from artillery training courses. In 1917, he was sent to the 2nd Separate Heavy Artillery Battalion on the [[Southwestern Front (Russian Empire)|Southwestern Front]] as a junior sergeant and fought in the [[Kerensky Offensive]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] broke out in 1917 he was demobilised and returned home, but in 1919 he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik party]] and the [[Red Army]], serving as an artilleryman. During the [[Russian Civil War]] he served with the Red Army in the Russian [[Far Eastern Republic]]. His commander at this time was [[Kliment Voroshilov]], later a close colleague of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Commissar]] for defence. This alliance was the key to Konev's subsequent career.\n\nIn 1926 Konev completed advanced officer training courses at the [[Frunze Military Academy]], and between then and 1931 he held a series of progressively more senior commands, becoming head of first the [[Transbaikal]] then the [[North Caucasus Military District]]s. In July 1938 he was appointed commander of the [[2nd Red Banner Army]]. In 1937 he became a Deputy of the [[Supreme Soviet]] and in 1939 a candidate member of the Party [[Central Committee]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|url = http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=698|website = warheroes.ru|access-date = 19 February 2016|language = Russian|trans-title = Konev Ivan Stepanovich}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Ivan Konev 1945.jpg|thumb|upright|Konev on the Eastern Front, 1945]]\nWhen [[Nazi Germany]] [[invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, Konev was assigned command of the [[19th Army (Soviet Union)|19th Army]] in the [[Vitebsk]] region, and waged a series of defensive battles during the Red Army's retreat, first to [[Smolensk]] and then to the approaches to Moscow.\n\nHe commanded the [[Kalinin Front]] from October 1941<ref name=GeorgyZhukov>{{Cite book |last=Zhukov |first=Georgy |title=Marshal of Victory, Volume II |publisher=[[Pen and Sword Books]] Ltd. |year=1974 |ISBN=9781781592915 |page=26}}</ref> to August 1942, playing a key role in the fighting around [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]] and the [[Soviet counter-offensive during the winter of 1941\u201342]]. For his role in the successful defence of the Soviet capital, Stalin promoted Konev to Colonel-General. In the summer of 1942 Konev led the Kalinin Front and later the Western front in the [[Battle of Rzhev, Summer 1942|battle on the Rzhev salient]].<ref>Gerasimova, Rzhev Slaughterhouse, p. 172.</ref>\n\nKonev held \"[[Front (military formation)|Front]]\" (army group) commands for the rest of the war. He commanded the [[Soviet Western Front]] until February 1943, the [[North-Western Front]] February\u2013July 1943, and the [[2nd Ukrainian Front]] from July 1943 (later further the [[1st Ukrainian Front]]) until May 1945.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:\u0416\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432.jpg|thumb|Konev as commander of the [[Steppe Front]] with [[Georgy Zhukov]] during the Battle of Kursk, 1943]]\nHe participated in the [[Battle of Kursk]], commanding the southern part of the Soviet counter-offensive, the Steppe Front, where he was an active and energetic exponent of [[Russian military deception|maskirovka]], the use of [[military camouflage]] and [[military deception|deception]].<ref name=Glantz153>Glantz, 1989. P. 153.</ref> Among the ''maskirovka'' measures he adopted to achieve tactical surprise were the camouflaging of defence lines and depots; dummy units and supply points; a dummy air defence network; and the use of reconnaissance units to verify the quality of his army's camouflage and deception works. In David Glantz's view, Konev's forces \"generated a major portion of the element of surprise\".<ref name=Glantz153/>\n\nThe result was that the Germans seriously underestimated the strength of the Soviet defences. The commander of 19 Panzer, [[Gustav Schmidt (general)|General G. Schmidt]], wrote that \"We did not assume that there was even one fourth [of the Russian strength] of what we had to encounter\".<ref>Glantz, 1989. Pp. 153\u2013154.</ref>\n\nAfter the victory at Kursk, Konev's armies retook [[Belgorod]], [[Odessa]], [[Kharkiv]] and [[Kiev]]. The subsequent Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky Offensive led to the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] which took place from 24 January to 16 February 1944. The offensive was part of the [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive]]. In it, the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts, commanded, respectively, by [[Nikolai Vatutin]] and Konev, trapped German forces of [[Army Group South]] in a pocket or cauldron west of the [[Dnieper river]]. During weeks of fighting, the two Red Army Fronts tried to eradicate the pocket; the subsequent [[Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky Offensive|Korsun battle]] eliminated the cauldron. According to [[Milovan Djilas]], Konev openly boasted of his killing of thousands of German prisoners of war: \"The cavalry finally finished them off. 'We let the Cossacks cut up as long as they wished. They even hacked off the hands of those who raised them to surrender' the Marshal recounted with a smile.\"<ref name=\"Djilas\">Djilas p. 54</ref>\n\n[[File:Prague liberation 1945 konev.jpg|thumb|Konev at the liberation of Prague by the Red Army in May 1945.]]\nFor his achievements in the Ukraine (and ignoring his atrocities), Konev was promoted by Stalin to [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] in February 1944. He was one of Stalin's favourite generals and one of the few senior commanders whom even Stalin admired for his ruthlessness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=35|title=Ivan Konev|last=Chen|first=Peter|date=|website=World War II Database|access-date=19 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1944 Konev's armies advanced from [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] into [[Poland]] and later into [[Czechoslovakia]]. In May he participated in an unsuccessful invasion of the [[Balkans]], (the [[first Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive]]) together with Generals [[Rodion Malinovsky]] and [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]].\n\nBy July he had advanced to the [[Vistula]] River in central Poland, and was awarded the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. In September 1944 his forces, now designated the [[4th Ukrainian Front|Fourth Ukrainian Front]], advanced into [[Slovakia]] and helped the Slovak partisans in their rebellion against German occupation.\n\nIn January 1945 Konev, together with [[Georgy Zhukov]], commanded the Soviet armies which launched [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|the massive winter offensive]] in western Poland, driving the German forces from the Vistula to the [[Oder River]]. In southern Poland his armies seized [[Krak\u00f3w]]. Soviet historians, and generally Russian sources, claimed that Konev preserved Krak\u00f3w from Nazi-planned destruction by ordering a lightning attack on the city.<ref name=Gareev>[[Makhmut Gareev]], [http://www.redstar.ru/55_yar/12_04_1.html Marshal Konev] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013152242/http://redstar.ru/55_yar/12_04_1.html |date=13 October 2007 }}, ''[[Krasnaia Zvezda]]'', 12 April 2001</ref> Konev's January 1945 offensive also prevented planned destruction of the [[Silesia]]n industry by the retreating Germans.\n\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u0438 24 \u0438\u044e\u043d\u044f 1945 \u0433.

Konev's forces entered the city first, but Stalin gave Zhukov the honour of [[Battle of Berlin|capturing Berlin]] and hoisting the Soviet flag over the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]]. Konev was ordered to the south-west, where his forces linked up with elements of the [[United States Army]] at [[Elbe Day|Torgau]] and also retook [[Prague]] shortly after the official surrender of the German forces.\n\n===Post-war career===\nAfter the war Konev was appointed head of the Soviet occupation forces in [[East Germany|Eastern Germany]] and also Allied High Commissioner for [[Austria]]. In 1946 he became commander of Soviet ground forces and First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, replacing Zhukov. He held these posts until 1950, when he was appointed commander of the [[Carpathian Military District]].\n\nAfter Stalin's death, however, Konev returned to prominence. He became a key ally of the new Party leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], being entrusted with the trial of the Stalinist police chief, [[Lavrenty Beria]] in 1953. He was again appointed First Deputy Minister of Defense and commander of Soviet ground forces, posts he held until 1956, when he was named [[Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization|Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact]]. Shortly after his appointment he led the suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]].\n\n[[File:Szent Istv\u00e1n k\u00f6r\u00fat a Falk Miksa (N\u00e9phadsereg) utca fel\u0151l a Honv\u00e9d utca fel\u00e9 n\u00e9zve.

In 1961\u201362, however, he was recalled and was again commander of the Soviet forces in East Germany. He was then appointed to the largely ceremonial post of Inspector-General of the Defense Ministry.\n\nKonev remained one of the Soviet Union's most admired military figures until his death in 1973. He married twice, and his daughter Nataliya is Dean of the Department of Linguistics and Literature at the [[Russian Military University]].\n\nIn 1969, the [[Minister of Defence of the Soviet Union|Ministry of Defence of the USSR]] published Konev's 285-page war memoir called ''Forty-Five''. It was later translated into English in the same year and published by [[Progress Publishers]], Moscow. This work discusses Konev's taking of Berlin, Prague, his work with Zhukov, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], his field meeting with General [[Omar Bradley]] and [[Jascha Heifetz]]. In English, the book was titled ''I. Konev&nbsp;\u2013 Year of Victory''.

In 1919, he joined the [[Bolsheviks]] and served in the [[Red Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. After graduating from [[Frunze Military Academy]] in 1926, Konev gradually rose through the ranks of the Soviet military. By 1939, he had become a candidate to the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]].\n\nFollowing the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, Konev took part in a series of major campaigns, including the battles of [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]] and [[Battle of Rzhev, Summer 1942|Rzhev]]. Konev further commanded forces in major Soviet offensives at [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]], in the [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive|Dnieper-Carpathian]] and [[Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive|Vistula-Oder]] offensives. In February 1944, he was made a [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]]. In the eve of German defeat, Konev's [[1st Ukrainian Front]] was pitted against the armies of [[Georgy Zhukov]] in the [[Race to Berlin]]. Konev was the first Allied commander to enter [[Prague]], the capital of [[Czechoslovakia]], after the [[Prague uprising]].\n\nAfter the war, Konev replaced Zhukov as commander of Soviet ground forces. In 1956, he was appointed [[Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization|commander of the Warsaw Pact armed forces]], and led the violent suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]]. Konev remained a popular military figure in the Soviet Union until his death in 1973.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn December 28, 1897, in the village of [[Podosinovsky District|Lodeyno]] to a peasant family of Russian ethnicity. Konev graduated from a parish school in the village of Yakovlevskaya Gora in 1906, and later the Nikolo-Pushemsky Zemstvo School in the neighboring village of Schetkino in 1912. At the age of 15, he found work as a forester and lumberjack at [[Podosinovets]] and [[Arkhangelsk]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Military career==\n[[File:Ivan Stepanovich Konev 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Konev as a regimental commander]]\nIn the spring of 1916, he was conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army. Konev was sent to the 2nd Heavy Artillery Brigade at Moscow and then graduated from artillery training courses. In 1917, he was sent to the 2nd Separate Heavy Artillery Battalion on the [[Southwestern Front (Russian Empire)|Southwestern Front]] as a junior sergeant and fought in the [[Kerensky Offensive]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] broke out in 1917 he was demobilised and returned home, but in 1919 he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik party]] and the [[Red Army]], serving as an artilleryman. During the [[Russian Civil War]] he served with the Red Army in the Russian [[Far Eastern Republic]]. His commander at this time was [[Kliment Voroshilov]], later a close colleague of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Commissar]] for defence. This alliance was the key to Konev's subsequent career.\n\nIn 1926 Konev completed advanced officer training courses at the [[Frunze Military Academy]], and between then and 1931 he held a series of progressively more senior commands, becoming head of first the [[Transbaikal]] then the [[North Caucasus Military District]]s. In July 1938 he was appointed commander of the [[2nd Red Banner Army]]. In 1937 he became a Deputy of the [[Supreme Soviet]] and in 1939 a candidate member of the Party [[Central Committee]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0432 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|url = http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=698|website = warheroes.ru|access-date = 19 February 2016|language = Russian|trans-title = Konev Ivan Stepanovich}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Ivan Konev 1945.jpg|thumb|upright|Konev on the Eastern Front, 1945]]\nWhen [[Nazi Germany]] [[invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, Konev was assigned command of the [[19th Army (Soviet Union)|19th Army]] in the [[Vitebsk]] region, and waged a series of defensive battles during the Red Army's retreat, first to [[Smolensk]] and then to the approaches to Moscow.\n\nHe commanded the [[Kalinin Front]] from October 1941<ref name=GeorgyZhukov>{{Cite book |last=Zhukov |first=Georgy |title=Marshal of Victory, Volume II |publisher=[[Pen and Sword Books]] Ltd. |year=1974 |ISBN=9781781592915 |page=26}}</ref> to August 1942, playing a key role in the fighting around [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]] and the [[Soviet counter-offensive during the winter of 1941\u201342]].

P. 153.</ref> Among the ''maskirovka'' measures he adopted to achieve tactical surprise were the camouflaging of defence lines and depots; dummy units and supply points; a dummy air defence network; and the use of reconnaissance units to verify the quality of his army's camouflage and deception works. In David Glantz's view, Konev's forces \"generated a major portion of the element of surprise\".<ref name=Glantz153/>\n\nThe result was that the Germans seriously underestimated the strength of the Soviet defences. The commander of 19 Panzer, [[Gustav Schmidt (general)|General G. Schmidt]], wrote that \"We did not assume that there was even one fourth [of the Russian strength] of what we had to encounter\".<ref>Glantz, 1989. Pp. 153\u2013154.</ref>\n\nAfter the victory at Kursk, Konev's armies retook [[Belgorod]], [[Odessa]], [[Kharkiv]] and [[Kiev]]. The subsequent Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky Offensive led to the [[Battle of the Korsun\u2013Cherkassy Pocket]] which took place from 24 January to 16 February 1944. The offensive was part of the [[Dnieper\u2013Carpathian Offensive]]. In it, the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts, commanded, respectively, by [[Nikolai Vatutin]] and Konev, trapped German forces of [[Army Group South]] in a pocket or cauldron west of the [[Dnieper river]]. During weeks of fighting, the two Red Army Fronts tried to eradicate the pocket; the subsequent [[Korsun\u2013Shevchenkovsky Offensive|Korsun battle]] eliminated the cauldron. According to [[Milovan Djilas]], Konev openly boasted of his killing of thousands of German prisoners of war: \"The cavalry finally finished them off. 'We let the Cossacks cut up as long as they wished. They even hacked off the hands of those who raised them to surrender' the Marshal recounted with a smile.\"<ref name=\"Djilas\">Djilas p. 54</ref>\n\n[[File:Prague liberation 1945 konev.jpg|thumb|Konev at the liberation of Prague by the Red Army in May 1945.]]\nFor his achievements in the Ukraine (and ignoring his atrocities), Konev was promoted by Stalin to [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] in February 1944. He was one of Stalin's favourite generals and one of the few senior commanders whom even Stalin admired for his ruthlessness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=35|title=Ivan Konev|last=Chen|first=Peter|date=|website=World War II Database|access-date=19 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1944 Konev's armies advanced from [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] into [[Poland]] and later into [[Czechoslovakia]]. In May he participated in an unsuccessful invasion of the [[Balkans]], (the [[first Jassy\u2013Kishinev Offensive]]) together with Generals [[Rodion Malinovsky]] and [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]].\n\nBy July he had advanced to the [[Vistula]] River in central Poland, and was awarded the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. In September 1944 his forces, now designated the [[4th Ukrainian Front|Fourth Ukrainian Front]], advanced into [[Slovakia]] and helped the Slovak partisans in their rebellion against German occupation.\n\nIn January 1945 Konev, together with [[Georgy Zhukov]], commanded the Soviet armies which launched [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|the massive winter offensive]] in western Poland, driving the German forces from the Vistula to the [[Oder River]]. In southern Poland his armies seized [[Krak\u00f3w]]. Soviet historians, and generally Russian sources, claimed that Konev preserved Krak\u00f3w from Nazi-planned destruction by ordering a lightning attack on the city.<ref name=Gareev>[[Makhmut Gareev]], [http://www.redstar.ru/55_yar/12_04_1.html Marshal Konev] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013152242/http://redstar.ru/55_yar/12_04_1.html |date=13 October 2007 }}, ''[[Krasnaia Zvezda]]'', 12 April 2001</ref> Konev's January 1945 offensive also prevented planned destruction of the [[Silesia]]n industry by the retreating Germans.\n\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u0438 24 \u0438\u044e\u043d\u044f 1945 \u0433.

Konev's forces entered the city first, but Stalin gave Zhukov the honour of [[Battle of Berlin|capturing Berlin]] and hoisting the Soviet flag over the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]]. Konev was ordered to the south-west, where his forces linked up with elements of the [[United States Army]] at [[Elbe Day|Torgau]] and also retook [[Prague]] shortly after the official surrender of the German forces.\n\n===Post-war career===\nAfter the war Konev was appointed head of the Soviet occupation forces in [[East Germany|Eastern Germany]] and also Allied High Commissioner for [[Austria]]. In 1946 he became commander of Soviet ground forces and First Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, replacing Zhukov. He held these posts until 1950, when he was appointed commander of the [[Carpathian Military District]].\n\nAfter Stalin's death, however, Konev returned to prominence. He became a key ally of the new Party leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], being entrusted with the trial of the Stalinist police chief, [[Lavrenty Beria]] in 1953. He was again appointed First Deputy Minister of Defense and commander of Soviet ground forces, posts he held until 1956, when he was named [[Supreme Commander of the Unified Armed Forces of the Warsaw Treaty Organization|Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact]]. Shortly after his appointment he led the suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]].\n\n[[File:Szent Istv\u00e1n k\u00f6r\u00fat a Falk Miksa (N\u00e9phadsereg) utca fel\u0151l a Honv\u00e9d utca fel\u00e9 n\u00e9zve.

In 1961\u201362, however, he was recalled and was again commander of the Soviet forces in East Germany. He was then appointed to the largely ceremonial post of Inspector-General of the Defense Ministry.\n\nKonev remained one of the Soviet Union's most admired military figures until his death in 1973. He married twice, and his daughter Nataliya is Dean of the Department of Linguistics and Literature at the [[Russian Military University]].\n\nIn 1969, the [[Minister of Defence of the Soviet Union|Ministry of Defence of the USSR]] published Konev's 285-page war memoir called ''Forty-Five''. It was later translated into English in the same year and published by [[Progress Publishers]], Moscow. This work discusses Konev's taking of Berlin, Prague, his work with Zhukov, [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], his field meeting with General [[Omar Bradley]] and [[Jascha Heifetz]]. In English, the book was titled ''I. Konev&nbsp;\u2013 Year of Victory''. It was also published in Spanish and French under the titles ''El A\u00f1o 45'' and ''L'an 45'' respectively.\n\n[[Marshal of the Soviet Union]], [[Hero of the Soviet Union|Twice Hero of the Soviet Union]], holder of the [[Order of Victory]] Ivan Stepanovich Konev was buried in the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis|Kremlin Wall]] with the greatest figures of the USSR, and can still be visited today.\n\nOn the 9th of January 1991, his memorial sculpture in Krak\u00f3w was dismantled.
