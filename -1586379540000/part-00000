In his 1989  book ''Labour's Path to Power: The New Revisionism'', Radice set out his vision for a modernised Labour Party, which included abandoning Clause IV of the party constitution. His highly influential and widely quoted ''Southern Discomfort'' pamphlet in 1992 also argued the case for reform. Using focus group evidence, Radice found that voters in the south believed that Labour was out of touch, extremist and against aspiration.\n\nPhilip Stephens later wrote in the ''Financial Times,'' \"At that time, Giles Radice, then an MP, wrote a brilliant essay on what he called Labour's 'southern discomfort'.  The party would not win, he argued, unless and until it managed to connect its ambitions for social justice with the individualistic aspirations of the voters in southern England. Here was the template for Mr Blair.\" <ref>Financial Times 6 June 2006</ref> Radice returned to this theme following Labour's 2010 defeat: his ''Southern Discomfort Again'' pamphlet (with Patrick Diamond) found that voters perceived that Labour had run out of steam, were out of touch (particularly on immigration), unfair and poorly led.  In this pamphlet and in ''Southern Discomfort: One Year On'' (2011), Radice warned that the 'southern problem' is more than geographical: social change means that Labour support collapsed in other areas, including the Midlands.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} A committed pro-European, Radice has for many years been a leading member both of the European Movement and Britain in Europe, and wrote a polemic called ''Offshore'' in 1992, in which he put the case for Britain in Europe.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAfter his retirement as an MP in 2001 Radice, wrote ''Friends and Rivals'', an acclaimed triple biography of three modernisers from an earlier generation &mdash; [[Roy Jenkins]], [[Denis Healey]], and [[Anthony Crosland]], arguing that their failure to work more closely together had harmed the modernising cause. This was followed by ''The Tortoise and the Hares'', a comparative biography of [[Clement Attlee]], [[Ernest Bevin]], [[Stafford Cripps]], [[Hugh Dalton]] and [[Herbert Morrison]]. ''Trio: Inside the Blair, Brown, Mandelson Project'' was published in 2010.    In a review of ''Trio'', Andrew Blick wrote that, \"With his previous work ''Friends and Rivals'' (2002) and ''The Tortoise and the Hares'' (2008), Radice developed a distinctive approach to contemporary history, using group biography ....Radice adds to his historical approach not only a readable writing style, but the judgements of an experienced Labour politician.\"<ref>''Political Quarterly'', Vol 82, Issue 2, 2011, pp. 322-25.</ref>\n\n==Other positions==\nLord Radice has been a member of the advisory board of the [[Centre for British Studies]] of Berlin's [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]] since 1998.<ref>[http://www.gbz.hu-berlin.de/the-centre/advisory-council Humboldt University of Berlin Advisory Council website], gbz.hu-berlin.de; accessed 21 February 2016.</ref>\n\nHe is a member of the [[Fabian Society]].

In his 1989  book ''Labour's Path to Power: The New Revisionism'', Radice set out his vision for a modernised Labour Party, which included abandoning Clause IV of the party constitution. His highly influential and widely quoted ''Southern Discomfort'' pamphlet in 1992 also argued the case for reform. Using focus group evidence, Radice found that voters in the south believed that Labour was out of touch, extremist and against aspiration.\n\nPhilip Stephens later wrote in the ''Financial Times,'' \"At that time, Giles Radice, then an MP, wrote a brilliant essay on what he called Labour's 'southern discomfort'.  The party would not win, he argued, unless and until it managed to connect its ambitions for social justice with the individualistic aspirations of the voters in southern England. Here was the template for Mr Blair.\" <ref>Financial Times 6 June 2006</ref> Radice returned to this theme following Labour's 2010 defeat: his ''Southern Discomfort Again'' pamphlet (with Patrick Diamond) found that voters perceived that Labour had run out of steam, were out of touch (particularly on immigration), unfair and poorly led.  In this pamphlet and in ''Southern Discomfort: One Year On'' (2011), Radice warned that the 'southern problem' is more than geographical: social change means that Labour support collapsed in other areas, including the Midlands.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} A committed pro-European, Radice has for many years been a leading member both of the European Movement and Britain in Europe, and wrote a polemic called ''Offshore'' in 1992, in which he put the case for Britain in Europe.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAfter his retirement as an MP in 2001 Radice, wrote ''Friends and Rivals'', an acclaimed triple biography of three modernisers from an earlier generation &mdash; [[Roy Jenkins]], [[Denis Healey]], and [[Anthony Crosland]], arguing that their failure to work more closely together had harmed the modernising cause. This was followed by ''The Tortoise and the Hares'', a comparative biography of [[Clement Attlee]], [[Ernest Bevin]], [[Stafford Cripps]], [[Hugh Dalton]] and [[Herbert Morrison]]. ''Trio: Inside the Blair, Brown, Mandelson Project'' was published in 2010.    In a review of ''Trio'', Andrew Blick wrote that, \"With his previous work ''Friends and Rivals'' (2002) and ''The Tortoise and the Hares'' (2008), Radice developed a distinctive approach to contemporary history, using group biography ....Radice adds to his historical approach not only a readable writing style, but the judgements of an experienced Labour politician.\"<ref>''Political Quarterly'', Vol 82, Issue 2, 2011, pp. 322-25.</ref>\n\n==Other positions==\nLord Radice has been a member of the advisory board of the [[Centre for British Studies]] of Berlin's [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]] since 1998.<ref>[http://www.gbz.hu-berlin.de/the-centre/advisory-council Humboldt University of Berlin Advisory Council website], gbz.hu-berlin.de; accessed 21 February 2016.</ref>\n\nHe is a member of the [[Fabian Society]].

In October 1974, Molyneaux became leader of the Ulster Unionists in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Between 1982 and 1986 he sat as a UUP member for South Antrim in the failed [[1982 Northern Ireland Assembly]]. Molyneaux was admitted to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1982. Following boundary changes that divided South Antrim, Molyneaux became member for the new seat of [[Lagan Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Lagan Valley]] in 1983. In 1985, Molyneaux resigned his seat, along with his unionist colleagues in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], in protest at the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]]. He was re-elected in the subsequent [[by-election]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/hl1/114.htm | title=House of Lords List of Members | publisher=Publications.parliament.uk | accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMolyneaux was generally regarded as a member of the integrationist tendency within the UUP (favouring direct rule from Westminster with some extension of local government powers, as opposed to the devolutionist preference for a revived Northern Ireland parliament or assembly).<ref>Patterson, H. (2012) 'Unionism After Good Friday and St Andrews' in ''The Political Quarterly, Vol. 83, No.2'' (London:Wiley-Blackwell)</ref>  This preference was widely attributed to the influence of [[Enoch Powell]]. Critics within Molyneaux's party saw Molyneux as a do-nothing leader, unduly deferential towards the Conservative Party (leading him to be taken by surprise by the Anglo-Irish Agreement and overshadowed by [[Ian Paisley]]).  Molyneaux's defenders would probably argue that his primary concern was party unity, that the UUP was so divided that only a minimalist policy could hold it together.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-of-lord-molyneaux-by-alex-kane-1-6622320 | title=Obituary of Lord Molyneaux by Alex Kane | publisher=NewsLetter | accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Molyneaux was an active member of the [[Conservative Monday Club]].

In October 1974, Molyneaux became leader of the Ulster Unionists in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Between 1982 and 1986 he sat as a UUP member for South Antrim in the failed [[1982 Northern Ireland Assembly]]. Molyneaux was admitted to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1982. Following boundary changes that divided South Antrim, Molyneaux became member for the new seat of [[Lagan Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Lagan Valley]] in 1983. In 1985, Molyneaux resigned his seat, along with his unionist colleagues in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], in protest at the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]]. He was re-elected in the subsequent [[by-election]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/hl1/114.htm | title=House of Lords List of Members | publisher=Publications.parliament.uk | accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMolyneaux was generally regarded as a member of the integrationist tendency within the UUP (favouring direct rule from Westminster with some extension of local government powers, as opposed to the devolutionist preference for a revived Northern Ireland parliament or assembly).<ref>Patterson, H. (2012) 'Unionism After Good Friday and St Andrews' in ''The Political Quarterly, Vol. 83, No.2'' (London:Wiley-Blackwell)</ref>  This preference was widely attributed to the influence of [[Enoch Powell]]. Critics within Molyneaux's party saw Molyneux as a do-nothing leader, unduly deferential towards the Conservative Party (leading him to be taken by surprise by the Anglo-Irish Agreement and overshadowed by [[Ian Paisley]]).  Molyneaux's defenders would probably argue that his primary concern was party unity, that the UUP was so divided that only a minimalist policy could hold it together.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-of-lord-molyneaux-by-alex-kane-1-6622320 | title=Obituary of Lord Molyneaux by Alex Kane | publisher=NewsLetter | accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Molyneaux was an active member of the [[Conservative Monday Club]].

He became a public figure in 1967 as the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]]. Forces under his command reoccupied the Crater district of Aden which had been taken over by local police mutineers in what became known as [[Battle of the Crater (Aden)|\"the last battle of the British empire\"]]. The reoccupation and subsequent control of the Crater were controversial and Mitchell resigned his army commission in 1968. Subsequently, he became a Conservative Member of Parliament and served one term from 1970 to February 1974. After participation in a failed business venture he subsequently worked as a security and military consultant. In 1989 Mitchell took a leading role in the [[Halo Trust]], a not-for-profit organisation undertaking mine clearance in former war zones.\n\n==Early life==\nMitchell's father (also called Colin) came from an Argyllshire fishing family. Mitchell (Snr) worked in a solicitor's office and for the [[David MacBrayne Ltd|MacBrayne ferry company]] before serving in the 10th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in [[World War I]]. Mitchell (Snr) achieved the rank of captain (commissioned \u2018in the field\u2019) and was awarded the [[Military Cross]] at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], but when the young Colin asked him how he would only say, 'Oh, shooting rabbits'. He was badly gassed in 1918. After the war, he worked in the City of London and married a [[Glaswegian]] woman (n\u00e9e Gilmour) whose father worked as a manager for the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] Railway company. The couple took up residence in the South London suburb of [[Purley, London|Purley]] where they had two children \u2013 Colin and Henrietta. The family lived in a modest semi-detached house and Colin would attend services at the local [[Presbyterian]] Church wearing a [[kilt]].<ref>''[[The Independent]]'', obituary, early paragraphs on family history in 'free to view' section :[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960724/ai_n14059912/pg_1 Lt-Col Colin Mitchell], by [[Tam Dalyell]] - 24 July 1996</ref> Mitchell received his formal education at the [[Whitgift School|Whitgift Grammar School]] in [[Croydon]].\n\n==Military career==\nIn 1940, at age 15, Mitchell enlisted in the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], and may have been the youngest Home Guard soldier. In May 1943 he joined the [[British Army]], enlisting as a private in the [[Royal West Kent Regiment]]. He soon became a Lance-Corporal and instructed newcomers in physical training. One of his fellow instructors was [[Stan Cullis]] who had been the captain of the [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] [[1939 FA Cup Final|cup side at Wembley in 1939]] and was the captain of [[England national football team|England]] at the time. Mitchell was commissioned into the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] in 1944.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=36843|supp=y|page=5788|date=15 December 1944}}</ref> He fought in the final battles of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]], and was lightly wounded in the advance on [[Ferrara]]. Despite this, his wartime experience inclined him to take up a military career.<ref>''[[The Independent]]'', obituary :[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary--ltcol-colin-mitchell-1330247.html Lt-Col Colin Mitchell], by [[Tam Dalyell]] - 24 July 1996</ref>  He was appointed to a regular commission on 21 December 1946.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37823|supp=y|page=6169|date=17 December 1946}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the war, he saw action against Jewish guerrillas during the [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine|Palestine Emergency]]. While in Palestine, he participated in operations to arrest Jewish militants. During [[Operation Agatha]], which saw most of the Jewish political leadership in Palestine detained, Mitchell's mission was to arrest [[Moshe Sharett|Moshe Shertok]] (a future [[Prime Minister of Israel]]). Initially, his unit raided the wrong house. However, they were later able to find and arrest him. In July 1946, he witnessed the [[King David Hotel bombing]]: he and his company commander were within 300 feet of the building when the bombing occurred. While on a personal reconnaissance mission, he was shot and wounded by one of his own Bren gunners, who mistook him for a guerrilla. After recovering from his injuries, he was transferred from his regiment to become [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[Gordon Holmes MacMillan|Gordon MacMillan]], the commander of British forces in Palestine and Transjordan. He spent a total of three years in Palestine. While there, he made friends among both the Arabs and Jews, including [[Moshe Dayan]], a future Israeli general who would become one of Mitchell's heroes, as well as Moshe Shertok, who developed a cordial relationship with Mitchell after his arrest and corresponded with him for years afterward, when he became a senior Israeli government official.<ref>http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1971/nov/17/northern-ireland-compton-committees</ref><ref name=\"Telegraph obituary\">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/army-obituaries/5796166/Lt-Col-C-C-Mad-Mitch-Mitchell.html Lt-Col C C 'Mad Mitch' Mitchell]</ref>\n\nIn 1950, with the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], he was allowed to rejoin his regiment so he could deploy to Korea. He participated in the initial advance into [[North Korea]], seeing close-quarters combat along the way. His regiment ultimately reached [[Taechon]], near the Chinese border on the [[Yalu River]]. When the Chinese Army intervened and crossed the Yalu River in overwhelming numbers, the regiment was forced to take part in the retreat of UN forces, and later helped hold the line against Communist forces when UN forces consolidated. The regiment held a position known as \"Frostbite Ridge\", where they had to endure freezing conditions. They held the area through the winter until the thaw, and in 1951, they began to advance. However, shortly afterward, they were relieved and withdrawn.<ref name=\"Telegraph obituary\"/>\n\nFollowing his service in Korea, Mitchell was posted in Britain, but in late 1957, he returned to the Argylls as a company commander with the 1st Battalion, and was posted to [[Cyprus]]. At the time, the [[Cyprus Emergency]] was in full swing. Mitchell was placed in charge of the coastal towns of [[Paphos]] and Ktima, where his men engaged in counter-insurgency operations against [[EOKA]] guerrillas. They faced both conventional EOKA raids and forest fires deliberately lit by EOKA fighters and local villagers who were motivated by the money they would receive to fight them.<ref name=\"Telegraph obituary\"/><ref>Edwards, Aaron: ''Mad Mitch's Tribal Law: Aden and the End of Empire''</ref>\n\nMitchell was subsequently posted to the [[British Army of the Rhine]] with the rest of the regiment, and then joined the [[King's African Rifles]], and was posted to [[East Africa]]. Soon afterward, he saw action in [[Zanzibar]] with the KAR in breaking up disturbances between the island's Arab and African populations, which had begun during a general election and had descended into widespread rioting and clashes. He also participated in operations on the [[Northern Frontier District]]. At the time, Somali guerrillas were launching raids as part of a campaign to unite the region with Somalia, and the frontiers with other neighbouring states were also volatile. In one incident, Mitchell was searching for Somali guerrillas in a low-flying helicopter, and an elephant attempted to attack the helicopter, nearly clipping it with its tusks. It has been claimed that while with the KAR Mitchell was instrumental in obtaining a commission for [[Idi Amin]], who later became President of [[Uganda]]. Mitchell's familiarity with the Scottish [[Scottish clan|clan system]] made him more comfortable with African tribal issues than was the case with his English contemporaries. Impressed by Mitchell and other Scottish officers, Amin would later adopt the title [[The Last King of Scotland|''King of Scotland'']].<ref name=\"Telegraph obituary\"/><ref>''[[The New York Times]]'':[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/27/world/colin-mitchell-is-dead-at-70-british-hero-in-aden-battles.html Mitchell's 1996 obituary]</ref>\n\nFollowing his service in Kenya, Mitchell rejoined the Argylls, which was sent to [[Borneo]] to participate in the [[Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation]]. Mitchell participated in a series of clashes with Indonesian forces. After six months of jungle warfare, the regiment was sent back to [[Singapore]] to recuperate. Mitchell was posted back to the UK as a staff officer. Throughout all this time Mitchell was making a reputation as a bold and efficient officer, passing out top of [[Staff College, Camberley|Staff College]] and serving as GSO1 on the staff of [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence staff]], [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]]. Mitchell was promoted [[First Lieutenant|lieutenant]] in 1947,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38240|page=1926|date=16 March 1948}}</ref> [[captain (OF-2)|captain]] in 1952,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=39696|supp=y|page=6068|date=14 November 1952}}</ref> [[major (United Kingdom)|major]] in 1959,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=41868|supp=y|page=7246|date=13 November 1959}}</ref> and his success in a wide range of appointments won him [[brevet rank]] as a lieutenant-colonel in 1964.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=43371|supp=y|page=5715|date=30 June 1964}}</ref>\n\nMitchell was promoted to substantive lieutenant-colonel on 31 December 1966,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=44223|supp=y|page=310|date=6 January 1967}}</ref> and made [[Commanding Officer]] 1st Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (the \u2018Argylls\u2019) on 12 January 1967.\n\n==Aden==\nIn 1967 the British Aden colony consisted of the City of Aden and attached Protectorate areas, with a total land mass similar to that of the United Kingdom. These territories enjoyed a degree of self government as the [[Federation of South Arabia]]. Within the City itself was the old quarter known as \"The Crater\", so called because it was sited in an [[extinct volcano]].<ref>Pirates to Grenades [http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Aden/pirates.html Aden] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171058/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Aden/pirates.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> The Crater district had an area of approximately one square mile and housed approximately 80,000 inhabitants.<ref>''Having Been A Soldier'', p. 1. The figure is repeated on p. 204.</ref> Between 1963 and 1967 the British administration faced a low intensity [[guerrilla warfare|insurgency]] from groups of armed Arab nationalists who were seeking independence for Aden and competing for future power after the inevitable British withdrawal. This insurgency was designated the \"[[Aden Emergency]]\".\n\n==Uprising in Aden City==\nIn late June 1967 the 1st Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was due to take over responsibility for security in Aden's Crater district from the [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers]]. However, before this took place, on 20 June 1967 elements of the locally recruited Aden Police [[Arab Police Mutiny|mutinied]], seizing control over the district in alliance with insurgent forces, staging several ambushes of British troops in the Crater district's streets. Eight British soldiers from a transport unit were attacked and killed by the mutineers, and other British troops were killed in coordinated separate attacks. Three men from the Argylls (its Officer Commanding 'D' company, along with two privates) were killed when a patrol of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers that they were accompanying was ambushed. All but one of the patrol being shot and killed.\n\nFor some days a stand-off around the Crater existed between British Forces and the mutineers, with the authorities hesitating. Then, just before sunset on 3 July 1967 Mitchell commanded an operation that [[Battle of the Crater (Aden)|reoccupied the Crater]]. The Argylls and other units entered and reoccupied the Crater, accompanied by 15 bagpipers playing \"[[Scotland the Brave]]\"<ref>The Argylls in Aden :[http://www.argylls1945to1971.co.uk/A_and_SH_Aden_Re-entryintoCrater.htm reocupation of the Crater]</ref> and the Argylls' regimental charge, \"Monymusk\".<ref name=ODNB>[[Tam Dalyell]], [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/63184 \u2018Mitchell, Colin Campbell (1925\u20131996)\u2019] (subscription required), ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], September 2004; online edition, January 2006, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/63184}}. Retrieved 13 February 2008</ref> Mitchell subsequently used what were described as \u201cstrong arm methods\u201d to maintain order in the Crater district for the remaining months before British withdrawal from Aden. The reoccupation itself was almost bloodless. One local man was killed and control of the Treasury building holding the [[Federation of South Arabia|Federation's]] currency reserves was restored.<ref name=\"dailyrecord.co.uk\">Daily Record, [http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/editors-choice/2008/08/23/bravery-of-mad-mitch-goes-unrewarded-despite-success-of-middle-east-mission-86908-20708289/] Mad Mitch in Aden</ref> Mitchell then used an integrated system of observation posts, patrols, checkpoints and intelligence gathering to maintain the Crater as a pacified area whilst security conditions elsewhere in Aden began to deteriorate. However, British troops in the Crater became subject to sniper and grenade attacks.\n\nAllegations were made of abuses by Mitchell and the troops under his command. There were also allegations that British troops had engaged in some looting within the district.<ref name=\"dailyrecord.co.uk\"/> Mitchell used the Chartered Bank building in the Crater district as his headquarters, and army snipers positioned upon its roof would shoot at anyone thought to represent a threat in the streets below. A [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] reporter stated \"Once we stood together in Crater watching the Argylls stacking, as in a butcher's shop, the bodies of four Arab militants they had just shot and Mad Mitch said: 'It was like shooting grouse, a brace here and a brace there'.\" <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7120629.stm|title=Return to Aden, without Mad Mitch|date=1 December 2007|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref> Mitchell (nicknamed 'Mad Mitch' by sections of the press) imposed what was described as \"Argyll law\" on the Crater.\n\nThe reoccupation of the Crater made Mitchell popular with sections of the British press and public.

General-Officer-Commanding Middle East Land Forces, Major-General [[Philip Tower]], feared that it would merely provoke trouble. He was of the view that engaging in a full reoccupation of the Crater, with its risk of casualties, was pointless given that British withdrawal from Aden was imminent and British strategy was moving to the role of neutral peacekeeping. Tower had authorized a probe into the Crater but Mitchell had used this authority to carry out a full military reoccupation. Tower subsequently ordered Mitchell to \"throttle back\" on the operation.<ref name=\"the Argylls' 1967 Aden campaign\"/> Mitchell stated that he considered Tower's approach to be \u201cwet hen tactics\u201d. The situation that developed was described in ''[[The Times]]'' as follows:<ref name=\"The Times, 24 July 1996\">''[[The Times]]'', 24 July 1996</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Mitchell frequently appeared on television: a small, handsome man with a direct, pugnacious manner, speaking the robust, un-minced words that the British had not heard from their army officers since the acceleration of the Imperial decline had begun nearly two decades before. Newspapers took him up as a popular hero, proudly bestowing upon him the sobriquet of 'Mad Mitch'.}}\n\nQuestions were raised in the House of Commons about the events in Aden. [[Tam Dalyell]] (Labour, West Lothian) asked whether it was true that: \"Mitchell disobeyed operational and administrative orders of his senior officers during the recapture of the Crater\"?<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 17 July 1968, \u201dIndiscipline Denied by Colonel Mitchell\u201d</ref> Mitchell himself later stated that he had been rebuked over the reoccupation by General Tower. The nature of this rebuke was explained by British Government's Defence Minister [[Denis Healey]] as follows:<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 25 July 1968</ref>\n\n{{cquote|\u2026 the brigade commander thought it necessary to emphasize to Colonel Mitchell that the maintenance of law and order with minimum force leading to an orderly withdrawal from Aden with minimum casualties was the policy that had to be followed.}}\n\nThe final British withdrawal from Aden took place in November 1967. Mitchell and the Argylls arrived back at their Plymouth garrison on 27 November. Between July and November the regiment had suffered 5 dead and 25 wounded in Aden, a near 5% casualty rate. Unlike all the other battalion commanders from Aden, Mitchell was not decorated, receiving instead only a Mention in Despatches.<ref name=MiD>{{London Gazette|issue=44508|supp=y|pages=878\u2013879|date=19 January 1968}}</ref> It was also indicated to him that further career advancement within the army was unlikely. Interviewed by the BBC in 1985, General Tower said \"Colonel Mitchell, for reasons of his own, wanted to cut a dash with the Argylls in the Crater\" thereby accepting unnecessary casualties.<ref>BBC documentary End of Empire - Aden, available on YouTube, see minute 42:30 onwards</ref> Reports began to circulate to the effect that the Argylls were to be disbanded as part of a general cutback in defence spending. In July 1968, Mitchell gave notice of his intention to resign his commission at the end of the year. Although he had not given the customary 7 months\u2019 notice required of senior officers, his resignation was accepted with effect from 1 October 1968.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=44686|supp=y|page=10530|date=27 September 1968}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nOnce he was a civilian, Mitchell assumed a prominent public role in a \u201cSave the Argylls\u201d campaign to stop the abolition of the regiment. He published a memoir entitled ''Having Been a Soldier'', undertook some freelance journalism and briefly took a job as management trainee with Beaverbrook Newspapers. However, he had become a popular public figure from his time in Aden, and turned this to his advantage when he started a new career in politics. In 1969 he was adopted as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party's]] parliamentary candidate for [[Aberdeenshire West (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeenshire West]]. This was a Liberal Party held seat, although the sitting member was retiring at the next election. Mitchell took the seat<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=45134|page=6951|date=23 June 1970}}</ref> with a 5,000 vote majority in the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]].<ref>1970 General Election :[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge70/i01.htm results, see Aberdeenshire West]</ref> His main opponent in that election was [[Laura Miranda Grimond|Laura Grimond]], wife of former Liberal leader [[Jo Grimond]].\n\nHe proved to be an energetic and effective constituency M.P. He also served for a year as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. However, it became apparent that he was not likely to develop a ministerial career. His main political interest was the British Army, and he was frequently critical of its leadership. In August 1970 he was quoted as having referred to \"... those bastards in Whitehall\".<ref>The Times, 7 August 1970, \u201cEmaciated Thin Red Line Survives\u201d</ref> He gravitated towards the right wing of the Conservative Party, opposing the United Kingdom's membership of the [[European Economic Community]], economic sanctions being placed upon [[Rhodesia]], and the arms embargo on Israel. He also became a prominent member of both the [[Monday Club]] and the 'Anglo-Rhodesian Society'. Mitchell became known as a maverick M.P., and was one of 39 Conservatives who defied the Party whip to vote against entry to the [[European Community|EEC]] in the Commons vote on 28 October 1971.<ref>BBC report :[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7948612.stm voting on the EU]</ref> Although never promoted to ministerial office, Mitchell was a high-profile backbench M.P., in demand by society and the media. He was a popular member of the [[Garrick Club]], and was reported to enjoy a \u201cgregarious social life\u201d in London.<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 25 July 1996</ref>\n\nIn 1973 he was approached by a consortium that was planning to establish a large sporting and agricultural estate in Scotland, which invited him to take a stake in the project and become the project's General-Manager with a generous salary. Mitchell accepted and announced he would not be seeking re-election to Parliament on the basis that he \u201c\u2026could not afford to be an M.P.\u201d \u2014 a remark that would come back to haunt him.<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 16 January 1974</ref> He left Parliament at the time of the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], against the advice of both his wife Sue and fellow maverick M.P [[Tam Dalyell]].\n\n==1974-1989==\nThe Scottish estate project failed and Mitchell became unemployed. He later stated that giving up his seat in Parliament had been a disastrous mistake. Mitchell spent much of the next 10 years trying to get back into Parliament. He applied to several constituency Conservative Associations, including [[Bournemouth East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bournemouth East]] in August 1977, but at every selection interview the question was raised as to why he had given up Aberdeenshire West in 1974. No winnable constituency would adopt him.<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 25 August 1977</ref> He remained on the fringes of Conservative Party politics, ''The Times'' Diary columnist reporting on a meeting of the Monday Club at the 1976 Conservative Party conference where he had made a speech on the subject of Rhodesia:<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 8 October 1976</ref>\n\n{{cquote|I went to mock, but came away with much sympathy for Mitchell personally rather than for the lost cause he espouses. He is quite at odds with the world in which he finds himself}}\n\nDuring this period Mitchell remained sporadically active in a series of consultancies, mostly of a military or security nature. He is known to have provided services to backers of the [[Mujahideen]] insurgents in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Contras|Contra]] rebels in [[Nicaragua]].<ref>New York Times :[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/27/world/colin-mitchell-is-dead-at-70-british-hero-in-aden-battles.html Mitchell's 1996 obituary]</ref> In November 1980, Mitchell praised the Mujahideen as \"gallant fighters... expressing themselves, as Afghans know best, in the romantic tradition of sniping, raiding and brigandry.\" He urged Western leaders to provide them with military training and equipment, and to select \"proven guerilla fighters\" from their ranks for training as future leaders of Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news|first=Colin|last=Mitchell|title=Aid for Afghan resistance|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=29 November 1980|page=13|issue=60789}}</ref> However, Mitchell became increasingly dissatisfied with his situation.<ref name=\"The Times, 24 July 1996\"/>\n\n{{cquote|At times his disappointment showed and it amounted to bitterness. He turned angrily against the media, which he had used so brilliantly... and against old friends who had tried to help him in difficult times. Once a popular member of the Garrick Club, he avoided it for years, finally stopping his subscription.}}\n\n==The Halo Trust==\nIn 1989, Mitchell took a leading role in the [[Halo Trust]] (the hazardous areas life-support organization). This non-profit making organization undertook de-mining operations in former war zones. It employed a core of (mostly British and Commonwealth) de-mining experts and a large number of locally recruited and trained personnel. Most of the Halo personnel were former servicemen.<ref>Halo Trust :[http://www.halotrust.org/index.html website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331131155/http://www.halotrust.org/index.html |date=31 March 2008 }}</ref> Halo became active around the world in areas such as [[Mozambique]], [[Cambodia]] and Afghanistan. Mitchell appeared comfortable in his work with Halo. It raised his public profile once again, and in a manner that was both positive and uncontroversial.\n\n==Death==\nMitchell died in his 71st year on 20 July 1996 at [[Westminster]] in London, after a short illness. His obituary in ''[[The Independent]]'' was written by his friend the Labour MP [[Tam Dalyell]]. Dalyell stated :\n\n{{cquote|In the course of my last conversation with him in 1995 Mitchell said that in perspective the \"Mad Mitch\" image had ruined his prospects of a serious senior military career, and had deprived him of being taken seriously as a politician ...}}\n\n==Personal life==\nMitchell married Jean Hamilton (Sue) Phillips in April 1956.

He became a public figure in 1967 as the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]]. Forces under his command reoccupied the Crater district of Aden which had been taken over by local police mutineers in what became known as [[Battle of the Crater (Aden)|\"the last battle of the British empire\"]]. The reoccupation and subsequent control of the Crater were controversial and Mitchell resigned his army commission in 1968. Subsequently he became a Conservative Member of Parliament and served one term from 1970 to February 1974. After participation in a failed business venture he subsequently worked as a security and military consultant. In 1989 Mitchell took a leading role in the [[Halo Trust]], a not-for-profit organisation undertaking mine clearance in former war zones.\n\n==Early life==\nMitchell\u2019s father (also called Colin) came from an Argyllshire fishing family. Mitchell (Snr) worked in a solicitor's office and for the [[David MacBrayne Ltd|MacBrayne ferry company]] before serving in the 10th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in [[World War I]]. Mitchell (Snr) achieved the rank of captain (commissioned \u2018in the field\u2019) and was awarded the [[Military Cross]] at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], but when the young Colin asked him how he would only say, 'Oh, shooting rabbits'. He was badly gassed in 1918. After the war, he worked in the City of London and married a [[Glaswegian]] woman (n\u00e9e Gilmour) whose father worked as a manager for the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] Railway company. The couple took up residence in the South London suburb of [[Purley, London|Purley]] where they had two children \u2013 Colin and Henrietta. The family lived in a modest semi-detached house and Colin would attend services at the local [[Presbyterian]] Church wearing a [[kilt]].<ref>''[[The Independent]]'', obituary, early paragraphs on family history in 'free to view' section :[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960724/ai_n14059912/pg_1 Lt-Col Colin Mitchell], by [[Tam Dalyell]] - 24 July 1996</ref> Mitchell received his formal education at the [[Whitgift School|Whitgift Grammar School]] in [[Croydon]].\n\n==Military career==\nIn 1940, at age 15, Mitchell enlisted in the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], and may have been the youngest Home Guard soldier. In May 1943 he joined the [[British Army]], enlisting as a private in the [[Royal West Kent Regiment]]. He soon became a Lance-Corporal and instructed newcomers in physical training. One of his fellow instructors was [[Stan Cullis]] who had been the captain of the [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] [[1939 FA Cup Final|cup side at Wembley in 1939]] and was the captain of [[England national football team|England]] at the time. Mitchell was commissioned into the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] in 1944.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=36843|supp=y|page=5788|date=15 December 1944}}</ref> He fought in the final battles of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]], and was lightly wounded in the advance on [[Ferrara]]. Despite this, his wartime experience inclined him to take up a military career.<ref>''[[The Independent]]'', obituary :[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary--ltcol-colin-mitchell-1330247.html Lt-Col Colin Mitchell], by [[Tam Dalyell]] - 24 July 1996</ref>  He was appointed to a regular commission on 21 December 1946.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37823|supp=y|page=6169|date=17 December 1946}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the war, he saw action against Jewish guerrillas during the [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine|Palestine Emergency]]. While in Palestine, he participated in operations to arrest Jewish militants. During [[Operation Agatha]], which saw most of the Jewish political leadership in Palestine detained, Mitchell's mission was to arrest [[Moshe Sharett|Moshe Shertok]] (a future [[Prime Minister of Israel]]). Initially, his unit raided the wrong house. However, they were later able to find and arrest him. In July 1946, he witnessed the [[King David Hotel bombing]]: he and his company commander were within 300 feet of the building when the bombing occurred. While on a personal reconnaissance mission, he was shot and wounded by one of his own Bren gunners, who mistook him for a guerrilla. After recovering from his injuries, he was transferred from his regiment to become [[aide-de-camp]] to General [[Gordon Holmes MacMillan|Gordon MacMillan]], the commander of British forces in Palestine and Transjordan. He spent a total of three years in Palestine. While there, he made friends among both the Arabs and Jews, including [[Moshe Dayan]], a future Israeli general who would become one of Mitchell's heroes, as well as Moshe Shertok, who developed a cordial relationship with Mitchell after his arrest and corresponded with him for years afterward, when he became a senior Israeli government official.<ref>http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1971/nov/17/northern-ireland-compton-committees</ref><ref name=\"Telegraph obituary\">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/army-obituaries/5796166/Lt-Col-C-C-Mad-Mitch-Mitchell.html Lt-Col C C 'Mad Mitch' Mitchell]</ref>\n\nIn 1950, with the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], he was allowed to rejoin his regiment so he could deploy to Korea. He participated in the initial advance into [[North Korea]], seeing close-quarters combat along the way. His regiment ultimately reached [[Taechon]], near the Chinese border on the [[Yalu River]]. When the Chinese Army intervened and crossed the Yalu River in overwhelming numbers, the regiment was forced to take part in the retreat of UN forces, and later helped hold the line against Communist forces when UN forces consolidated. The regiment held a position known as \"Frostbite Ridge\", where they had to endure freezing conditions. They held the area through the winter until the thaw, and in 1951, they began to advance. However, shortly afterward, they were relieved and withdrawn.<ref name=\"Telegraph obituary\"/>\n\nFollowing his service in Korea, Mitchell was posted in Britain, but in late 1957, he returned to the Argylls as a company commander with the 1st Battalion, and was posted to [[Cyprus]]. At the time, the [[Cyprus Emergency]] was in full swing. Mitchell was placed in charge of the coastal towns of [[Paphos]] and Ktima, where his men engaged in counter-insurgency operations against [[EOKA]] guerrillas. They faced both conventional EOKA raids and forest fires deliberately lit by EOKA fighters and local villagers who were motivated by the money they would receive to fight them.<ref name=\"Telegraph obituary\"/><ref>Edwards, Aaron: ''Mad Mitch's Tribal Law: Aden and the End of Empire''</ref>\n\nMitchell was subsequently posted to the [[British Army of the Rhine]] with the rest of the regiment, and then joined the [[King's African Rifles]], and was posted to [[East Africa]]. Soon afterward, he saw action in [[Zanzibar]] with the KAR in breaking up disturbances between the island's Arab and African populations, which had begun during a general election and had descended into widespread rioting and clashes. He also participated in operations on the [[Northern Frontier District]]. At the time, Somali guerrillas were launching raids as part of a campaign to unite the region with Somalia, and the frontiers with other neighbouring states were also volatile. In one incident, Mitchell was searching for Somali guerrillas in a low-flying helicopter, and an elephant attempted to attack the helicopter, nearly clipping it with its tusks. It has been claimed that while with the KAR Mitchell was instrumental in obtaining a commission for [[Idi Amin]], who later became President of [[Uganda]]. Mitchell's familiarity with the Scottish [[Scottish clan|clan system]] made him more comfortable with African tribal issues than was the case with his English contemporaries. Impressed by Mitchell and other Scottish officers, Amin would later adopt the title [[The Last King of Scotland|''King of Scotland'']].<ref name=\"Telegraph obituary\"/><ref>''[[The New York Times]]'':[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/27/world/colin-mitchell-is-dead-at-70-british-hero-in-aden-battles.html Mitchell's 1996 obituary]</ref>\n\nFollowing his service in Kenya, Mitchell rejoined the Argylls, which was sent to [[Borneo]] to participate in the [[Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation]]. Mitchell participated in a series of clashes with Indonesian forces. After six months of jungle warfare, the regiment was sent back to [[Singapore]] to recuperate. Mitchell was posted back to the UK as a staff officer. Throughout all this time Mitchell was making a reputation as a bold and efficient officer, passing out top of [[Staff College, Camberley|Staff College]] and serving as GSO1 on the staff of [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence staff]], [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]].

These territories enjoyed a degree of self government as the [[Federation of South Arabia]]. Within the City itself was the old quarter known as \"The Crater\", so called because it was sited in an [[extinct volcano]].<ref>Pirates to Grenades [http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Aden/pirates.html Aden] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171058/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Aden/pirates.html |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> The Crater district had an area of approximately one square mile and housed approximately 80,000 inhabitants.<ref>''Having Been A Soldier'', p. 1. The figure is repeated on p. 204.</ref> Between 1963 and 1967 the British administration faced a low intensity [[guerrilla warfare|insurgency]] from groups of armed Arab nationalists who were seeking independence for Aden and competing for future power after the inevitable British withdrawal. This insurgency was designated the \"[[Aden Emergency]]\".\n\n==Uprising in Aden City==\nIn late June 1967 the 1st Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was due to take over responsibility for security in Aden's Crater district from the [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers]]. However, before this took place, on 20 June 1967 elements of the locally recruited Aden Police [[Arab Police Mutiny|mutinied]], seizing control over the district in alliance with insurgent forces, staging several ambushes of British troops in the Crater district's streets. Eight British soldiers from a transport unit were attacked and killed by the mutineers, and other British troops were killed in coordinated separate attacks. Three men from the Argylls (its Officer Commanding 'D' company, along with two privates) were killed when a patrol of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers that they were accompanying was ambushed. All but one of the patrol being shot and killed.\n\nFor some days a stand-off around the Crater existed between British Forces and the mutineers, with the authorities hesitating. Then, just before sunset on 3 July 1967 Mitchell commanded an operation that [[Battle of the Crater (Aden)|reoccupied the Crater]]. The Argylls and other units entered and reoccupied the Crater, accompanied by 15 bagpipers playing \"[[Scotland the Brave]]\"<ref>The Argylls in Aden :[http://www.argylls1945to1971.co.uk/A_and_SH_Aden_Re-entryintoCrater.htm reocupation of the Crater]</ref> and the Argylls' regimental charge, \"Monymusk\".<ref name=ODNB>[[Tam Dalyell]], [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/63184 \u2018Mitchell, Colin Campbell (1925\u20131996)\u2019] (subscription required), ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], September 2004; online edition, January 2006, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/63184}}. Retrieved 13 February 2008</ref> Mitchell subsequently used what were described as \u201cstrong arm methods\u201d to maintain order in the Crater district for the remaining months before British withdrawal from Aden. The reoccupation itself was almost bloodless. One local man was killed and control of the Treasury building holding the [[Federation of South Arabia|Federation's]] currency reserves was restored.<ref name=\"dailyrecord.co.uk\">Daily Record, [http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/editors-choice/2008/08/23/bravery-of-mad-mitch-goes-unrewarded-despite-success-of-middle-east-mission-86908-20708289/] Mad Mitch in Aden</ref> Mitchell then used an integrated system of observation posts, patrols, checkpoints and intelligence gathering to maintain the Crater as a pacified area whilst security conditions elsewhere in Aden began to deteriorate. However, British troops in the Crater became subject to sniper and grenade attacks.\n\nAllegations were made of abuses by Mitchell and the troops under his command. There were also allegations that British troops had engaged in some looting within the district.<ref name=\"dailyrecord.co.uk\"/> Mitchell used the Chartered Bank building in the Crater district as his headquarters, and army snipers positioned upon its roof would shoot at anyone thought to represent a threat in the streets below. A [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] reporter stated \"Once we stood together in Crater watching the Argylls stacking, as in a butcher's shop, the bodies of four Arab militants they had just shot and Mad Mitch said: 'It was like shooting grouse, a brace here and a brace there'.\" <ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7120629.stm|title=Return to Aden, without Mad Mitch|date=1 December 2007|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref> Mitchell (nicknamed 'Mad Mitch' by sections of the press) imposed what was described as \"Argyll law\" on the Crater.\n\nThe reoccupation of the Crater made Mitchell popular with sections of the British press and public.

General-Officer-Commanding Middle East Land Forces, Major-General [[Philip Tower]], feared that it would merely provoke trouble. He was of the view that engaging in a full reoccupation of the Crater, with its risk of casualties, was pointless given that British withdrawal from Aden was imminent and British strategy was moving to the role of neutral peacekeeping. Tower had authorized a probe into the Crater but Mitchell had used this authority to carry out a full military reoccupation. Tower subsequently ordered Mitchell to \"throttle back\" on the operation.<ref name=\"the Argylls' 1967 Aden campaign\"/> Mitchell stated that he considered Tower\u2019s approach to be \u201cwet hen tactics\u201d. The situation that developed was described in ''[[The Times]]'' as follows:<ref name=\"The Times, 24 July 1996\">''[[The Times]]'', 24 July 1996</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Mitchell frequently appeared on television: a small, handsome man with a direct, pugnacious manner, speaking the robust, un-minced words that the British had not heard from their army officers since the acceleration of the Imperial decline had begun nearly two decades before. Newspapers took him up as a popular hero, proudly bestowing upon him the sobriquet of 'Mad Mitch'.}}\n\nQuestions were raised in the House of Commons about the events in Aden. [[Tam Dalyell]] (Labour, West Lothian) asked whether it was true that: \"Mitchell disobeyed operational and administrative orders of his senior officers during the recapture of the Crater\"?<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 17 July 1968, \u201dIndiscipline Denied by Colonel Mitchell\u201d</ref> Mitchell himself later stated that he had been rebuked over the reoccupation by General Tower.

Mitchell and the Argylls arrived back at their Plymouth garrison on 27 November. Between July and November the regiment had suffered 5 dead and 25 wounded in Aden, a near 5% casualty rate. Unlike all the other battalion commanders from Aden, Mitchell was not decorated, receiving instead only a Mention in Despatches.<ref name=MiD>{{London Gazette|issue=44508|supp=y|pages=878\u2013879|date=19 January 1968}}</ref> It was also indicated to him that further career advancement within the army was unlikely. Interviewed by the BBC in 1985, General Tower said \"Colonel Mitchell, for reasons of his own, wanted to cut a dash with the Argylls in the Crater\" thereby accepting unnecessary casualties.<ref>BBC documentary End of Empire - Aden, available on YouTube, see minute 42:30 onwards</ref> Reports began to circulate to the effect that the Argylls were to be disbanded as part of a general cutback in defence spending. In July 1968, Mitchell gave notice of his intention to resign his commission at the end of the year. Although he had not given the customary 7 months\u2019 notice required of senior officers, his resignation was accepted with effect from 1 October 1968.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=44686|supp=y|page=10530|date=27 September 1968}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nOnce he was a civilian, Mitchell assumed a prominent public role in a \u201cSave the Argylls\u201d campaign to stop the abolition of the regiment. He published a memoir entitled ''Having Been a Soldier'', undertook some freelance journalism and briefly took a job as management trainee with Beaverbrook Newspapers. However, he had become a popular public figure from his time in Aden, and turned this to his advantage when he started a new career in politics. In 1969 he was adopted as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party's]] parliamentary candidate for [[Aberdeenshire West (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeenshire West]]. This was a Liberal Party held seat, although the sitting member was retiring at the next election. Mitchell took the seat<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=45134|page=6951|date=23 June 1970}}</ref> with a 5,000 vote majority in the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]].<ref>1970 General Election :[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge70/i01.htm results, see Aberdeenshire West]</ref> His main opponent in that election was [[Laura Miranda Grimond|Laura Grimond]], wife of former Liberal leader [[Jo Grimond]].\n\nHe proved to be an energetic and effective constituency M.P. He also served for a year as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. However, it became apparent that he was not likely to develop a ministerial career. His main political interest was the British Army, and he was frequently critical of its leadership. In August 1970 he was quoted as having referred to \"... those bastards in Whitehall\".<ref>The Times, 7 August 1970, \u201cEmaciated Thin Red Line Survives\u201d</ref> He gravitated towards the right wing of the Conservative Party, opposing the United Kingdom's membership of the [[European Economic Community]], economic sanctions being placed upon [[Rhodesia]], and the arms embargo on Israel. He also became a prominent member of both the [[Monday Club]] and the 'Anglo-Rhodesian Society'. Mitchell became known as a maverick M.P., and was one of 39 Conservatives who defied the Party whip to vote against entry to the [[European Community|EEC]] in the Commons vote on 28 October 1971.<ref>BBC report :[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7948612.stm voting on the EU]</ref> Although never promoted to ministerial office, Mitchell was a high-profile backbench M.P., in demand by society and the media. He was a popular member of the [[Garrick Club]], and was reported to enjoy a \u201cgregarious social life\u201d in London.<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 25 July 1996</ref>\n\nIn 1973 he was approached by a consortium that was planning to establish a large sporting and agricultural estate in Scotland, which invited him to take a stake in the project and become the project's General-Manager with a generous salary. Mitchell accepted and announced he would not be seeking re-election to Parliament on the basis that he \u201c\u2026could not afford to be an M.P.\u201d \u2014 a remark that would come back to haunt him.<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 16 January 1974</ref> He left Parliament at the time of the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], against the advice of both his wife Sue and fellow maverick M.P [[Tam Dalyell]].\n\n==1974-1989==\nThe Scottish estate project failed and Mitchell became unemployed. He later stated that giving up his seat in Parliament had been a disastrous mistake. Mitchell spent much of the next 10 years trying to get back into Parliament. He applied to several constituency Conservative Associations, including [[Bournemouth East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bournemouth East]] in August 1977, but at every selection interview the question was raised as to why he had given up Aberdeenshire West in 1974. No winnable constituency would adopt him.<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 25 August 1977</ref> He remained on the fringes of Conservative Party politics, ''The Times'' Diary columnist reporting on a meeting of the Monday Club at the 1976 Conservative Party conference where he had made a speech on the subject of Rhodesia:<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 8 October 1976</ref>\n\n{{cquote|I went to mock, but came away with much sympathy for Mitchell personally rather than for the lost cause he espouses. He is quite at odds with the world in which he finds himself}}\n\nDuring this period Mitchell remained sporadically active in a series of consultancies, mostly of a military or security nature. He is known to have provided services to backers of the [[Mujahideen]] insurgents in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Contras|Contra]] rebels in [[Nicaragua]].<ref>New York Times :[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/27/world/colin-mitchell-is-dead-at-70-british-hero-in-aden-battles.html Mitchell's 1996 obituary]</ref> In November 1980, Mitchell praised the Mujahideen as \"gallant fighters... expressing themselves, as Afghans know best, in the romantic tradition of sniping, raiding and brigandry.\" He urged Western leaders to provide them with military training and equipment, and to select \"proven guerilla fighters\" from their ranks for training as future leaders of Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite news|first=Colin|last=Mitchell|title=Aid for Afghan resistance|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=29 November 1980|page=13|issue=60789}}</ref> However, Mitchell became increasingly dissatisfied with his situation.<ref name=\"The Times, 24 July 1996\"/>\n\n{{cquote|At times his disappointment showed and it amounted to bitterness. He turned angrily against the media, which he had used so brilliantly... and against old friends who had tried to help him in difficult times. Once a popular member of the Garrick Club, he avoided it for years, finally stopping his subscription.}}\n\n==The Halo Trust==\nIn 1989, Mitchell took a leading role in the [[Halo Trust]] (the hazardous areas life-support organization). This non-profit making organization undertook de-mining operations in former war zones. It employed a core of (mostly British and Commonwealth) de-mining experts and a large number of locally recruited and trained personnel.

It raised his public profile once again, and in a manner that was both positive and uncontroversial.\n\n==Death==\nMitchell died in his 71st year on 20 July 1996 at [[Westminster]] in London, after a short illness. His obituary in ''[[The Independent]]'' was written by his friend the Labour MP [[Tam Dalyell]]. Dalyell stated :\n\n{{cquote|In the course of my last conversation with him in 1995 Mitchell said that in perspective the \"Mad Mitch\" image had ruined his prospects of a serious senior military career, and had deprived him of being taken seriously as a politician ...}}\n\n==Personal life==\nMitchell married Jean Hamilton (Sue) Phillips in April 1956. Phillips was the daughter of Wing Commander Stephen Phillips, R.A.F., and was a native of Meikleour, Perthshire. The couple had three children (2 sons and 1 daughter), the youngest of whom (Colina) was born in 1965. Their son, Dr. Angus Mitchell, is a noted authority on the life of Irish revolutionary [[Roger Casement]].<ref>Irish democrat :[http://www.irishdemocrat.co.uk/greaves-summer-school/2006-greaves-summer-school/ see 5th image]</ref>  One observer later described Phillips as: \"his marvellous wife ... who backed him through thick and thin - mostly thin\".<ref>''[[The Independent]]'' obituary :[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960724/ai_n14059912/pg_1 Lt-Col Colin Mitchell, by Tam Dalyell - 24 July 1996]</ref>\n\n==References==\nThe two major sources for the article are ''Having Been a Soldier'' (Mitchell's autobiography) London: Hamilton, 1969. {{ISBN|0-241-01722-X}}, and from Tam Dalyell's long obituary [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary--ltcol-colin-mitchell-1330247.html] of Mitchell published in ''[[The Independent]]'' on 24 July 1996.\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Colin Campbell Mitchell}}\n* Army History [https://web.archive.org/web/20071210113504/http://www.argylls1945to1971.co.uk/index.html The Argylls, 1945 to 1971]\n* 700 [[Glengarry|Glengarried]] Men :[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220801/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Aden/700.htm The Argylls' 1967 tour of duty in Aden]\n* BBC report, 1 December 2007:[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7120629.stm a return to Aden without Mad Mitch]\n* Army History  [http://www.argylls1945to1971.co.uk/A_and_SH_Aden1967.htm Argylls in Aden]\n* \"Tartan kitsch\" {{YouTube|ex4J6X8kIts|The Barren Rocks of Aden}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{succession box\n  | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Aberdeenshire West (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeenshire West]]\n  | years  = [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]\u2013[[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|Feb 1974]]\n  | before = [[James Davidson (UK politician)|James Davidson]]\n  | after  = [[Russell Fairgrieve]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{good article}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mitchell, Colin}}\n[[Category:Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders officers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:British military personnel of the Aden Emergency]]\n[[Category:British military personnel of the Cyprus Emergency]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of the Korean War]]\n[[Category:British military personnel of the Palestine Emergency]]\n[[Category:Scottish Conservative Party MPs]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies]]\n[[Category:People educated at Whitgift School]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974]]\n[[Category:1925 births]]\n[[Category:1996 deaths]]\n[[Category:King's African Rifles officers]]\n[[Category:Graduates of the Staff College, Camberley]]\n[[Category:People from Croydon]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: Subsequently \u2192 Subsequently,, \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Mitchell"}

The Allies consisted of [[British Empire|British Imperial Forces]], including a [[Sacred Band (World War II)|Greek contingent]], with [[United States|American]] and [[Military history of France during World War II|French corps]]. The battle opened with initial success by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italian]] forces but the massive supply interdiction efforts  led to the decisive defeat of the Axis. Over 250,000 [[Wehrmacht|German]] and [[Royal Italian Army during World War II|Italian]] troops were taken as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], including most of the [[Afrika Korps]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Western Desert===\nThe first two years of the [[North African campaign|war in North Africa]] were characterized by chronic supply shortages and transport problems. The North African coast has few natural harbors and the British base at [[Alexandria]] on the [[Nile]] delta was some {{convert|1300|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} by road from the main Italian port at [[Tripoli]] in Libya. Smaller ports at [[Benghazi]] and [[Tobruk]] were {{convert|650|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} and {{convert|400|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} west of Alexandria on the [[Litoranea Balbo]] (Via Balbia) running along a narrow corridor along the coast. Control of the central [[Mediterranean]] was contested by the British and Italian navies, which were equally matched and exerted a reciprocal constraint supply through Alexandria, Tripoli, Benghazi and Tobruk, although the British could supply Egypt via the long route through the Atlantic around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and by the [[Indian Ocean]] into the [[Red Sea]].\n\nThe chronic difficulty in the  supply of military forces in the desert led to several indecisive victories by both sides and long fruitless advances along the coast. The [[Italian invasion of Egypt]] by the [[Tenth Army (Italy)|10th Army]] in 1940, advanced {{convert|60|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} into Egypt and more than {{convert|1000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} in a straight line from Tripoli, {{convert|370|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from Benghazi and {{convert|200|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from Tobruk. The [[Western Desert Force]] (WDF) fought a delaying action as it fell back to Mersa Matruh (Matruh), then began [[Operation Compass]], a raid and counter-attack into Libya. The 10th Army was destroyed and the WDF occupied El Agheila, some {{convert|600|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from Alexandria. With the arrival of the German [[Afrika Korps]], the Axis counter-attacked in [[Operation Sonnenblume]] and in April 1941 reached the limit of their supply capacity at the Egyptian border but failed to recapture Tobruk.\n\nIn November 1941 the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] recovered, helped by the short supply distance from Alexandria to the front line and launched [[Operation Crusader]], relieving the [[Siege of Tobruk]] and again reached El Agheila. The Eighth Army was soon pushed back to Gazala west of Tobruk and at the [[Battle of Gazala]] in May 1942, the Axis [[First Battle of El Alamein|pushed them all the way back to El Alamein]], only {{convert|100|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from Alexandria. In 1942, the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Italian Navy]] were still disputing the Mediterranean but the British hold on [[Malta]] allowed the [[Royal Air Force]] to sink more Italian supply ships. Large quantities of supplies became available to the British from the United States and the supply situation of the Eighth Army eventually resolved. With the Eighth Army no longer constrained, the Axis were driven westwards from [[Egypt]] following the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in November 1942.\n\n===Operation Torch===\n{{Main article|Operation Torch}}\n[[File:Near Algiers, \"Torch\" troops hit the beaches behind a large American flag \"Left\" hoping for the French Army not fire... - NARA - 195516.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|American troops land on an Algerian beach during [[Operation Torch]].]]\nIn July 1942, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] discussed relatively small-scale [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]] to land in northern France during 1942 ([[Operation Sledgehammer]], which was the forerunner of [[Operation Roundup (1942)|Operation Roundup]], the main landings in 1943), but agreed that these operations were impractical and should be deferred.<ref>Playfair, p. 111.</ref> Instead it was agreed that landings would be made to secure the Vichy territories in North Africa ([[Morocco]], [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]]) and then to thrust east to take the Axis forces in the Western Desert in their rear.<ref>Playfair, p. 114.</ref> An Allied occupation of the whole of the North African coast would open the Mediterranean to Allied shipping, releasing the huge capacity required to maintain supplies around the circuitous route via the Cape of Good Hope. On 8 November, [[Operation Torch]] landed Allied forces in Algeria (at Oran and Algiers) and Morocco (at Casablanca) with the intention that once Vichy forces in Algeria had capitulated, an advance would be made to Tunis some {{convert|500|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the east.\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Allied plans===\n\nBecause of the nearness of Sicily to Tunisia, the Allies expected that the Axis would move to occupy the country as soon as they heard of the Torch landings.<ref>Playfair, pp. 151\u2013152.</ref> To forestall this, it would be necessary to occupy Tunisia as quickly as possible after the landings were made. However, there was a limit to how far east the Torch landings could be made because of the increasing proximity of Axis airfields in Sicily and Sardinia which at the end of October held 298&nbsp;German and 574&nbsp;Italian aircraft.<ref>Playfair, p. 116.</ref> Algiers was accordingly chosen for the most easterly landings. This would ensure the success of the initial landings in spite of uncertainty as to how the incumbent French forces would react. Once Algiers was secured, a small force, the Eastern Task Force, would be projected as quickly as possible into Tunisia in a race to occupy Tunis, some {{Convert|500|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} distant along poor roads in difficult terrain during the winter rainy season, before the Axis could organise.<ref>Playfair, pp. 117\u2013118.</ref>\n\nHowever, planners had to assume the worst case regarding the extent of Vichy opposition at Algiers and the invasion convoys were assault-loaded with a preponderance of infantry to meet heavy ground opposition. This meant that at Algiers the disembarkation of mobile forces for an advance to Tunisia would necessarily be delayed.<ref>Hinsley, pp. 472\u2013473</ref> Plans were thus a compromise and the Allies realised that an attempt to reach Bizerte and Tunis overland before the Axis could establish themselves represented a gamble which depended on the ability of the navy and air force to delay the Axis build-up.<ref name=\"Playfair239\">Playfair, p. 239.</ref> The Allies, although they had provided for the possibility of strong Vichy opposition to their landings both in terms of infantry and air force allocations, seriously underestimated the Axis appetite for and speed of intervention in Tunisia.<ref>Hinsley, p. 487</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-784-0208-17A, Nordafrika, italienische Panzer.2.jpg|thumb|Italian Semovente 75/18]]\nOnce operations had commenced and despite clear intelligence reports regarding the Axis reaction, the Allies were slow to respond and it was not until nearly two weeks after the landings that air and naval plans were made to interdict Axis sea transport to Tunis.<ref>Hinsley, p. 493</ref> At the end of November, naval [[Force K]] was reformed in Malta with three cruisers and four destroyers and Force Q formed in B\u00f4ne with three cruisers and two destroyers. No Axis ships sailing to Tunis were sunk in November but the Allied naval forces had some success in early December sinking seven Axis transports. However, this came too late to affect the fighting on land because the armoured elements of 10th ''Panzer'' Division had already arrived. To counter the surface threat, Axis convoys were switched to daylight when they could be protected by air cover. Night convoys resumed on completion of the extension of Axis minefields which severely restricted the activities of Force K and Force Q.<ref>Hinsley, pp. 495\u2013496</ref>\n\n===Tunisia===\n[[File:Tunisia1942-1943.svg|thumb|Sketch map of Tunisia during the 1942\u20131943 campaign]]\nTunisia is rectangular, with its northern and much of its eastern boundary on the Mediterranean coast. Most of the inland western border with Algeria is astride the eastern line of the [[Atlas Mountains]] which run from the Atlantic coast of Morocco, {{convert|1200|mi|km|order=flip}} east to Tunis. This portion of the border is easily defensible at the small number of passes through the two north\u2013south lines of the mountains. In the south a lower range of mountains limit the approaches to a narrow gap, facing Libya to the east, between the [[Matmata Hills]] and the coast. The French had earlier constructed a {{convert|20|km|mi}} wide and {{convert|30|km|mi}} deep series of defensive works known as the [[Mareth Line]] along the plain, to defend against an Italian invasion from Libya.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=117}}\n\nOnly in the north was the terrain favourable to attack; here the Atlas Mountains stopped near the eastern coast, leaving a large area on the north-west coast unprotected. Defensive lines in the north could deal with approaching forces, while the Mareth Line made the south secure. In between, there were only a few easily defended passes through the Atlas Mountains.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=117\u2013119}} Tunisia has two big deep water ports at [[Tunis]] and [[Bizerte]], only a few hundred miles from Italian supply bases in [[Sicily]]. Ships could deliver supplies at night, safe from RAF patrols and return the next night, while Libya was a full-day trip, making supply operations vulnerable to daylight air attacks. In [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s view, Tunisia could be held indefinitely, upsetting Allied plans in Europe.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=171}}\n\n==Run for Tunis==\n{{Main article|Run for Tunis}}\n[[File:Tunisia25Novto10Dec1942.jpg|thumb|upright|Tunisia campaign operations 25 November to 10 December 1942]]\nBy 10 November, French opposition to the ''Torch'' landings had ceased, creating a military vacuum in Tunisia.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=2}} The [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] (Lieutenant-General [[Kenneth Arthur Noel Anderson|Kenneth Anderson]]) was immediately ordered to send the [[36th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|36th Infantry Brigade Group]], which had been the floating reserve for the Algiers landing, eastward by sea to occupy the Algerian ports of Bougie, Philippeville, and B\u00f4ne and the airfield at Djedjelli, preliminary to advancing into Tunisia. The Combined Chiefs of Staff had decided that with the forces available, ''Torch'' would not include landings close to Tunisia. Anderson needed to get his limited force east quickly, before the Axis could reinforce Tunisia, but the Allies had only two brigade groups and some additional armour and artillery for the attack.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=2}}{{refn|After the event, Anderson and Cunningham, the naval commander, expressed the view that without landings east of Algiers, the race for [[Tunis]] was lost before it started.<ref>Hinsley, p. 492</ref> Eisenhower, when accepting the Combined Chiefs' ruling, pointed out that the decision not to land east of Algiers removed the early capture of Tunis \"from the realm of the probable to the remotely possible\".<ref>Eisenhower, p. 90</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nThe French governor in Tunisia, [[:fr:Jean-Pierre Esteva|Admiral Esteva]], was afraid to support the Allies or oppose the Axis. He did not close airfields to either side; the Germans moved first and by 9 November, there were reports of 40 German aircraft arriving at Tunis and by 10 November, aerial reconnaissance reported 100&nbsp;aircraft.<ref>Playfair, p. 152.</ref> Two days later, an airlift began that carried over 15,000&nbsp;men and {{convert|581|LT|t}} of supplies and ships brought 176 tanks, 131 artillery pieces, 1,152 vehicles and {{convert|13000|LT|t}} of supplies. By the end of the month, three German divisions, including the [[German 10th Panzer Division|10th Panzer Division]], and two Italian infantry divisions had arrived. [[Walther Nehring]] took command of the new XC Corps on 12 November and arrived on 17 November. The French military commander in Tunisia, General Barr\u00e9, moved troops into the western mountains of Tunisia and formed a defensive line from Tebersouk through [[Majaz al Bab]] (Medjez el Bab).<ref name=\"Watson60\">Watson (2007), p. 60</ref>\n\nThere were two roads eastwards into Tunisia from Algeria. The Allied plan was to advance along the two roads and take Bizerte and Tunis. On 11 November, the British 36th Infantry Brigade had landed unopposed at Bougie but supply shortages delayed their arrival at Djedjelli until 13 November.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=2}} B\u00f4ne airfield was occupied following a parachute drop by 3rd Parachute Battalion and this was followed by 6 Commando seizing the port on 12 November. Advanced guards of the 36th Infantry Brigade reached Tebarka on 15 November and Djebel Abiod on 18 November, where they met Axis forces. Further south, on 15 November, a US parachute battalion made an unopposed drop at Youks-les-Bains, capturing the airfield and advanced to take the airfield at Gafsa on 17 November.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|pp=4\u20136}}\n\nOn 19 November Nehring demanded passage for his forces across the bridge at Medjez and was refused by Barr\u00e9. The Germans attacked twice and were repulsed, but the French defensive success was costly, and lacking armour and artillery, the French had to withdraw.<ref name=\"Watson60\"/>{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=6}} Some Vichy French forces, such as Barr\u00e9's, joined the Allies. But the attitude of Vichy forces remained uncertain until on 22 November, when the \"Darlan Deal\" placed French North Africa on the Allied side. This allowed US and British forces that had been securing Algeria to go to the front. By this time, the Axis had deployed a corps in Tunisia and outnumbered the Allies there in almost all ways.\n\n[[File:SC167334t.jpg|thumb|US crew of an [[M3 Lee]] tank at Souk el Arba, 23 November 1942]]\n<!-- [[501st heavy tank battalion (Germany)]] links here, please do not change the section title without re-linking -->\nTwo Allied brigade groups advanced toward Djebel Abiod and B\u00e9ja respectively. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', happy to have local air superiority while Allied planes had to fly from relatively distant bases in Algeria, harassed them all the way.<ref>Ford (1999), p. 17</ref> On 17 November, the same day Nehring arrived, the leading elements of the British 36th Brigade on the northern road met a mixed force of 17 tanks and 400&nbsp;paratroops with self-propelled guns at Djebel Abiod. The German paratroopers, with Luftwaffe and Italian fire support from the [[1st Mountain Infantry Division Superga|1st Mountain Infantry Division ''Superga'']], knocked out 11&nbsp;tanks but their advance was halted while the fight at Djebel Abiod continued for nine days.<ref>Ford (1999), pp. 19\u201322</ref> On 22 November, tanks from the Italian 50th Brigade forced US paratroopers to abandon Gafsa. The two Allied columns concentrated at Djebel Abiod and B\u00e9ja, preparing for an assault on 24 November. The 36th Brigade was to advance from Djebel Abiod toward Mateur and 11th Brigade was to move down the valley of the River Merjerda to take Majaz al Bab (shown on Allied maps as Medjez el Bab or just Medjez) and then to [[Tebourba]], [[Djedeida]] and Tunis. ''Blade Force'', an armoured regimental group made up of 37mm gun Stuart light tanks and 75mm M3 GMC self propelled guns, was to strike across country on minor roads in the gap between the two infantry brigades towards Sidi Nsir and make flanking attacks on Terbourba and Djedeida.<ref>Ford (1999), p. 23</ref>\n\n[[File:Crusader Mk III tanks in Tunisia, 31 December 1942.

In the south 11th Brigade were halted by stiff resistance at Medjez. Blade Force passed through Sidi Nsir to reach the Chouigui Pass, north of Terbourba part of B Squadren Stuart's from Blade Force infiltrated behind Axis lines to the newly activated airbase at Djedeida in the afternoon and destroyed more than 20&nbsp;Axis planes but lacking infantry support, withdrew to Chouigui. The understrength tank Squadrons and three M3 GMC French 75s were to hold the pass. A mixed  unit of Mark III and Mark IV Panzers and a small Italian scouting Force, around 15 tanks all told. Frontal attacks by the GMC and Stuarts were ineffective losing 12 tanks, but allowed a rear attack by B Squadron firing into the weaker rear armour of the German tanks. The German commander, believing he had encountered a much stronger force, retreated. <ref>Ford (1999), pp. 23\u201325</ref> Blade Force's attack caught Nehring by surprise and he decided to withdraw from Medjez and strengthen Djedeida, only {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Tunis.<ref>Ford (1999), p.25</ref> The 36th Brigade's delayed attack began on 26 November but they were ambushed with the leading battalion taking 149&nbsp;casualties.<ref>Ford (1999), p.28</ref> Further attacks were driven back from cleverly planned interlocking defences.\n1 Commando landed {{convert|14|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} west of Bizerte on 30 November to outflank the Jefna position, but failed and rejoined 36th Brigade by 3 December.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=6}} The position remained in German hands until the last days of fighting in Tunisia the following spring.<ref>Ford (1999), p. 40</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-788-0009-13A, Tunesien, Fallschirmj\u00e4ger mit Gewehr u.

However, on 27 November the Germans attacked in strength. 11th Brigade tried to regain the initiative in the early hours of 28 November, attacking toward Djedeida airfield with the help of US armour, but failed.<ref>Ford (1999), pp. 37\u201338</ref> On 29 November, Combat Command B of US 1st Armored Division had concentrated forward for an attack in conjunction with Blade Force planned for 2 December. They were forestalled by an Axis counter-attack, led by Major-General [[Wolfgang Fischer]], whose [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] had just arrived in Tunisia.<ref>Watson (2007), pp. 62\u201363</ref> By the evening of 2 December, Blade Force had been withdrawn, leaving 11th Brigade and Combat Command B to deal with the Axis attack.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=6}} The attack threatened to cut off 11th Brigade and break through into the Allied rear, but desperate fighting over four days delayed the Axis advance and permitted a controlled withdrawal to the high ground on each side of the river west of Terbourba.<ref>Ford (1999), p. 50</ref>\n\nThe Allied force initially withdrew roughly {{convert|6|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the high positions of Longstop Hill (Djebel el Ahmera) and Bou Aoukaz on each side of the river. Concern over the vulnerability to flanking attacks prompted a further withdrawal west. By the end of 10 December, Allied units held a defensive line just east of Medjez el Bab. Here, they started a build up for another attack and were ready by late December 1942. The slow build up had brought Allied force levels up to a total of 54,000&nbsp;British, 73,800&nbsp;American and 7,000&nbsp;French troops. A hasty intelligence review showed about 125,000&nbsp;combat and 70,000&nbsp;service troops, mostly Italian, in front of them. The main attack began the afternoon of 22 December. Despite rain and insufficient air cover, progress was made up the lower ridges of the {{convert|900 |ft|m|adj=on}} Longstop Hill that controlled the river corridor from Medjez to Tebourba and thence to Tunis. After three days of to-and-fro fighting, with ammunition running low and Axis forces now holding adjacent high ground, the Longstop position became untenable and the Allies were forced to withdraw to Medjez,<ref>Ford (1999), pp. 53\u201354</ref> and by 26 December 1942 the Allies had withdrawn to the line they had set out from two weeks earlier, having suffered 20,743 casualties.\n\n===Aftermath===\n\n====French politics====\n[[File:Charles de Gaulle 1943 Tunisia.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|General [[Charles de Gaulle]] and General [[Charles Mast]] saluting at Tunis, Tunisia, 1943]]\nWhile the battles wound down, factionalism among the French again erupted. On 24 December, [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] was assassinated and [[Henri Giraud]] succeeded him as High Commissioner. To the frustration of the Free French, the [[Government of the United States|US government]] had displayed considerable willingness to make a deal with Darlan and the Vichyists. Consequently, Darlan's death appeared to present an opportunity to bring together the French in North Africa and [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s Free French. De Gaulle and Giraud met in late January but little progress was made in reconciling their differences or the constituencies they represented.<ref>Playfair, p. 266.</ref> It was not until June 1943 that the [[French Committee of National Liberation]] (CFLN) was formed under the joint chairmanship of Giraud and de Gaulle. De Gaulle quickly eclipsed Giraud, who openly disliked political responsibility and more or less willingly from then on deferred to the Leader of the Free French.\n\n====Command changes====\nNehring, considered by most to be an excellent commander, had continually infuriated his superiors with outspoken critiques. He was \"replaced\" when the command was renamed the [[5th Panzer Army]] and Colonel-General [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen von Arnim]] arrived in Tunis unannounced on 8 December, to assume command. The Army consisted of the composite Infantry [[Division von Broich/von Manteuffel]] in the Bizerte area, the 10th Panzer Division in the centre before Tunis and the 1st Mountain Infantry Division \"Superga\" on the southern flank, but Hitler had told Arnim that the army would grow to three mechanised and three motorised divisions.<ref>Watson (2007), p. 64</ref> The Allies had tried to prevent the Axis build up with substantial air and sea forces but Tunis and Bizerte were only {{convert|120|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from the ports and airfields of western Sicily, {{convert|180|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from Palermo and {{convert|300|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from Naples, making it very difficult to intercept Axis transports which had the benefit of substantial air cover.<ref name=\"Playfair239\"/> From mid-November 1942 to January 1943, 243,000&nbsp;men and {{convert|856000|LT|t}} of supplies and equipment arrived in Tunisia by sea and air.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-552-0822-36, Tunesien, Zugmachinen und Me 323 Gigant.jpg|thumb|German reinforcements; a [[Sd.Kfz. 8]] half-track and a tractor pull transport from a [[Messerschmitt Me 323]] ''Gigant''.]]\n\nGeneral Eisenhower transferred further units from Morocco and Algeria eastward into Tunisia. In the north, the British First Army, over the next three months, received three more British divisions, the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st]], [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th]], and [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Infantry Divisions]], joining the [[6th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|6th Armoured]] and [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th Infantry Divisions]]. By late March the British [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]] HQ ([[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[John Crocker]]) had arrived to join the British [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Charles Walter Allfrey|Charles Allfrey]]) in commanding the expanded army. On their right flank, the basis of a two-division French [[19th Army Corps (France)|XIX Corps]] (General [[Alphonse Juin]]) was assembling.<ref>Playfair, pp. 258\u2013259.</ref>\n\nIn the south was the [[II Corps (United States)|US II Corps]] ([[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Lloyd Fredendall]]), consisting of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st]] and [[34th Infantry Division (United States)|34th Infantry Divisions]] and the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] (although the 34th Division was attached to the British IX Corps to the north). Giraud refused to have the French XIX Corps under the command of the British First Army and so they, along with the US II Corps, remained under command of [[Allied Force Headquarters]] (AFHQ). New forward airfields were built to improve air support.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=7}} The Americans also began bases in Algeria and Tunisia, to form a large forward base at Maknassy, on the eastern edge of the Atlas Mountains, well placed to cut off the ''Panzerarmee'' in the south from Tunis and the Fifth Panzer Army in the north.\n\n==Kasserine==\n\n===Prelude===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-554-0872-35, Tunesien, Panzer VI (Tiger I).jpg|thumb|A German Tiger tank on the move, in Tunisia January 1943]]\nDuring the first half of January, Anderson had with mixed results kept constant pressure through limited attacks and reconnaissance in strength.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=8}} Arnim did the same and on 18 January, launched ''Unternehmen Eilbote I'' (Operation Courier I).<ref>Watson (2007), p. 67</ref> Elements of the 10th Panzer and 334th Infantry divisions attacked from Pont du Fahs to create more space in front of the ''Superga'' Division and forestall an Allied thrust east to the coast at Enfidaville, to cut Rommel's line of communication.<ref>Playfair, pp. 278\u2013279.</ref> The westward thrust against the right wing of the British V Corps at Bou Arada had little success but further south his attack against French positions around the \"hinge\" of the Western and Eastern Dorsals succeeded, advancing {{convert|35|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} south to Ousseltia and {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} south-west to Robaa. The poorly equipped defenders resisted well but were overwhelmed and the equivalent of seven infantry battalions were cut off in the mountains.<ref>Playfair, p. 279</ref> Anderson sent the 36th Brigade to Robaa and requested Lloyd Fredendall to send Combat Command B from 1st Armored Division to Ousseltia, to come under Juin's orders on arrival. Fierce fighting lasted until 23 January but the front was stabilised.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=8}}\n\n[[File:Giovanni Messe.jpg|thumb|upright|Italian General Giovanni Messe]]\nThe obvious lack of Allied co-ordination led Eisenhower to change the command structure. On 21 January Anderson was made responsible for the co-ordination of the whole front, and on 24 January his responsibilities were extended to include \"the employment of American troops\". That night, Juin accepted the command of Anderson, confirmed by Giraud the next day but with forces spread over a {{convert|200|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} front and poor communication (Anderson motored over {{convert|1000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} in four days to speak to the corps commanders) the practical difficulties remained. Eisenhower appointed an air support commander, Brigadier General [[Laurence S. Kuter]], for the whole front on 21 January.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=8}}\n\n[[Erwin Rommel]] had made plans for forces retreating through Libya to dig-in in front of the defunct French fortifications of the Mareth Line. The Axis forces would control the two natural entrances into Tunisia in the north and south, with only the easily defensible mountain passes between them. In January, those parts of the German-Italian Panzer Army on the Mareth defences were renamed First Italian Army (General [[Giovanni Messe]]), separate from the units (including the remains of the ''Afrika Korps'') he had facing the Western Dorsale. On 23 January 1943, the Eighth Army took Tripoli, by which point the army retreating through Libya was already well on its way to the Mareth position. Part of the II US Corps crossed into Tunisia through passes in the Atlas Mountains from Algeria, controlling the interior of the triangle formed by the mountains. Their position raised the possibility of a thrust eastwards towards Sfax on the coast, to cut off the First Italian Army at Mareth from  Arnim's forces to the north around Tunis. Rommel could not allow this and formed a plan for a spoiling attack.\n\n===Battle of Sidi Bou Zid===\n{{Further information|Battle of Sidi Bou Zid}}\n[[File:Tunisia30Janto10Apr1943.jpg|thumb|upright|8th Army operations, 30 January to 10 April 1943]]\nOn 30 January 1943, the German 21st Panzer and three Italian divisions from the 5th Panzer Army met elements of the French forces near Fa\u00efd, the main pass from the eastern arm of the mountains into the coastal plains. Fredendall did not respond to the French request to send reinforcements in the form of tanks from 1st Armored Division and after desperate resistance, the under-equipped French defenders were overrun.<ref name=\"Watson68\">Watson (2007), p. 68</ref> Several counterattacks were organised, including a belated attack by Combat Command B of the US 1st Armored Division but all of these were beaten off with ease by Arnim's forces which by this time had created strong defensive positions.<ref name=\"Watson68\"/> After three days, the Allied forces had been forced to pull back and were withdrawn into the interior plains to make a new forward defensive line at the small town of [[Sbeitla]].\n\nIn Operation ''Fr\u00fchlingswind'' (spring wind), Arnim ordered four armoured battle groups forward on 14 February in the area of Sidi Bou Zid held by 34th Infantry Division's 168th Regimental Combat Team and 1st Armored Division's Combat Command A. The defenders' dispositions were poor, with concentrations dispersed so that they were unable to be mutually supportive. By 15 February, CCA had been severely damaged leaving the infantry units isolated on hilltops. Combat Command C was ordered across country to relieve Sidi Bou Zid but were repelled with heavy losses. By the evening of 15 February, three of the Axis battlegroups were able to head toward Sbeitla, {{convert|20|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the northwest.<ref name=\"watson77\">Watson (2007), p.77</ref> Pushing aside the remains of CCA and CCC, the battlegroups were confronted by Combat Command B in front of Sbeitla. With the help of air support, CCB held on through the day. However, the air support could not be sustained and the defenders of Sbeitla were obliged to withdraw and the town lay empty by midday on 17 February.<ref name=\"watson77\"/>\n\nTo the south, in Operation ''Morgenluft'' (morning air), an Italian First Army battlegroup made up of the remains of the Afrika Korps under [[Karl B\u00fclowius]] had advanced toward Gafsa at dusk on 15 February to find the town deserted, part of a withdrawal to shorten the Allied front to facilitate a reorganisation involving the withdrawal of French XIX Corps in order to re-equip. II US Corps withdrew to the line of Dernaia-Kasserine-Gap-Sbiba with XIX Corps on their left flank vacating the Eastern Dorsal to conform with them.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=9}} By the afternoon of 17 February, Rommel's troops had occupied Feriana and Thelepte (roughly {{Convert|15|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} southwest of Kasserine) forcing the evacuation on the morning of 18 February of Thelepte airfield, the main air base in British First Army's southern sector.<ref>Playfair, p. 294</ref>\n\n===Battle of Kasserine Pass===\n{{Main article|Battle of Kasserine Pass}}\n[[File:Americains Kasserine.jpg|thumb|American troops moving through the Kasserine Pass]]\nAfter further discussion, the ''Comando Supremo'' issued orders on 19 February for Rommel to attack through the Kasserine and Sbiba passes toward Thala and Le Kef to threaten First Army's flank. Rommel's original proposal was for a limited but concentrated attack through Kasserine to confront II Corps' strength at T\u00e9bessa and gain vital supplies from the US dumps there. Although he was to have 10th and 21st Panzer Divisions transferred to his command, Rommel was concerned that the new plan would dilute his force concentration and expose his flanks to threat.<ref>Watson (2007), pp. 80\u201381</ref>\n\nOn 19 February 1943, Rommel, having now been given formal control of the 10th and 21st Panzer Divisions, the Afrika Korps battlegroup as well as General Messe's forces on the Mareth defences (renamed Italian First Army),<ref name=\"Watson 2007, p. 82\">Watson (2007), p. 82</ref> launched what would become the Battle of Kasserine Pass. Hoping to take the inexperienced defenders by surprise, he sent the light armour of the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion racing into the pass. Colonel Alexander Stark's ''Stark Force'', a brigade group made up of US and French units, was responsible for the defence of the pass.<ref name=\"Watson 2007, p. 82\"/> It had not had time to organise properly but was able to direct heavy artillery fire from the surrounding heights which brought the  leading mechanised units of the ''Afrika Korps'' batlegroup to a halt.<ref>Watson (2007), p. 84</ref> Before they could continue, infantry had to be sent up into the high ground seeking to eliminate the artillery threat. A battlegroup under Hans-Georg Hildebrand including tanks from 21st Panzer were advancing north from Sbeitla toward the Sbiba Gap. In front of the hills east of Sbiba they were brought to a halt by 1st Guards Brigade and 18th Regimental Combat Team which had strong field and anti-tank artillery support and were joined by two infantry regiments from 34th Infantry Division.<ref>Watson (2007), pp. 86\u201387</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-787-0510-34A, Nordafrika, feuerndes Gesch\u00fctz.jpg|thumb|Germans fire an [[88mm gun]] in Tunisia]]\n\nBy the morning of 20 February, the bitter hand-to-hand fighting in the hills above Kasserine was continuing while the ''Afrika Korps Kampfgruppe'' and a battalion from the [[131 Armoured Division Centauro]] and more artillery, prepared for another attack through the pass, once it had been joined by a 10th Panzer Division battle group from Sbeitla. The morning attack made slow progress but the intense pressure applied during the renewed attack that afternoon triggered a collapse in the Allied defences.<ref>Watson (2007), pp. 89\u201393</ref>\n\nHaving rolled through the Kasserine Pass on the afternoon of 20 February, units of the Centauro Division headed west toward T\u00e9bessa, meeting little or no resistance. Following them came the von Broich battlegroup from 10th Panzer, which forked right onto the road to Thala where they were slowed by a regimental armoured group from 26th Armoured Brigade (''Gore Force''). Their tanks outgunned, Gore Force sustained heavy losses but bought time for ''Nick Force'', a composite force from British 6th Armoured Division, based around 26th Armoured Brigade Group with extra infantry and artillery (which Anderson had ordered the previous day to leave the Kesra area to bolster the Thala defences) to prepare defensive positions further up the road. Meanwhile, Fredendall had sent 1st Armored Division's CCB to meet the threat to T\u00e9bessa.<ref>Watson (2007), p. 102</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in Tunisia 1943 NA880.jpg|thumb|Infantry and [[Universal Carrier|carriers]] of the Grenadier Guards, advance over difficult terrain near the Kasserine Pass, 24 February 1943.]]\nBy 1pm on 21 February, Battlegroup von Broich was in contact with the dug-in 26th Armoured Brigade Group on the Thala road and making slow progress. Rommel took direct control of the attack and forced the defences by 4pm.<ref>Watson (2007), p. 103</ref> However, 26th Brigade Group were able to withdraw in reasonable order to the next, final, defensive line in front of Thala. Fighting at this position started at 7pm and continued at close quarters for three hours with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. ''Nick Force'' had taken a heavy beating and did not expect to be able to hold out the next day. However, during the night a further 48 artillery pieces from US 9th Infantry Division arrived after a {{convert|800|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} trip from Morocco on poor roads and in bad weather. On the morning of 22 February, as Broich prepared to launch his attack, his front was hit by a devastating artillery barrage. Surprisingly, Rommel told Broich to regroup and assume a defensive posture, so surrendering the initiative.<ref>Watson (2007), p. 104</ref>\n\nThe 21st Panzer battlegroup at Sbiba was making no progress. Further south, the ''Afrika Korps'' battlegroup on the road to T\u00e9bessa had been halted on 21 February by CCB's armour and artillery dug in on the slopes of Djebel Hamra.<ref>Watson (2007), p. 105</ref> An attempt to outflank them during the night of 21 February was a costly failure. A further attack early on 23 February was again beaten back.<ref>Watson (2007), pp. 106\u2013107</ref> In a dispirited meeting on 22 February with Kesselring, Rommel argued that faced with stiffening defences and the news that the Eighth Army's lead elements had finally reached Medenine, only a few kilometres from the Mareth Line, he should call off the attack and withdraw to support the Mareth defences, hoping that the Kasserine attack had caused enough damage to deter any offensive action from the west. Kesselring was keen for the offensive to continue but finally agreed that evening, and ''Comando Supremo'' formally terminated the operation.<ref>Watson (2007), pp. 109\u2013110</ref> The Axis forces from Kasserine reached the Mareth line on 25 February.\n\n===Aftermath===\nAction then abated for a time and both sides studied the results of recent battles. Rommel remained convinced that US forces posed little threat, while the British and Commonwealth troops were his equal. He held this opinion for far too long, and it would prove very costly. The Americans likewise studied the battle and relieved several senior commanders while issuing several \"lessons learned\" publications to improve future performance. Most important, on 6 March 1943 command of the II US Corps passed from Fredendall to [[George S. Patton]], with [[Omar Bradley]] as assistant Corps Commander. Commanders were reminded that large units should be kept concentrated to ensure mass on the battlefield, rather than widely dispersed as Fredendall had deployed them. This had the intended side effect of improving the fire control of the already-strong US artillery. Close air support had also been weak (although this had been hampered by the generally poor weather conditions).\n\n[[File:General Alexander, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces in North Africa, discussing future operations with the Supreme Commander, General Eisenhower, in Tunisia, 26 July 1943.

Once he had been given control of the whole front at the end of January, Anderson's aim had been to reorganise the front into consolidated national sectors and create reserves with which to regain the initiative, the same priorities articulated in Alexander's orders dated 20 February.<ref name=\"Playfair304\"/><ref name=\"Playfair305\">Playfair, p. 305.</ref> On 21 February, Alexander declared his objective to destroy all enemy forces in Tunisia by first advancing Eighth Army north of Gab\u00e8s, while the First Army mounted attacks to draw off reserves which would otherwise be used against the Eighth Army. The armies would gain airfields for the Allied air forces. The co-ordinated land, sea and air power of the Allies would draw a net round the Axis forces in Tunisia by 30 April, to meet the timetable set at the Casablanca Conference to allow Sicily to be invaded during the favourable weather of August.<ref>Playfair, pp. 315\u2013316</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-787-0502-34A, Generaloberst von Arnim und General von Vaerst.jpg|thumb|Hans-J\u00fcrgen von Arnim (right) Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Africa]]\nThe Casablanca Conference had agreed to reorganise the air forces in the Mediterranean to integrate them more closely; Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Arthur Tedder]] was made commander of Mediterranean Air Command, responsible for all Allied air activity in the Mediterranean and Major General [[Carl Andrew Spaatz|Carl Spaatz]] became commander of the [[Northwest African Air Forces]] under Tedder, with responsibility for all air operations in Tunisia.<ref>Playfair, p. 271</ref> By 23 February, Air Marshal Sir [[Arthur Coningham (RAF officer)|Arthur Coningham]] had succeeded Kuter at the Allied Air Support Command, which became Northwest African Tactical Air Force under Spaatz, with the [[Desert Air Force]] supporting Eighth Army, under its operational control.\n\nConingham found that the air organisation in Tunisia was that of the Western Desert in 1941 when he had first assumed command of the Desert Air Force. The lessons of the Desert Campaign had not been used in planning for Torch, which constrained the ability of the air arm, already short of aircraft and supplies, to provide tactical support to the army during the Run for Tunis. Coningham unified the British and American operational commands and trained them in new operational practices.<ref>Playfair, pp. 307\u2013311</ref>\n\nThe Axis also created a combined command for their two armies.

On 6 March 1943, three German armoured divisions, two light divisions and nine Italian divisions launched [[Battle of Medenine|Operation Capri]], an attack southward in the direction of Medenine, the northernmost British strong point. The Axis attack was repulsed with massed artillery fire; 55 Axis tanks were knocked out. With the failure of Capri, Rommel decided that the only way to save the Axis armies would be to abandon the campaign, and on 9 March he travelled to Italy for discussions with ''Comando Supremo'' in Rome. Finding no support for his ideas, he travelled on 10 March to see [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] at his headquarters in [[Ukraine]], to try to convince him to abandon Tunisia and return the Axis armies to Europe. Hitler refused and Rommel was placed, in strict secrecy, on sick leave.

The terrain and rain however prevented the deployment of tanks, aircraft and anti-tank guns, which left the infantry isolated. A determined counter-attack by [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] and the [[136th Armoured Division Giovani Fascisti]] on 22 March, recaptured much of the [[bridgehead]]. XXX Corps prepared a new attack towards Tallouf, in which the [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Infantry Division]] (Major-General [[Francis Tuker]]) was to make a night attack on {{nowrap|23/24 March,}} around the inland end of the line.

The German tanks rolling up lead units of the US forces ran into a minefield, and US artillery and anti-tank units opened fire. The 10th Panzer Division rapidly lost 30 tanks and retreated out of the minefield. A second attack supported by infantry in the late afternoon was also repulsed, and the 10th Panzer Division retired to Gab\u00e8s. The US II Corps was unable to exploit the German failure and each attack was stopped by the 10th Panzer Division or 21st Panzer Division counter-attacks up the road from Gab\u00e8s; co-ordination of Allied air and ground forces remained unsatisfactory. The Eighth Army and the US II Corps attacked for the next week and on 28 March, the Eighth Army captured El Hamma, forcing the Axis to abandon Gab\u00e8s and retreat north towards the Fifth Panzer Army. The hills in front of the US forces were abandoned, allowing them to join the British forces in Gab\u00e8s later that day.

Weber's force was to advance in three groups: a central group moving west toward Medjez el Bab; a second to the north advancing south-west, on the route from [[Mateur]] to [[B\u00e9ja]] (which was some {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} west of Medjez) and the third group pushing west {{convert|25|mi|km}} south of Medjez.

British destroyers operating from Malta prevented marine supply, reinforcement or evacuation of Tunisia by sea ([[Operation Retribution (1943)|Operation Retribution]]). Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Cunningham]], Eisenhower's Naval Task Force commander, issued Nelsonian orders to his ships: ''\"Sink, burn, capture, destroy. Let nothing pass\"'' but very few Axis ships even attempted passage. By 18 April, after attacks by Eighth Army from the south and flanking attacks by IX Corps and French XIX Corps, the Axis forces had been pushed into a defensive line on the north-east coast of Tunis, attempting to protect their supply lines but with little hope of continuing the battle for long.\n\nAlexander planned that while II US Corps would attack on the north towards Bizerte, First Army would attack towards Tunis while Eighth Army attacked north from Enfidaville. Anderson would co-ordinate the actions of First Army and II US Corps, issuing the appropriate orders to achieve this.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=11}} Anderson's plan was for the main attack to be in the centre of the V Corps front at Medjez, confronting main Axis defences. However, IX Corps on the right would first attack north-east with, by speed of movement, the intention of getting in behind the Medjez position and disrupting their armoured reserves. II US Corps would make a double thrust: one to capture the high ground on V Corps' left flank and a second toward Bizerte.

The northward advance of Eighth Army had \"pinched out\" US II Corps' eastward facing front line, allowing the corps to be withdrawn and switched to the northern end of the Allied front. Arnim knew that an Allied offensive was imminent and launched a spoiling attack on the night of 20/21 April, between Medjez and Goubellat on the IX Corps front. The Hermann G\u00f6ring Division supported by tanks from 10th Panzer Division penetrated up to {{convert|5|mi|km}} at some points but could not force a general withdrawal and eventually returned to their lines.

The battle had drawn the Axis reserves of armour south, away from the central front. Seeing that no further progress was likely, Anderson withdrew the 6th Armoured Division and most of the 46th Infantry Division into army reserve.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=12}} The V Corps attack began on the evening of 22 April and the US II Corps launched their offensive in the early hours of 23 April in the [[Battle of Hill 609]], in which the hill was captured, which opened the way to Bizerte.

General Alexander gave Montgomery a holding task and transferred the British [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]], the [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Infantry Division]] and the [[22nd Guards Brigade|201st Guards Motor Brigade]] from the Eighth Army to the First Army, joining the British 1st Armoured Division which had been transferred before the main offensive.<ref>Mead, p. 44</ref>\n\nThe redeployments were complete by the night of 5 May; Anderson had arranged for a dummy concentration of tanks near Bou Arada on the IX Corps front, to deflect attention from the arrival of the 7th Armoured Division in the Medjez sector and achieved a considerable measure of surprise as to the size of the armoured force when the attack began.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=13}} The final assault was launched at 3:30&nbsp;a.m. on 6 May by IX Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks]] who had taken over from Lieutenant-General John Crocker, who had been wounded. V Corps, under Lieutenant-General [[Charles Walter Allfrey]], had made a preliminary attack on 5 May, to capture high ground and secure the left flank of IX Corps. The 4th British and 4th Indian Divisions, concentrated on a narrow front and supported by heavy artillery concentrations, broke a hole in the defences for the 6th and 7th Armoured divisions to pass through.

The Allies consisted of [[British Empire|British Imperial Forces]], including a [[Sacred Band (World War II)|Greek contingents]], with [[United States|American]] and [[Military history of France during World War II|French corps]]. The battle opened with initial success by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Italian]] forces but the massive supply interdiction efforts  led to the decisive defeat of the Axis. Over 250,000 [[Wehrmacht|German]] and [[Royal Italian Army during World War II|Italian]] troops were taken as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], including most of the [[Afrika Korps]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Western Desert===\nThe first two years of the [[North African campaign|war in North Africa]] were characterized by chronic supply shortages and transport problems. The North African coast has few natural harbors and the British base at [[Alexandria]] on the [[Nile]] delta was some {{convert|1300|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} by road from the main Italian port at [[Tripoli]] in Libya. Smaller ports at [[Benghazi]] and [[Tobruk]] were {{convert|650|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} and {{convert|400|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} west of Alexandria on the [[Litoranea Balbo]] (Via Balbia) running along a narrow corridor along the coast. Control of the central [[Mediterranean]] was contested by the British and Italian navies, which were equally matched and exerted a reciprocal constraint supply through Alexandria, Tripoli, Benghazi and Tobruk, although the British could supply Egypt via the long route through the Atlantic around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and by the [[Indian Ocean]] into the [[Red Sea]].\n\nThe chronic difficulty in the  supply of military forces in the desert led to several indecisive victories by both sides and long fruitless advances along the coast. The [[Italian invasion of Egypt]] by the [[Tenth Army (Italy)|10th Army]] in 1940, advanced {{convert|60|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} into Egypt and more than {{convert|1000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} in a straight line from Tripoli, {{convert|370|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from Benghazi and {{convert|200|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from Tobruk. The [[Western Desert Force]] (WDF) fought a delaying action as it fell back to Mersa Matruh (Matruh), then began [[Operation Compass]], a raid and counter-attack into Libya. The 10th Army was destroyed and the WDF occupied El Agheila, some {{convert|600|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from Alexandria. With the arrival of the German [[Afrika Korps]], the Axis counter-attacked in [[Operation Sonnenblume]] and in April 1941 reached the limit of their supply capacity at the Egyptian border but failed to recapture Tobruk.\n\nIn November 1941 the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] recovered, helped by the short supply distance from Alexandria to the front line and launched [[Operation Crusader]], relieving the [[Siege of Tobruk]] and again reached El Agheila. The Eighth Army was soon pushed back to Gazala west of Tobruk and at the [[Battle of Gazala]] in May 1942, the Axis [[First Battle of El Alamein|pushed them all the way back to El Alamein]], only {{convert|100|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from Alexandria. In 1942, the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Italian Navy]] were still disputing the Mediterranean but the British hold on [[Malta]] allowed the [[Royal Air Force]] to sink more Italian supply ships. Large quantities of supplies became available to the British from the United States and the supply situation of the Eighth Army eventually resolved. With the Eighth Army no longer constrained, the Axis were driven westwards from [[Egypt]] following the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] in November 1942.\n\n===Operation Torch===\n{{Main article|Operation Torch}}\n[[File:Near Algiers, \"Torch\" troops hit the beaches behind a large American flag \"Left\" hoping for the French Army not fire... - NARA - 195516.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|American troops land on an Algerian beach during [[Operation Torch]].]]\nIn July 1942, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] discussed relatively small-scale [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious operations]] to land in northern France during 1942 ([[Operation Sledgehammer]], which was the forerunner of [[Operation Roundup (1942)|Operation Roundup]], the main landings in 1943), but agreed that these operations were impractical and should be deferred.<ref>Playfair, p. 111.</ref> Instead it was agreed that landings would be made to secure the Vichy territories in North Africa ([[Morocco]], [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]]) and then to thrust east to take the Axis forces in the Western Desert in their rear.<ref>Playfair, p. 114.</ref> An Allied occupation of the whole of the North African coast would open the Mediterranean to Allied shipping, releasing the huge capacity required to maintain supplies around the circuitous route via the Cape of Good Hope. On 8 November, [[Operation Torch]] landed Allied forces in Algeria (at Oran and Algiers) and Morocco (at Casablanca) with the intention that once Vichy forces in Algeria had capitulated, an advance would be made to Tunis some {{convert|500|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the east.\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Allied plans===\n\nBecause of the nearness of Sicily to Tunisia, the Allies expected that the Axis would move to occupy the country as soon as they heard of the Torch landings.<ref>Playfair, pp. 151\u2013152.</ref> To forestall this, it would be necessary to occupy Tunisia as quickly as possible after the landings were made. However, there was a limit to how far east the Torch landings could be made because of the increasing proximity of Axis airfields in Sicily and Sardinia which at the end of October held 298&nbsp;German and 574&nbsp;Italian aircraft.<ref>Playfair, p. 116.</ref> Algiers was accordingly chosen for the most easterly landings. This would ensure the success of the initial landings in spite of uncertainty as to how the incumbent French forces would react. Once Algiers was secured, a small force, the Eastern Task Force, would be projected as quickly as possible into Tunisia in a race to occupy Tunis, some {{Convert|500|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} distant along poor roads in difficult terrain during the winter rainy season, before the Axis could organise.<ref>Playfair, pp. 117\u2013118.</ref>\n\nHowever, planners had to assume the worst case regarding the extent of Vichy opposition at Algiers and the invasion convoys were assault-loaded with a preponderance of infantry to meet heavy ground opposition. This meant that at Algiers the disembarkation of mobile forces for an advance to Tunisia would necessarily be delayed.<ref>Hinsley, pp. 472\u2013473</ref> Plans were thus a compromise and the Allies realised that an attempt to reach Bizerte and Tunis overland before the Axis could establish themselves represented a gamble which depended on the ability of the navy and air force to delay the Axis build-up.<ref name=\"Playfair239\">Playfair, p. 239.</ref> The Allies, although they had provided for the possibility of strong Vichy opposition to their landings both in terms of infantry and air force allocations, seriously underestimated the Axis appetite for and speed of intervention in Tunisia.<ref>Hinsley, p. 487</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-784-0208-17A, Nordafrika, italienische Panzer.2.jpg|thumb|Italian Semovente 75/18]]\nOnce operations had commenced and despite clear intelligence reports regarding the Axis reaction, the Allies were slow to respond and it was not until nearly two weeks after the landings that air and naval plans were made to interdict Axis sea transport to Tunis.<ref>Hinsley, p. 493</ref> At the end of November, naval [[Force K]] was reformed in Malta with three cruisers and four destroyers and Force Q formed in B\u00f4ne with three cruisers and two destroyers. No Axis ships sailing to Tunis were sunk in November but the Allied naval forces had some success in early December sinking seven Axis transports. However, this came too late to affect the fighting on land because the armoured elements of 10th ''Panzer'' Division had already arrived. To counter the surface threat, Axis convoys were switched to daylight when they could be protected by air cover. Night convoys resumed on completion of the extension of Axis minefields which severely restricted the activities of Force K and Force Q.<ref>Hinsley, pp. 495\u2013496</ref>\n\n===Tunisia===\n[[File:Tunisia1942-1943.svg|thumb|Sketch map of Tunisia during the 1942\u20131943 campaign]]\nTunisia is rectangular, with its northern and much of its eastern boundary on the Mediterranean coast. Most of the inland western border with Algeria is astride the eastern line of the [[Atlas Mountains]] which run from the Atlantic coast of Morocco, {{convert|1200|mi|km|order=flip}} east to Tunis. This portion of the border is easily defensible at the small number of passes through the two north\u2013south lines of the mountains. In the south a lower range of mountains limit the approaches to a narrow gap, facing Libya to the east, between the [[Matmata Hills]] and the coast. The French had earlier constructed a {{convert|20|km|mi}} wide and {{convert|30|km|mi}} deep series of defensive works known as the [[Mareth Line]] along the plain, to defend against an Italian invasion from Libya.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=117}}\n\nOnly in the north was the terrain favourable to attack; here the Atlas Mountains stopped near the eastern coast, leaving a large area on the north-west coast unprotected. Defensive lines in the north could deal with approaching forces, while the Mareth Line made the south secure. In between, there were only a few easily defended passes through the Atlas Mountains.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=117\u2013119}} Tunisia has two big deep water ports at [[Tunis]] and [[Bizerte]], only a few hundred miles from Italian supply bases in [[Sicily]]. Ships could deliver supplies at night, safe from RAF patrols and return the next night, while Libya was a full-day trip, making supply operations vulnerable to daylight air attacks. In [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s view, Tunisia could be held indefinitely, upsetting Allied plans in Europe.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=171}}\n\n==Run for Tunis==\n{{Main article|Run for Tunis}}\n[[File:Tunisia25Novto10Dec1942.jpg|thumb|upright|Tunisia campaign operations 25 November to 10 December 1942]]\nBy 10 November, French opposition to the ''Torch'' landings had ceased, creating a military vacuum in Tunisia.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=2}} The [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] (Lieutenant-General [[Kenneth Arthur Noel Anderson|Kenneth Anderson]]) was immediately ordered to send the [[36th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|36th Infantry Brigade Group]], which had been the floating reserve for the Algiers landing, eastward by sea to occupy the Algerian ports of Bougie, Philippeville, and B\u00f4ne and the airfield at Djedjelli, preliminary to advancing into Tunisia. The Combined Chiefs of Staff had decided that with the forces available, ''Torch'' would not include landings close to Tunisia.

The 36th Brigade was to advance from Djebel Abiod toward Mateur and 11th Brigade was to move down the valley of the River Merjerda to take Majaz al Bab (shown on Allied maps as Medjez el Bab or just Medjez) and then to [[Tebourba]], [[Djedeida]] and Tunis. ''Blade Force'', an armoured regimental group made up of 37mm gun Stuart light tanks and 75mm M3 GMC self propelled guns, was to strike across country on minor roads in the gap between the two infantry brigades towards Sidi Nsir and make flanking attacks on Terbourba and Djedeida.<ref>Ford (1999), p. 23</ref>\n\n[[File:Crusader Mk III tanks in Tunisia, 31 December 1942.

Concern over the vulnerability to flanking attacks prompted a further withdrawal west. By the end of 10 December, Allied units held a defensive line just east of Medjez el Bab. Here, they started a build up for another attack and were ready by late December 1942. The slow build up had brought Allied force levels up to a total of 54,000&nbsp;British, 73,800&nbsp;American and 7,000&nbsp;French troops. A hasty intelligence review showed about 125,000&nbsp;combat and 70,000&nbsp;service troops, mostly Italian, in front of them. The main attack began the afternoon of 22 December. Despite rain and insufficient air cover, progress was made up the lower ridges of the {{convert|900 |ft|m|adj=on}} Longstop Hill that controlled the river corridor from Medjez to Tebourba and thence to Tunis. After three days of to-and-fro fighting, with ammunition running low and Axis forces now holding adjacent high ground, the Longstop position became untenable and the Allies were forced to withdraw to Medjez,<ref>Ford (1999), pp. 53\u201354</ref> and by 26 December 1942 the Allies had withdrawn to the line they had set out from two weeks earlier, having suffered 20,743 casualties.\n\n===Aftermath===\n\n====French politics====\n[[File:Charles de Gaulle 1943 Tunisia.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|General [[Charles de Gaulle]] and General [[Charles Mast]] saluting at Tunis, Tunisia, 1943]]\nWhile the battles wound down, factionalism among the French again erupted. On 24 December, [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] was assassinated and [[Henri Giraud]] succeeded him as High Commissioner. To the frustration of the Free French, the [[Government of the United States|US government]] had displayed considerable willingness to make a deal with Darlan and the Vichyists. Consequently, Darlan's death appeared to present an opportunity to bring together the French in North Africa and [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s Free French. De Gaulle and Giraud met in late January but little progress was made in reconciling their differences or the constituencies they represented.<ref>Playfair, p. 266.</ref> It was not until June 1943 that the [[French Committee of National Liberation]] (CFLN) was formed under the joint chairmanship of Giraud and de Gaulle. De Gaulle quickly eclipsed Giraud, who openly disliked political responsibility and more or less willingly from then on deferred to the Leader of the Free French.\n\n====Command changes====\nNehring, considered by most to be an excellent commander, had continually infuriated his superiors with outspoken critiques. He was \"replaced\" when the command was renamed the [[5th Panzer Army]] and Colonel-General [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen von Arnim]] arrived in Tunis unannounced on 8 December, to assume command. The Army consisted of the composite Infantry [[Division von Broich/von Manteuffel]] in the Bizerte area, the 10th Panzer Division in the centre before Tunis and the 1st Mountain Infantry Division \"Superga\" on the southern flank, but Hitler had told Arnim that the army would grow to three mechanised and three motorised divisions.<ref>Watson (2007), p. 64</ref> The Allies had tried to prevent the Axis build up with substantial air and sea forces but Tunis and Bizerte were only {{convert|120|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from the ports and airfields of western Sicily, {{convert|180|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from Palermo and {{convert|300|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from Naples, making it very difficult to intercept Axis transports which had the benefit of substantial air cover.<ref name=\"Playfair239\"/> From mid-November 1942 to January 1943, 243,000&nbsp;men and {{convert|856000|LT|t}} of supplies and equipment arrived in Tunisia by sea and air.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-552-0822-36, Tunesien, Zugmachinen und Me 323 Gigant.jpg|thumb|German reinforcements; a [[Sd.Kfz. 8]] half-track and a tractor pull transport from a [[Messerschmitt Me 323]] ''Gigant''.]]\n\nGeneral Eisenhower transferred further units from Morocco and Algeria eastward into Tunisia. In the north, the British First Army, over the next three months, received three more British divisions, the [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|1st]], [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th]], and [[46th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|46th Infantry Divisions]], joining the [[6th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|6th Armoured]] and [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th Infantry Divisions]]. By late March the British [[IX Corps (United Kingdom)|IX Corps]] HQ ([[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[John Crocker]]) had arrived to join the British [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Charles Walter Allfrey|Charles Allfrey]]) in commanding the expanded army.

Giraud refused to have the French XIX Corps under the command of the British First Army and so they, along with the US II Corps, remained under command of [[Allied Force Headquarters]] (AFHQ). New forward airfields were built to improve air support.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=7}} The Americans also began bases in Algeria and Tunisia, to form a large forward base at Maknassy, on the eastern edge of the Atlas Mountains, well placed to cut off the ''Panzerarmee'' in the south from Tunis and the Fifth Panzer Army in the north.\n\n==Kasserine==\n\n===Prelude===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-554-0872-35, Tunesien, Panzer VI (Tiger I).jpg|thumb|A German Tiger tank on the move, in Tunisia January 1943]]\nDuring the first half of January, Anderson had with mixed results kept constant pressure through limited attacks and reconnaissance in strength.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=8}} Arnim did the same and on 18 January, launched ''Unternehmen Eilbote I'' (Operation Courier I).<ref>Watson (2007), p. 67</ref> Elements of the 10th Panzer and 334th Infantry divisions attacked from Pont du Fahs to create more space in front of the ''Superga'' Division and forestall an Allied thrust east to the coast at Enfidaville, to cut Rommel's line of communication.<ref>Playfair, pp. 278\u2013279.</ref> The westward thrust against the right wing of the British V Corps at Bou Arada had little success but further south his attack against French positions around the \"hinge\" of the Western and Eastern Dorsals succeeded, advancing {{convert|35|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} south to Ousseltia and {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} south-west to Robaa.

Fierce fighting lasted until 23 January but the front was stabilised.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=8}}\n\n[[File:Giovanni Messe.jpg|thumb|upright|Italian General Giovanni Messe]]\nThe obvious lack of Allied co-ordination led Eisenhower to change the command structure. On 21 January Anderson was made responsible for the co-ordination of the whole front, and on 24 January his responsibilities were extended to include \"the employment of American troops\". That night, Juin accepted the command of Anderson, confirmed by Giraud the next day but with forces spread over a {{convert|200|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} front and poor communication (Anderson motored over {{convert|1000|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} in four days to speak to the corps commanders) the practical difficulties remained. Eisenhower appointed an air support commander, Brigadier General [[Laurence S. Kuter]], for the whole front on 21 January.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=8}}\n\n[[Erwin Rommel]] had made plans for forces retreating through Libya to dig-in in front of the defunct French fortifications of the Mareth Line. The Axis forces would control the two natural entrances into Tunisia in the north and south, with only the easily defensible mountain passes between them. In January, those parts of the German-Italian Panzer Army on the Mareth defences were renamed First Italian Army (General [[Giovanni Messe]]), separate from the units (including the remains of the ''Afrika Korps'') he had facing the Western Dorsale. On 23 January 1943, the Eighth Army took Tripoli, by which point the army retreating through Libya was already well on its way to the Mareth position. Part of the II US Corps crossed into Tunisia through passes in the Atlas Mountains from Algeria, controlling the interior of the triangle formed by the mountains. Their position raised the possibility of a thrust eastwards towards Sfax on the coast, to cut off the First Italian Army at Mareth from  Arnim's forces to the north around Tunis. Rommel could not allow this and formed a plan for a spoiling attack.\n\n===Battle of Sidi Bou Zid===\n{{Further information|Battle of Sidi Bou Zid}}\n[[File:Tunisia30Janto10Apr1943.jpg|thumb|upright|8th Army operations, 30 January to 10 April 1943]]\nOn 30 January 1943, the German 21st Panzer and three Italian divisions from the 5th Panzer Army met elements of the French forces near Fa\u00efd, the main pass from the eastern arm of the mountains into the coastal plains. Fredendall did not respond to the French request to send reinforcements in the form of tanks from 1st Armored Division and after desperate resistance, the under-equipped French defenders were overrun.<ref name=\"Watson68\">Watson (2007), p. 68</ref> Several counterattacks were organised, including a belated attack by Combat Command B of the US 1st Armored Division but all of these were beaten off with ease by Arnim's forces which by this time had created strong defensive positions.<ref name=\"Watson68\"/> After three days, the Allied forces had been forced to pull back and were withdrawn into the interior plains to make a new forward defensive line at the small town of [[Sbeitla]].\n\nIn Operation ''Fr\u00fchlingswind'' (spring wind), Arnim ordered four armoured battle groups forward on 14 February in the area of Sidi Bou Zid held by 34th Infantry Division's 168th Regimental Combat Team and 1st Armored Division's Combat Command A. The defenders' dispositions were poor, with concentrations dispersed so that they were unable to be mutually supportive. By 15 February, CCA had been severely damaged leaving the infantry units isolated on hilltops. Combat Command C was ordered across country to relieve Sidi Bou Zid but were repelled with heavy losses. By the evening of 15 February, three of the Axis battlegroups were able to head toward Sbeitla, {{convert|20|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the northwest.<ref name=\"watson77\">Watson (2007), p.77</ref> Pushing aside the remains of CCA and CCC, the battlegroups were confronted by Combat Command B in front of Sbeitla.

II US Corps withdrew to the line of Dernaia-Kasserine-Gap-Sbiba with XIX Corps on their left flank vacating the Eastern Dorsal to conform with them.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=9}} By the afternoon of 17 February, Rommel's troops had occupied Feriana and Thelepte (roughly {{Convert|15|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} southwest of Kasserine) forcing the evacuation on the morning of 18 February of Thelepte airfield, the main air base in British First Army's southern sector.<ref>Playfair, p. 294</ref>\n\n===Battle of Kasserine Pass===\n{{Main article|Battle of Kasserine Pass}}\n[[File:Americains Kasserine.jpg|thumb|American troops moving through the Kasserine Pass]]\nAfter further discussion, the ''Comando Supremo'' issued orders on 19 February for Rommel to attack through the Kasserine and Sbiba passes toward Thala and Le Kef to threaten First Army's flank. Rommel's original proposal was for a limited but concentrated attack through Kasserine to confront II Corps' strength at T\u00e9bessa and gain vital supplies from the US dumps there. Although he was to have 10th and 21st Panzer Divisions transferred to his command, Rommel was concerned that the new plan would dilute his force concentration and expose his flanks to threat.<ref>Watson (2007), pp. 80\u201381</ref>\n\nOn 19 February 1943, Rommel, having now been given formal control of the 10th and 21st Panzer Divisions, the Afrika Korps battlegroup as well as General Messe's forces on the Mareth defences (renamed Italian First Army),<ref name=\"Watson 2007, p. 82\">Watson (2007), p. 82</ref> launched what would become the Battle of Kasserine Pass. Hoping to take the inexperienced defenders by surprise, he sent the light armour of the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion racing into the pass. Colonel Alexander Stark's ''Stark Force'', a brigade group made up of US and French units, was responsible for the defence of the pass.<ref name=\"Watson 2007, p. 82\"/> It had not had time to organise properly but was able to direct heavy artillery fire from the surrounding heights which brought the  leading mechanised units of the ''Afrika Korps'' batlegroup to a halt.<ref>Watson (2007), p. 84</ref> Before they could continue, infantry had to be sent up into the high ground seeking to eliminate the artillery threat. A battlegroup under Hans-Georg Hildebrand including tanks from 21st Panzer were advancing north from Sbeitla toward the Sbiba Gap. In front of the hills east of Sbiba they were brought to a halt by 1st Guards Brigade and 18th Regimental Combat Team which had strong field and anti-tank artillery support and were joined by two infantry regiments from 34th Infantry Division.<ref>Watson (2007), pp. 86\u201387</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-787-0510-34A, Nordafrika, feuerndes Gesch\u00fctz.jpg|thumb|Germans fire an [[88mm gun]] in Tunisia]]\n\nBy the morning of 20 February, the bitter hand-to-hand fighting in the hills above Kasserine was continuing while the ''Afrika Korps Kampfgruppe'' and a battalion from the [[131 Armoured Division Centauro]] and more artillery, prepared for another attack through the pass, once it had been joined by a 10th Panzer Division battle group from Sbeitla. The morning attack made slow progress but the intense pressure applied during the renewed attack that afternoon triggered a collapse in the Allied defences.<ref>Watson (2007), pp. 89\u201393</ref>\n\nHaving rolled through the Kasserine Pass on the afternoon of 20 February, units of the Centauro Division headed west toward T\u00e9bessa, meeting little or no resistance. Following them came the von Broich battlegroup from 10th Panzer, which forked right onto the road to Thala where they were slowed by a regimental armoured group from 26th Armoured Brigade (''Gore Force''). Their tanks outgunned, Gore Force sustained heavy losses but bought time for ''Nick Force'', a composite force from British 6th Armoured Division, based around 26th Armoured Brigade Group with extra infantry and artillery (which Anderson had ordered the previous day to leave the Kesra area to bolster the Thala defences) to prepare defensive positions further up the road. Meanwhile, Fredendall had sent 1st Armored Division's CCB to meet the threat to T\u00e9bessa.<ref>Watson (2007), p. 102</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in Tunisia 1943 NA880.jpg|thumb|Infantry and [[Universal Carrier|carriers]] of the Grenadier Guards, advance over difficult terrain near the Kasserine Pass, 24 February 1943.]]\nBy 1pm on 21 February, Battlegroup von Broich was in contact with the dug-in 26th Armoured Brigade Group on the Thala road and making slow progress. Rommel took direct control of the attack and forced the defences by 4pm.<ref>Watson (2007), p. 103</ref> However, 26th Brigade Group were able to withdraw in reasonable order to the next, final, defensive line in front of Thala. Fighting at this position started at 7pm and continued at close quarters for three hours with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. ''Nick Force'' had taken a heavy beating and did not expect to be able to hold out the next day. However, during the night a further 48 artillery pieces from US 9th Infantry Division arrived after a {{convert|800|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} trip from Morocco on poor roads and in bad weather. On the morning of 22 February, as Broich prepared to launch his attack, his front was hit by a devastating artillery barrage. Surprisingly, Rommel told Broich to regroup and assume a defensive posture, so surrendering the initiative.<ref>Watson (2007), p. 104</ref>\n\nThe 21st Panzer battlegroup at Sbiba was making no progress. Further south, the ''Afrika Korps'' battlegroup on the road to T\u00e9bessa had been halted on 21 February by CCB's armour and artillery dug in on the slopes of Djebel Hamra.<ref>Watson (2007), p. 105</ref> An attempt to outflank them during the night of 21 February was a costly failure. A further attack early on 23 February was again beaten back.<ref>Watson (2007), pp. 106\u2013107</ref> In a dispirited meeting on 22 February with Kesselring, Rommel argued that faced with stiffening defences and the news that the Eighth Army's lead elements had finally reached Medenine, only a few kilometres from the Mareth Line, he should call off the attack and withdraw to support the Mareth defences, hoping that the Kasserine attack had caused enough damage to deter any offensive action from the west. Kesselring was keen for the offensive to continue but finally agreed that evening, and ''Comando Supremo'' formally terminated the operation.<ref>Watson (2007), pp. 109\u2013110</ref> The Axis forces from Kasserine reached the Mareth line on 25 February.\n\n===Aftermath===\nAction then abated for a time and both sides studied the results of recent battles. Rommel remained convinced that US forces posed little threat, while the British and Commonwealth troops were his equal. He held this opinion for far too long, and it would prove very costly. The Americans likewise studied the battle and relieved several senior commanders while issuing several \"lessons learned\" publications to improve future performance. Most important, on 6 March 1943 command of the II US Corps passed from Fredendall to [[George S. Patton]], with [[Omar Bradley]] as assistant Corps Commander. Commanders were reminded that large units should be kept concentrated to ensure mass on the battlefield, rather than widely dispersed as Fredendall had deployed them. This had the intended side effect of improving the fire control of the already-strong US artillery. Close air support had also been weak (although this had been hampered by the generally poor weather conditions).\n\n[[File:General Alexander, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces in North Africa, discussing future operations with the Supreme Commander, General Eisenhower, in Tunisia, 26 July 1943.

The Axis attack was repulsed with massed artillery fire; 55 Axis tanks were knocked out. With the failure of Capri, Rommel decided that the only way to save the Axis armies would be to abandon the campaign, and on 9 March he travelled to Italy for discussions with ''Comando Supremo'' in Rome. Finding no support for his ideas, he travelled on 10 March to see [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] at his headquarters in [[Ukraine]], to try to convince him to abandon Tunisia and return the Axis armies to Europe.

The terrain and rain however prevented the deployment of tanks, aircraft and anti-tank guns, which left the infantry isolated. A determined counter-attack by [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] and the [[136th Armoured Division Giovani Fascisti]] on 22 March, recaptured much of the [[bridgehead]]. XXX Corps prepared a new attack towards Tallouf, in which the [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Infantry Division]] (Major-General [[Francis Tuker]]) was to make a night attack on {{nowrap|23/24 March,}} around the inland end of the line.

The German tanks rolling up lead units of the US forces ran into a minefield, and US artillery and anti-tank units opened fire. The 10th Panzer Division rapidly lost 30 tanks and retreated out of the minefield. A second attack supported by infantry in the late afternoon was also repulsed, and the 10th Panzer Division retired to Gab\u00e8s. The US II Corps was unable to exploit the German failure and each attack was stopped by the 10th Panzer Division or 21st Panzer Division counter-attacks up the road from Gab\u00e8s; co-ordination of Allied air and ground forces remained unsatisfactory. The Eighth Army and the US II Corps attacked for the next week and on 28 March, the Eighth Army captured El Hamma, forcing the Axis to abandon Gab\u00e8s and retreat north towards the Fifth Panzer Army. The hills in front of the US forces were abandoned, allowing them to join the British forces in Gab\u00e8s later that day.

Weber's force was to advance in three groups: a central group moving west toward Medjez el Bab; a second to the north advancing south-west, on the route from [[Mateur]] to [[B\u00e9ja]] (which was some {{convert|25|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} west of Medjez) and the third group pushing west {{convert|25|mi|km}} south of Medjez.

This attack by the Manteuffel Division made good progress across the French-held, lightly defended hills between [[Cap Serrat]] and the railway town of [[Sedjenane]]. Costly counter-attacks on February 27 and 2 March by part of the [[139th (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire) Brigade|139th Infantry Brigade]], 46th Infantry Division), [[No. 1 Commando]] and supporting artillery delayed the Axis advance.<ref name=\"Playfair327\"/> Withdrawals of French battalions in the Medjez area to join XIX Corps, left little opposition to the German occupation of the high ground dominating the town, which was left in a dangerous salient.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=10}} As a result, Sedjenane was abandoned by the British on 4 March and the 139th Infantry Brigade was pushed slowly back over the next three weeks some {{convert|15|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} toward Djebel Abiod.\n\n===Operation Ochsenkopf===\n{{Further information|Operation Ochsenkopf}}\n[[File:British 4.5 inch gun and crew Tunisia 1943 IWM TR 1004.jpg|thumb|left|A British [[BL 4.5-inch Medium Field Gun|4.5 inch medium gun]] firing on targets spotted by the [[RAF]]]]\nThe main offensive, ''Ochsenkopf'' led to fierce fighting - ''Kampfgruppe'' Lang attacking in the northern sector were held up by a small force of artillery and a battalion of the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment|Hampshire Regiment]] for a whole day at [[Sidi Nsir]] and ''Hampshire Farm'' before they could be overcome.

British destroyers operating from Malta prevented marine supply, reinforcement or evacuation of Tunisia by sea ([[Operation Retribution (1943)|Operation Retribution]]). Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Cunningham]], Eisenhower's Naval Task Force commander, issued Nelsonian orders to his ships: ''\"Sink, burn, capture, destroy. Let nothing pass\"'' but very few Axis ships even attempted passage. By 18 April, after attacks by Eighth Army from the south and flanking attacks by IX Corps and French XIX Corps, the Axis forces had been pushed into a defensive line on the north-east coast of Tunis, attempting to protect their supply lines but with little hope of continuing the battle for long.\n\nAlexander planned that while II US Corps would attack on the north towards Bizerte, First Army would attack towards Tunis while Eighth Army attacked north from Enfidaville. Anderson would co-ordinate the actions of First Army and II US Corps, issuing the appropriate orders to achieve this.{{sfn|Anderson|1946|p=11}} Anderson's plan was for the main attack to be in the centre of the V Corps front at Medjez, confronting main Axis defences. However, IX Corps on the right would first attack north-east with, by speed of movement, the intention of getting in behind the Medjez position and disrupting their armoured reserves. II US Corps would make a double thrust: one to capture the high ground on V Corps' left flank and a second toward Bizerte.

The northward advance of Eighth Army had \"pinched out\" US II Corps' eastward facing front line, allowing the corps to be withdrawn and switched to the northern end of the Allied front. Arnim knew that an Allied offensive was imminent and launched a spoiling attack on the night of 20/21 April, between Medjez and Goubellat on the IX Corps front. The Hermann G\u00f6ring Division supported by tanks from 10th Panzer Division penetrated up to {{convert|5|mi|km}} at some points but could not force a general withdrawal and eventually returned to their lines.

The battle had drawn the Axis reserves of armour south, away from the central front.
