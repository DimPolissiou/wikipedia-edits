Kanchipuram is known for its [[Kamakshi Amman Temple]] dedicated to the mother goddess. Dwarka represents the place where god [[Krishna]], after leaving Mathura spent 100 years before He left for his divine abode from here, according to the epic [[Mahabharata]]. Mathura is the embodiment of events in the life of Krishna during his childhood and young days. Haridwar with shrines of both [[Shiva]] and Vishnu, represents the gateway to [[Uttarakhand]], as the sacred river [[Ganges]] emerges from the hills into the plains at this place. Varanasi is the place of salvation as it is strongly believed that death at this place will bring salvation. [[Varanasi]] is the holiest of all and it is favorite to lord [[Shiva]], thus it is often referred as ''City of Lord Shiva''. In Hinduism, one should visit the major temples in Varanasi in his/her life. Ujjain, also known by the ancient name Avanti, has one of the 12 [[Jyotirlingas]] installed in the [[Mahakaleshwar Temple]]. Each of these cities is also famous for the spectacular melas or fairs held. Haridwar and Ujjain are famous for the [[Kumbh Mela]] held once every 12 years. Marriage festival of [[Kamakshi]] at Kanchipuram is a special occasion. [[Krishna Janmashtami]] ( birth day of Krishna - generally held in August as per Hindu calendar) is a special occasion in Dwarka and Mathura.<ref name=Bansal/><ref name=Morgan/>\nThe seven religious cities are within India's territorial ambit and pilgrimage to these places greatly enhances the unity of the nation, in spite of its linguistic and cultural diversity. The seven sacred urban centers are well connected by road, rail and air transport with the rest of the country.<ref name=Bansal/>\n\n==Haridwar==\n[[File:Clock Tower, at Har-ki-Pauri, Haridwar.jpg|thumb|left|Har-ki-Pauri at Haridwar]]\n\"Haridwar\", also written as \"Hardwar\", literally means \"gateway to god Vishnu (Hari)\" or \"gateway to god Shiva (Har)\". It is the holiest city in the state of [[Uttarakhand]]. It is strategically located ({{coord|29.96|N|78.16|E}}) on the western bank of the river [[Ganges]] as it emerges into the plains at the exact location where the Har-Ki-Pauri ghat has been built to facilitate pilgrims to take a holy bath. It is thus also called the ''Gangadwara'', the place where the Ganges descends to the plains. Every year, thousands of people flock to Haridwar, also called Hardwar, to bathe at the Har-Ki-Pauri ghat (ghat is an embankment structure built out of stone slabs leading to the river edge to facilitate bathing) since it is believed that the feet of Vishnu is imprinted on a rock preserved here. Every evening at sun set time at the ghat, thousands of pilgrims offer [[Arti (Hinduism)|arti]], a Hindu ritual of offering lights of earthen lamps on small floating leaf holders with flowers, as the temple bells reverberate amidst chanting of hymns.<ref name=\"Bansal p.44-47\">Bansal p.44-47</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=\nhttp://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp043.htm|title=SACRIFICE OF DAKSHA 1 (From the Vayu Purana)|accessdate=2009-08-16|publisher= The Vishnu Purana, translated by [[Horace Hayman Wilson]], 1840. p. 62, 62:2}}</ref><ref name=Hoiberg>{{Cite book|last=Hoiberg|first=Dale|author2=Indu Ramchandani |title=Students' Britannica India|work=Haridwar|pages=248|accessdate=2009-08-09|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AE_LIg9G5CgC&pg=PA248&dq=Haridwar&lr=&ei=h0h-Svv3BpqUkAT2jpSPCg#v=onepage&q=Haridwar&f=false|publisher=Popular Prakashan|year= 2000|isbn= 9780852297605}}</ref>\n\nLegend from Hindu scriptures state that Haridwar is one among the four sites where drops of [[Amrita]], the elixir of immortality, accidentally spilled over from the pitcher, in which it was being carried away by the celestial bird [[Garuda]], after the [[Samudra manthan]] (churning of the ocean); the other three places are said to be Ujjain, [[Nasik]], and [[Allahabad]].<ref name=Harid>{{Cite web|url=http://sahajaharidwar.tripod.com/About_Haridwar.html|title=About Haridwar|accessdate=2009-08-12|publisher=sahajaharidwar.com}}</ref>\n\nAnother legend narrated for this pilgrim place is that sage [[Kapila]] had cursed the ancestors of prince [[Bhagiratha]].

Its hoary history, closely spun around the epic [[Mahabharata]] (also substantiated in the travelogues of the Chinese chronicler [[Hiuen Tsang]]), records that [[Timurlane]] had ransacked this town in the year 1399 AD. Apart from the holy ghat, there are a large number of temples in the city dedicated to Shiva, goddess [[Shakti]] or [[Durga]] (a cable car way has been built to approach this temple, apart from the ancient approach by steps over the hills), Vishnu and a galaxy of other deities.

The 12 years cycle [[Kumbh Mela]] is held during January or February depending on the Hindu [[Panchanga|Calmanac]].

It has undergone several changes with times under different rulers and in 800 AD, [[Adi Shankara]]charya is said to have got the [[Dwarkadheesh temple, Gujrat|Dwarakadheesh temple]] renovated and also added a shrine of goddess Adya Shakti. Over the next few centuries more renovations took place with grant of additional land till 1261 AD, when the temple was destroyed by Mohamed Shah. In subsequent years also, renovation took place but there was dispute between two groups for the control of the temple. In 1504, [[Vallabhacharya]] established the image of Dwarakadeesh in a well in Ladva village to protect it from Muslim marauders and again it was shifted to [[Dungarpur]] where the temple was renovated. In 1861, Maharaja Khanderao renovated the temple. During British rule, the temple tower was rebuilt. A golden pitcher was fixed on the temple tower by Maharaja [[Gaekwad]] in the year 1903 and further renovations were undertaken by the then Shankarachrya of Dwarka Peet. Since 1960, the conservation of the temple is under the control of the Government of India.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dwarkadhish.org/little-history.aspx|title=Events|accessdate=2009-08-13|publisher=Dwarkadhish.org Official Website of Jagad Mandir \u2013 Dwarka}}</ref>\n\nThe present Dwarakhadheesh temple, also called the Jagat Mandir (universal shrine) or ''trilok sundar'' (most beautiful in all three worlds), is a seven storied structure, {{convert|43|m|ft}} in height, appears to be raising above the Arabian sea. It is dated to the 13th century AD on the basis of oceanographic explorations undertaken to trace the ancient temple, which was submerged in the Arabian sea. The elegantly carved temple [[shikara]] (tower) is adorned with a huge flag, which is said to be {{convert|52|yard|ft}} in length with seven colours that can be seen flying from a distance of {{convert|10|km|mi}} (hoisting this flag has a great religious significance). There is an approach to the back side of the temple from the Gomti River end, which is built of 56 steps.

It is a richly carved temple decorated with sculptures of gods and goddesses on the exterior with the sanctum housing the main image of Rukmini. Carved ''naratharas'' (human figures) and carved ''gajatharas'' (elephants) are depicted in panels at the base of the tower. An interesting legend is narrated to justify separate dwelling temples, far away from each other, for Rukmini and her husband Krishna. It is said that at the request of sage [[Durvasa]] (who was renowned for his short temper and bestowing curses) Krishna and Rukmini pulled a chariot taking sage Durvasa to their house for dinner. On the way, when Rukmini asked for water to quench her thirst, Krishna drew Ganges water, by prodding the ground with his toe, for her to drink. Rukmini quenched her thirst with the Ganges water. But Durvasa felt insulted since Rukmini did not have the courtesy to offer him water to drink.

Before this period, it was the capital of early [[Cholas]] in the 2nd century BC. After the rule of the [[Pallava Dynasty]], the [[Vijayanagara empire]] and the [[Nayak (ethnic group)|Nayaka]] dynasty period followed, in that order. Prior to the Pallava reign, it is conjectured, based on the chronicles of the [[Xuanzang]], the Chinese pilgrim who visited Pallavas court, that the city was under the influence of [[Ashoka]], the [[Mauryan]] emperor in 3rd century BC. Xuanzang had also noted that [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] had visited this place. [[Jain]] and [[Buddhist]] temples and [[stupas]] of the [[Chola Dynasty]] reign have been recorded but mostly do not exist on ground. But South Indian architecture got a fillip only during the Pallava rule, particularly of rock cut temples during Mahendarvarman I's reign after he converted from Jainism to Hinduism . He was considered a man with vision and intelligence, a scholar, musician and a playwright. Kanchipuram was considered second only to Varanasi city in fame and learning.

The history dates its links to the period of [[Vikramaditya]] and [[Ashoka]] (3rd century BC). The religious tradition links it to god Shiva triumphing over the demon king [[Tripurasura]] and then renaming the city as Ujjainyini (meaning 'conquers with pride').<ref name=Ujjain>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ujjain.nic.in/tourist/what_to_see.htm|title=Ujjain|accessdate=2009-08-09|publisher=Ujaajin.nic.in}}</ref>\n\nUjjain, probably, also marks the spread of Hindu religious beliefs to the [[Central Asia]] region. Particular mention could be made to the reign of [[Vima Kadphises]], during the [[Kushan Dynasty]], who considered Shiva as his divine patron. During his reign, apart from the influence of [[Greece|Greek]] religious practices, worship of Shiva, in particular, was also seen as an accepted practice in [[Iran]]. This leaning is attributed to Vima Kadphises's victory over Indian territory. Inscriptions of his times in [[Iran]] establish that he had converted the temple of [[Dioscuri]] (built during Greeko \u2013 [[Bactria]]n period) at Dilberjin into a sanctuary for Shiva by decorating the place with a painting of Shiva and his wife [[Parvati]]. He got the wall painting of Shiva (''Oeso'') done by craftsmen he had taken from Ujjayani (Ujjain), apart from constructing a water conveyance system to the sanctuary of Shiva. Inscriptions further testify that the Kushan king attributed his rise to power to Srava (=Shiva) and Candavira. It is deduced that Candavira may be the same god as Candishvara, the God of Mahakala temple at Ujjain. It is also conjectured that the support of the Indian community (who worshipped Shiva) settled in eastern Iran and the encouragement he got from their priesthood, before and during his Indian campaign, and his relations with Ujjain, contributed to his deep involvement with the cult of Shiva. This devotion was continued by him even after his Indian campaign.<ref name=Harmatta>{{Cite book|last=Harmatta|first=Janos|title= History of civilizations of Central Asia | work=Religious Life under Vima Kaldphises |pages=318\u2013321|accessdate=2009-08-09|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DguGWP0vGY8C&pg=PA319&dq=Ujjain&lr=&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Ujjain&f=false|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass Publ|year=1999|isbn= 9788120814080}}</ref><ref>Ring p.835-837</ref>\n\nEmperor Ashoka also played a significant role as the Viceroy of Ujjain in enhancing its importance. Ashoka who ruled for three decades between 268 and 233 BC started his career in [[Taxila]] (now in [[Pakistan]]) in the north west by subduing a revolt. Thereafter, his father [[Bindusara]], of the [[Mauryan Dynasty]], transferred Ashoka as his Viceroy to Ujjain, which was the famous capital of the earlier kingdom of Avanti, in [[Central India]].<ref name=Kulkae>{{Cite book|last=Kulkae|first=Hermann|author2=Dietmar Rothermund |title= A History of India |work=Ashoka the beloved to the Gods|pages=62\u201365|accessdate=2009-08-09|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0GEtXp-GsUC&pg=PA65&dq=Ujjain&lr=&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Ujjain&f=false|publisher= CRC Press|year=1998|isbn=  9780203443453}}</ref>\n\nIt was once the largest city and capital of [[Malwa]] region. In the ancient city of Ujjain, [[Jai Singh II of Amber|Jai Singh II]] ruled in the 18th century. Jai Singh II built an observatory here, called the [[Jantar Mantar]]. The reason for building the observatory here was that it was the centre of [[Hindu Astronomy]] since ancient times and it was located on the prime or first meridian (of longitude) established on the canons of Hindu astronomy. According to [[Indian astronomy]], the first [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of longitude passes through Ujjain.

Based on archeological findings of ancient pottery, tools and tackles, Mathura's ancient history has been traced to about 1200 BC. [[Vedic period|Vedic]] and [[Puranas|Puranic]] literature also link founding of Mathura by [[Shatrughna]] (youngest brother of Rama). The Puranas also mention about two clans namely, Andhaka and Vrsni, the later clan was more organized under Krishna, attesting to historic linkage to the period between sixth century and fifth century BC. Mauryan empire's influence from the fourth century BC, when there was domination of Jain and Buddhist religious culture, have been noted from the sculptures recorded in Mathura. From this period, it has been inferred that \"the city had a significant impact on the development of figurative sculpture elsewhere in the country\". It was also a commercial hub during this period, imbibing composite culture and religious ethos, apart from establishing a prospering commerce both within and across the borders of the region. Following the [[Maurya]]n rule, the [[Kushans]] ruled till 3rd century AD when the sacred and secular life styles coalesced. Then a number of rulers followed, with the [[Gupta empire]] under [[Samudra Gupta]] ruling between 330 AD and 380 AD. During the Gupta empire, which lasted till sixth century AD, there was decline in the prosperity of Mathura. The [[Huns]] sacked the city in the sixth century. Thereafter, the city was controlled by [[Maukhari Dynasty]] of [[Kanauj]] when the Krishna cult evolved from the 7th century onwards to make the city a hub of Krishna worship in the country. Then [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] invaded and ransacked Mathura and decamped with all religious treasures made of gold and silver. This was followed by ushering in the rule of [[Slave Dynasty]] or [[Delhi Sultanate]] from 1193 AD and subsequently by the [[Mughal Dynasty]] rule, which lasted till the [[United Kingdom|British]] took over.  The Mughal rule, in particular of [[Aurangzeb]] saw the highest level of persecution, when in 1669 the Keshava temple was demolished and in its place a mosque was built. Even though the [[jat]] community of the region tried unsuccessfully to restore some of the temples but repeated Muslim depredation continued and it was not until the [[British Raj]] came into effect, after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]] in 1857, that Krishna worship in Mathura got a reprieve. British archeologists were successful in recreating the ancient historicity of the city and providing insight to Indian culture. Krishna temples and ancient history are now both major attractions of the city.<ref>Ring p.572-57</ref>\n\nThe present [[Keshav Dev Temple]] has been built at the same location where several major temples had been built in the 5000 years of hoary past, which is traced to the Vajranabha, the great grandson of Krishna. A grand temple was rebuilt during the reign of [[Chandragupta II|Chandra Gupta]] [[Vikramaditya]] in the 5th century that was sacked by Mahmud of Ghazni. Thereafter, at the same location Raja Veer Singh Deva Bundela had built a {{convert|250|ft|m}} high temple during [[Jahangir]]'s reign, which was also destroyed by [[Aurangzeb]] in 1669 and a mosque built in its place, which can be seen adjoining the present temple. The present temple (see picture in infobox) was completed in 1958 with installation of images of [[Radha Krishna]]. In the adjoining altars several images have been installed; on the left altar images of [[Jagannath]] (a form of Krishna), [[Balarama]] (Krishna's brother) and [[Subhadra]] (Krishna's sister) are seen; on the right altar idols of Rama, Sita and Lakshman are installed, right across there is a Hanuman idol. Images of Shiva and goddess Durga are also seen within the main temple foyer. The main temple complex also has a small shrine where Krishna was born (said to be the prison where he was born)  depicting images of [[Vasudeva]], [[Devaki]] and four-armed Krishna.<ref name = \"bansal4043\">Bansal p.40-43</ref>\n\nOn the bank of the [[Yamuna River]], at Vishrama ghat [[aarti]] is offered every evening to the river, since it is stated to be the location where Krishna rested after slaying King [[Kamsa]], his maternal uncle. Images of goddess [[Yami|Yamuna]] and her brother [[Yama]], the god of death, are also located here.<ref name = \"bansal4043\"/>\n\nThere are many other temples of importance to pilgrims within Mathura, to name only a few, such as the [[Prem Mandir Vrindavan]], Govindji temple, Madan Mohan temple, Radha Damodar temple, Radha Gopinath temple, Banke Bihari temple, Krishna Balarama temple, Rangaji temple and Seva Kunja.

Kanchipuram is known for its [[Kamakshi Amman Temple]] dedicated to the mother goddess. Dwarka represents the place where god [[Krishna]], after leaving Mathura spent 100 years before He left for his divine abode from here, according to the epic [[Mahabharata]]. Mathura is the embodiment of events in the life of Krishna during his childhood and young days. Haridwar with shrines of both [[Shiva]] and Vishnu, represents the gateway to [[Uttarakhand]], as the sacred river [[Ganges]] emerges from the hills into the plains at this place. Varanasi is the place of salvation as it is strongly believed that death at this place will bring salvation. [[Varanasi]] is the holiest of all and it is favorite to lord [[Shiva]], thus it is often referred as ''City of Lord Shiva''. In Hinduism, one should visit the major temples in Varanasi in his/her life. Ujjain, also known by the ancient name Avanti, has one of the 12 [[Jyotirlingas]] installed in the [[Mahakaleshwar Temple]]. Each of these cities is also famous for the spectacular melas or fairs held. Haridwar and Ujjain are famous for the [[Kumbh Mela]] held once every 12 years.

It is thus also called the ''Gangadwara'', the place where the Ganges descends to the plains. Every year, thousands of people flock to Haridwar, also called Hardwar, to bathe at the Har-Ki-Pauri ghat (ghat is an embankment structure built out of stone slabs leading to the river edge to facilitate bathing) since it is believed that the feet of Vishnu is imprinted on a rock preserved here.

Over the next few centuries more renovations took place with grant of additional land till 1261 AD, when the temple was destroyed by Mohamed Shah. In subsequent years also, renovation took place but there was dispute between two groups for the control of the temple. In 1504, [[Vallabhacharya]] established the image of Dwarakadeesh in a well in Ladva village to protect it from Muslim marauders and again it was shifted to [[Dungarpur]] where the temple was renovated. In 1861, Maharaja Khanderao renovated the temple. During British rule, the temple tower was rebuilt. A golden pitcher was fixed on the temple tower by Maharaja [[Gaekwad]] in the year 1903 and further renovations were undertaken by the then Shankarachrya of Dwarka Peet.

An interesting legend is narrated to justify separate dwelling temples, far away from each other, for Rukmini and her husband Krishna. It is said that at the request of sage [[Durvasa]] (who was renowned for his short temper and bestowing curses) Krishna and Rukmini pulled a chariot taking sage Durvasa to their house for dinner. On the way, when Rukmini asked for water to quench her thirst, Krishna drew Ganges water, by prodding the ground with his toe, for her to drink. Rukmini quenched her thirst with the Ganges water.

Before this period, it was the capital of early [[Cholas]] in the 2nd century BC. After the rule of the [[Pallava Dynasty]], the [[Vijayanagara empire]] and the [[Nayak (ethnic group)|Nayaka]] dynasty period followed, in that order. Prior to the Pallava reign, it is conjectured, based on the chronicles of the [[Xuanzang]], the Chinese pilgrim who visited Pallavas court, that the city was under the influence of [[Ashoka]], the [[Mauryan]] emperor in 3rd century BC. Xuanzang had also noted that [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] had visited this place. [[Jain]] and [[Buddhist]] temples and [[stupas]] of the [[Chola Dynasty]] reign have been recorded but mostly do not exist on ground. But South Indian architecture got a fillip only during the Pallava rule, particularly of rock cut temples during Mahendarvarman I's reign after he converted from Jainism to Hinduism . He was considered a man with vision and intelligence, a scholar, musician and a playwright. Kanchipuram was considered second only to Varanasi city in fame and learning.

The history dates its links to the period of [[Vikramaditya]] and [[Ashoka]] (3rd century BC). The religious tradition links it to god Shiva triumphing over the demon king [[Tripurasura]] and then renaming the city as Ujjainyini (meaning 'conquers with pride').<ref name=Ujjain>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ujjain.nic.in/tourist/what_to_see.htm|title=Ujjain|accessdate=2009-08-09|publisher=Ujaajin.nic.in}}</ref>\n\nUjjain, probably, also marks the spread of Hindu religious beliefs to the [[Central Asia]] region. Particular mention could be made to the reign of [[Vima Kadphises]], during the [[Kushan Dynasty]], who considered Shiva as his divine patron. During his reign, apart from the influence of [[Greece|Greek]] religious practices, worship of Shiva, in particular, was also seen as an accepted practice in [[Iran]]. This leaning is attributed to Vima Kadphises's victory over Indian territory. Inscriptions of his times in [[Iran]] establish that he had converted the temple of [[Dioscuri]] (built during Greeko \u2013 [[Bactria]]n period) at Dilberjin into a sanctuary for Shiva by decorating the place with a painting of Shiva and his wife [[Parvati]]. He got the wall painting of Shiva (''Oeso'') done by craftsmen he had taken from Ujjayani (Ujjain), apart from constructing a water conveyance system to the sanctuary of Shiva. Inscriptions further testify that the Kushan king attributed his rise to power to Srava (=Shiva) and Candavira. It is deduced that Candavira may be the same god as Candishvara, the God of Mahakala temple at Ujjain. It is also conjectured that the support of the Indian community (who worshipped Shiva) settled in eastern Iran and the encouragement he got from their priesthood, before and during his Indian campaign, and his relations with Ujjain, contributed to his deep involvement with the cult of Shiva. This devotion was continued by him even after his Indian campaign.<ref name=Harmatta>{{Cite book|last=Harmatta|first=Janos|title= History of civilizations of Central Asia | work=Religious Life under Vima Kaldphises |pages=318\u2013321|accessdate=2009-08-09|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DguGWP0vGY8C&pg=PA319&dq=Ujjain&lr=&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Ujjain&f=false|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass Publ|year=1999|isbn= 9788120814080}}</ref><ref>Ring p.835-837</ref>\n\nEmperor Ashoka also played a significant role as the Viceroy of Ujjain in enhancing its importance. Ashoka who ruled for three decades between 268 and 233 BC started his career in [[Taxila]] (now in [[Pakistan]]) in the north west by subduing a revolt. Thereafter, his father [[Bindusara]], of the [[Mauryan Dynasty]], transferred Ashoka as his Viceroy to Ujjain, which was the famous capital of the earlier kingdom of Avanti, in [[Central India]].<ref name=Kulkae>{{Cite book|last=Kulkae|first=Hermann|author2=Dietmar Rothermund |title= A History of India |work=Ashoka the beloved to the Gods|pages=62\u201365|accessdate=2009-08-09|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0GEtXp-GsUC&pg=PA65&dq=Ujjain&lr=&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Ujjain&f=false|publisher= CRC Press|year=1998|isbn=  9780203443453}}</ref>\n\nIt was once the largest city and capital of [[Malwa]] region. In the ancient city of Ujjain, [[Jai Singh II of Amber|Jai Singh II]] ruled in the 18th century. Jai Singh II built an observatory here, called the [[Jantar Mantar]].

All these factors have contributed to the city being called the religious capital of Hinduism.<ref name=\"Bansal p.48-49\">Bansal p.48-49</ref><ref name=Varun>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9074835/Varanasi|title=Varanasi|publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]|accessdate=2009-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Alexander |last=Cunningham |author2=Surendranath Majumdar Sastri  |authorlink=Alexander Cunningham |title=Ancient Geography of India |pages=131\u2013140 |publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal |origyear=1924 |year=2002 |isbn=81-215-1064-3  }}</ref>\n\nVaranasi is also known as the favourite city of the Hindu deity [[Lord Shiva]] as it has been mentioned in the [[Rigveda]] that this city in older times was known as [[Varanasi|Kashi]] or \"Shiv ki Nagri\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9074835/Varanasi |title=Varanasi |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref> The [[Pandavas]] went to Kashi in search of Shiva to atone for their sins of fratricide and bramhanahatya that they had committed during the epic [[Kurukshetra war]] of [[Mahabharata]] epic.<ref name=\"Bansal p.48-49\"/>\n\nAmong the innumerable temples in the city,  most worshipped are: the [[Kashi Vishvanath Temple]] of Shiva; the [[Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple (Varanasi)|Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple]]; and the Durga Temple known for the band of monkeys that reside in the large trees nearby.

Based on archeological findings of ancient pottery, tools and tackles, Mathura's ancient history has been traced to about 1200 BC. [[Vedic period|Vedic]] and [[Puranas|Puranic]] literature also link founding of Mathura by [[Shatrughna]] (youngest brother of Rama). The Puranas also mention about two clans namely, Andhaka and Vrsni, the later clan was more organized under Krishna, attesting to historic linkage to the period between sixth century and fifth century BC. Mauryan empire's influence from the fourth century BC, when there was domination of Jain and Buddhist religious culture, have been noted from the sculptures recorded in Mathura. From this period, it has been inferred that \"the city had a significant impact on the development of figurative sculpture elsewhere in the country\". It was also a commercial hub during this period, imbibing composite culture and religious ethos, apart from establishing a prospering commerce both within and across the borders of the region. Following the [[Maurya]]n rule, the [[Kushans]] ruled till 3rd century AD when the sacred and secular life styles coalesced. Then a number of rulers followed, with the [[Gupta empire]] under [[Samudra Gupta]] ruling between 330 AD and 380 AD. During the Gupta empire, which lasted till sixth century AD, there was decline in the prosperity of Mathura. The [[Huns]] sacked the city in the sixth century. Thereafter, the city was controlled by [[Maukhari Dynasty]] of [[Kanauj]] when the Krishna cult evolved from the 7th century onwards to make the city a hub of Krishna worship in the country. Then [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] invaded and ransacked Mathura and decamped with all religious treasures made of gold and silver. This was followed by ushering in the rule of [[Slave Dynasty]] or [[Delhi Sultanate]] from 1193 AD and subsequently by the [[Mughal Dynasty]] rule, which lasted till the [[United Kingdom|British]] took over.  The Mughal rule, in particular of [[Aurangzeb]] saw the highest level of persecution, when in 1669 the Keshava temple was demolished and in its place a mosque was built. Even though the [[jat]] community of the region tried unsuccessfully to restore some of the temples but repeated Muslim depredation continued and it was not until the [[British Raj]] came into effect, after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]] in 1857, that Krishna worship in Mathura got a reprieve. British archeologists were successful in recreating the ancient historicity of the city and providing insight to Indian culture. Krishna temples and ancient history are now both major attractions of the city.<ref>Ring p.572-57</ref>\n\nThe present [[Keshav Dev Temple]] has been built at the same location where several major temples had been built in the 5000 years of hoary past, which is traced to the Vajranabha, the great grandson of Krishna. A grand temple was rebuilt during the reign of [[Chandragupta II|Chandra Gupta]] [[Vikramaditya]] in the 5th century that was sacked by Mahmud of Ghazni. Thereafter, at the same location Raja Veer Singh Deva Bundela had built a {{convert|250|ft|m}} high temple during [[Jahangir]]'s reign, which was also destroyed by [[Aurangzeb]] in 1669 and a mosque built in its place, which can be seen adjoining the present temple. The present temple (see picture in infobox) was completed in 1958 with installation of images of [[Radha Krishna]]. In the adjoining altars several images have been installed; on the left altar images of [[Jagannath]] (a form of Krishna), [[Balarama]] (Krishna's brother) and [[Subhadra]] (Krishna's sister) are seen; on the right altar idols of Rama, Sita and Lakshman are installed, right across there is a Hanuman idol. Images of Shiva and goddess Durga are also seen within the main temple foyer. The main temple complex also has a small shrine where Krishna was born (said to be the prison where he was born)  depicting images of [[Vasudeva]], [[Devaki]] and four-armed Krishna.<ref name = \"bansal4043\">Bansal p.40-43</ref>\n\nOn the bank of the [[Yamuna River]], at Vishrama ghat [[aarti]] is offered every evening to the river, since it is stated to be the location where Krishna rested after slaying King [[Kamsa]], his maternal uncle. Images of goddess [[Yami|Yamuna]] and her brother [[Yama]], the god of death, are also located here.<ref name = \"bansal4043\"/>\n\nThere are many other temples of importance to pilgrims within Mathura, to name only a few, such as the [[Prem Mandir Vrindavan]], Govindji temple, Madan Mohan temple, Radha Damodar temple, Radha Gopinath temple, Banke Bihari temple, Krishna Balarama temple, Rangaji temple and Seva Kunja. Also, in the nearby [[Vrindavan]] where Krishna spent his childhood days, there is a galaxy of temples (said to be 5000), which is also a very pious place for pilgrims. It is {{convert|12|km|mi}} away from Mathura.<ref name = \"bansal4043\"/>\n\nOther important religious events observed by pilgrims in the precincts of Mathura and Vrindavan are the Vrindavan [[parikrama|Parikrama (religious practice)]] (circumambulation around the temples along a prescribed path) and the Braj Mandal parikrama during October\u2013November, which takes 3 months to complete on foot, as it includes going round the [[Govardhan]] hill, apart from several other shrines.<ref name = \"bansal4043\"/>\n\nIt is located about {{convert|50|km|mi}} north of [[Agra]], and {{convert|150|km|mi}} south of [[Delhi]]; about {{convert|20|km|mi}} from holy [[Vrindavan]].<ref name=Schweig/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Char Dham]]\n*[[Chota Char Dham]]\n* [[Jyotirlinga]]\n\n==Places at a Glance==\n* Haridwar -Hari (Form of Vishnu)\n* Ayodhya- Ayodhyanath, Vijayaraghava Rama (Form of Lord Rama)\n* Kancheepuram- Devi Kamakshi (Form of Goddess Parvati, Shakti)\n* Varanasi(or Kashi)- Kashi Vishwanath (Form of Shiva)\n* Mathura- Shri Gowardhan Krishna (Form of Krishna)\n* Ujjain- Shri Mahakaleshwar (Form of Shiva)\n* Dwarka- Shri Dwarkadheesh (Form of Krishna)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Hindu holy cities}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu holy cities]]\n", "name_user": "Titodutta", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapta_Puri"}

The road was one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome and became one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Up until the 1850s it was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility and it was enriched with feasts and games. After a two-century decline, from the 1950s onwards the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious locations.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\").<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> [[Procession]]s travelled through these streets almost daily during the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]]. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge that killed more than 300 people.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge and to connect the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons aside from reducing traffic were also important for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI.

Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nIn addition to reconstructing [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Julius II implemented multiple projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae'') in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', a task which was started forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484).<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref> One of the most important projects was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia on the left bank, a new grand avenue through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the Florentine merchant quarter on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/> and transport goods coming from the [[Via Aurelia]] and the [[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]] roads towards the centre of the city.

The road was one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome and became one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Up until the 1850s it was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility and it was enriched with feasts and games. After a two-century decline, from the 1950s onwards the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious locations.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\").<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> [[Procession]]s travelled through these streets almost daily during the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]]. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years.

In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge and to connect the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]].

Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nIn addition to reconstructing [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Julius II implemented multiple projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae'') in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', a task which was started forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484).<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref> One of the most important projects was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia on the left bank, a new grand avenue through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the Florentine merchant quarter on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/> and transport goods coming from the [[Via Aurelia]] and the [[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]] roads towards the centre of the city.  The Pope intended for it to reach Piazza di [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and the [[Port of Ripa Grande and Papal Arsenal|port of Ripa Grande]].<ref name=\"po19\"/>\n\nThe main goal behind these plans was to superimpose a regular road network with the focus given to the Tiber by medieval Rome's disorderly buildings; together with the new [[Borgo Nuovo (Rome)|Via Alessandrina]] that Alexander VI opened in the Borgo, the ''Via dei Pettinari'' that connected the [[Trastevere]] on one side and the [[Campidoglio]] on the other, the Lungara and Via Giulia created a quadrilateral network of modern roads in the city's maze of alleys.<ref name=\"po19\"/> In the original project Via Giulia was supposed to reach the Hospital of Santo Spirito in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] via the rebuilt ''[[Pons Neronianus]]''.<ref name=del472/><ref name=cast380>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380</ref> The center of the city shifted towards the Vatican and [[Trastevere]] and away from the [[Palazzo Senatorio]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], which was the symbol of the Roman nobility's power;<ref name=tem124/><ref name=\"po19\"/> the plan was intended to separate the papacy from the city's powerful noble families, particularly the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]] families.<ref name=tem124>Temple (2011), pp. 124</ref>\n\nThese projects had a secondary, celebrative goal to promote the [[Pontiff]] as the unifier of Italy and the renewer of Rome; in 1506, after the end of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the Pope overthrew the powerful [[Baglioni (family)|Baglioni]] and [[Bentivoglio family|Bentivoglio]] families and conquered [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]],<ref name=\"po19\">Portoghesi, p. 19</ref> as testified in an inscription along the ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi''.<ref>IVLIO.II.PONT:OPT:MAX:QVOD FINIB:DITIONIS.S.R.E.PROLATIS ITALIAQ:LIBERATA VRBEM ROMAM OCCVPATE SIMILIOREM QVAM DIVISE PATEFACTIS DIMENSIS Q: VIIS PRO MAIESTATE IMPERII ORNAVIT (''Julius II p.o.m. who extended the power of the Holy Roman Church and freed Italy.

He was in possession of a beautiful horse which was being eyed by the son of king of Hissar for quite some time. Tandhan refused to hand over his precious horse to the king's son.\n\nThe king's son then decides to forcefully acquire the horse and thus challenges Tandan to a duel. Tandan fights the battle bravely and kills the king's son. The enraged king thus kills Tandan in front of Narayani in the battle. Narayani, symbolic of female bravery and power, fights with the king and kills him.

{"title_page": "Licence to Grill", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n'''''Licence to Grill''''' is a show hosted by [[Rob Rainford]] and can be seen on [[Food Network Canada]],  [[Asian Food Channel]] and downloaded at [[MoboVivo]].  The show is produced by [[Knight Enterprises]]. The show was formerly carried in the United States on the [[Discovery Networks]] channel Discovery Home, but was dropped from the schedule when the channel was flipped to the ecology-themed [[Planet Green]]. The episode \"Bike Ride BBQ\" was the last one to air in the USA.\n\n''Licence to Grill'' is a series that explores the enjoyment of backyard cooking, entertaining, and the [[barbecue]].  Each episode takes place over a day or two, but mainly on Saturdays.  The host and chef Rob Rainford prepares a meal for the evening when guests will arrive.\n\nThe central theme is barbecue and with that, Rainford shows us tips and tricks for cooking on a barbecue.  The recipes range from the typical barbecue fare, such as [[hamburgers]], [[steak]]s, [[kebab]]s, to more ambitious meals such as [[Lamb and mutton|leg of lamb]], hot smoking sides of [[fish]], grilled [[dessert]]s.\n\nRainford has a philosophy when it comes to the barbecue: \"It's pretty simple.

The show is produced by [[Knight Enterprises]]. The show was formerly carried in the United States on the [[Discovery Networks]] channel Discovery Home, but was dropped from the schedule when the channel was flipped to the ecology-themed [[Planet Green]]. The episode \"Bike Ride BBQ\" was the last one to air in the USA.  \n\n''Licence to Grill'' is a series that explores the enjoyment of backyard cooking, entertaining, and the [[barbecue]].  Each episode takes place over a day or two, but mainly on Saturdays.  The host and chef Rob Rainford prepares a meal for the evening when guests will arrive.\n\nThe central theme is barbecue and with that, Rainford shows us tips and tricks for cooking on a barbecue.  The recipes range from the typical barbecue fare, such as [[hamburgers]], [[steak]]s, [[kebab]]s, to more ambitious meals such as [[Lamb and mutton|leg of lamb]], hot smoking sides of [[fish]], grilled [[dessert]]s.\n\nRainford has a philosophy when it comes to the barbecue: \"It's pretty simple. Just start with the freshest ingredients you can find and then you've got two choices: long slow cooking over low indirect heat, or red hot and smokin' for fast grilling. If you cook low and slow then you can use all sorts of rubs and smoking agents to infuse the food with a depth of flavour you just can\u2019t get out of an oven.
