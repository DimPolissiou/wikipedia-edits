{"title_page": "Marriage in ancient Greece", "text_new": "[[File:Pyxis01_pushkin.jpg|right|thumb|250x250px|\"Wedding preparation\"]]\n'''Marriage in ancient Greece''' had less of a basis in personal relationships and more in social responsibility. The goal and focus of all marriages was intended to be reproduction, making marriage an issue of public interest. Marriages were usually arranged by the parents; on occasion professional matchmakers were used. Each city was politically independent and each had its own laws concerning marriage. For the marriage to be legal, the woman's father or guardian gave permission to a suitable male who could afford to marry. Orphaned daughters were usually married to uncles or cousins. Wintertime marriages were popular due to the significance of that time to Hera, the goddess of marriage. The couple participated in a ceremony which included rituals such as veil removal, but it was the couple living together that made the marriage legal.  Marriage was understood to be the official transition from childhood into adulthood for females.<ref name=\"WILLIAMSON 1998\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Sacred_and_the_Feminine_in_Ancient_G.html?id=YvvJtcFkRpcC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Sacred and the Feminine in Ancient Greece|last=WILLIAMSON|first=MALCOLM|date=1998|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415126632|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAvailable historical records on the subject focus exclusively on Athens or Sparta and primarily on the aristocratic class. Scholars are uncertain whether these traditions were common throughout the rest of Ancient Greece and for those in lower classes or if these records are unique to these regions and social classes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780195067279|url-access=registration|quote=Women in the classical world: image and text.|title=Women in the Classical World: Image and Text|last=Fantham|first=Elaine|last2=Foley|first2=Helene Peet|last3=Kampen|first3=Natalie Boymel|last4=Pomeroy|first4=Sarah B.|last5=Shapiro|first5=H.

There is also limited information available about marriage in the city of [[Gortyn]] in ancient times, in the form of the legal text the [[Gortyn code]].\n\n== Marriage as a public interest ==\nThe ancient Greek legislators considered marriage to be a matter of public interest.<ref name=\"WILLIAMSON 1998\"/> Marriages was intended to be monogamous. In keeping with this idea, the heroes of [[Homer]] never have more than one wife by law,<ref>Buttmann, Lexilogus, 73</ref> though they may be depicted with living with concubines, or having sexual relationships with one or more woman. According to [[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', any man who was not married by age thirty-five could be punished with a loss of [[civil rights]] and with financial consequences. He proposes that when choosing a wife, men should always consider the interests of the state over their own desires.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=peJWAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA618&lpg=PA618&dq=Platner,+Process,+&c.+vol.+ii.+p.+248&source=bl&ots=xKPoWGGxn3&sig=ACfU3U0NJrijdJv20iXvdo8-pkYlJL2TXg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwij_qWP7YvmAhWvVN8KHWebDFsQ6AEwAXoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities|last=Smith|first=William|last2=Anthon|first2=Charles|date=1843|publisher=Harper & Brothers|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== In Ancient Sparta ===\nIn Ancient [[Sparta]], the subordination of private interests and personal happiness to the good of the public was strongly encouraged by the laws of the city. One example of the legal importance of marriage can be found in the laws of Lycurgus of Sparta, which required that criminal proceedings be taken against those who married too late (''graphe opsigamiou'')<ref name=\"Onomasticon\">[[Julius Pollux|Pollux]], ''Onomasticon'' [https://archive.org/stream/pollucisonomasti02polluoft#page/118/mode/2up VIII.40].</ref> or unsuitably (''graphe kakogamiou''),<ref name=\"Onomasticon\" /> as well as against confirmed bachelors,<ref name=\":2\">[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Lycurgus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0047%3Achapter%3D15%3Asection%3D1 15.1].</ref> that is, against those who did not marry at all (''graphe agamiou'').<ref name=\"Onomasticon\" /> These regulations were founded on the generally recognised principle that it was the duty of every citizen to raise up a strong and healthy legitimate children to the state.<ref>Mulller, Dorians., iv. 4. \u00a7 3.</ref>\n\nThe Spartans considered ''teknopoioia'' (childbearing) as the main object of marriage. Because of this, whenever a woman had no children by her own husband,  the state ought to allow her to live with another man.<ref>[[Xenophon]]. de Rep. Lac. i. 8.</ref> On the same principle, and to prevent the end of the family line, Spartan King [[Anaxandridas II]] was allowed to live with two wives. He kept two separate establishments: this was a case of [[bigamy]], which, as [[Herodotus]]<ref>Herodotus. vi. 39, 40</ref> observes, was not at all consistent with Spartan nor indeed with [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] customs.\n\n=== In Ancient Athens ===\nFor a marriage to be viewed as legitimate in Athens, both the bride and groom had to be of free status, and after 451BCE, both had to be legitimate children of Athenian citizen families. Children of such unions would then be considered legitimate Athenian citizens when they came of age. Though the marriages were not legally recognized in Athens, wealthy [[metic]]<nowiki/>s would be considered married by those around them if they followed the same procedures and ceremonies. These couples would then act as any married Athenian couple would.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=N6uqZScTzSgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Title:+Studying+Gender+in+Classical+Antiquity&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIgIqmgublAhVGmuAKHU3mCccQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Studying Gender in Classical Antiquity|last=Foxhall|first=Lin|date=2013-05-09|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107067028|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== In Ancient Gortyn ===\nThe [[Gortyn code|Gortyn Code]] gives information on the law surrounding marriage in ancient [[Gortyn]]. Though the code records the law, scholar Sue Blundell reminds us we should not assume that this reflects a consistently held practice. The code seems to mostly address legality of marriages to consider the citizenship and political status of any children. Citizenship of the children of slave men and free women depended on where the children lived. Children were considered slaves if the couple lived and raised the children in the house of their father, making them property of his master. If the couple lived and raised children in the house of their mother they were considered free.<ref name=\":3\" /> Children born to two slave parents would be owned by their master.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/womeninancientgr0000blun|url-access=registration|title=Women in Ancient Greece|last=Blundell|first=Sue|last2=Blundell|first2=Susan|date=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674954731|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Arranged marriage ==\nMarriage was usually arranged between the parents of the bride and the groom. A man would choose his wife based on three things: the [[dowry]], which was given by the father of the bride to the groom; her presumed fertility; and her skills, such as [[weaving]]. There were usually no established age limits for marriage, although, with the exception of political marriages, waiting until childbearing age was considered proper decorum. Many women were married by the age of 14 or 16, while men commonly married around the age of 30.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe son-in-law and father-in-law became allies ({{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9}}, ''etai,'' \"clansmen\")<ref>Pl. of {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2}} ''etes''.</ref> through the exchange of gifts in preparation for the transfer of the bride.

The exchange also showed that the woman's family was not simply selling her or rejecting her; the gifts formalized the legitimacy of a marriage. Gifts from the betrothed wife ({{lang|grc|\u1f15\u03b4\u03bd\u03b1}} ''hedna'')<ref>Pl. of {{lang|grc|\u1f15\u03b4\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd}} ''hednon''.</ref> usually consisted of cattle.<ref name=\"Powers\">Powers, Jennifer. \"Greek Weddings: The History of Marriage.\" SUNY Albany, 1997.

Academic Search Complete. Web. 19 Mar. 2014</ref>\n\nMarriages were also arranged through the meeting of the fathers of the young couple, basing the  marriage on their interests in expanding a business or forging an alliance between the families, with little concern about what the groom thought of the situation, and no regard for what the wife wished.<ref>Thompson, James C. \"MARRIAGE IN ANCIENT ATHENS.\" MARRIAGE IN ANCIENT ATHENS. N.p., n.d., July 2010. Web. 19 Mar. 2014.</ref>\n\n== Selecting a spouse ==\nIndependent of any public considerations, there were also private or personal reasons (particular to the ancients) which made marriage an obligation. Plato mentions one of these as the duty incumbent upon every individual to provide for a continuance of representatives to succeed himself as ministers of the Divinity (''toi Theoi [[Hyperetes|hyperetas]] an' hautou paradidonai''). Another was the desire felt by almost everyone, not merely to perpetuate his own name, but also to prevent his ''heritage being desolate, and his name being cut off'', and to leave someone who might make the customary offerings at his grave.<ref>[[Isaeus]] de Apoll. Hered. p.&nbsp;66. Bek.</ref> With this in mind, childless persons would sometimes [[Adoption|adopt]] unwanted children, including children who had been left to die.\n\nBy Athenian law, a citizen was not allowed to marry a foreign woman, nor conversely, under very severe penalties.<ref>Demosth. c.Neaer. p.&nbsp;1350</ref> However, proximity by blood (''anchisteia''), or consanguinity (''syngeneia''), was not, with few exceptions, a bar to marriage in any part of Greece; direct lineal descent was.<ref>Isaeus, de Oiron. her. p.&nbsp;72.</ref> Thus brothers were permitted to marry even with sisters, if not ''homometrioi'' or born from the same mother, as [[Cimon]] did with [[Elpinice]], though a connection of this sort appears to have been looked on with abhorrence.<ref>Becker, Charikles, vol. ii. p.&nbsp;448.</ref>\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that love ever played a significant role in selecting a legal spouse, though scholars have stated that it is likely there would have been affairs due to love.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Heiresses ==\n{{main|Epikleros}}In [[Athens]], in the case of a father dying [[intestate]] and without male children, his [[Beneficiary|heiress]] had no choice in marriage. The woman was not an heiress by modern day Western standards, as she could not actually own the land, however, she could not be separated from it. This meant that any man would have to first marry her in order to own the land.<ref name=\":4\" /> She was compelled by law to marry her nearest kinsman, usually a first cousin or an uncle that was capable of fathering children. If either the heiress and/or her potential husband are married they were required to divorce, unless the father had taken the precaution of adopting his daughter's current husband as his heir before his death.<ref name=\":4\" /> Under Solon's reforms couples of this nature were required to have sex a minimum of three times per month in order to conceive a male heir.'''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Brief History of Ancient Greece: Politics, Society, and Culture|last=Pomeroy|first=Sarah B.|last2=Burstein|first2=Stanley M.|last3=Donlan|first3=Walter|last4=Tolbert Roberts|first4=Jennifer|last5=Tandy|first5=David W.|last6=Tsouvala|first6=Georgia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=0190925302|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref>''' If the heiress were poor ([[Timocracy|thessa]]), the nearest unmarried kinsman either married her or portioned her suitably to her rank. When there were several co-heiresses, they were respectively married to their kinsmen, the nearest having the first choice (see [[Epikleros]]). In fact the heiress, together with her [[inheritance]], belonged to the kinsmen of the family, so that in early times a father could not give his daughter (if an heiress) in marriage without their consent.<ref>Muller, Dorians, ii. 10. \u00a7 4.</ref> This was not the case, however, in later Athenian law,<ref>Demosth., C. Steph.; p. 1134.</ref> by which a father was empowered to dispose of his daughter by will or otherwise; just as [[widow]]s were disposed of in marriage by the will of their husbands, who were still considered their rightful guardians (''[[Kurios|kyrioi]]'').<ref>Demosth. C. Aphob.; p. 814.</ref>\n\nThe same practice of marrying in the family (''[[oikos]]''), especially in the case of heiresses, prevailed in Sparta. These women were known as ''patrouchoi.'''''<ref name=\":3\" />''' [[Leonidas]] married the heiress of [[Cleomenes I]], as her ''anchisteia'', or next of kin, and [[Anaxandrides]] his own sister's daughter. Moreover, if a father had not determined himself concerning his daughter, the king's court decided who among the privileged persons or members of the same family should marry the heiress.<ref>Herodotus, vi. 57 ; Muller, /. c.</ref>\n\nLin Foxhall has cited evidence of a similar tradition in ancient [[Gortyn]], where the women were known as ''patroiokoi''.<ref name=\":3\" /> These girls would be married as young as 12 in order to produce an heir as quickly as possible. They could be claimed first by paternal uncles, and if there was no uncles to make the claim, then paternal cousins by order of age would have the next right to marry her. If still no one was able to claim her, she was free to marry who she pleased \"of the tribe from those who apply\". However, if she were to turn down the first claimant, she would owe him half of her inheritance.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Dates for marriage ==\nAncient Greeks primarily married in winter, during the month of ''Gamelion'', the equivalent of the month of January. Gamelion translates to \"Wedding-Month\". This was done in honour of the goddess of marriage, Hera. There were also special sacrifices made to her throughout the month.<ref name=\":4\" /> There are also many superstitions that say they married during full moons.\n\n== Engagement ==\nMatch-making among the ancients remained outside the dominion of political and legal regulation.  This was entirely left to the care and forethought of parents, or women who made a profession of it, and who were therefore called ''promnestriai'' or ''promnestrides''.<ref>Pollux, iii. 31.</ref> The profession, however, does not seem to have been thought very honourable or to have been held in repute, as being too nearly connected with that of a panderer (''proagogos'').<ref>Plato, Theaet. 2. p.&nbsp;150.</ref>\n\nIn [[ancient Athens]], marriages were arranged between the groom and the [[Kyrios|guardian (''kyrios'')]] of the bride.<ref>Flaceliere, Robert (1974). Daily Life in Greece. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., INC.. pp. 57.</ref> The ''kyrios'' would announce that he was allowing his daughter to marry.<ref name=\"Mireaux 215\">[[\u00c9mile Mireaux|Mireaux, Emile]] (1959). ''Daily Life in the Time of Homer''. New York: The Macmillan Company. pp. 215.</ref> The suitors would compete against each other for the daughters hand in marriage. They would bring extravagant gifts or compete by song, dance, or games.<ref name=\"Mireaux 215\" /> When the suitor was chosen for the daughter, the suitor and the father would proceed in a process known as ''engysis'', (\u2018giving of a pledge into the hand\u2019), which is where the two men would shake hands and say some ritual phrases.  The woman did not decide whom she would marry, only under very special circumstances, and she played no active role in the ''engysis'' process, which was not out of the norm for that time period.<ref>Flaceliere, Robert (1974). Daily Life in Greece. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., INC.. pp. 60.</ref> After the engysis, the two would make a binding promise, which occurred before the marriage.\n\nIn Athens the ''engyesis'', or [[betrothal]], was in fact indispensable to the complete validity of a [[marriage contract]]. It was made by the natural or legal guardian (''kyrios'') of the bride, usually her father, and attended by the relatives of both parties as witnesses. In view of this crowd the guardian would say \"I give you my daughter to sow for the purpose of producing legitimate children.\" to which the intended groom would respond \"I take her.\"'''<ref name=\":0\" />''' The law of Athens ordained that all children born from a marriage legally contracted in this respect should be legal ''gnesioi'',<ref>Demosth. c. Steph. p.&nbsp;1134</ref> and consequently, if sons, ''isomoiroi'', entitled to inherit equally or in gavel-kind. It would seem, therefore, that the issue of a marriage without espousals would lose their heritable rights, which depended on their being born ''ex astes kai engyetes gynaikos'', that is, from a citizen and a legally betrothed wife. The wife's [[dowry]] was also settled at the espousals.<ref>Meicr and Schoeman, p.&nbsp;415.</ref>\n\nIn Sparta the betrothal of the bride by her father or guardian (''kyrios'') was requisite as a preliminary of marriage, just as at Athens.<ref>Muller, Dorians, ii. 4. \u00a7 2.</ref> Another custom peculiar to the Spartans, and a relic of ancient times, was the seizure of the bride by her intended husband (see Herodotus, vi. 65), but of course with the sanction of her parents or guardians.<ref>Xen. de Rep. Lac. i. 5.</ref> She was not, however, immediately domiciled in her husband's house, but cohabited with him for some time clandestinely, till he brought her, and frequently her mother also, to his home. A similar custom appears to have prevailed in Crete, where, as we are told,<ref>Strabo, x. p.&nbsp;482</ref> the young men when dismissed from the ''[[agela]]'' of their fellows were immediately married, but did not take their wives home till some time afterwards. Muller suggests that the children of this furtive intercourse were called ''[[Partheniae|parthenioi]]''.\n\n== Marriage celebration ==\nThe ancient Greek marriage celebration consisted of a three part ceremony which lasted three days: the ''proaulia'', which was the pre-wedding ceremony, the ''gamos'', which was the actual wedding, and the ''epaulia'', which was the post-wedding ceremony. Most of the wedding was focused on the experience of the bride.<ref name=\"WILLIAMSON 1998\"/> In Athens specifically, most of the wedding would take place at night.\n\n=== Proaulia ===\nThe ''proaulia'' was the time when the bride would spend her last days with her mother, female relatives, and friends preparing for her wedding. The ''proaulia'' was usually a feast held at the bride\u2019s father\u2019s house. During this ceremony, the bride would make various offerings, called the ''proteleia'', to gods such as [[Artemis]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]]. \u201cToys would be dedicated to Artemis by adolescent girls prior to marriage, as a prelude to finding a husband and having children. More significant as a rite of passage before marriage was the ritual of the cutting and dedication of a lock of hair.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|title=Women and Girls in Classical Greek Religion|last=Dillon|first=Matthew|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=0415202728|location=New York|page=215}}</ref> It is also likely that she would have offered the girdle worn since puberty to these goddesses.<ref name=\":4\" /> These offerings signified the bride's separation from childhood and initiation into adulthood. They also established a bond between the bride and the gods, who provided protection for the bride during this transition.\n\n=== Gamos ===\nThe ''gamos'' was the wedding day, where a series of ceremonies surrounded the transfer of the bride from her father's home to that of her new husband. It started with a sacrifice, ''proteleia'', (premarital), which was for the gods to bless the two being wed. The day's rituals began with a nuptial bath which was given to the bride. This bath symbolized purification as well as fertility, and the water would have been delivered from a special location or type of container called the loutrophoros.<ref name=\":1\" /> The bride and groom then made offerings at the temple to ensure a fruitful future life.  A wedding feast at the home of the father of the bride<ref name=\":4\" /> would be attended by both families. However, men and women sat at different tables, the women would sit and wait until the men were done.'''<ref>Garland,Robert (1990).The Greek Way of Life. New York:Cornell University Press. pp.119-120</ref>'''  The most significant ritual of the wedding day was the ''anakalupteria'', which was the removal of the bride's veil.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0129&q1=Anacalyteria|title=History of Science: Cyclop\u00e6dia: Alguazil - anagram|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-01}}</ref> This signified the completion of the transfer to her husband's family.\n[[File:Wedding procession pyxis BM GR1920.12-21.1 by Marley Painter.jpg|thumb|Vase Painting of Wedding Procession]]\nThe woman consecrated the marriage by moving into the suitors living quarters.<ref>Flaceliere,Robert (1974).Daily Life in Greece.New York:Macmillan Publishing Co., INC..pp.62</ref> Once the woman stepped in the house the ''sunoikein'', \u2018living together\u2019, legalized the ''engysis'' that the suitor and the ''kyrios'' made. The day after the marriage it was typical for the friends of the bride to visit the new home. Though the reason is unknown, it is thought this may have been to ease the transition into their new life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe most important part was the marriage procession; a chariot driven by the groom bringing the still-veiled bride to his, and now her, home. They would be followed by relatives bringing gifts to the couple. The entire path would be lit by torches.<ref name=\":0\" /> The gifts given would often be painted with romantic images of marriage and newlyweds. It is likely that these images were chosen to ease the brides fear of her marriage to a man who would have often been a stranger.<ref name=\":1\" /> Upon arriving at the home they would be greeted by the mother-in-law and brought directly to the hearth of the home. At this point the couple would have been showered with dried fruits and nuts in order to bless them with fertility and prosperity. It was at this point where the groom would lead the bride to the bridal chamber and her veil would be ritually removed.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Epaulia ===\nThe epaulia took place on the day following the gamos. This is when the gifts were presented by the relatives of the couple and formally carried into the house. The gifts often were to reference the new sexual and domestic role of the wife. Some common gifts were jewellery, garments, perfume, pots, and furniture.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Spartan marriage ===\nSpartan marriage lacked the ceremony of Athens. Spartan women would be willfully captured and dressed as a man, also having her hair shaved as a man would. In this attire the bride would be laid alone in the dark where a sober groom would sneak in, remove her belt, and carry her to bed. As men were required to sleep in the barracks, he would leave shortly after. This process of sneaking in would continue nightly. The bride would help this process by planning when and where it was safe for them to meet. Sometimes this process would continue for so long that couples would have children before meeting in the daylight.<ref name=\":2\" /> It is also likely that Spartan women were not married as young as Athenian women, as Spartans wanted a bride to be in her prime with a developed body, not of a slight or immature frame.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the average marriage Spartan brides were most likely around 18, grooms around 25.<ref name=\":4\" /> There is no evidence to suggest if the consent of the families was obtained before this type of marriage, but as far as sources suggest it was accepted by all Spartans.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Gortyn Marriage ===\nLittle is known about marriage ceremonies in ancient Gortyn, but some evidence suggests that brides may have been quite young, and would still live in their father's house until they could manage their husband's household.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Married Life==\n\n=== In Ancient Athens ===\n[[File:Vase painting of women engaged in wool-working.jpeg|thumb|Black-Figure vase painting of women engaged in wool-working]]\nOnce married, domestic life began. The domestic space and duties were divided by male and female. The women would have their space upstairs, and the men downstairs. This helped keep women out of sight when any visitors or strangers were present in the space. Any entertainment would happen in the men's quarters to keep women hidden as well. It is thought that this seclusion of women may also have acted as a status symbol, as it was only wealthy families who could afford to have the space and staff to keep their women entirely secluded.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ypjb23YVIfYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Images+of+Women+in+Antiquity&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiFmImYvOXlAhXlQd8KHWcuBOMQ6wEIKzAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Images of Women in Antiquity|last=Cameron|first=Averil|last2=Kuhrt|first2=Am\u00e9lie|date=2013-04-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135859237|language=en}}</ref>  The seclusion of women also guarantees the legitimacy to any children the woman has.<ref name=\":5\" /> In the women's space both free and slave women would mix company, working together to produce textiles. Weaving and producing textiles were considered an incredibly important task for women, and they would often offered particularly fine works to the gods.<ref name=\":4\" /> If the women wished to work outside on warm days they were able to do so in an interior courtyard.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was also important for women to be able to oversee the tasks of the household and slaves in the absence of her husband. A husband would train his wife to do this properly, as men could potentially be gone for long periods of time to deal with concerns of either democratic or military importance.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== In Ancient Sparta ===\nRegardless of being married, Spartan men continued to live in the barracks until age thirty in times of both peace and war. This separation of husband and wife was thought to keep their relationship passionate, as opportunities for intercourse were scarce. It was thought that children conceived from the passion this separation fostered would be more energetic and vigorous than the average child.<ref name=\":1\" /> The only goal of Spartan marriage was reproduction, and there was many cases of agreements being made for children to be conceived outside of the just the husband and wife. If a husband was very old he may choose a young man to impregnate his wife on his behalf.<ref name=\":0\" /> All of these measures were taken to ensure the children were as impressive as possible, and superior to non-Spartan children. Spartan wives could not work to earn money, and were expected to support themselves from the land assigned to them that was worked by slaves or lower class workers. It is not certain if women were assigned land themselves, or oversaw the land assigned to their husbands.<ref name=\":1\" /> Spartan women would not mourn the deaths of husbands or sons who died in war, but rather take pride in their brave acts and heroic death.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== In Ancient Gortyan ===\nThough the [[Gortyn code]] gives limited information on married life in Gortyn, there is some evidence that women had more independence under the law than in places such as Athens or Sparta, though they were still not significant in comparison to the legal rights of men. Foxhall has stated that this law being in place however does not mean it was necessarily common practice.<ref name=\":3\" /> The laws also did not necessarily exist for the good of women or contribute to the overall well-being of women. Husbands and wives shared the income from their joint estates, but the woman kept sole control over her own property.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Unmarried Women ===\nIt is unknown how common it was for women to remain unmarried in ancient Greece, as single women would not have been of interest for male historians to write about. There are lines in [[Lysistrata]] by [[Aristophanes]] which allude to sadness the women of Athens have for women who have aged and are now unable to have legitimate children due to men having been gone so long to fight the [[Peloponnesian War]]. Unmarried women would have been financially dependent on their nearest male family member. If her family was poor, this may have caused the woman to turn to sex work in order to support herself.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Divorce ==\nAccording to scholars, divorce did not seem to be looked down upon in ancient Greece. Any negative reputation attributed to divorce would have been due to related scandals rather than the divorce itself.<ref name=\":0\" /> In ancient Athens, both husband and wife had the power to initiate a divorce.  The husband simply had to send his wife back to her father to end the marriage.<ref name=\"Cohn-Haft 1995 1\">{{cite journal|last=Cohn-Haft|first=Louis|year=1995|title=Divorce in Classical Athens|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=115|page=1}}</ref>  For the wife to obtain a divorce, she had to appear before the [[archon]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohn-Haft|first=Louis|year=1995|title=Divorce in Classical Athens|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=115|page=4}}</ref> Though divorces instigated by the wife would have had to have been registered with the archon, he did not seem to have the power to make any decision regarding it, and would simply take record of it.The wife would likely also have needed the support of her father and family.<ref name=\":4\" />  The wife was financially protected by laws which declared her dowry was to be returned in cases of divorce.<ref name=\":1\" /> There were two additional procedures by which people other than the couple could dissolve a marriage.  The first of these was divorce initiated by the father of the bride; the only example of this procedure to have survived comes from Demosthenes' speech ''[[Against Spudias]]''.<ref name=\"Cohn-Haft 1995 1\" />  This was only permitted if the wife had not borne her husband a child.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Greek Law|last=Cantarella|first=Eva|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|editor1-last=Gagarin|editor1-first=Michael|location=Cambridge|page=247|chapter=Gender, Sexuality, and Law|editor2-last=Cohen|editor2-first=David}}</ref>  Finally, if a woman became [[epikleros]] after her marriage, her closest male relative on her father's death was expected to end both his and her current marriage in order to marry her.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohn-Haft|first=Louis|year=1995|title=Divorce in Classical Athens|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=115|page=9}}</ref>\n\nIn cases where a woman was found to have committed adultery, the husband was obliged to divorce his wife under threat of disenfranchisement.<ref>Demosthenes, 59.86&#x2013;87</ref>  It has been suggested that in some cases, in order to avoid scandal, husbands may not have strictly followed this law, however.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roy|first=J.|year=1997|title=An Alternative Sexual Morality for Classical Athenians|journal=Greece & Rome|volume=44|issue=1|page=14}}</ref>  Upon divorce, a husband was required to pay back his wife's dowry.  If he did not, he was liable to pay 18% interest annually on it.<ref>{{cite book|title=Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves: Women in Classical Antiquity|last=Pomeroy|first=Sarah|publisher=Pimlico|year=1994|location=London|page=63}}</ref>\n\nAt Sparta, barrenness on the part of a wife seems to have been a ground for dismissal by the husband.<ref>Herodotus vi; 61</ref>\n\nIn Gortyn either husband or wife had the ability to divorce the other. When initiated by the husband he owed his wife a small financial compensation. Divorced wives kept their property, half of the crops from their own property, and half of what they had woven.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAnother common reason for marriages to end  was if someone was widowed. Women were often made widows when their husbands died in war, men commonly became widows as a result of death during childbirth. It was common for those who were divorced or widowed to be remarried.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Women in Classical Athens]]\n* [[Women in ancient Sparta]]\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{cite web|url=http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/consortium/ancientweddings3.html|title=Ancient Weddings|last=Powers|first=Jennifer|work=Classics Technology Center|publisher=AbleMedia|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}\n* {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A4YyVL0sygAC&lpg=PR1&pg=PA211#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion|last=Dillon|first=Matthew|publisher=London and New York:Routledge|year=2002|location=New York|pages=211\u2013215}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{SmithDGRA}}\n{{Ancient Greece topics| state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Ancient Greek law|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek society|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Marriage in classical antiquity]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek culture|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Marriage by culture|Greek]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Pyxis01_pushkin.jpg|right|thumb|250x250px|\"Wedding preparation\"]]\n'''Marriage in ancient Greece''' had less of a basis in personal relationships and more in social responsibility. The goal and focus of all marriages was intended to be reproduction, making marriage an issue of public interest. Marriages were usually arranged by the parents; on occasion professional matchmakers were used. Each city was politically independent and each had its own laws concerning marriage. For the marriage to be legal, the woman's father or guardian gave permission to a suitable male who could afford to marry. Orphaned daughters were usually married to uncles or cousins. Wintertime marriages were popular due to the significance of that time to Hera, the goddess of marriage. The couple participated in a ceremony which included rituals such as veil removal, but it was the couple living together that made the marriage legal.  Marriage was understood to be the official transition from childhood into adulthood for females.<ref name=\"WILLIAMSON 1998\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Sacred_and_the_Feminine_in_Ancient_G.html?id=YvvJtcFkRpcC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Sacred and the Feminine in Ancient Greece|last=WILLIAMSON|first=MALCOLM|date=1998|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415126632|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAvailable historical records on the subject focus exclusively on Athens or Sparta and primarily on the aristocratic class.

In keeping with this idea, the heroes of [[Homer]] never have more than one wife by law,<ref>Buttmann, Lexilogus, 73</ref> though they may be depicted with living with concubines, or having sexual relationships with one or more woman. According to [[Plato|Plato's]] ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'', any man who was not married by age thirty-five could be punished with a loss of [[civil rights]] and with financial consequences. He proposes that when choosing a wife, men should always consider the interests of the state over their own desires.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=peJWAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA618&lpg=PA618&dq=Platner,+Process,+&c.+vol.+ii.+p.+248&source=bl&ots=xKPoWGGxn3&sig=ACfU3U0NJrijdJv20iXvdo8-pkYlJL2TXg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwij_qWP7YvmAhWvVN8KHWebDFsQ6AEwAXoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities|last=Smith|first=William|last2=Anthon|first2=Charles|date=1843|publisher=Harper & Brothers|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== In Ancient Sparta ===\nIn Ancient [[Sparta]], the subordination of private interests and personal happiness to the good of the public was strongly encouraged by the laws of the city. One example of the legal importance of marriage can be found in the laws of Lycurgus of Sparta, which required that criminal proceedings be taken against those who married too late (''graphe opsigamiou'')<ref name=\"Onomasticon\">[[Julius Pollux|Pollux]], ''Onomasticon'' [https://archive.org/stream/pollucisonomasti02polluoft#page/118/mode/2up VIII.40].</ref> or unsuitably (''graphe kakogamiou''),<ref name=\"Onomasticon\" /> as well as against confirmed bachelors,<ref name=\":2\">[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Lycurgus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0047%3Achapter%3D15%3Asection%3D1 15.1].</ref> that is, against those who did not marry at all (''graphe agamiou'').<ref name=\"Onomasticon\" /> These regulations were founded on the generally recognised principle that it was the duty of every citizen to raise up a strong and healthy legitimate children to the state.<ref>Mulller, Dorians., iv. 4. \u00a7 3.</ref>\n\nThe Spartans considered ''teknopoioia'' (childbearing) as the main object of marriage. Because of this, whenever a woman had no children by her own husband,  the state ought to allow her to live with another man.<ref>[[Xenophon]]. de Rep. Lac. i. 8.</ref> On the same principle, and to prevent the end of the family line, Spartan King [[Anaxandridas II]] was allowed to live with two wives. He kept two separate establishments: this was a case of [[bigamy]], which, as [[Herodotus]]<ref>Herodotus. vi. 39, 40</ref> observes, was not at all consistent with Spartan nor indeed with [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] customs.\n\n=== In Ancient Athens ===\nFor a marriage to be viewed as legitimate in Athens, both the bride and groom had to be of free status, and after 451BCE, both had to be legitimate children of Athenian citizen families. Children of such unions would then be considered legitimate Athenian citizens when they came of age. Though the marriages were not legally recognized in Athens, wealthy [[metic]]<nowiki/>s would be considered married by those around them if they followed the same procedures and ceremonies. These couples would then act as any married Athenian couple would.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=N6uqZScTzSgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Title:+Studying+Gender+in+Classical+Antiquity&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIgIqmgublAhVGmuAKHU3mCccQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Studying Gender in Classical Antiquity|last=Foxhall|first=Lin|date=2013-05-09|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107067028|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== In Ancient Gortyn ===\nThe [[Gortyn code|Gortyn Code]] gives information on the law surrounding marriage in ancient [[Gortyn]]. Though the code records the law, scholar Sue Blundell reminds us we should not assume that this reflects a consistently held practice. The code seems to mostly address legality of marriages to consider the citizenship and political status of any children. Citizenship of the children of slave men and free women depended on where the children lived. Children were considered slaves if the couple lived and raised the children in the house of their father, making them property of his master. If the couple lived and raised children in the house of their mother they were considered free.<ref name=\":3\" /> Children born to two slave parents would be owned by their master.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/womeninancientgr0000blun|url-access=registration|title=Women in Ancient Greece|last=Blundell|first=Sue|last2=Blundell|first2=Susan|date=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674954731|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Arranged marriage ==\nMarriage was usually arranged between the parents of the bride and the groom. A man would choose his wife based on three things: the [[dowry]], which was given by the father of the bride to the groom; her presumed fertility; and her skills, such as [[weaving]]. There were usually no established age limits for marriage, although, with the exception of political marriages, waiting until childbearing age was considered proper decorum. Many women were married by the age of 14 or 16, while men commonly married around the age of 30.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe son-in-law and father-in-law became allies ({{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9}}, ''etai,'' \"clansmen\")<ref>Pl. of {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2}} ''etes''.</ref> through the exchange of gifts in preparation for the transfer of the bride.

N.p., n.d., July 2010. Web. 19 Mar. 2014.</ref>\n\n== Selecting a spouse ==\nIndependent of any public considerations, there were also private or personal reasons (particular to the ancients) which made marriage an obligation. Plato mentions one of these as the duty incumbent upon every individual to provide for a continuance of representatives to succeed himself as ministers of the Divinity (''toi Theoi [[Hyperetes|hyperetas]] an' hautou paradidonai''). Another was the desire felt by almost everyone, not merely to perpetuate his own name, but also to prevent his ''heritage being desolate, and his name being cut off'', and to leave someone who might make the customary offerings at his grave.<ref>[[Isaeus]] de Apoll. Hered. p.&nbsp;66. Bek.</ref> With this in mind, childless persons would sometimes [[Adoption|adopt]] unwanted children, including children who had been left to die.\n\nBy Athenian law, a citizen was not allowed to marry a foreign woman, nor conversely, under very severe penalties.<ref>Demosth. c.Neaer. p.&nbsp;1350</ref> However, proximity by blood (''anchisteia''), or consanguinity (''syngeneia''), was not, with few exceptions, a bar to marriage in any part of Greece; direct lineal descent was.<ref>Isaeus, de Oiron. her. p.&nbsp;72.</ref> Thus brothers were permitted to marry even with sisters, if not ''homometrioi'' or born from the same mother, as [[Cimon]] did with [[Elpinice]], though a connection of this sort appears to have been looked on with abhorrence.<ref>Becker, Charikles, vol. ii. p.&nbsp;448.</ref>\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that love ever played a significant role in selecting a legal spouse, though scholars have stated that it is likely there would have been affairs due to love.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Heiresses ==\n{{main|Epikleros}}In [[Athens]], in the case of a father dying [[intestate]] and without male children, his [[Beneficiary|heiress]] had no choice in marriage. The woman was not an heiress by modern day Western standards, as she could not actually own the land, however, she could not be separated from it. This meant that any man would have to first marry her in order to own the land.<ref name=\":4\" /> She was compelled by law to marry her nearest kinsman, usually a first cousin or an uncle that was capable of fathering children. If either the heiress and/or her potential husband are married they were required to divorce, unless the father had taken the precaution of adopting his daughter's current husband as his heir before his death.<ref name=\":4\" /> Under Solon's reforms couples of this nature were required to have sex a minimum of three times per month in order to concieve a male heir.'''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Brief History of Ancient Greece: Politics, Society, and Culture|last=Pomeroy|first=Sarah B.|last2=Burstein|first2=Stanley M.|last3=Donlan|first3=Walter|last4=Tolbert Roberts|first4=Jennifer|last5=Tandy|first5=David W.|last6=Tsouvala|first6=Georgia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=0190925302|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref>''' If the heiress were poor ([[Timocracy|thessa]]), the nearest unmarried kinsman either married her or portioned her suitably to her rank. When there were several co-heiresses, they were respectively married to their kinsmen, the nearest having the first choice (see [[Epikleros]]). In fact the heiress, together with her [[inheritance]], belonged to the kinsmen of the family, so that in early times a father could not give his daughter (if an heiress) in marriage without their consent.<ref>Muller, Dorians, ii. 10. \u00a7 4.</ref> This was not the case, however, in later Athenian law,<ref>Demosth., C. Steph.; p. 1134.</ref> by which a father was empowered to dispose of his daughter by will or otherwise; just as [[widow]]s were disposed of in marriage by the will of their husbands, who were still considered their rightful guardians (''[[Kurios|kyrioi]]'').<ref>Demosth. C. Aphob.; p. 814.</ref>\n\nThe same practice of marrying in the family (''[[oikos]]''), especially in the case of heiresses, prevailed in Sparta. These women were known as ''patrouchoi.'''''<ref name=\":3\" />''' [[Leonidas]] married the heiress of [[Cleomenes I]], as her ''anchisteia'', or next of kin, and [[Anaxandrides]] his own sister's daughter. Moreover, if a father had not determined himself concerning his daughter, the king's court decided who among the privileged persons or members of the same family should marry the heiress.<ref>Herodotus, vi. 57 ; Muller, /. c.</ref>\n\nLin Foxhall has cited evidence of a similar tradition in ancient [[Gortyn]], where the women were known as ''patroiokoi''.<ref name=\":3\" /> These girls would be married as young as 12 in order to produce an heir as quickly as possible. They could be claimed first by paternal uncles, and if there was no uncles to make the claim, then paternal cousins by order of age would have the next right to marry her. If still no one was able to claim her, she was free to marry who she pleased \"of the tribe from those who apply\". However, if she were to turn down the first claimant, she would owe him half of her inheritance.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Dates for marriage ==\nAncient Greeks primarily married in winter, during the month of ''Gamelion'', the equivalent of the month of January. Gamelion translates to \"Wedding-Month\". This was done in honour of the goddess of marriage, Hera. There were also special sacrifices made to her throughout the month.<ref name=\":4\" /> There are also many superstitions that say they married during full moons.\n\n== Engagement ==\nMatch-making among the ancients remained outside the dominion of political and legal regulation.  This was entirely left to the care and forethought of parents, or women who made a profession of it, and who were therefore called ''promnestriai'' or ''promnestrides''.<ref>Pollux, iii. 31.</ref> The profession, however, does not seem to have been thought very honourable or to have been held in repute, as being too nearly connected with that of a panderer (''proagogos'').<ref>Plato, Theaet. 2. p.&nbsp;150.</ref>\n\nIn [[ancient Athens]], marriages were arranged between the groom and the [[Kyrios|guardian (''kyrios'')]] of the bride.<ref>Flaceliere, Robert (1974). Daily Life in Greece. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., INC.. pp. 57.</ref> The ''kyrios'' would announce that he was allowing his daughter to marry.<ref name=\"Mireaux 215\">[[\u00c9mile Mireaux|Mireaux, Emile]] (1959). ''Daily Life in the Time of Homer''. New York: The Macmillan Company. pp. 215.</ref> The suitors would compete against each other for the daughters hand in marriage. They would bring extravagant gifts or compete by song, dance, or games.<ref name=\"Mireaux 215\" /> When the suitor was chosen for the daughter, the suitor and the father would proceed in a process known as ''engysis'', (\u2018giving of a pledge into the hand\u2019), which is where the two men would shake hands and say some ritual phrases.  The woman did not decide whom she would marry, only under very special circumstances, and she played no active role in the ''engysis'' process, which was not out of the norm for that time period.<ref>Flaceliere, Robert (1974). Daily Life in Greece. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., INC.. pp. 60.</ref> After the engysis, the two would make a binding promise, which occurred before the marriage.\n\nIn Athens the ''engyesis'', or [[betrothal]], was in fact indispensable to the complete validity of a [[marriage contract]]. It was made by the natural or legal guardian (''kyrios'') of the bride, usually her father, and attended by the relatives of both parties as witnesses. In view of this crowd the guardian would say \"I give you my daughter to sow for the purpose of producing legitimate children.\" to which the intended groom would respond \"I take her.\"'''<ref name=\":0\" />''' The law of Athens ordained that all children born from a marriage legally contracted in this respect should be legal ''gnesioi'',<ref>Demosth. c. Steph. p.&nbsp;1134</ref> and consequently, if sons, ''isomoiroi'', entitled to inherit equally or in gavel-kind. It would seem, therefore, that the issue of a marriage without espousals would lose their heritable rights, which depended on their being born ''ex astes kai engyetes gynaikos'', that is, from a citizen and a legally betrothed wife. The wife's [[dowry]] was also settled at the espousals.<ref>Meicr and Schoeman, p.&nbsp;415.</ref>\n\nIn Sparta the betrothal of the bride by her father or guardian (''kyrios'') was requisite as a preliminary of marriage, just as at Athens.<ref>Muller, Dorians, ii. 4. \u00a7 2.</ref> Another custom peculiar to the Spartans, and a relic of ancient times, was the seizure of the bride by her intended husband (see Herodotus, vi. 65), but of course with the sanction of her parents or guardians.<ref>Xen. de Rep. Lac. i. 5.</ref> She was not, however, immediately domiciled in her husband's house, but cohabited with him for some time clandestinely, till he brought her, and frequently her mother also, to his home. A similar custom appears to have prevailed in Crete, where, as we are told,<ref>Strabo, x. p.&nbsp;482</ref> the young men when dismissed from the ''[[agela]]'' of their fellows were immediately married, but did not take their wives home till some time afterwards. Muller suggests that the children of this furtive intercourse were called ''[[Partheniae|parthenioi]]''.\n\n== Marriage celebration ==\nThe ancient Greek marriage celebration consisted of a three part ceremony which lasted three days: the ''proaulia'', which was the pre-wedding ceremony, the ''gamos'', which was the actual wedding, and the ''epaulia'', which was the post-wedding ceremony. Most of the wedding was focused on the experience of the bride.<ref name=\"WILLIAMSON 1998\"/> In Athens specifically, most of the wedding would take place at night.\n\n=== Proaulia ===\nThe ''proaulia'' was the time when the bride would spend her last days with her mother, female relatives, and friends preparing for her wedding. The ''proaulia'' was usually a feast held at the bride\u2019s father\u2019s house. During this ceremony, the bride would make various offerings, called the ''proteleia'', to gods such as [[Artemis]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]]. \u201cToys would be dedicated to Artemis by adolescent girls prior to marriage, as a prelude to finding a husband and having children. More significant as a rite of passage before marriage was the ritual of the cutting and dedication of a lock of hair.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|title=Women and Girls in Classical Greek Religion|last=Dillon|first=Matthew|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=0415202728|location=New York|page=215}}</ref> It is also likely that she would have offered the girdle worn since puberty to these goddesses.<ref name=\":4\" /> These offerings signified the bride's separation from childhood and initiation into adulthood. They also established a bond between the bride and the gods, who provided protection for the bride during this transition.\n\n=== Gamos ===\nThe ''gamos'' was the wedding day, where a series of ceremonies surrounded the transfer of the bride from her father's home to that of her new husband. It started with a sacrifice, ''proteleia'', (premarital), which was for the gods to bless the two being wed. The day's rituals began with a nuptial bath which was given to the bride. This bath symbolized purification as well as fertility, and the water would have been delivered from a special location or type of container called the loutrophoros.<ref name=\":1\" /> The bride and groom then made offerings at the temple to ensure a fruitful future life.  A wedding feast at the home of the father of the bride<ref name=\":4\" /> would be attended by both families. However, men and women sat at different tables, the women would sit and wait until the men were done.'''<ref>Garland,Robert (1990).The Greek Way of Life. New York:Cornell University Press. pp.119-120</ref>'''  The most significant ritual of the wedding day was the ''anakalupteria'', which was the removal of the bride's veil.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0129&q1=Anacalyteria|title=History of Science: Cyclop\u00e6dia: Alguazil - anagram|website=digicoll.library.wisc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-01}}</ref> This signified the completion of the transfer to her husband's family.\n[[File:Wedding procession pyxis BM GR1920.12-21.1 by Marley Painter.jpg|thumb|Vase Painting of Wedding Procession]]\nThe woman consecrated the marriage by moving into the suitors living quarters.<ref>Flaceliere,Robert (1974).Daily Life in Greece.New York:Macmillan Publishing Co., INC..pp.62</ref> Once the woman stepped in the house the ''sunoikein'', \u2018living together\u2019, legalized the ''engysis'' that the suitor and the ''kyrios'' made. The day after the marriage it was typical for the friends of the bride to visit the new home. Though the reason is unknown, it is thought this may have been to ease the transition into their new life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe most important part was the marriage procession; a chariot driven by the groom bringing the still-veiled bride to his, and now her, home. They would be followed by relatives bringing gifts to the couple. The entire path would be lit by torches.<ref name=\":0\" /> The gifts given would often be painted with romantic images of marriage and newlyweds. It is likely that these images were chosen to ease the brides fear of her marriage to a man who would have often been a stranger.<ref name=\":1\" /> Upon arriving at the home they would be greeted by the mother-in-law and brought directly to the hearth of the home. At this point the couple would have been showered with dried fruits and nuts in order to bless them with fertility and prosperity. It was at this point where the groom would lead the bride to the bridal chamber and her veil would be ritually removed.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Epaulia ===\nThe epaulia took place on the day following the gamos. This is when the gifts were presented by the relatives of the couple and formally carried into the house. The gifts often were to reference the new sexual and domestic role of the wife. Some common gifts were jewellery, garments, perfume, pots, and furniture.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Spartan marriage ===\nSpartan marriage lacked the ceremony of Athens. Spartan women would be willfully captured and dressed as a man, also having her hair shaved as a man would. In this attire the bride would be laid alone in the dark where a sober groom would sneak in, remove her belt, and carry her to bed. As men were required to sleep in the barracks, he would leave shortly after. This process of sneaking in would continue nightly. The bride would help this process by planning when and where it was safe for them to meet. Sometimes this process would continue for so long that couples would have children before meeting in the daylight.<ref name=\":2\" /> It is also likely that Spartan women were not married as young as Athenian women, as Spartans wanted a bride to be in her prime with a developed body, not of a slight or immature frame.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the average marriage Spartan brides were most likely around 18, grooms around 25.<ref name=\":4\" /> There is no evidence to suggest if the consent of the families was obtained before this type of marriage, but as far as sources suggest it was accepted by all Spartans.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Gortyn Marriage ===\nLittle is known about marriage ceremonies in ancient Gortyn, but some evidence suggests that brides may have been quite young, and would still live in their father's house until they could manage their husband's household.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Married Life==\n\n=== In Ancient Athens ===\n[[File:Vase painting of women engaged in wool-working.jpeg|thumb|Black-Figure vase painting of women engaged in wool-working]]\nOnce married, domestic life began. The domestic space and duties were divided by male and female. The women would have their space upstairs, and the men downstairs. This helped keep women out of sight when any visitors or strangers were present in the space. Any entertainment would happen in the men's quarters to keep women hidden as well. It is thought that this seclusion of women may also have acted as a status symbol, as it was only wealthy families who could afford to have the space and staff to keep their women entirely secluded.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Ypjb23YVIfYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Images+of+Women+in+Antiquity&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiFmImYvOXlAhXlQd8KHWcuBOMQ6wEIKzAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Images of Women in Antiquity|last=Cameron|first=Averil|last2=Kuhrt|first2=Am\u00e9lie|date=2013-04-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135859237|language=en}}</ref>  The seclusion of women also guarantees the legitimacy to any children the woman has.<ref name=\":5\" /> In the women's space both free and slave women would mix company, working together to produce textiles. Weaving and producing textiles were considered an incredibly important task for women, and they would often offered particularly fine works to the gods.<ref name=\":4\" /> If the women wished to work outside on warm days they were able to do so in an interior courtyard.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was also important for women to be able to oversee the tasks of the household and slaves in the absence of her husband. A husband would train his wife to do this properly, as men could potentially be gone for long periods of time to deal with concerns of either democratic or military importance.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== In Ancient Sparta ===\nRegardless of being married, Spartan men continued to live in the barracks until age thirty in times of both peace and war. This separation of husband and wife was thought to keep their relationship passionate, as opportunities for intercourse were scarce. It was thought that children conceived from the passion this separation fostered would be more energetic and vigorous than the average child.<ref name=\":1\" /> The only goal of Spartan marriage was reproduction, and there was many cases of agreements being made for children to be conceived outside of the just the husband and wife. If a husband was very old he may choose a young man to impregnate his wife on his behalf.<ref name=\":0\" /> All of these measures were taken to ensure the children were as impressive as possible, and superior to non-Spartan children. Spartan wives could not work to earn money, and were expected to support themselves from the land assigned to them that was worked by slaves or lower class workers. It is not certain if women were assigned land themselves, or oversaw the land assigned to their husbands.<ref name=\":1\" /> Spartan women would not mourn the deaths of husbands or sons who died in war, but rather take pride in their brave acts and heroic death.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== In Ancient Gortyan ===\nThough the [[Gortyn code]] gives limited information on married life in Gortyn, there is some evidence that women had more independence under the law than in places such as Athens or Sparta, though they were still not significant in comparison to the legal rights of men. Foxhall has stated that this law being in place however does not mean it was necessarily common practice.<ref name=\":3\" /> The laws also did not necessarily exist for the good of women or contribute to the overall well-being of women. Husbands and wives shared the income from their joint estates, but the woman kept sole control over her own property.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Unmarried Women ===\nIt is unknown how common it was for women to remain unmarried in ancient Greece, as single women would not have been of interest for male historians to write about. There are lines in [[Lysistrata]] by [[Aristophanes]] which allude to sadness the women of Athens have for women who have aged and are now unable to have legitimate children due to men having been gone so long to fight the [[Peloponnesian War]]. Unmarried women would have been financially dependent on their nearest male family member. If her family was poor, this may have caused the woman to turn to sex work in order to support herself.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Divorce ==\nAccording to scholars, divorce did not seem to be looked down upon in ancient Greece. Any negative reputation attributed to divorce would have been due to related scandals rather than the divorce itself.<ref name=\":0\" /> In ancient Athens, both husband and wife had the power to initiate a divorce.  The husband simply had to send his wife back to her father to end the marriage.<ref name=\"Cohn-Haft 1995 1\">{{cite journal|last=Cohn-Haft|first=Louis|year=1995|title=Divorce in Classical Athens|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=115|page=1}}</ref>  For the wife to obtain a divorce, she had to appear before the [[archon]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohn-Haft|first=Louis|year=1995|title=Divorce in Classical Athens|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=115|page=4}}</ref> Though divorces instigated by the wife would have had to have been registered with the archon, he did not seem to have the power to make any decision regarding it, and would simply take record of it.The wife would likely also have needed the support of her father and family.<ref name=\":4\" />  The wife was financially protected by laws which declared her dowry was to be returned in cases of divorce.<ref name=\":1\" /> There were two additional procedures by which people other than the couple could dissolve a marriage.  The first of these was divorce initiated by the father of the bride; the only example of this procedure to have survived comes from Demosthenes' speech ''[[Against Spudias]]''.<ref name=\"Cohn-Haft 1995 1\" />  This was only permitted if the wife had not borne her husband a child.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Greek Law|last=Cantarella|first=Eva|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|editor1-last=Gagarin|editor1-first=Michael|location=Cambridge|page=247|chapter=Gender, Sexuality, and Law|editor2-last=Cohen|editor2-first=David}}</ref>  Finally, if a woman became [[epikleros]] after her marriage, her closest male relative on her father's death was expected to end both his and her current marriage in order to marry her.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohn-Haft|first=Louis|year=1995|title=Divorce in Classical Athens|journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies|volume=115|page=9}}</ref>\n\nIn cases where a woman was found to have committed adultery, the husband was obliged to divorce his wife under threat of disenfranchisement.<ref>Demosthenes, 59.86&#x2013;87</ref>  It has been suggested that in some cases, in order to avoid scandal, husbands may not have strictly followed this law, however.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roy|first=J.|year=1997|title=An Alternative Sexual Morality for Classical Athenians|journal=Greece & Rome|volume=44|issue=1|page=14}}</ref>  Upon divorce, a husband was required to pay back his wife's dowry.  If he did not, he was liable to pay 18% interest annually on it.<ref>{{cite book|title=Goddesses, Whores, Wives, and Slaves: Women in Classical Antiquity|last=Pomeroy|first=Sarah|publisher=Pimlico|year=1994|location=London|page=63}}</ref>\n\nAt Sparta, barrenness on the part of a wife seems to have been a ground for dismissal by the husband.<ref>Herodotus vi; 61</ref>\n\nIn Gortyn either husband or wife had the ability to divorce the other. When initiated by the husband he owed his wife a small financial compensation. Divorced wives kept their property, half of the crops from their own property, and half of what they had woven.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAnother common reason for marriages to end  was if someone was widowed. Women were often made widows when their husbands died in war, men commonly became widows as a result of death during childbirth. It was common for those who were divorced or widowed to be remarried.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Women in Classical Athens]]\n* [[Women in ancient Sparta]]\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{cite web|url=http://ablemedia.com/ctcweb/consortium/ancientweddings3.html|title=Ancient Weddings|last=Powers|first=Jennifer|work=Classics Technology Center|publisher=AbleMedia|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}\n* {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A4YyVL0sygAC&lpg=PR1&pg=PA211#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Girls and Women in Classical Greek Religion|last=Dillon|first=Matthew|publisher=London and New York:Routledge|year=2002|location=New York|pages=211\u2013215}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{SmithDGRA}}\n{{Ancient Greece topics| state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Ancient Greek law|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek society|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Marriage in classical antiquity]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek culture|Marriage]]\n[[Category:Marriage by culture|Greek]]\n", "name_user": "PohranicniStraze", "label": "safe", "comment": "sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_ancient_Greece"}

The [[rail gauge|gauge]] chosen was the Italian standard narrow gauge measurement of {{RailGauge|950mm}}, similar to many common narrow gauge railways under construction in Italy at the same time.\n\nWith the short building time and the simultaneous flow of some common equipment and materials to the national railway yards, e.g. metallic plate [[Railroad tie|ties]] (sleepers), it was necessary to acquire these from France to some extent.\n\nA previous Italian law from 1879 officially established the track gauges, which specified the use of {{RailGauge|1500mm}} and {{RailGauge|1000mm}} gauge track measured from the centre of the rails, or {{RailGauge|1445mm}} and {{RailGauge|950mm}}, respectively, on the inside faces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parovoz.com/spravka/gauges-en.php |title=Railroad Gauge Width |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717001706/http://parovoz.com/spravka/gauges-en.php |archivedate=17 July 2012  }}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:Litorrina railcar.JPG|thumb|left|Littorina railcar at Asmara train station]]\n[[File:AsmaraStazione.jpg|thumb|The railway station of Asmara in 1938, with passengers boarding a ''Littorina'']]\nConstruction began from the Red Sea port city of Massawa in 1887, heading towards the capital city of Asmara.  The \"Decauville\" railway was the first built, from Massaua to Saati, just 27&nbsp;km.<ref>[http://www.ferroviaeritrea.it/la_ferrovia_massauasaati.htm Railway Massaua-Saati, built in 1887\u20131888 (in italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012032531/http://www.ferroviaeritrea.it/la_ferrovia_massauasaati.htm |date=12 October 2013 }}</ref> Progress was slow, thanks to the long climb up the mountains to the high plateau of inland Eritrea, and the substantial civil engineering works required; the line reached Asmara in 1911.  It was extended to [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]] in 1922, [[Agat, Eritrea|Agat]] in 1925, [[Agordat]] in 1928, and finally Bishia in 1932, for a total length of {{convert|280|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Bishia (Biscia in Italian) proved to be the end, even though the builders had ambitions of reaching the [[Sudan Railways]] line. Mussolini's [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invasion of Ethiopia]] led to resources being diverted elsewhere, including the upgrading of the line from Massawa to Asmara to handle more traffic.\n\nBuilding the line from Massawa to Asmara was a significant undertaking. Even with the tighter turns and narrower right-of-way allowed by a narrow gauge railway, the line required 65 bridges (including a fourteen-arch viaduct crossing the [[Obel River]]) and 39 tunnels,<ref>[http://www.eritrea.be/railway.htm The Eritrean Railway]</ref> the longest being {{convert|320|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Even so, there were still grades of more than 3%.  The highest point on the railway is just east of Asmara at {{convert|2394|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.\n\nThe construction of the railway was considered a fine achievement of the first half of the twentieth century.<ref>[http://www.trainweb.org/eritrean/scrapbook/where/maps/map.jpg Detailed Map of the Railway between Massaua and Agordat in 1938]</ref>\n\n===In operation===\nIn 1935 it carried supplies for the Italian war effort in Ethiopia and the line saw 30 trains daily, while by 1965 the line was carrying nearly half a million passengers a year as well as 200,000 tons of freight. Things went downhill from there. Improvements to the road from Massawa to Asmara, and to the trucks and buses that used it, began to take traffic away from the railway.\n\nUntil 1941, the railway was Italian controlled, but the fortunes of war allowed the British to take control. After 1942 the railway (damaged during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|British occupation]] and by [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|Italian guerrillas]]) was abandoned from [[Agordat]] to Biscia.\n\nIn 1953 Eritrea was joined to Ethiopia in Federation as the British pulled out, giving Ethiopia a coastline, but starting off 40 years of unrest and eventually war. The first Director General of the railway was Yacob Zanios, a former railway executive from Dire Dawa, who was appointed by HIM Emperor Haile Sellassie to assume management of the railway from the British and organize, rebuild the infrastructure, and integrate the railway into the national transportation grid. Under the four-year leadership of Yacob Zanios, the railway became operational and a very successful enterprise.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were successful years for the railway, but in the 1970s the railway fell more and more out of use as the mismanagement of the railway and political unrest intensified, and in 1975 the railway was destroyed by the ruling [[Derg]] regime in Ethiopia. Much of the infrastructure was destroyed during the following years of war, and both sides used materials salvaged from the railway for fortification and other purposes.\n\n===Rebuilding===\n[[File:Eritrean Railway Map of March, 1998.svg|thumb|Between Arbaroba Station and Asmara the railway climbs at a steady 3.3%]]\nEritrea won its independence from Ethiopia in 1993, and in 1994 the Eritrean president declared that rebuilding the railway was a priority for the new nation. During the war years a spirit of self-reliance had been built up, and the Eritreans refused foreign loans and expensive rework. Instead, the Eritreans decided, they would rebuild what they had left with their own efforts. Rebuilding the line started, some work going into rebuilding the workshops and station in Asmara while others set to reconstructing the Massawa end. Renovation of the main line began from Massawa westbound, recovering rails and steel ties.\n\nAt the same time, restoration began on the remaining locomotives and rolling stock remaining after the conflict. Eleven steam locomotives survived, and at least six have been rebuilt to working order. In addition, several 1930s vintage Fiat 'Littorina' railcars survive and have been made operational, as well as two 1957 [[Krupp]]-built Bo-Bo diesels (the line's newest locomotives) and one of three surviving Drewry shunters, brought to the railway by the British during the war years. Finally, several road trucks have been converted to run on rail wheels. Much freight stock and a number of passenger cars also survive.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe line has been restored from Massawa to Asmara, but {{As of|2006|lc=on}} no scheduled services traverse the whole length of the line.  Charter trains for tourists now do, and regular train services exist in certain areas.  While the surviving equipment is sufficient for such a limited service, the purchase or building of more is necessary to provide a serious form of transportation over the length of the line. In 2007, The Eritrean Railroad Authority requested funding to continue the Italian-era plan to extend the route to [[Tesseney]] and provide an opportunity for Sudan to efficiently use the Port of Massawa. Mining companies in Eritrea have also inquired about use of the railway and its improvement.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070119/ts_afp/eritreatransportrail_070119161553 |title=Eritrean has sights on rail link to Sudan |date=19 January 2007 |accessdate=19 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129080034/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070119/ts_afp/eritreatransportrail_070119161553 |archivedate=29 January 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nThe surviving freight cars include a number of larger boxcars suitable for a limited freight service.\n\n===Equipment===\n\n====Steam locomotives====\nThree classes of steam locomotive still exist; one design of 0-4-0 shunter and two designs of 0-4-4-0 Mallet for line service.\n\n=====202 Series=====\n[[File:Eritrean Railway class 202 - 2008-11-04 edit 1.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of class 202 locomotives in the works in Asmara]]\nThese small 0-4-0 [[tank engine]]s were and are the standard shunter locomotives of the system, built between 1927 and 1937 by the firm of [[Societ\u00e0 Italiana Ernesto Breda|Breda]] in [[Milan]]. They have short side tanks, a rear coal bunker, and a unified, oval dome containing the steam dome inside a larger sand dome. This arrangement, popular worldwide in nations that favored the sand dome, helped both to insulate the steam dome and to keep the sand dry with the warmth. Large, prominent builder's plates adorn the domes. They utilise [[Walschaerts valve gear]] with [[piston|piston valves]] and [[superheater|superheating]], and are painted in the traditional European style of red below the running board, including frames and wheels, and black above, including boiler, cab, tanks etc. The purpose of the red paint is to make cracks and breakages in the locomotive's important running gear more obvious.\n[[File:Eritrean Railway class 440 - 2008-11-04.jpg|thumb|A class 440 locomotive, making the climb up to Asmara]]\nSix of these engines survive, of which two were in running order and four in storage awaiting restoration.\n\n=====440 Series=====\nOne of these early Mallet locomotives, which is a true Mallet and thus a compound, still exists in storage at the Asmara workshops. It was a 1915 product of [[Gio. Ansaldo & C.|Ansaldo]] in Genova.\n\n=====442 Series=====\nThese later, and much larger, compound Mallet locomotives were built by Ansaldo in Genova in 1938 to largely replace the earlier types, both the 440 Series and the unsuccessful 441 Series. The latter were simple locomotives (i.e., non-compound) and found liable to run out of steam on the heavy grades of the line. Four of them are still in existence of which three are in running order.\n[[File:Ansaldo 442 steam locomotive in Eritrea.JPG|thumb|An Ansaldo 442 steam locomotive built in 1938, used for transporting cargo from the port city of Massawa to the capital Asmara almost 2.5&nbsp;km higher. It is also a tourist attraction as the climb is steep and spectacular]]\n\nThese are the prime main-line steam locomotives of the railway, and are in high demand for tourist services. Two of them, double headed, are required to scale the steepest grades with a train of any length. Like the other locomotives they are tank engines with large side tanks and a rear coal bunker, under cover of the cab roof in this design.\n\n====Diesel locomotives====\nThe railway possesses five diesel locomotives. They are in the process of being returned to working order.\n\n=====Krupp Bo-Bo roadswitchers=====\nThe railway purchased two [[Krupp]]-built Bo-Bo 25D [[roadswitcher]]s of typical German offset-cab design in 1957, the newest motive power owned by the system and the only locomotives purchased after World War II. They are both still in working order. When the line's replacement is complete, it is intended to use them for hauling freight. The roadswitchers are painted in a creamy white with brown frames and trucks.\n\n=====Drewry shunters=====\nThree [[Drewry Car Co.]] built diesel [[shunter]]s are owned by the railway, and were brought to Eritrea by the British after their takeover in 1941. They were previously in service in the [[Sudan]] and were of a slightly wider gauge ({{RailGauge|1067mm}}) there; they were regauged to the railway's {{RailGauge|950mm}} gauge by turning them from an outside framed to an inside framed layout. Two are 0-6-0s and one is an 0-4-0; one of each is working while the third is under repair. They are painted in the same scheme as the Krupp units but lacking their bonnet sides and the engines are exposed.\n\n====Railcars====\nThree [[Fiat]]-built 'Littorina' railcars survived the civil war and two are in working order. They are [[Art Deco]] in style, with large Fiat radiators on the front. The bodies are painted in creamy white with grey underneath and roofs with red 'bumpers' on the ends and a red stripe separating the body color from the grey below. They are intended for tourist service; new vehicles will be built or bought for regular passenger service.\n\nIn addition, one 4-wheel railcar built by [[Brown Boveri]] of Switzerland exists out of service in the Asmara shops. It was apparently being used as a mobile generator car before the civil war. It was originally built for [[Mogadishu\u2013Villabruzzi Railway|Italian Somaliland Railway]].\n\nFor maintenance an improvised maintenance car is used, a four-wheeler built from a motor-cycle.\n\n====Rail trucks====\n{{main|Road-rail vehicle}}\nA number of Russian-built Orion light trucks have been converted to run on rail wheels. At present, they are being used in the railway's reconstruction.\n\n====Passenger cars====\nA number of [[passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]], all mounted on two [[Bogie|four-wheel trucks]], survive. They are fitted with wooden seats and have a platform at each end, one of which is for the [[brakeman]] \u2013 there are no continuous train brakes on the railway, and braking is either done with the locomotive's brakes or by manually applying the brakes on each car. They are now painted in an attractive livery of white with pale blue in a stripe above the windows and at the bottom of the bodywork.\n\n====Freight cars====\nAbandoned [[goods wagon]]s sit on sidings near Asmara, and are being restored. Priority is being given to the 8-wheel (2 x 4-wheel truck) boxcars and flatcars, but a large number of 4-wheel cars still exist.\n\n====Couplings and brakes====\nLocos and wagons are equipped with a [[Railway coupling#Buffers and chain|single centre buffer with a hook and screw chain]] underneath. There are no [[continuous brake]]s; instead a brakeman travels on each coach to apply braking when required.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Allen |first=Vic |date=July 2003 |title=The Land that's Gone Back to Steam |magazine=The Railway Magazine |pages=22\u201327}}</ref> However, a picture of a tank car shows hoses for some kind of continuous brake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/eritrean/scrapbook/who/ferrovie-coloniali/ch2-eritrea/carro.html|title=Il Materiale Rotabile|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Loading gauge====\nThe [[structure gauge]] of the Eritrean Railway is small. Therefore, two test runs, one in 2006 another one in spring 2010 took place when [[Intermodal container|ISO containers]] were carried on traditional [[Flatcar|flat wagons]] through all the tunnels along the line.<ref>Bernd Seiler: ''Eritrea \u2013 Eisenbahn zwischen Vergangenheit und Zukunft''.

The cableway was the longest of its kind in the world at the time of its inauguration. It had 13 stations with diesel engines, with 1620 little transport wagons. The [[United Kingdom|British]] later dismantled it during their eleven-year occupation, after defeating Italy in [[World War II]].\n\n===Mersa Fatma\u2013Colulli Railway===\nA {{convert|74.5|km}} long {{RailGauge|600mm|lk=on}} gauge [[potash]] transport railway<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/eritrean/scrapbook/when/building/building.html|title=Building the line|accessdate=24 March 2009}}</ref> located between [[Massawa]] and [[Assab]]. A {{RailGauge|600mm}} gauge line was built in 1905 by the Italians inside the port of Mersa Fatma and from it into the hinterland until [[Colluli mine|Colluli]] near the current Ethiopian border in the [[Danakil depression]] with the terminus roughly 35 meters below sea level.<ref>[http://robevan.xoom.it//robevan/mappe/aoi_1936/menu_AfOrIt_1936.htm Map of Italian Eritrea in 1936 with detailed railway route to Colulli (click on sections 4 and 7)]</ref> Potash production is said to have reached about 50,000 metric tons after this railway was constructed. Production was stopped some years after [[World War I]] owing to large-scale supplies mainly from [[Germany]]. Unsuccessful attempts to reopen successful production were made in the period 1920\u20131941 by the Italian government. Between the years 1925\u20131929 an Italian company mined 25,000 tons of [[sylvite]], averaging 70% KCl, which was transported by rail to Mersa Fatma. This was the main source of potash in Eritrea and had to cease most operations because of the [[Great Depression]] of 1929.<ref>Neil Robinson.

It was extended to [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]] in 1922, [[Agat, Eritrea|Agat]] in 1925, [[Agordat]] in 1928, and finally Bishia in 1932, for a total length of {{convert|280|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. Bishia (Biscia in Italian) proved to be the end, even though the builders had ambitions of reaching the [[Sudan Railways]] line. Mussolini's [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invasion of Ethiopia]] led to resources being diverted elsewhere, including the upgrading of the line from Massawa to Asmara to handle more traffic.\n\nBuilding the line from Massawa to Asmara was a significant undertaking. Even with the tighter turns and narrower right-of-way allowed by a narrow gauge railway, the line required 65 bridges (including a fourteen-arch viaduct crossing the [[Obel River]]) and 39 tunnels,<ref>[http://www.eritrea.be/railway.htm The Eritrean Railway]</ref> the longest being {{convert|320|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Even so, there were still grades of more than 3%.  The highest point on the railway is just east of Asmara at {{convert|2394|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.\n\nThe construction of the railway was considered a fine achievement of the first half of the twentieth century.<ref>[http://www.trainweb.org/eritrean/scrapbook/where/maps/map.jpg Detailed Map of the Railway between Massaua and Agordat in 1938]</ref>\n\n===In operation===\nIn 1935 it carried supplies for the Italian war effort in Ethiopia and the line saw 30 trains daily, while by 1965 the line was carrying nearly half a million passengers a year as well as 200,000 tons of freight. Things went downhill from there. Improvements to the road from Massawa to Asmara, and to the trucks and buses that used it, began to take traffic away from the railway.\n\nUntil 1941, the railway was Italian controlled, but the fortunes of war allowed the British to take control. After 1942 the railway (damaged during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|British occupation]] and by [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|Italian guerrillas]]) was abandoned from [[Agordat]] to Biscia.\n\nIn 1953 Eritrea was joined to Ethiopia in Federation as the British pulled out, giving Ethiopia a coastline, but starting off 40 years of unrest and eventually war. The first Director General of the railway was Yacob Zanios, a former railway executive from Dire Dawa, who was appointed by HIM Emperor Haile Sellassie to assume management of the railway from the British and organize, rebuild the infrastructure, and integrate the railway into the national transportation grid.

Eleven steam locomotives survived, and at least six have been rebuilt to working order. In addition, several 1930s vintage Fiat 'Littorina' railcars survive and have been made operational, as well as two 1957 [[Krupp]]-built Bo-Bo diesels (the line's newest locomotives) and one of three surviving Drewry shunters, brought to the railway by the British during the war years.

They utilise [[Walschaerts valve gear]] with [[piston|piston valves]] and [[superheater|superheating]], and are painted in the traditional European style of red below the running board, including frames and wheels, and black above, including boiler, cab, tanks etc. The purpose of the red paint is to make cracks and breakages in the locomotive's important running gear more obvious.\n[[File:Eritrean Railway class 440 - 2008-11-04.jpg|thumb|A class 440 locomotive, making the climb up to Asmara]]\nSix of these engines survive, of which two were in running order and four in storage awaiting restoration.\n\n=====440 Series=====\nOne of these early Mallet locomotives, which is a true Mallet and thus a compound, still exists in storage at the Asmara workshops. It was a 1915 product of [[Gio. Ansaldo & C.|Ansaldo]] in Genova.\n\n=====442 Series=====\nThese later, and much larger, compound Mallet locomotives were built by Ansaldo in Genova in 1938 to largely replace the earlier types, both the 440 Series and the unsuccessful 441 Series. The latter were simple locomotives (i.e., non-compound) and found liable to run out of steam on the heavy grades of the line. Four of them are still in existence of which three are in running order.\n[[File:Ansaldo 442 steam locomotive in Eritrea.JPG|thumb|An Ansaldo 442 steam locomotive built in 1938, used for transporting cargo from the port city of Massawa to the capital Asmara almost 2.5&nbsp;km higher. It is also a tourist attraction as the climb is steep and spectacular]]\n\nThese are the prime main-line steam locomotives of the railway, and are in high demand for tourist services. Two of them, double headed, are required to scale the steepest grades with a train of any length. Like the other locomotives they are tank engines with large side tanks and a rear coal bunker, under cover of the cab roof in this design.\n\n====Diesel locomotives====\nThe railway possesses five diesel locomotives. They are in the process of being returned to working order.\n\n=====Krupp Bo-Bo roadswitchers=====\nThe railway purchased two [[Krupp]]-built Bo-Bo 25D [[roadswitcher]]s of typical German offset-cab design in 1957, the newest motive power owned by the system and the only locomotives purchased after World War II. They are both still in working order. When the line's replacement is complete, it is intended to use them for hauling freight. The roadswitchers are painted in a creamy white with brown frames and trucks.\n\n=====Drewry shunters=====\nThree [[Drewry Car Co.]] built diesel [[shunter]]s are owned by the railway, and were brought to Eritrea by the British after their takeover in 1941. They were previously in service in the [[Sudan]] and were of a slightly wider gauge ({{RailGauge|1067mm}}) there; they were regauged to the railway's {{RailGauge|950mm}} gauge by turning them from an outside framed to an inside framed layout. Two are 0-6-0s and one is an 0-4-0; one of each is working while the third is under repair. They are painted in the same scheme as the Krupp units but lacking their bonnet sides and the engines are exposed.\n\n====Railcars====\nThree [[Fiat]]-built 'Littorina' railcars survived the civil war and two are in working order. They are [[Art Deco]] in style, with large Fiat radiators on the front. The bodies are painted in creamy white with grey underneath and roofs with red 'bumpers' on the ends and a red stripe separating the body color from the grey below. They are intended for tourist service; new vehicles will be built or bought for regular passenger service.\n\nIn addition, one 4-wheel railcar built by [[Brown Boveri]] of Switzerland exists out of service in the Asmara shops. It was apparently being used as a mobile generator car before the civil war. It was originally built for [[Mogadishu\u2013Villabruzzi Railway|Italian Somaliland Railway]].\n\nFor maintenance an improvised maintenance car is used, a four-wheeler built from a motor-cycle.\n\n====Rail trucks====\n{{main|Road-rail vehicle}}\nA number of Russian-built Orion light trucks have been converted to run on rail wheels. At present, they are being used in the railway's reconstruction.\n\n====Passenger cars====\nA number of [[passenger car (rail)|passenger cars]], all mounted on two [[Bogie|four-wheel trucks]], survive. They are fitted with wooden seats and have a platform at each end, one of which is for the [[brakeman]] \u2013 there are no continuous train brakes on the railway, and braking is either done with the locomotive's brakes or by manually applying the brakes on each car. They are now painted in an attractive livery of white with pale blue in a stripe above the windows and at the bottom of the bodywork.\n\n====Freight cars====\nAbandoned [[goods wagon]]s sit on sidings near Asmara, and are being restored. Priority is being given to the 8-wheel (2 x 4-wheel truck) boxcars and flatcars, but a large number of 4-wheel cars still exist.\n\n====Couplings and brakes====\nLocos and wagons are equipped with a [[Railway coupling#Buffers and chain|single centre buffer with a hook and screw chain]] underneath. There are no [[continuous brake]]s; instead a brakeman travels on each coach to apply braking when required.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Allen |first=Vic |date=July 2003 |title=The Land that's Gone Back to Steam |magazine=The Railway Magazine |pages=22\u201327}}</ref> However, a picture of a tank car shows hoses for some kind of continuous brake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/eritrean/scrapbook/who/ferrovie-coloniali/ch2-eritrea/carro.html|title=Il Materiale Rotabile|accessdate=16 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Loading gauge====\nThe [[structure gauge]] of the Eritrean Railway is small. Therefore, two test runs, one in 2006 another one in spring 2010 took place when [[Intermodal container|ISO containers]] were carried on traditional [[Flatcar|flat wagons]] through all the tunnels along the line.<ref>Bernd Seiler: ''Eritrea \u2013 Eisenbahn zwischen Vergangenheit und Zukunft''.

The cableway was the longest of its kind in the world at the time of its inauguration. It had 13 stations with diesel engines, with 1620 little transport wagons. The [[United Kingdom|British]] later dismantled it during their eleven-year occupation, after defeating Italy in [[World War II]].\n\n===Mersa Fatma\u2013Colulli Railway===\nA {{convert|74.5|km}} long {{RailGauge|600mm|lk=on}} gauge [[potash]] transport railway<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/eritrean/scrapbook/when/building/building.html|title=Building the line|accessdate=24 March 2009}}</ref> located between [[Massawa]] and [[Assab]]. A {{RailGauge|600mm}} gauge line was built in 1905 by the Italians inside the port of Mersa Fatma and from it into the hinterland until [[Colluli mine|Colluli]] near the current Ethiopian border in the [[Danakil depression]] with the terminus roughly 35 meters below sea level.<ref>[http://robevan.xoom.it//robevan/mappe/aoi_1936/menu_AfOrIt_1936.htm Map of Italian Eritrea in 1936 with detailed railway route to Colulli (click on sections 4 and 7)]</ref> Potash production is said to have reached about 50,000 metric tons after this railway was constructed. Production was stopped some years after [[World War I]] owing to large-scale supplies mainly from [[Germany]]. Unsuccessful attempts to reopen successful production were made in the period 1920\u20131941 by the Italian government. Between the years 1925\u20131929 an Italian company mined 25,000 tons of [[sylvite]], averaging 70% KCl, which was transported by rail to Mersa Fatma. This was the main source of potash in Eritrea and had to cease most operations because of the [[Great Depression]] of 1929.<ref>Neil Robinson.

Australian captain [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] was named the player of the series, having scored 626 runs at an [[Batting average (cricket)|average]] of 125.20. In the second Test match, Clarke, with 329 not out, scored the 25th [[List of Test cricket triple centuries|triple century]] in Test match cricket.  The third Test match saw [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]] bring up a century in just 69 deliveries, setting a new record for the fastest Test century by an opening batsman. In the fourth Test, Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke compiled a fourth wicket partnership of 386 runs, the highest partnership in Tests between Australia and India, or in Tests at the Adelaide Oval. Following the Test series, The T20I series was held which was drawn 1\u20131. The tour concluded with the ODI tri-series with India finishing last in the ODI tri-series, with three wins, one tie and four losses from its eight ODIs and did not make it to the best of three finals.\n\n==Background==\nBy mid-2011, the [[Indian cricket team]] was enjoying unprecedented success, winning the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] held at home, while also being the No. 1 Test team, which they had achieved in 2009.<ref>imesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/series-tournament/sri-lanka-in-india-2009/top-stories/Finally-Team-India-is-No-1-in-Test-cricket/articleshow/5308844.cms</ref> They proved to be undefeatable at home as always, but also enjoyed success away, especially beyond the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]] such as in [[Indian cricket team in South Africa in 2010-11|South Africa]] in late 2010, where for the first time ever, the Indian cricket team did not lose a Test series there. The team, led by [[wicketkeeper]]-[[batsman]] [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]], was widely praised by media and former cricketers, and Dhoni's captaincy was also considered by some experts to be one of the reasons for India's success. However, this success was turned upside down in their tour to [[Indian cricket team in England in 2011|England in 2011]]. It was widely expected that India would win the Test and ODI series there, by light of their recent success. However, their weaknesses in their bowling and batting were completely exposed by the [[England national cricket team|Englishmen]] and they lost all the 4 Tests, losing their No. 1 Test status to England.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/14516554</ref> Despite the debacle in England, it was widely expected that India would retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after the series in Australia, as the team's previous 2 tours Down Under were ok with achieving 2 test victories and that the Australian cricket team was now quite weak. Also the nucleus of the Indian side selected for the tour had a number of players who had a good record in Australia. India had most recently won a five-match ODI home series against England 5\u20130 in October and a three-Test home series against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] 2\u20130 in November, further improving expectations.\n\nThe Australian team, however, was undergoing a period of transition, with many of their successful players like [[Shane Warne]], [[Adam Gilchrist]], [[Matthew Hayden]] and [[Glenn McGrath]] having retired a couple of years prior and former captain and batting mainstay [[Ricky Ponting]] woefully out-of-form. The team was now captained by [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] and had many inexperienced players. Australia's recent record was not inspiring, meekly losing the [[2010\u201311 Ashes|Ashes]] series, not going to the semifinals of the [[Cricket World Cup]] for the first time since 1992, and drawing two prior Test series against [[Australian cricket team in South Africa in 2011\u201312|South Africa away]] and against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand at home]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://m.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/controversial-dismissals-leave-india-with-the-momentum-20111226-1p9yt.html|title=Controversial dismissals leave India with the momentum|last=Gleeson|first=Michael|date=26 December 2011|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref> Their coach [[Tim Nielsen]] had been sacked<ref>http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/selectors-andrew-hilditch-and-greg-chappell-plus-coach-tim-nielsen-sacked-as-part-of-argus-review/story-fn2mcu3x-1226118158097</ref> and replaced with former [[South Africa national cricket team|South African]] coach [[Mickey Arthur]].<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/arthur--picked-as--australias-new-head--cricket-coach-20111122-1ns27.html</ref> Not many cricket experts and media, even in Australia, were expecting an Australian resurgence against a very formidable India.\n\nAlso, this was batting maestro [[Sachin Tendulkar]]'s fifth series in Australia, having been a member of the Indian side in its previous tours Down Under in 1991, 1999, 2003 and 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_will-tendulkar-dravid-laxman-write-a-better-end-for-themselves_1629815|title=Will Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman write a better end for themselves?|last=Deba Prasad Dhar|date=25 December 2011|work=Daily News & Analysis|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> At the beginning of the tour, Tendulkar had scored 99 centuries in international cricket; the tour gave him the opportunity to become the first player in the history of the sport to reach score his hundredth century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/cricket/sachin-tendulkar-tipped-to-score-hundreth-hundred-during-the-scgs-100th-test/story-fn67wltq-1226233523402|title=Sachin Tendulkar tipped to score 100th century at the SCG|last=Conn|first=Malcolm|date=31 December 2011|work=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIndia made two changes to its bowling attack from the third test of the West Indies series, with pacemen [[Zaheer Khan]] and [[Umesh Yadav]] replacing paceman [[Varun Aaron]] and spinner [[Pragyan Ojha]], and fielding an unchanged batting lineup.

''[[The Australian]]'' wrote under the headline \"India's pillars of strength reduced to useless rubble\" <blockquote>Dhoni is not the only shaky pillar of what only eight months ago was the number one cricket nation in the world. VVS Laxman, once the scourge of Australian bowlers, is being flayed himself at home after scores of 2,1, 2, 66, 31 and 0. Virender Sehwag, who warmed up for this series by scoring the fastest double century in One-Day International history, also is trending south faster than Scott and Amundsen, having followed up his whirlwind 67 in Melbourne with innings of 7, 30, 4, 0 and 10. Worst of all, Dhoni has failed with the bat. The Indian captain is no thunderer at the best of times \u2013 neither is coach Duncan Fletcher, which may be part of the problem \u2013 but how can he demand more of his batsmen when he has nowhere to hide behind scores of 6, 23, 57no, 2, 12 and 2? India has not had a single century-maker in the past three Tests,</blockquote> The [[Daily Telegraph]] said that India's performance was \"so bad that the first question that came Michael Clarke's way at the press conference was 'did it feel as if you were playing Bangladesh?'\". The newspaper also played up Dhoni's one-match ban due to the Indian team's slow over-rate in the third Test. Under the headline 'Dhoni dumped from Adelaide Test', the newspaper wrote, \"India's shambolic tour of Australia plunged into unprecedented disarray when their captain MS Dhoni was sensationally banned from playing in the final Test due to slow over rates\". The [[Herald Sun]] wrote about how Australia built up a team after the Ashes humiliation last year while sarcastically mentioning the visiting players skipping practice sessions in the tour.<blockquote>As painful as it was, getting flogged in last year's Ashes may be remembered as the recession Australia had to have. Nothing is being taken for granted in Australian cricket any more. The new coaching unit is working well under head coach Mickey Arthur and Australia has worked hard to freshen up every aspect of its game. India, by contrast, just lobs along, its players pocketing millions each year and too spoilt to make major sacrifices. It's appropriate that many Indian players spent a lot of time last week sitting under trees at training, because their entire Test match game is being left in the shade.</blockquote>\n\nThe Indian tour to Australia was the last international series for Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman. Dravid announced his retirement from international cricket soon after the tour<ref>[http://www.kentcricket.co.uk/news/rahul-dravid-announces-his-retirement Rahul Dravid Announces His Retirement]</ref> and Laxman announced his retirement after selecting him for two match home series against New-Zealand.   \n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/download/423882.html Download ICC's Future tours programme]\n\n{{International cricket tours of Australia}}\n{{International cricket in 2011-12}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Indian cricket team in Australia in 2011-12}}\n[[Category:Indian cricket tours of Australia|2011-12]]\n[[Category:2011\u201312 Australian cricket season]]\n[[Category:International cricket competitions in 2011\u201312]]\n[[Category:2011 in Indian cricket]]\n[[Category:2012 in Indian cricket]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=May 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2014}}\n{{Infobox cricket tour\n| series_name              = Indian cricket team in Australia in 2011\u201312\n| team1_image              = Flag of Australia.svg\n| team1_name               = Australia\n| team2_image              = Flag of India.svg\n| team2_name               = India\n| from_date                = 15 December 2011\n| to_date                  = 28 February 2012\n| team1_captain            = [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] (Tests)<br />[[George Bailey (cricketer, born 1982)|George Bailey]] (T20Is)\n| team2_captain            = [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni|MS Dhoni]] (1st\u20133rd Tests/T20Is)<br />[[Virender Sehwag]] (4th Test)\n| no_of_tests              = 4\n| team1_tests_won          = 4\n| team2_tests_won          = 0\n| team1_tests_most_runs    = [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] (626)\n| team2_tests_most_runs    = [[Virat Kohli]] (300)\n| team1_tests_most_wickets = [[Ben Hilfenhaus]] (27)\n| team2_tests_most_wickets = [[Zaheer Khan]] (15)\n| player_of_test_series    = [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] (Aus)\n| no_of_twenty20s              = 2\n| team1_twenty20s_won          = 1\n| team2_twenty20s_won          = 1\n| team1_twenty20s_most_runs    = [[Matthew Wade]] (104)\n| team2_twenty20s_most_runs    = [[Gautam Gambhir]] (76)\n| team1_twenty20s_most_wickets = [[Daniel Christian]] (2)<br />[[David Hussey]] (2)<br />[[Brad Hogg]] (2)\n| team2_twenty20s_most_wickets = [[Rahul Sharma (cricketer, born 1986)|Rahul Sharma]] (3)\n| player_of_twenty20_series    =\n}}\nThe [[Indian cricket team]] toured [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] from 15 December 2011 to 28 February 2012.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/team/6.html?template=fixtures Indian cricket team in Australia 2011\u201312]''[[ESPNCricinfo]]'' Retrieved 4 August 2011.</ref> The tour included four [[Test cricket|Tests]] to contest the [[Border\u2013Gavaskar Trophy]] (which was held by India at the start of the tour),<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/series/464518.html Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2010/11]</ref> two [[Twenty20]]s (T20Is),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-india-2011/content/series/518944.html?template=fixtures |title=India tour of Australia 2011/12 |accessdate=21 June 2011 |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo }}</ref><ref>[http://cricket.oneindia.in/schedules/series/IndiainAustralia2011-12.html Indian cricket team in Australia 2011/12] Retrieved 4 August 2011.</ref> and eight ODIs as part of the [[2011\u201312 Commonwealth Bank Series|Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series]] which also involved [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]].<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/story/518929.html Tri-series returns to Australia] Retrieved 17 December 2011</ref>\n\nAustralian won the four Test series in a 4\u20130 whitewash to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Australian captain [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] was named the player of the series, having scored 626 runs at an [[Batting average (cricket)|average]] of 125.20. In the second Test match, Clarke, with 329 not out, scored the 25th [[List of Test cricket triple centuries|triple century]] in Test match cricket.  The third Test match saw [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]] bring up a century in just 69 deliveries, setting a new record for the fastest Test century by an opening batsman. In the fourth Test, Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke compiled a fourth wicket partnership of 386 runs, the highest partnership in Tests between Australia and India, or in Tests at the Adelaide Oval. Following the Test series, The T20I series was held which was drawn 1\u20131. The tour concluded with the ODI tri-series with India finishing last in the ODI tri-series, with three wins, one tie and four losses from its eight ODIs and did not make it to the best of three finals.\n\n==Background==\nBy mid-2011, the [[Indian cricket team]] was enjoying unprecedented success, winning the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] held at home, while also being the No. 1 Test team, which they had achieved in 2009.<ref>imesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/series-tournament/sri-lanka-in-india-2009/top-stories/Finally-Team-India-is-No-1-in-Test-cricket/articleshow/5308844.cms</ref> They proved to be undefeatable at home as always, but also enjoyed success away, especially beyond the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]] such as in [[Indian cricket team in South Africa in 2010-11|South Africa]] in late 2010, where for the first time ever, the Indian cricket team did not lose a Test series there. The team, led by [[wicketkeeper]]-[[batsman]] [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]], was widely praised by media and former cricketers, and Dhoni's captaincy was also considered by some experts to be one of the reasons for India's success. However, this success was turned upside down in their tour to [[Indian cricket team in England in 2011|England in 2011]]. It was widely expected that India would win the Test and ODI series there, by light of their recent success. However, their weaknesses in their bowling and batting were completely exposed by the [[England national cricket team|Englishmen]] and they lost all the 4 Tests, losing their No. 1 Test status to England.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/14516554</ref> Despite the debacle in England, it was widely expected that India would retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after the series in Australia, as the team's previous 2 tours Down Under were ok with achieving 2 test victories and that the Australian cricket team was now quite weak. Also the nucleus of the Indian side selected for the tour had a number of players who had a good record in Australia. India had most recently won a five-match ODI home series against England 5\u20130 in October and a three-Test home series against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] 2\u20130 in November, further improving expectations.\n\nThe Australian team, however, was undergoing a period of transition, with many of their successful players like [[Shane Warne]], [[Adam Gilchrist]], [[Matthew Hayden]] and [[Glenn McGrath]] having retired a couple of years prior and former captain and batting mainstay [[Ricky Ponting]] woefully out-of-form. The team was now captained by [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] and had many inexperienced players. Australia's recent record was not inspiring, meekly losing the [[2010\u201311 Ashes|Ashes]] series, not going to the semifinals of the [[Cricket World Cup]] for the first time since 1992, and drawing two prior Test series against [[Australian cricket team in South Africa in 2011\u201312|South Africa away]] and against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand at home]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://m.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/controversial-dismissals-leave-india-with-the-momentum-20111226-1p9yt.html|title=Controversial dismissals leave India with the momentum|last=Gleeson|first=Michael|date=26 December 2011|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref> Their coach [[Tim Nielsen]] had been sacked<ref>http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/selectors-andrew-hilditch-and-greg-chappell-plus-coach-tim-nielsen-sacked-as-part-of-argus-review/story-fn2mcu3x-1226118158097</ref> and replaced with former [[South Africa national cricket team|South African]] coach [[Mickey Arthur]].<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/arthur--picked-as--australias-new-head--cricket-coach-20111122-1ns27.html</ref> Not many cricket experts and media, even in Australia, were expecting an Australian resurgence against a very formidable India.\n\nAlso, this was batting maestro [[Sachin Tendulkar]]'s fifth series in Australia, having been a member of the Indian side in its previous tours Down Under in 1991, 1999, 2003 and 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_will-tendulkar-dravid-laxman-write-a-better-end-for-themselves_1629815|title=Will Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman write a better end for themselves?|last=Deba Prasad Dhar|date=25 December 2011|work=Daily News & Analysis|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref> At the beginning of the tour, Tendulkar had scored 99 centuries in international cricket; the tour gave him the opportunity to become the first player in the history of the sport to reach score his hundredth century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/cricket/sachin-tendulkar-tipped-to-score-hundreth-hundred-during-the-scgs-100th-test/story-fn67wltq-1226233523402|title=Sachin Tendulkar tipped to score 100th century at the SCG|last=Conn|first=Malcolm|date=31 December 2011|work=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=30 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIndia made two changes to its bowling attack from the third test of the West Indies series, with pacemen [[Zaheer Khan]] and [[Umesh Yadav]] replacing paceman [[Varun Aaron]] and spinner [[Pragyan Ojha]], and fielding an unchanged batting lineup.

India won the toss and chose to bat. The Australian bowlers dominated the Indian batsman, who lost wickets regularly through the day. The half-century partnership between [[Ravichandran Ashwin]] (20) and top-scorer [[MS Dhoni]] (57*) for the seventh wicket provided the only resistance, and India was dismissed for 191 after tea. [[James Pattinson]] (4/43) was the top bowler for Australia, taking the wickets of four of India's top five batsmen.\n\nIn reply, the Australian top order collapsed to 3/37, with [[Zaheer Khan]] taking all three wickets and at one point on a hat-trick. [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] and [[Ricky Ponting]] then steadied the Australian innings, adding 79 runs without loss to take Australia to 3/116 at stumps.\n\n;Day 2\nAustralian batting dominated the second day.

The top two teams at the end of the round robin stage then participated in a best-of-three finals series.\n\nIn a close round robin, Sri Lanka and Australia qualified for the finals series, each with 19 points in the group stage; India finished last with 15 points, and did not qualify for the finals.

''[[The Australian]]'' wrote under the headline \"India's pillars of strength reduced to useless rubble\" <blockquote>Dhoni is not the only shaky pillar of what only eight months ago was the number one cricket nation in the world. VVS Laxman, once the scourge of Australian bowlers, is being flayed himself at home after scores of 2,1, 2, 66, 31 and 0. Virender Sehwag, who warmed up for this series by scoring the fastest double century in One-Day International history, also is trending south faster than Scott and Amundsen, having followed up his whirlwind 67 in Melbourne with innings of 7, 30, 4, 0 and 10. Worst of all, Dhoni has failed with the bat. The Indian captain is no thunderer at the best of times \u2013 neither is coach Duncan Fletcher, which may be part of the problem \u2013 but how can he demand more of his batsmen when he has nowhere to hide behind scores of 6, 23, 57no, 2, 12 and 2? India has not had a single century-maker in the past three Tests,</blockquote> The [[Daily Telegraph]] said that India's performance was \"so bad that the first question that came Michael Clarke's way at the press conference was 'did it feel as if you were playing Bangladesh?'\". The newspaper also played up Dhoni's one-match ban due to the Indian team's slow over-rate in the third Test. Under the headline 'Dhoni dumped from Adelaide Test', the newspaper wrote, \"India's shambolic tour of Australia plunged into unprecedented disarray when their captain MS Dhoni was sensationally banned from playing in the final Test due to slow over rates\". The [[Herald Sun]] wrote about how Australia built up a team after the Ashes humiliation last year while sarcastically mentioning the visiting players skipping practice sessions in the tour.<blockquote>As painful as it was, getting flogged in last year's Ashes may be remembered as the recession Australia had to have. Nothing is being taken for granted in Australian cricket any more. The new coaching unit is working well under head coach Mickey Arthur and Australia has worked hard to freshen up every aspect of its game. India, by contrast, just lobs along, its players pocketing millions each year and too spoilt to make major sacrifices. It's appropriate that many Indian players spent a lot of time last week sitting under trees at training, because their entire Test match game is being left in the shade.</blockquote>\n\nThe Indian tour to Australia was the last international series for Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman. Dravid announced his retirement from international cricket soon after the tour and Laxman announced his retirement after selecting him for two match home series against New-Zealand.   \n <ref>[http://www.kentcricket.co.uk/news/rahul-dravid-announces-his-retirement Rahul Dravid Announces His Retirement]</ref>\n\nIndia would win 4-0 in the next series against Australia. Australian players including [[Shane Watson]] and [[James Pattinson]] were to be guilty of discipline breach in the series of 2013.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/download/423882.html Download ICC's Future tours programme]\n\n{{International cricket tours of Australia}}\n{{International cricket in 2011-12}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Indian cricket team in Australia in 2011-12}}\n[[Category:Indian cricket tours of Australia|2011-12]]\n[[Category:2011\u201312 Australian cricket season]]\n[[Category:International cricket competitions in 2011\u201312]]\n[[Category:2011 in Indian cricket]]\n[[Category:2012 in Indian cricket]]\n", "name_user": "TinfoilFacts", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed the referencing for Rahul Dravid's retirement.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cricket_team_in_Australia_in_2011%E2%80%9312"}
