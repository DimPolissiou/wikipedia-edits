It had been previously run by the [[Cardiff Tramway Company]]. The resultant [[Cardiff Corporation Tramways]] spent the next three decades extending its electric tram network, and at its peak in 1927 ran 141 electric trams over 18 miles of line. On Christmas Eve 1920, the corporation introduced its first bus, although the first motor bus route was operated by the Tramway Company from 1907.<ref name=History>[http://www.cardiffbus.com/english/page.shtml?pageid=361#_subnav04 The Cardiff Story], Cardiff Bus. Retrieved 19 October 2017.</ref>\n\nThe first [[Trolleybuses in Cardiff|Cardiff trolleybuses]] were introduced in 1942, their introduction having been delayed by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. The intention was to convert the remaining tramway system to trolleybus operation, then to extend the network. While the first stage was completed in 1950, the only extension made to the system was to [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]] which took place in 1955. Although powers had been obtained to considerably expand the network, a policy U-turn occurred in 1961 when the decision was made to replace all the trolleybuses with motor buses. This task was completed in 1970, bringing to an end 68 years of electric traction on the streets of Cardiff.<ref name=History/>\n\nThe [[Transport Act 1985|Transport Act of 1985]] [[bus deregulation|deregulated bus services]] outside London and required all Local Authorities to establish private \"arm's length\" bus companies. In October 1986 the council established a subsidiary company.<ref name=company2001229>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02001229 Companies House extract company no 2001229] Cardiff City Transport Services Limited</ref> In 1992, the closure of the National Welsh bus company led Cardiff Bus to extend and intensify its network in the areas and towns surrounding Cardiff, including [[Barry, Wales|Barry]], the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] and [[Caerphilly]]. The Caerphilly local network of services including links between Cardiff, Caerphilly, [[Blackwood, Caerphilly|Blackwood]] and [[Tredegar]] were discontinued in 2001 and are now provided by [[Stagecoach Wales|Stagecoach in South Wales]].\n\nSome loss-making services have been withdrawn and are now operated under local authority tender by other operators, including Watts Coaches and [[NAT Group]].\n\nFrom September 2016, four of Cardiff Bus' services (routes 51/53, 86 and X91) were transferred to its new Capital Links sister brand,<ref>{{cite web|title=Capital Links|url=http://www.cardiffbus.com/english/article.shtml?articleid=6016|website=Cardiff Bus|publisher=Cardiff Bus|accessdate=23 July 2017}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> with a further four services transferring over to Capital Links two months later.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Routes for Capital Links|url=http://www.capitallinks.co.uk/article.shtml?articleid=6215|website=Capital Links|publisher=Capital Links|accessdate=23 July 2017}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Vehicles used on these services are in either an orange or green base livery, and as of July 2017, Capital Links operate seven routes.\n\n==Operations==\nCardiff Bus has a turnover of \u00a327million, employs around 705 people, on an average weekday carries around 100,000 passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtuclearn.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=49|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610221345/http://www.wtuclearn.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=49|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 June 2015|title=Staff turnover plummets to record low levels|publisher=TUC Wales|accessdate=2 November 2008}}</ref> In 2009 the company started to operate the park and ride service from Cardiff City Stadium to the city centre.\n\n===Fares===\nCardiff Bus operates an exact fare policy and no change is given. The city used to be divided into four fare zones, but on 5 April 2009, Cardiff Bus introduced a flat fare of \u00a31.60 for a one-way journey or \u00a33.20 for all-day travel in Cardiff and Penarth, or \u00a31.40/\u00a32.80 for travel within Barry. This has since been increased to \u00a32.00 for a one-way journey or \u00a34.00 for all-day travel in Cardiff and Penarth, or \u00a31.90 and \u00a33.80 in Barry (\u00a33.20/\u00a35.50 Cardiff and Barry). A weekly ticket can be purchased for travel within Cardiff for \u00a315, but an \"iff card\" will need to be presented as this type of ticket is not printed out on their machine. Tickets can also be purchased on the mobile app (available for iOS and Android).\nSpecial fares apply for travel between Cardiff and Barry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiffbus.com/english/faresandtickets.shtml#_subnav02|title=Our Fares|publisher=Cardiff Bus|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> Special fares also apply for Newport, with a \u00a34.50 return ticket offered along with the Day to Go Plus ticket also being accepted.\n\n===Iff card===\n{{main|Iff card}}\n\nIff card is a [[contactless smart card]] introduced by Cardiff Bus in October 2010, allowing customers to travel on its services after having pre-paid. The first 30,000 cards were issued free of charge and preloaded with \u00a33 of credit, after which the cards will be charged at \u00a35.\n\nAn amount of money is electronically loaded onto the card, either upon boarding a bus or at the Cardiff Bus customer service centre. A passenger then chooses a ticket type. The card can also be used as a season ticket. The card should be topped-up when the balance is low, however, the card allows the customer to acquire a negative balance up to \u00a33.<ref>[http://www.cardiffbus.com/smartcard.shtml Smartcard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007204320/http://www.cardiffbus.com/smartcard.shtml |date=7 October 2010 }} Cardiff Bus</ref>\n\nThe card can be topped-up in units of \u00a31, \u00a32, \u00a33, \u00a34, \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a315 or \u00a320, up to maximum amount of \u00a350. The card may be used by persons aged between 6 and 60. The Iff card cannot be used to pay a partial amount. The card is cancelled if not used for a continuous period of one year.<ref>[http://www.cardiffbus.com/terms_conditions.htm Iff: Terms and Conditions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010044719/http://www.cardiffbus.com/terms_conditions.htm |date=10 October 2010 }} Cardiff Bus</ref>\n\n=== Contactless ===\nIn March 2018 the company introduced the [[Ticketer]] contactless card payment system on all its routes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/cardiff-bus-introducing-contactless-payments-14385816|title=Cardiff Bus is introducing contactless payments this month|last=Hughes|first=Marcus|date=2018-03-08|website=walesonline|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> As well as including an [[EFTPOS]] reader for Visa/Mastercard cards, fares can be bought and scanned using the Cardiff Bus app (which on most tickets including day to go and week to go tickets is cheaper than using cash).<ref name=\":0\" /> The reader can also scan [[QR code|QR codes]] from paper multi-journey tickets.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Fleet===\n[[File:Park Place, Cathays, Cardiff (23714174510).jpg|thumb|right|A Mercedes-Benz Citaro and an Alexander Dennis Enviro400 in [[Cathays]]]]\nAs of August 2018, the fleet consists of 224 vehicles, all of which are low floor. Single deck vehicles dominate the fleet, accounting for 90.7% of the overall fleet. Since 2013, 90 brand new vehicles have been purchased, with the most recent being delivered in August 2017.\n\nOn the double deck side of the fleet, of which there are 23 vehicles, ten high capacity [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]]s joined the fleet in 2015. Prior to the delivery of the former, thirteen [[East Lancs Olympus]] bodied [[Scania N-series|Scania N230UDs]] entered service in 2007.\n\nThe most common single deck type is the [[Plaxton Pointer|Pointer]]-bodied [[Dennis Dart|Alexander Dennis/Dennis/TransBus Dart SLF]], with 72 vehicles of three different lengths in the fleet. The second most common type is the [[Scania OmniCity]], with 43 in total. Nineteen of the OmniCitys are the articulated variant.\n\nThe [[Alexander Dennis Enviro200]] also dominates, with 40 examples in the fleet, including ten with the \"MMC\" body. The [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]] has become the standard large single deck type in recent years, with 40 Citaros in service as of August 2017. Operated in smaller numbers are the [[Alexander Dennis Enviro300|TransBus Enviro300]], with twelve examples, and seven [[Wright Solar]] bodied [[Scania K-series|Scania K230UBs]].\n\n===Branding===\nAlthough the predominant colour of Cardiff is blue, the original branding in both the entire tram, trolley bus and early bus operations until the 1970s was [[Carmine|crimson lake]] and cream livery. This then changed to orange with white lining, from August 1972 with \"City of Cardiff\" on the left hand side and \"Dinas Caerdydd\" on the right hand side. This changed in 1986 when the business became Cardiff Bus. However, since the 1990s the dominant colouring has been green, first with cream lining and since the introduction of modern wrapping, a return for orange in the adjustments/outline.\n\nJust before the introduction of the Iff Card, the company started a \"your bus service\" campaign, fronted by a series of local people's faces being applied in large scale on the sides and rears of selected buses.\n\nBus 472 had a grey vinyl wrapped livery advertising the IFF card following its launch in 2008. It was then repainted into a heritage orange and white livery to celebrate 30 years since the formation of Cardiff Bus (after the 1986 deregulation of buses) and it currently sports a vinyl wrap celebrating Cardiff's sporting success with Cardiff City Football Club, Cardiff Blues, Cardiff Devils ice hockey team and Gerraint Thomas winning the Tour De France.\n\n==Controversy==\nCardiff Bus's dominant position has sometimes come in for criticism and investigation. In 2004, 2Travel,<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/03823139 Companies House extract company no 3823139] 2 Travel Group plc</ref> a company operating significant numbers of school contract services in South Wales, launched low-cost services in Cardiff and Swansea to utilise its fleet between the school runs.

It had been previously run by the [[Cardiff Tramway Company]]. The resultant [[Cardiff Corporation Tramways]] spent the next three decades extending its electric tram network, and at its peak in 1927 ran 141 electric trams over 18 miles of line. On Christmas Eve 1920, the corporation introduced its first bus, although the first motor bus route was operated by the Tramway Company from 1907.<ref name=History>[http://www.cardiffbus.com/english/page.shtml?pageid=361#_subnav04 The Cardiff Story], Cardiff Bus. Retrieved 19 October 2017.</ref>\n\nThe first [[Trolleybuses in Cardiff|Cardiff trolleybuses]] were introduced in 1942, their introduction having been delayed by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. The intention was to convert the remaining tramway system to trolleybus operation, then to extend the network. While the first stage was completed in 1950, the only extension made to the system was to [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]] which took place in 1955. Although powers had been obtained to considerably expand the network, a policy U-turn occurred in 1961 when the decision was made to replace all the trolleybuses with motor buses. This task was completed in 1970, bringing to an end 68 years of electric traction on the streets of Cardiff.<ref name=History/>\n\nThe [[Transport Act 1985|Transport Act of 1985]] [[bus deregulation|deregulated bus services]] outside London and required all Local Authorities to establish private \"arm's length\" bus companies. In October 1986 the council established a subsidiary company.<ref name=company2001229>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02001229 Companies House extract company no 2001229] Cardiff City Transport Services Limited</ref> In 1992, the closure of the National Welsh bus company led Cardiff Bus to extend and intensify its network in the areas and towns surrounding Cardiff, including [[Barry, Wales|Barry]], the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] and [[Caerphilly]].

The city used to be divided into four fare zones, but on 5 April 2009, Cardiff Bus introduced a flat fare of \u00a31.60 for a one-way journey or \u00a33.20 for all-day travel in Cardiff and Penarth, or \u00a31.40/\u00a32.80 for travel within Barry. This has since been increased to \u00a32.00 for a one-way journey or \u00a34.00 for all-day travel in Cardiff and Penarth, or \u00a31.90 and \u00a33.80 in Barry (\u00a33.20/\u00a35.50 Cardiff and Barry). A weekly ticket can be purchased for travel within Cardiff for \u00a315, but an \"iff card\" will need to be presented as this type of ticket is not printed out on their machine. Tickets can also be purchased on the mobile app (available for iOS and Android).\nSpecial fares apply for travel between Cardiff and Barry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiffbus.com/english/faresandtickets.shtml#_subnav02|title=Our Fares|publisher=Cardiff Bus|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> Special fares also apply for Newport, with a \u00a34.50 return ticket offered along with the Day to Go Plus ticket also being accepted.\n\n===Iff card===\n{{main|Iff card}}\n\nIff card is a [[contactless smart card]] introduced by Cardiff Bus in October 2010, allowing customers to travel on its services after having pre-paid. The first 30,000 cards were issued free of charge and preloaded with \u00a33 of credit, after which the cards will be charged at \u00a35.\n\nAn amount of money is electronically loaded onto the card, either upon boarding a bus or at the Cardiff Bus customer service centre. A passenger then chooses a ticket type. The card can also be used as a season ticket. The card should be topped-up when the balance is low, however, the card allows the customer to acquire a negative balance up to \u00a33.<ref>[http://www.cardiffbus.com/smartcard.shtml Smartcard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007204320/http://www.cardiffbus.com/smartcard.shtml |date=7 October 2010 }} Cardiff Bus</ref>\n\nThe card can be topped-up in units of \u00a31, \u00a32, \u00a33, \u00a34, \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a315 or \u00a320, up to maximum amount of \u00a350. The card may be used by persons aged between 6 and 60. The Iff card cannot be used to pay a partial amount.

Single deck vehicles dominate the fleet, accounting for 90.7% of the overall fleet. Since 2013, 90 brand new vehicles have been purchased, with the most recent being delivered in August 2017.\n\nOn the double deck side of the fleet, of which there are 23 vehicles, ten high capacity [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]]s joined the fleet in 2015. Prior to the delivery of the former, thirteen [[East Lancs Olympus]] bodied [[Scania N-series|Scania N230UDs]] entered service in 2007.\n\nThe most common single deck type is the [[Plaxton Pointer|Pointer]]-bodied [[Dennis Dart|Alexander Dennis/Dennis/TransBus Dart SLF]], with 72 vehicles of three different lengths in the fleet. The second most common type is the [[Scania OmniCity]], with 43 in total. Nineteen of the OmniCitys are the articulated variant.\n\nThe [[Alexander Dennis Enviro200]] also dominates, with 40 examples in the fleet, including ten with the \"MMC\" body. The [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]] has become the standard large single deck type in recent years, with 40 Citaros in service as of August 2017. Operated in smaller numbers are the [[Alexander Dennis Enviro300|TransBus Enviro300]], with twelve examples, and seven [[Wright Solar]] bodied [[Scania K-series|Scania K230UBs]].\n\n===Branding===\nAlthough the predominant colour of Cardiff is blue, the original branding in both the entire tram, trolley bus and early bus operations until the 1970s was [[Carmine|crimson lake]] and cream livery. This then changed to orange with white lining, from August 1972 with \"City of Cardiff\" on the left hand side and \"Dinas Caerdydd\" on the right hand side. This changed in 1986 when the business became Cardiff Bus. However, since the 1990s the dominant colouring has been green, first with cream lining and since the introduction of modern wrapping, a return for orange in the adjustments/outline.\n\nJust before the introduction of the Iff Card, the company started a \"your bus service\" campaign, fronted by a series of local people's faces being applied in large scale on the sides and rears of selected buses.\n\nBus 472 had a grey vinyl wrapped livery advertising the IFF card following its launch in 2008. It was then repainted into a heritage orange and white livery to celebrate 30 years since the formation of Cardiff Bus (after the 1986 deregulation of buses) and it currently sports a vinyl wrap celebrating Cardiff's sporting success with Cardiff City Football Club, Cardiff Blues, Cardiff Devils ice hockey team and Gerraint Thomas winning the Tour De France.\n\n==Controversy==\nCardiff Bus's dominant position has sometimes come in for criticism and investigation. In 2004, 2Travel,<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/03823139 Companies House extract company no 3823139] 2 Travel Group plc</ref> a company operating significant numbers of school contract services in South Wales, launched low-cost services in Cardiff and Swansea to utilise its fleet between the school runs. Low fares were achieved by omitting major bus stations avoiding hefty access fees. Cardiff Bus launched a basic service in competition with 2Travel, using white buses bearing no livery also stopping short of the bus station.

Following the success of [[Robert Schumann]]'s [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E{{music|flat}} major, Op. 44]] in 1842, which paired the piano with a string quartet, composers increasingly adopted Schumann's instrumentation, and it was this form of the piano quintet that dominated during the second half of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century.\n\nAmong the best known and most frequently performed piano quintets, aside from Schumann's, are those by [[Trout quintet|Franz Schubert]], [[Piano Quintet (Brahms)|Johannes Brahms]], [[Piano_Quintet_(Franck)|C\u00e9sar Franck]], [[Piano Quintet No. 2 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] and [[Piano Quintet (Shostakovich)|Dmitri Shostakovich]].<ref name=\"Stowell324\">{{cite book|author1=Robin Stowell|author2=Jonathan Cross|title=The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bJAZU27hWEC&pg=PA324|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00042-0|page=324}}</ref>\n\n==The piano quintet before 1842==\nWhile the related chamber music genres of the [[piano trio]] and [[piano quartet]] were established in the eighteenth century by [[Mozart]] and others, the piano quintet did not come into its own as a genre until the nineteenth century.<ref>The quintets for piano, [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], [[French horn|horn]], and [[bassoon]] composed by [[Quintet for Piano and Winds (Mozart)|Mozart]] and [[Quintet for Piano and Winds (Beethoven)|Beethoven]] are usually described as \"quintets for piano and winds\" so as to distinguish them from compositions for piano and four strings.</ref> Its roots extend into the late [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], when [[piano concertos]] were sometimes transcribed for [[piano]] with [[string quartet]] accompaniment.<ref name=\"Harvard\">{{cite book|author=Willi Apel|title=The Harvard Dictionary of Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02rFSecPhEsC&pg=PA699|date=28 November 2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01163-2|page=699}}</ref> \n\nAlthough [[Luigi Boccherini]] composed quintets for piano and string quartet, before 1842 it was more common for the piano to be joined by violin, viola, cello and double bass.  Perhaps the best known quintets for this combination of instruments are [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Trout Quintet|\"Trout\" Quintet]] in A major (1819) and [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]]'s Piano Quintet in E-flat minor, Op.87 (1802). Other piano quintets using this instrumentation were composed by [[Jan Ladislav Dussek]] (1799), [[Ferdinand Ries]] (1817),  [[Johann Baptist Cramer]] (1825, 1832), [[Henri Jean Rigel]] (1826), [[Johann Peter Pixis]] (ca.1827), [[Franz Limmer]] (1832), [[Louise Farrenc]] (1839, 1840), and [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]] (1846, 1848, 1849).<ref name=\"Smallman3\">{{cite book|last=Smallman|first=Basil|title=The Piano Quartet and Quintet: Style, Structure, and Scoring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TzEBCIO8sgC&pg=PA3|year=1996|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-816640-5|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"Smallman26\">{{cite book|author=Basil Smallman|title=The Piano Quartet and Quintet: Style, Structure, and Scoring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TzEBCIO8sgC&pg=PA26|year=1996|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-816640-5|page=26}}</ref>\n\nMozart (in 1784) and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (in 1796) each composed a quintet for piano and winds, scored for piano, oboe, clarinet, horn, and bassoon, that are sometimes referred to as piano quintets.\n\n==Schumann and the Romantic piano quintet==\n[[File:Robert Schumann 1839.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Schumann]], lithograph by [[Josef Kriehuber]], in 1839, three years before the composition of his piano quintet.]]\nIn the middle of the 19th century, [[Robert Schumann]]'s [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E{{music|flat}} major]], Op. 44 (1842), composed for piano with string quartet, helped make that combination of instruments the default model for the piano quintet.  Schumann's choice of scoring reflected developments in musical performance and instrumental design.\n\nBy midcentury, the [[string quartet]] was regarded as the most prestigious and important chamber music genre, while advances in the design of the [[piano]] had expanded its power and dynamic range. Bringing the piano and string quartet together, Schumann's piano quintet took full advantage of the expressive possibilities of these forces in combination, alternating conversational passages between the five instruments with passages in which the combined forces of the strings are massed against the piano. In Schumann's hands, the piano quintet became a genre \"suspended between private and public spheres\" alternating between \"quasi-symphonic and more properly chamber-like elements\"--well suited to an era when chamber music was increasingly being performed in large concert halls rather than at private gatherings in intimate spaces. <ref>John Daverio, 'Robert Schumann: Herald of a \"New Poetic Age.\"' (1997, Oxford), p. 256</ref>\n\nSchumann's quintet helped establish the piano quintet as a significant, and quintessentially Romantic, chamber music genre.<ref name=\"Stowell323-324\">Stowell, Robin ''The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet'', pp. 323\u2013324.</ref>.

''The Piano Quartet and Quintet: Style, Structure, and Scoring'', p. 53.</ref> [[Johannes Brahms]], for example, was persuaded by [[Clara Schumann]], who had played the piano part in the first public performance of her husband's piano quintet, to rework a sonata for two pianos as a piano quintet. The result, the [[Piano Quintet (Brahms)|Piano Quintet in F minor]] (1864), is one of the most frequently performed works of the genre.<ref name=Rodda>[http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&composition_id=2431] Rodda, Richard E. \"Piano Quintet in F minor, Op. 34,\" n.p.</ref> \n\nSubsequent compositions such as [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s [[Piano Quintet (Franck)|Piano Quintet in F minor]] (1879) and [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s [[Piano Quintet No. 2 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Piano Quintet #2 in A major, Op. 81]] (1887) further solidified the genre as an archetypal \"vehicle for Romantic expression.\"<ref name=\"Stowell324\" />\n\n==20th century==\nIn the twentieth century, the piano quintet repertoire was expanded with notable contributions by composers such as [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Sergei Taneyev]], [[Louis Vierne]], [[Piano Quintet (Elgar)|Edward Elgar]], [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9]], and [[Piano Quintet (Shostakovich)|Dmitri Shostakovich]].

The term also refers to the group of musicians that plays a piano quintet. The genre particularly flourished during the nineteenth century.\n\nUntil the middle of the nineteenth century, most piano quintets were scored for piano, [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], and [[double bass]]. Following the success of [[Robert Schumann]]'s [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E{{music|flat}} major, Op. 44]] in 1842, which paired the piano with a string quartet, composers increasingly adopted Schumann's instrumentation, and it was this form of the piano quintet that dominated during the second half of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century.\n\nAmong the best known and most frequently performed piano quintets, aside from Schumann's, are those by [[Trout quintet|Franz Schubert]], [[Piano Quintet (Brahms)|Johannes Brahms]], [[Piano_Quintet_(Franck)|C\u00e9sar Franck]], [[Piano Quintet No. 2 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] and [[Piano Quintet (Shostakovich)|Dmitri Shostakovich]].<ref name=\"Stowell324\">{{cite book|author1=Robin Stowell|author2=Jonathan Cross|title=The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bJAZU27hWEC&pg=PA324|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00042-0|page=324}}</ref>\n\n==The piano quintet before 1842==\nWhile the related chamber music genres of the [[piano trio]] and [[piano quartet]] were established in the eighteenth century by [[Mozart]] and others, the piano quintet did not come into its own as a genre until the nineteenth century.<ref>The quintets for piano, [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], [[French horn|horn]], and [[bassoon]] composed by [[Quintet for Piano and Winds (Mozart)|Mozart]] and [[Quintet for Piano and Winds (Beethoven)|Beethoven]] are usually described as \"quintets for piano and winds\" so as to distinguish them from compositions for piano and four strings.</ref> Its roots extend into the late [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], when [[piano concertos]] were sometimes transcribed for [[piano]] with [[string quartet]] accompaniment.<ref name=\"Harvard\">{{cite book|author=Willi Apel|title=The Harvard Dictionary of Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02rFSecPhEsC&pg=PA699|date=28 November 2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01163-2|page=699}}</ref> \n\nAlthough [[Luigi Boccherini]] composed quintets for piano and string quartet, before 1842 it was more common for the piano to be joined by violin, viola, cello and double bass.  Perhaps the best known quintets for this combination of instruments are [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Trout Quintet|\"Trout\" Quintet]] in A major (1819) and [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]]'s Piano Quintet in E-flat minor, Op.87 (1802). Other piano quintets using this instrumentation were composed by [[Jan Ladislav Dussek]] (1799), [[Ferdinand Ries]] (1817),  [[Johann Baptist Cramer]] (1825, 1832), [[Henri Jean Rigel]] (1826), [[Johann Peter Pixis]] (ca.1827), [[Franz Limmer]] (1832), [[Louise Farrenc]] (1839, 1840), and [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]] (1846, 1848, 1849).<ref name=\"Smallman3\">{{cite book|last=Smallman|first=Basil|title=The Piano Quartet and Quintet: Style, Structure, and Scoring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TzEBCIO8sgC&pg=PA3|year=1996|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-816640-5|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"Smallman26\">{{cite book|author=Basil Smallman|title=The Piano Quartet and Quintet: Style, Structure, and Scoring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TzEBCIO8sgC&pg=PA26|year=1996|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-816640-5|page=26}}</ref>\n\nMozart (in 1784) and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (in 1796) each composed a quintet for piano and winds, scored for piano, oboe, clarinet, horn, and bassoon, that are sometimes referred to as piano quintets.\n\n==Schumann and the Romantic piano quintet==\n[[File:Robert Schumann 1839.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Schumann]], lithograph by [[Josef Kriehuber]], in 1839, three years before the composition of his piano quintet.]]\nIn the middle of the 19th century, [[Robert Schumann]]'s [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E{{music|flat}} major]], Op. 44 (1842), composed for piano with string quartet, helped make that combination of instruments the default model for the piano quintet.  Schumann's choice of scoring reflected developments in musical performance and instrumental design.\n\nBy midcentury, the [[string quartet]] was regarded as the most prestigious and important chamber music genre, while advances in the design of the [[piano]] had expanded its power and dynamic range. Bringing the piano and string quartet together, Schumann's piano quintet took full advantage of the expressive possibilities of these forces in combination, alternating conversational passages between the five instruments with passages in which the combined forces of the strings are massed against the piano. In Schumann's hands, the piano quintet became a genre \"suspended between private and public spheres\" alternating between \"quasi-symphonic and more properly chamber-like elements\"--well suited to an era when chamber music was increasingly being performed in large concert halls rather than at private gatherings in intimate spaces. <ref>John Daverio, 'Robert Schumann: Herald of a \"New Poetic Age.\"' (1997, Oxford), p. 256</ref>\n\nSchumann's quintet helped establish the piano quintet as a significant, and quintessentially Romantic, chamber music genre.<ref name=\"Stowell323-324\">Stowell, Robin ''The Cambridge Companion to the String Quartet'', pp. 323\u2013324.</ref>.

''The Piano Quartet and Quintet: Style, Structure, and Scoring'', p. 53.</ref> [[Johannes Brahms]], for example, was persuaded by [[Clara Schumann]], who had played the piano part in the first public performance of her husband's piano quintet, to rework a sonata for two pianos as a piano quintet. The result, the [[Piano Quintet (Brahms)|Piano Quintet in F minor]] (1864), is one of the most frequently performed works of the genre.<ref name=Rodda>[http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&composition_id=2431] Rodda, Richard E. \"Piano Quintet in F minor, Op. 34,\" n.p.</ref> \n\nSubsequent compositions such as [[C\u00e9sar Franck]]'s [[Piano Quintet (Franck)|Piano Quintet in F minor]] (1879) and [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s [[Piano Quintet No. 2 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Piano Quintet #2 in A major, Op. 81]] (1887) further solidified the genre as an archetypal \"vehicle for Romantic expression.\"<ref name=\"Stowell324\" />\n\n==20th century==\nIn the twentieth century, the piano quintet repertoire was expanded with notable contributions by composers such as [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Sergei Taneyev]], [[Louis Vierne]], [[Piano Quintet (Elgar)|Edward Elgar]], [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9]], and [[Piano Quintet (Shostakovich)|Dmitri Shostakovich]].

Data are from Nikuradse (1932, 1933), Colebrook (1939), and McKeon (2004).]]\n\nThe friction factor {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub>}} is not a constant: it depends on such things as the characteristics of the pipe (diameter {{mvar|D}} and roughness height {{mvar|\u03b5}}), the characteristics of the fluid (its kinematic viscosity {{mvar|\u03bd}} [nu]), and the velocity of the fluid flow {{math|\u27e8''v''\u27e9}}. It has been measured to [[Friction loss#Measurements|high accuracy within certain flow regimes]] and may be evaluated by the use of various empirical relations, or it may be read from published charts. These charts are often referred to as [[Moody diagrams]], after [[Lewis Ferry Moody|L. F. Moody]], and hence the factor itself is sometimes erroneously called the ''Moody friction factor''. It is also sometimes called the [[Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius|Blasius]] friction factor, after the approximate formula he proposed.\n\nFigure 1 shows the value of {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub>}} as measured by experimenters for many different fluids, over a wide range of Reynolds numbers, and for pipes of various roughness heights. There are three broad regimes of fluid flow encountered in these data: laminar, critical, and turbulent.  \n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Laminar regime ===\nFor [[laminar flow|laminar (smooth) flows]], it is a consequence of [[Hagen\u2013Poiseuille equation#Relation to Darcy\u2013Weisbach|Poiseuille's law]] (which stems from an exact classical solution for the fluid flow) that\n\n:<math>f_{\\mathrm D} = \\frac{64}{\\mathrm{Re}},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|Re}} is the [[Reynolds number]]\n\n: <math>\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac \\rho \\mu \\langle v \\rangle D = \\frac{\\langle v \\rangle D} \\nu, </math>\n\nand where {{mvar|\u03bc}} is the viscosity of the fluid and \n:<math>\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}</math>\nis known as the [[kinematic viscosity]]. In this expression for Reynolds number, the characteristic length {{mvar|D}} is taken to be the [[hydraulic diameter]] of the pipe, which, for a cylindrical pipe flowing full, equals the inside diameter. In Figures 1 and 2 of friction factor versus Reynolds number, the regime {{math|Re < 2000}} demonstrates laminar flow; the friction factor is well represented by the above equation.{{efn|The data exhibit, however, a systematic departure of up to 50% from the theoretical Hagen\u2013Poiseuille equation in the region of {{math|Re > 500}} up to the onset of critical flow.}}\n\nIn effect, the friction loss in the laminar regime is more accurately characterized as being proportional to flow velocity, rather than proportional to the square of that velocity: one could regard the Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation as not truly applicable in the laminar flow regime.\n\nIn laminar flow, friction loss arises from the transfer of momentum from the fluid in the center of the flow to the pipe wall via the viscosity of the fluid; no vortices are present in the flow. Note that the friction loss is insensitive to the pipe roughness height {{mvar|\u03b5}}: the flow velocity in the neighborhood of the pipe wall is zero.\n\n=== Critical regime ===\nFor Reynolds numbers in the range {{math|2000 < Re < 4000}}, the flow is unsteady (varies grossly with time) and varies from one section of the pipe to another (is not \"fully developed\"). The flow involves the incipient formation of vortices; it is not well understood. \n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Turbulent regime ===\n[[File:Darcy Friction factor for Re between 10E3 and 10E8 for values of relative roughness.svg|thumb|'''Figure 2.'''

Data are from Nikuradse (1932, 1933), Colebrook (1939), and McKeon (2004).]]\nFor Reynolds number greater than 4000, the flow is turbulent; the resistance to flow follows the Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation: it is proportional to the square of the mean flow velocity. Over a domain of many orders of magnitude of {{math|Re}} ({{math|4000 < Re < 10<sup>8</sup>}}), the friction factor varies less than one order of magnitude ({{math|0.006 < ''f''<sub>D</sub> < 0.06}}). Within the turbulent flow regime, the nature of the flow can be further divided into a regime where the pipe wall is effectively smooth, and one where its roughness height is salient.\n\n====Smooth-pipe regime====\n{{clear left}}\n<!-- [[File:NikRough residual vs Re fD.svg|thumb|Figure 3.

While the Colebrook\u2013White relation is, in the general case, an iterative method, the Swamee\u2013Jain equation allows {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub>}} to be found directly for full flow in a circular pipe.<ref name=\"Crowe2005\">{{cite book |last1=Crowe|first1=Clayton T. |last2=Elger|first2=Donald F. |last3=Robertson|first3=John A. |title=Engineering Fluid Mechanics |date=2005 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |edition=8th |at=p. 379; Eq. 10:23, 10:24, paragraph 4}}\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f_\\mathrm{D}}} = 2 \\log\\left(\\mathrm{Re} \\sqrt{f_\\mathrm{D}}\\right) - 0.8 \\quad \\text{for } \\mathrm{Re} > 3000.</math></ref>\n\n==== Direct calculation when friction loss ''{{mvar|S}}'' is known ====\nIn typical engineering applications, there will be a set of given or known quantities. The acceleration of gravity {{mvar|g}} and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid {{mvar|\u03bd}} are known, as are the diameter of the pipe {{mvar|D}} and its roughness height {{mvar|\u03b5}}. If as well the head loss per unit length {{mvar|S}} is a known quantity, then the friction factor {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub>}} can be calculated directly from the chosen fitting function.

Of the two, the Darcy\u2013Weisbach factor {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub>}} is more commonly used by civil and mechanical engineers, and the Fanning factor {{mvar|f}} by chemical engineers, but care should be taken to identify the correct factor regardless of the source of the chart or formula.\n\nNote that\n\n: <math>\\Delta p = f_{\\mathrm D} \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho {\\langle v \\rangle}^2}{2} = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot {2\\rho {\\langle v \\rangle}^2}</math>\n\nMost charts or tables indicate the type of friction factor, or at least provide the formula for the friction factor with laminar flow. If the formula for laminar flow is {{math|''f'' {{=}} {{sfrac|16|Re}}}}, it is the Fanning factor {{mvar|f}}, and if the formula for laminar flow is {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|64|Re}}}}, it is the Darcy\u2013Weisbach factor {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub>}}.\n\nWhich friction factor is plotted in a Moody diagram may be determined by inspection if the publisher did not include the formula described above:\n#Observe the value of the friction factor for laminar flow at a Reynolds number of 1000.\n#If the value of the friction factor is 0.064, then the Darcy friction factor is plotted in the Moody diagram.  Note that the nonzero digits in 0.064 are the numerator in the formula for the laminar Darcy friction factor: {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|64|Re}}}}.\n#If the value of the friction factor is 0.016, then the Fanning friction factor is plotted in the Moody diagram.  Note that the nonzero digits in 0.016 are the numerator in the formula for the laminar Fanning friction factor: {{math|''f'' {{=}} {{sfrac|16|Re}}}}.\n\nThe procedure above is similar for any available Reynolds number that is an integer power of ten.  It is not necessary to remember the value 1000 for this procedure\u2014only that an integer power of ten is of interest for this purpose.\n\n== History ==\nHistorically this equation arose as a variant on the [[Prony equation]]; this variant was developed by [[Henry Darcy]] of France, and further refined into the form used today by [[Julius Weisbach]] of [[Saxony]] in 1845. Initially, data on the variation of {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub>}} with velocity was lacking, so the Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation was outperformed at first by the empirical Prony equation in many cases. In later years it was eschewed in many special-case situations in favor of a variety of [[empirical equation]]s valid only for certain flow regimes, notably the [[Hazen\u2013Williams equation]] or the [[Manning equation]], most of which were significantly easier to use in calculations. However, since the advent of the [[calculator]], ease of calculation is no longer a major issue, and so the Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation's generality has made it the preferred one.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Brown|first1=G.

The key quantities are then the pressure drop along the pipe per unit length, {{math|{{sfrac|\u0394''p''|''L''}}}}, and the volumetric flow rate. The flow rate can be converted to a mean flow velocity {{mvar|V}} by dividing by the [[Hydraulic diameter|wetted area]] of the flow (which equals the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional]] [[area]] of the pipe if the pipe is full of fluid).\n\nPressure has dimensions of energy per unit volume, therefore the pressure drop between two points must be proportional to the [[dynamic pressure]] q. We also know that pressure must be proportional to the length of the pipe between the two points {{mvar|L}} as the pressure drop per unit length is a constant. To turn the relationship into a proportionality coefficient  of dimensionless quantity, we can divide by the hydraulic diameter of the pipe, {{mvar|D}}, which is also constant along the pipe. Therefore,\n\n:<math>\\Delta p \\propto \\frac{L}{D} q.</math>\n\nThe proportionality coefficient is the dimensionless \"[[Darcy friction factor formulae|Darcy friction factor]]\" or \"flow coefficient\". This dimensionless coefficient will be a combination of geometric factors such as {{mvar|\u03c0}}, the Reynolds number and (outside the laminar regime) the relative roughness of the pipe (the ratio of the [[roughness height]] to the [[hydraulic diameter]]).\n\nNote that the dynamic pressure is not the kinetic energy of the fluid per unit volume,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} for the following reasons. Even in the case of [[laminar flow]], where all the [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|flow line]]s are parallel to the length of the pipe, the velocity of the fluid on the inner surface of the pipe is zero due to viscosity, and the velocity in the center of the pipe must therefore be larger than the average velocity obtained by dividing the volumetric flow rate by the wet area. The average kinetic energy then involves the [[Root-mean-square speed|root mean-square velocity]], which always exceeds the mean velocity. In the case of [[turbulent flow]], the fluid acquires random velocity components in all directions, including perpendicular to the length of the pipe, and thus turbulence contributes to the kinetic energy per unit volume but not to the average lengthwise velocity of the fluid.\n\n==Practical application==\nIn a [[hydraulic engineering]] application, it is typical for the volumetric flow {{mvar|Q}} within a pipe (that is, its productivity) and the head loss per unit length {{mvar|S}} (the concomitant power consumption) to be the critical important factors. The practical consequence is that, for a fixed volumetric flow rate {{mvar|Q}}, head loss {{mvar|S}} ''decreases'' with the inverse fifth power of the pipe diameter, {{mvar|D}}.  Doubling the diameter of a pipe of a given schedule (say, ANSI schedule 40) roughly doubles the amount of material required per unit length and thus its installed cost. Meanwhile, the head loss is decreased by a factor of 32 (about a 97% reduction). Thus the energy consumed in moving a given volumetric flow of the fluid is cut down dramatically for a modest increase in capital cost.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bernoulli's principle]]\n* [[Darcy friction factor formulae]]\n* [[Euler number (physics)|Euler number]]\n* [[Hagen\u2013Poiseuille equation]]\n* [[Water pipe]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last=De Nevers | year=1970 | title=Fluid Mechanics | publisher=Addison\u2013Wesley | isbn=0-201-01497-1 }}\n* {{cite book | last1=Shah | first1=R.

Data are from Nikuradse (1932, 1933), Colebrook (1939), and McKeon (2004).]]\n\nThe friction factor {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub>}} is not a constant: it depends on such things as the characteristics of the pipe (diameter {{mvar|D}} and roughness height {{mvar|\u03b5}}), the characteristics of the fluid (its kinematic viscosity {{mvar|\u03bd}} [nu]), and the velocity of the fluid flow {{math|\u27e8''v''\u27e9}}. It has been measured to [[Friction loss#Measurements|high accuracy within certain flow regimes]] and may be evaluated by the use of various empirical relations, or it may be read from published charts. These charts are often referred to as [[Moody diagrams]], after [[Lewis Ferry Moody|L. F. Moody]], and hence the factor itself is sometimes erroneously called the ''Moody friction factor''. It is also sometimes called the [[Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius|Blasius]] friction factor, after the approximate formula he proposed.\n\nFigure 1 shows the value of {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub>}} as measured by experimenters for many different fluids, over a wide range of Reynolds numbers, and for pipes of various roughness heights. There are three broad regimes of fluid flow encountered in these data: laminar, critical, and turbulent.  \n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Laminar regime ===\nFor [[laminar flow|laminar (smooth) flows]], it is a consequence of [[Hagen\u2013Poiseuille equation#Relation to Darcy\u2013Weisbach|Poiseuille's law]] (which stems from an exact classical solution for the fluid flow) that\n\n:<math>f_{\\mathrm D} = \\frac{64}{\\mathrm{Re}},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|Re}} is the [[Reynolds number]]\n\n: <math>\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac \\rho \\mu \\langle v \\rangle D = \\frac{\\langle v \\rangle D} \\nu, </math>\n\nand where {{mvar|\u03bc}} is the viscosity of the fluid and \n:<math>\\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}</math>\nis known as the [[kinematic viscosity]]. In this expression for Reynolds number, the characteristic length {{mvar|D}} is taken to be the [[hydraulic diameter]] of the pipe, which, for a cylindrical pipe flowing full, equals the inside diameter. In Figures 1 and 2 of friction factor versus Reynolds number, the regime {{math|Re < 2000}} demonstrates laminar flow; the friction factor is well represented by the above equation.{{efn|The data exhibit, however, a systematic departure of up to 50% from the theoretical Hagen\u2013Poiseuille equation in the region of {{math|Re > 500}} up to the onset of critical flow.}}\n\nIn effect, the friction loss in the laminar regime is more accurately characterized as being proportional to flow velocity, rather than proportional to the square of that velocity: one could regard the Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation as not truly applicable in the laminar flow regime.\n\nIn laminar flow, friction loss arises from the transfer of momentum from the fluid in the center of the flow to the pipe wall via the viscosity of the fluid; no vortices are present in the flow. Note that the friction loss is insensitive to the pipe roughness height {{mvar|\u03b5}}: the flow velocity in the neighborhood of the pipe wall is zero.\n\n=== Critical regime ===\nFor Reynolds numbers in the range {{math|2000 < Re < 4000}}, the flow is unsteady (varies grossly with time) and varies from one section of the pipe to another (is not \"fully developed\"). The flow involves the incipient formation of vortices; it is not well understood. \n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Turbulent regime ===\n[[File:Darcy Friction factor for Re between 10E3 and 10E8 for values of relative roughness.svg|thumb|'''Figure 2.'''

Data are from Nikuradse (1932, 1933), Colebrook (1939), and McKeon (2004).]]\nFor Reynolds number greater than 4000, the flow is turbulent; the resistance to flow follows the Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation: it is proportional to the square of the mean flow velocity. Over a domain of many orders of magnitude of {{math|Re}} ({{math|4000 < Re < 10<sup>8</sup>}}), the friction factor varies less than one order of magnitude ({{math|0.006 < ''f''<sub>D</sub> < 0.06}}). Within the turbulent flow regime, the nature of the flow can be further divided into a regime where the pipe wall is effectively smooth, and one where its roughness height is salient.\n\n====Smooth-pipe regime====\n{{clear left}}\n<!-- [[File:NikRough residual vs Re fD.svg|thumb|Figure 3.

Of the two, the Darcy\u2013Weisbach factor {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub>}} is more commonly used by civil and mechanical engineers, and the Fanning factor {{mvar|f}} by chemical engineers, but care should be taken to identify the correct factor regardless of the source of the chart or formula.\n\nNote that\n\n: <math>\\Delta p = f_{\\mathrm D} \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot \\frac{\\rho {\\langle v \\rangle}^2}{2} = f \\cdot \\frac{L}{D} \\cdot {2\\rho {\\langle v \\rangle}^2}</math>\n\nMost charts or tables indicate the type of friction factor, or at least provide the formula for the friction factor with laminar flow. If the formula for laminar flow is {{math|''f'' {{=}} {{sfrac|16|Re}}}}, it is the Fanning factor {{mvar|f}}, and if the formula for laminar flow is {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|64|Re}}}}, it is the Darcy\u2013Weisbach factor {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub>}}.\n\nWhich friction factor is plotted in a Moody diagram may be determined by inspection if the publisher did not include the formula described above:\n#Observe the value of the friction factor for laminar flow at a Reynolds number of 1000.\n#If the value of the friction factor is 0.064, then the Darcy friction factor is plotted in the Moody diagram.  Note that the nonzero digits in 0.064 are the numerator in the formula for the laminar Darcy friction factor: {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|64|Re}}}}.\n#If the value of the friction factor is 0.016, then the Fanning friction factor is plotted in the Moody diagram.  Note that the nonzero digits in 0.016 are the numerator in the formula for the laminar Fanning friction factor: {{math|''f'' {{=}} {{sfrac|16|Re}}}}.\n\nThe procedure above is similar for any available Reynolds number that is an integer power of ten.  It is not necessary to remember the value 1000 for this procedure\u2014only that an integer power of ten is of interest for this purpose.\n\n== History ==\nHistorically this equation arose as a variant on the [[Prony equation]]; this variant was developed by [[Henry Darcy]] of France, and further refined into the form used today by [[Julius Weisbach]] of [[Saxony]] in 1845. Initially, data on the variation of {{math|''f''<sub>D</sub>}} with velocity was lacking, so the Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation was outperformed at first by the empirical Prony equation in many cases. In later years it was eschewed in many special-case situations in favor of a variety of [[empirical equation]]s valid only for certain flow regimes, notably the [[Hazen\u2013Williams equation]] or the [[Manning equation]], most of which were significantly easier to use in calculations. However, since the advent of the [[calculator]], ease of calculation is no longer a major issue, and so the Darcy\u2013Weisbach equation's generality has made it the preferred one.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Brown|first1=G.

The key quantities are then the pressure drop along the pipe per unit length, {{math|{{sfrac|\u0394''p''|''L''}}}}, and the volumetric flow rate. The flow rate can be converted to a mean flow velocity {{mvar|V}} by dividing by the [[Hydraulic diameter|wetted area]] of the flow (which equals the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional]] [[area]] of the pipe if the pipe is full of fluid).\n\nPressure has dimensions of energy per unit volume, therefore the pressure drop between two points must be proportional to the [[dynamic pressure]] q. We also know that pressure must be proportional to the length of the pipe between the two points {{mvar|L}} as the pressure drop per unit length is a constant. To turn the relationship into a proportionality coefficient  of dimensionless quantity, we can divide by the hydraulic diameter of the pipe, {{mvar|D}}, which is also constant along the pipe. Therefore,\n\n:<math>\\Delta p \\propto \\frac{L}{D} q.</math>\n\nThe proportionality coefficient is the dimensionless \"[[Darcy friction factor formulae|Darcy friction factor]]\" or \"flow coefficient\". This dimensionless coefficient will be a combination of geometric factors such as {{mvar|\u03c0}}, the Reynolds number and (outside the laminar regime) the relative roughness of the pipe (the ratio of the [[roughness height]] to the [[hydraulic diameter]]).\n\nNote that the dynamic pressure is not the kinetic energy of the fluid per unit volume,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} for the following reasons. Even in the case of [[laminar flow]], where all the [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|flow line]]s are parallel to the length of the pipe, the velocity of the fluid on the inner surface of the pipe is zero due to viscosity, and the velocity in the center of the pipe must therefore be larger than the average velocity obtained by dividing the volumetric flow rate by the wet area. The average kinetic energy then involves the [[Root-mean-square speed|root mean-square velocity]], which always exceeds the mean velocity. In the case of [[turbulent flow]], the fluid acquires random velocity components in all directions, including perpendicular to the length of the pipe, and thus turbulence contributes to the kinetic energy per unit volume but not to the average lengthwise velocity of the fluid.\n\n==Practical application==\nIn a [[hydraulic engineering]] application, it is typical for the volumetric flow {{mvar|Q}} within a pipe (that is, its productivity) and the head loss per unit length {{mvar|S}} (the concomitant power consumption) to be the critical important factors. The practical consequence is that, for a fixed volumetric flow rate {{mvar|Q}}, head loss {{mvar|S}} ''decreases'' with the inverse fifth power of the pipe diameter, {{mvar|D}}.  Doubling the diameter of a pipe of a given schedule (say, ANSI schedule 40) roughly doubles the amount of material required per unit length and thus its installed cost. Meanwhile, the head loss is decreased by a factor of 32 (about a 97% reduction). Thus the energy consumed in moving a given volumetric flow of the fluid is cut down dramatically for a modest increase in capital cost.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bernoulli's principle]]\n* [[Darcy friction factor formulae]]\n* [[Euler number (physics)|Euler number]]\n* [[Hagen\u2013Poiseuille equation]]\n* [[Water pipe]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last=De Nevers | year=1970 | title=Fluid Mechanics | publisher=Addison\u2013Wesley | isbn=0-201-01497-1 }}\n* {{cite book | last1=Shah | first1=R.

These were considered the most widespread and most likely to be adopted by speakers from other regions.<ref name=\"prores\" /> The initial idea to select this region as a base was first proposed in [[Krste Petkov Misirkov]]'s works as he believed the Macedonian language should abstract on those dialects that are distinct from neighbouring Slavic languages, such as Bulgarian and Serbian.<ref>Dedai\u0107, Mirjana N. et al. ''South Slavic Discourse Particles''; John Benjamins Publishing (2010) p. 13</ref> Likewise, this view does not take into account the fact that a Macedonian [[koin\u00e9 language]] was already in existence.<ref name=\"Comrie251\">{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=251}}</ref>\n\nBased on a large group of features, Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern, Western and Northern groups (the boundary geographically runs approximately from [[Skopje]] and [[Skopska Crna Gora]] along the rivers [[Vardar]] and Crna).<ref name=\"u103\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=103}}</ref> There are numerous [[isogloss]]es between these dialectal variations, with structural differences in phonetics, prosody (accentuation), morphology and syntax.<ref name=\"u103\" /> \n\nVariations in consonants occur between the two groups, with most Western regions losing the /x/ and the /v/ in intervocalic position (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (head): /\u0261lava/  = /\u0261la/: ''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438'' (heads): /\u0261lavi/ = /\u0261laj/) while Eastern dialects preserve it. Stress in the Western dialects is generally fixed and falls on the antepenultimate syllable while Eastern dialects have non-fixed stress systems that can fall on any syllable of the word,<ref name=\"usikova110\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref> that is also reminiscent of Bulgarian dialects. Additionally, Eastern dialects are distinguishable by their fast tonality, [[elision]] of sounds and the suffixes for definiteness. The Northern dialectal group is close to South Serbian and [[Torlakian dialects]] and is characterized by 46\u201347 phonetic and grammatical isoglosses.<ref name=\"u104\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=104}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the [[Proto-Slavic]] reduced vowels ([[yer]]s), vocalic sonorants, and the back nasal *\u01eb. That classification distinguishes between the following 6 groups:<ref>{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=247}}</ref>\n\nWestern Dialects:\n* '''Ohrid-Prespa Group''': [[Ohrid dialect]], [[Struga dialect]], [[Vev\u010dani-Rado\u017eda dialect]], [[Upper Prespa dialect]] and [[Lower Prespa dialect]].\n* '''Debar Group''': [[Debar dialect]], [[Reka dialect]], [[Drimkol-Golo Brdo dialect]], [[Gali\u010dnik dialect]], [[Skopska Crna Gora dialect]] and [[Na\u0161inski|Gora dialect]]\n* '''Polog Group''': [[Upper Polog dialect]], [[Lower Polog dialect]], [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]], [[Ki\u010devo-Pore\u010de dialect]] and [[Skopje-Veles dialect]]\n* '''Kostur-Kor\u010da Group''': [[Kor\u010da dialect]], [[Kostur dialect]] and [[Nestram-Kostenar dialect]]\n\nEastern Dialects:\n* '''Northern Group''': [[Kumanovo dialect]], [[Kratovo dialect]], [[Kriva Palanka dialect]] and [[Ov\u010de Pole dialect]]\n* '''Eastern Group''': [[\u0160tip - Ko\u010dani dialect]], [[Strumica dialect]], [[Tikve\u0161-Mariovo dialect]], [[Male\u0161evo-Pirin dialect]],  [[Solun-Voden dialect]] and [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Listen\n| type          = speech\n| header        = \n| filename      = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Bitola.ogg\n| title         = Bitola dialect\n| description   = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Bitola]]\n| filename2     = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Topol\u010dani.ogg\n| title2        = Prilep dialect\n| description2  = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Prilep]]\n\n}}\n{{main|Macedonian phonology}}\nThe [[phonology|phonological]] system of Standard Macedonian is based on the [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]].

For the pronunciation of the middle vowels /''\u0435''/ and /''\u043e''/ by native Macedonian speakers, various vowel sounds can be produced ranging from [\u025b] to [\u1eb9] and from [o] to [\u1ecd]. Unstressed vowels are not [[vowel reduction|reduced]], although they are pronounced more weakly and shortly than stressed ones, especially if they are found in a stressed syllable.{{sfn|Friedman|1998|p=252}}<ref name=\"gramatika\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001}}</ref> The five vowels and the letter /''\u0440''/ which acts as a [[semivowel]] when found between two consonants (e.g. ''\u0446\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430'', \"church\"), can be syllable-forming.<ref name=\"usikova111\" /> \n\nThe [[schwa]] is phonemic in many dialects (varying in closeness to {{IPAblink|\u028c}} or {{IPAblink|\u0268}}) but its use in the standard language is marginal.<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\"/> When writing a dialectal word and keeping the schwa for aesthetic effect, an [[apostrophe]] is used; for example, {{angbr|\u043a\u2019\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0442}}, {{angbr|\u0441\u2019\u043d\u0446\u0435}}, etc. When spelling words letter-by-letters, each consonant is followed by the schwa sound. The individual letters of [[acronyms]] are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: {{angbr|[[Macedonian Orthodox Church|\u041c\u041f\u0426]]}} ({{IPA|[m\u0259.p\u0259.t\u0361s\u0259]}}). The lexicalized acronyms {{angbr|[[USSR|\u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420]]}} ({{IPA|[\u025bs.\u025bs.\u025bs.\u025br]}}) and {{angbr|\u041c\u0422}} ({{IPA|[\u025bm.t\u025b]}}) (a brand of cigarettes), are among the few exceptions. [[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441}} {{IPA-mk|\u02c8v\u025b\u02d0l\u025bs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'. The sequence {{IPA|/aa/}} is often realized phonetically as {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}; e.g. {{angbr|\u0441\u0430\u0430\u0442}} {{IPA|/saat/}} {{IPA|[sa\u02d0t]}} '''colloq.'' hour', {{angbr|\u0437\u043c\u0438\u0438}} - snakes. In other words, two vowels appearing next to each other can also be pronounced twice separately (e.g. ''\u043f\u043e\u043e\u0434\u0438'' - to walk).<ref name=\"usikova111\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n|+ Vowels<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lunt|1952|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n!\n!

The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]] in Macedonian is {{linktext|antepenultimate}} and dynamic (expiratory). This means that it falls on the third from last [[syllable]] in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source.<ref name=\"usikova109\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=109-110}}</ref> To note which syllable of the word should be accented, Macedonian uses an apostrophe over its vowels.

This linguistic phenomenon is called ''\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442'' and is denoted with a (\u035c ) sign. Several words are taken as a single unit and thus follow the rules of the stress falling on the antepenultimate syllable. The rule applies when using [[clitics]] (either enclitics or proclitics) such as the negating particle ''\u043d\u0435'' with verbs (''\u0442\u043e\u0458 \u043d\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he did not come) and with short pronoun forms or the future particle ''\u045c\u0435'' are used in-between (''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u043c\u0443  \u035c  \u0458\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u0430\u0434\u0435'', did not give it to him; ''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u045c\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he will not come).<ref name=\"matura\" /> Other uses include the [[imperative form]] accompanied by short pronoun forms (''\u0434\u00e1\u0458  \u035c  \u043c\u0438'': give me), the expression of possessives (''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430  \u035c  \u043c\u0438''), prepositions followed by a noun (''\u0437\u00e1\u0434  \u035c  \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430''), question words followed by verbs (''\u043a\u043e\u0433\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435''), some compound nouns (''\u0441\u0443\u0432\u00f3  \u035c  \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0458\u0435'' - raisins, ''\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u00f3  \u035c  \u043c\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e'' - yoghurt) and others.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Macedonian grammar}}\n\nMacedonian grammar is markedly [[Analytic language|analytic]] in comparison with other Slavic languages, having lost the common Slavic case system. The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] [[participle]] in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]].\n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe [[vocative]] of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{cite book|last=Bogdanoska|first=Biljana|year=2008|title=\u0417\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430|trans-title=Macedonian language and literature for students|language=mk|publisher=Bomat Grafiks|location=[[Skopje]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills).

As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three [[definite article]]s, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThree types of pronouns can be distinguished in Macedonian: [[personal pronouns|personal]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438''), [[relative pronouns|relative]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438'') and [[demonstrative pronouns|demonstrative]] (''\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438''). Case relations are marked in pronouns.\n\nPersonal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''. Examples of personal pronouns are shown below:\n*Personal pronoun: '''''\u0408\u0430\u0441''' \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043c \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430''.

(\"He told me to come\")\n\nRelative pronouns can refer to a person (''\u043a\u043e\u0458, \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0435'' - who), objects (''\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - which) or serve as indicators of possession (''\u0447\u0438\u0458, \u0447\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0447\u0438\u0435'' - whose) in the function of a question or a relative word. These pronouns are inflected for gender and number and other word forms can be derived from them (''\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0458'' - nobody, ''\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - something, ''\u0441\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0458'' - everybody's). There are three groups of demonstrative pronouns that can indicate proximate (''\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0458'' - this one (mas.)), distal (''\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0430'' - the one there (fem.)) and unspecific (''\u0442\u043e\u0430'' - that one (neut.)) objects.

Per this grammatical category, one can distinguish between ''\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e'' i.e. definite past, denoting events that the speaker witnessed at a given definite time point, and ''\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e'' i.e. indefinite past denoting events that did not occur at a definite time point or events reported to the speaker, excluding the time component in the latter case.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant. \n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and a past tense of the verb conjugated for person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, transitiveness, mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a [[grammatical aspect]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Per this category, verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long). In addition to its primary functions, the imperative is used to indicate actions in the past, eternal truths as is the case in sayings and a condition. The Macedonian conditional is conjugated in the same way for all three persons using the particle ''\u0431\u0438'' and the verbal l-form,  ''\u0431\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b'' (I/you/he would read).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n===Syntax and prepositions===\nMacedonian syntax has a [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) [[word order]] which is nevertheless flexible and can be [[tropicalization|tropicalized]].<ref name=\"gramatika\" /> For instance, the sentence ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d'' (Marija loves Ivan) can become of the [[object\u2013verb\u2013subject]] (OVS) form as well, ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430''.<ref name=\"u116\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=116}}</ref> Tropicalization can also be achieved using a combination of word order and intonation; as an example all of the following sentences give a different point of emphasis:\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the subject)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on both the subject and the verb)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the verb and the object)<ref name=\"Friedman50\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=50}}</ref>\n\nMacedonian is a [[null-subject language]] which means that the subject pronoun can be omitted, for instance ''\u0428\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0448 (\u0442\u0438)?''

In the fourteenth century, the Ottoman Turks invaded and conquered most of the Balkans, incorporating Macedonia into the [[Ottoman Empire]].

During this time, Yugoslav Macedonia became known as [[Vardar Banovina]] (Vardar province) and the language of public life, education and the church was Serbo-Croatian.

The Macedonian language was proclaimed the official language of the Republic of Macedonia at the First Session of the Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia, held on 2 August 1944. The first official Macedonian grammar was developed by Krume Kepeski. One of the most important contributors in the standardisation of the Macedonian literary language was [[Bla\u017ee Koneski]]. The first document written in the literary standard Macedonian language is the first issue of the ''[[Nova Makedonija]]'' newspaper in 1944. ''Makedonska Iskra'' (Macedonian Spark) was the first Macedonian newspaper published in Australia, from 1946 to 1957. Its articles were not in standard Macedonian but in local [[Slavic dialects of Greece]]. A monthly with national distribution, it commenced in Perth and later moved to Melbourne and Sydney.

These were considered the most widespread and most likely to be adopted by speakers from other regions.<ref name=\"prores\" /> The initial idea to select this region as a base was first proposed in [[Krste Petkov Misirkov]]'s works as he believed the Macedonian language should abstract on those dialects that are distinct from neighbouring Slavic languages, such as Bulgarian and Serbian.<ref>Dedai\u0107, Mirjana N. et al. ''South Slavic Discourse Particles''; John Benjamins Publishing (2010) p. 13</ref> Likewise, this view does not take into account the fact that a Macedonian [[koin\u00e9 language]] was already in existence.<ref name=\"Comrie251\">{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=251}}</ref>\n\nBased on a large group of features, Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern, Western and Northern groups (the boundary geographically runs approximately from [[Skopje]] and [[Skopska Crna Gora]] along the rivers [[Vardar]] and Crna).<ref name=\"u103\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=103}}</ref> There are numerous [[isogloss]]es between these dialectal variations, with structural differences in phonetics, prosody (accentuation), morphology and syntax.<ref name=\"u103\" /> \n\nVariations in consonants occur between the two groups, with most Western regions losing the /x/ and the /v/ in intervocalic position (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (head): /\u0261lava/  = /\u0261la/: ''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438'' (heads): /\u0261lavi/ = /\u0261laj/) while Eastern dialects preserve it. Stress in the Western dialects is generally fixed and falls on the antepenultimate syllable while Eastern dialects have non-fixed stress systems that can fall on any syllable of the word,<ref name=\"usikova110\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref> that is also reminiscent of Bulgarian dialects. Additionally, Eastern dialects are distinguishable by their fast tonality, [[elision]] of sounds and the suffixes for definiteness. The Northern dialectal group is close to South Serbian and [[Torlakian dialects]] and is characterized by 46\u201347 phonetic and grammatical isoglosses.<ref name=\"u104\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=104}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the [[Proto-Slavic]] reduced vowels ([[yer]]s), vocalic sonorants, and the back nasal *\u01eb. That classification distinguishes between the following 6 groups:<ref>{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=247}}</ref>\n\nWestern Dialects:\n* '''Ohrid-Prespa Group''': [[Ohrid dialect]], [[Struga dialect]], [[Vev\u010dani-Rado\u017eda dialect]], [[Upper Prespa dialect]] and [[Lower Prespa dialect]].\n* '''Debar Group''': [[Debar dialect]], [[Reka dialect]], [[Drimkol-Golo Brdo dialect]], [[Gali\u010dnik dialect]], [[Skopska Crna Gora dialect]] and [[Na\u0161inski|Gora dialect]]\n* '''Polog Group''': [[Upper Polog dialect]], [[Lower Polog dialect]], [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]], [[Ki\u010devo-Pore\u010de dialect]] and [[Skopje-Veles dialect]]\n* '''Kostur-Kor\u010da Group''': [[Kor\u010da dialect]], [[Kostur dialect]] and [[Nestram-Kostenar dialect]]\n\nEastern Dialects:\n* '''Northern Group''': [[Kumanovo dialect]], [[Kratovo dialect]], [[Kriva Palanka dialect]] and [[Ov\u010de Pole dialect]]\n* '''Eastern Group''': [[\u0160tip - Ko\u010dani dialect]], [[Strumica dialect]], [[Tikve\u0161-Mariovo dialect]], [[Male\u0161evo-Pirin dialect]],  [[Solun-Voden dialect]] and [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Listen\n| type          = speech\n| header        = \n| filename      = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Bitola.ogg\n| title         = Bitola dialect\n| description   = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Bitola]]\n| filename2     = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Topol\u010dani.ogg\n| title2        = Prilep dialect\n| description2  = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Prilep]]\n\n}}\n{{main|Macedonian phonology}}\nThe [[phonology|phonological]] system of Standard Macedonian is based on the [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]].

For the pronunciation of the middle vowels /''\u0435''/ and /''\u043e''/ by native Macedonian speakers, various vowel sounds can be produced ranging from [\u025b] to [\u1eb9] and from [o] to [\u1ecd]. Unstressed vowels are not [[vowel reduction|reduced]], although they are pronounced more weakly and shortly than stressed ones, especially if they are found in a stressed syllable.{{sfn|Friedman|1998|p=252}}<ref name=\"gramatika\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001}}</ref> The five vowels and the letter /''\u0440''/ which acts as a [[semivowel]] when found between two consonants (e.g. ''\u0446\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430'', \"church\"), can be syllable-forming.<ref name=\"usikova111\" /> \n\nThe [[schwa]] is phonemic in many dialects (varying in closeness to {{IPAblink|\u028c}} or {{IPAblink|\u0268}}) but its use in the standard language is marginal.<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\"/> When writing a dialectal word and keeping the schwa for aesthetic effect, an [[apostrophe]] is used; for example, {{angbr|\u043a\u2019\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0442}}, {{angbr|\u0441\u2019\u043d\u0446\u0435}}, etc. When spelling words letter-by-letters, each consonant is followed by the schwa sound. The individual letters of [[acronyms]] are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: {{angbr|[[Macedonian Orthodox Church|\u041c\u041f\u0426]]}} ({{IPA|[m\u0259.p\u0259.t\u0361s\u0259]}}). The lexicalized acronyms {{angbr|[[USSR|\u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420]]}} ({{IPA|[\u025bs.\u025bs.\u025bs.\u025br]}}) and {{angbr|\u041c\u0422}} ({{IPA|[\u025bm.t\u025b]}}) (a brand of cigarettes), are among the few exceptions. [[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441}} {{IPA-mk|\u02c8v\u025b\u02d0l\u025bs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'. The sequence {{IPA|/aa/}} is often realized phonetically as {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}; e.g. {{angbr|\u0441\u0430\u0430\u0442}} {{IPA|/saat/}} {{IPA|[sa\u02d0t]}} '''colloq.'' hour', {{angbr|\u0437\u043c\u0438\u0438}} - snakes. In other words, two vowels appearing next to each other can also be pronounced twice separately (e.g. ''\u043f\u043e\u043e\u0434\u0438'' - to walk).<ref name=\"usikova111\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n|+ Vowels<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lunt|1952|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n!\n!

The dental nasal ({{IPA|/n/}}) and dental lateral ({{IPA|/\u026b/}}) are also syllabic in certain foreign words; e.g. {{angbr|\u045a\u0443\u0442\u043d}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0272utn\u0329]}} '[[Newton (unit)|newton]]', {{angbr|\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0442\u043b}} {{IPA|[p\u0254p\u0254ka\u02c8t\u025bp\u025bt\u026b\u0329]}} '[[Popocat\u00e9petl]]', etc. The [[labiodental nasal]] {{IPA|[\u0271]}} occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0432\u0430\u0458}} {{IPA|[\u02c8tra\u0271vaj]}} '[[tram]]'). The [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} similarly occur as an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438}} {{IPA|[\u02c8a\u014b\u0261liski]}} 'English'). The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]] in Macedonian is {{linktext|antepenultimate}} and dynamic (expiratory).

The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] [[participle]] in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]].\n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe [[vocative]] of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{cite book|last=Bogdanoska|first=Biljana|year=2008|title=\u0417\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430|trans-title=Macedonian language and literature for students|language=mk|publisher=Bomat Grafiks|location=[[Skopje]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills).

As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three [[definite article]]s, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThree types of pronouns can be distinguished in Macedonian: [[personal pronouns|personal]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438''), [[relative pronouns|relative]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438'') and [[demonstrative pronouns|demonstrative]] (''\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438''). Case relations are marked in pronouns.\n\nPersonal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''.

(\"He told me to come\")\n\nRelative pronouns can refer to a person (''\u043a\u043e\u0458, \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0435'' - who), objects (''\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - which) or serve as indicators of possession (''\u0447\u0438\u0458, \u0447\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0447\u0438\u0435'' - whose) in the function of a question or a relative word.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant. \n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and a past tense of the verb conjugated for person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, transitiveness, mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a [[grammatical aspect]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Per this category, verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long).

Although the written language, now called [[Church Slavonic]], remained static as a result of Turkish domination, the spoken dialects moved further apart.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe earliest lexicographic evidence of the Macedonian dialects, described as Bulgarian,<ref>[http://www.slav.uni-sofia.bg/lilijournal/index.php/bg/issues/contents-spring2010/articles-spring2010/170-ilieval-2010 Littera et Lingua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112190002/http://www.slav.uni-sofia.bg/lilijournal/index.php/bg/issues/contents-spring2010/articles-spring2010/170-ilieval-2010 |date=2013-11-12 }}, {{ISSN|1312-6172}}, \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442 2010, \u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0418\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 XVI \u0438 XVII \u0432\u0435\u043a.</ref> can be found in a lexicon from the 16th century written in the Greek alphabet.<ref>[http://www.mn.mk/docs/Makedonski-Leksikon-XVI-vek.pdf 'Un Lexique Macedonien Du XVIe Siecle'], Giannelli, Ciro.

His work articulated for the first time a distinct pair of two groups of [[Bulgarian dialects]]: Eastern and Western (spoken in today Western Bulgaria and North Macedonia).

Misirkov was born in a village [[Pella (modern)|Postol]] in Ottoman Macedonia. Although literature had been written in the Slavic dialects of Macedonia before, arguably the most important book published in relation to the Macedonian language was Misirkov's ''On Macedonian Matters'', published in 1903. In that book, he argued for creation of a standard literary Macedonian language from the central dialects of Macedonia that would use a [[phonemic orthography]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nAfter the first two Balkan wars, the region of Macedonia was split between Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia (later [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], Yugoslavia). Serbia occupied the area that is currently North Macedonia incorporating it into the Kingdom as \"Southern Serbia\". During this time, Yugoslav Macedonia became known as [[Vardar Banovina]] (Vardar province) and the language of public life, education and the church was Serbo-Croatian. In the other two parts of Macedonia the respective national languages, Greek and Bulgarian, were made official. In Bulgarian (Pirin) Macedonia, the local dialects continued to be described as dialects of Bulgarian.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[second World War]], most of Yugoslav Macedonia was occupied by the Bulgarian army, who was allied with the Axis. The standard Bulgarian language was reintroduced in schools and [[liturgies]].

The Macedonian language was proclaimed the official language of the Republic of Macedonia at the First Session of the Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia, held on 2 August 1944. The first official Macedonian grammar was developed by Krume Kepeski. One of the most important contributors in the standardisation of the Macedonian literary language was [[Bla\u017ee Koneski]]. The first document written in the literary standard Macedonian language is the first issue of the ''[[Nova Makedonija]]'' newspaper in 1944. ''Makedonska Iskra'' (Macedonian Spark) was the first Macedonian newspaper published in Australia, from 1946 to 1957. Its articles were not in standard Macedonian but in local [[Slavic dialects of Greece]]. A monthly with national distribution, it commenced in Perth and later moved to Melbourne and Sydney. After the [[Tito-Stalin split]] in 1948, under the auspices of some Macedonian intellectuals in [[Bucharest]], anti-Yugoslav,  ''non-[[serbianisation|serbianised]]'' alphabet, grammar, and primer were created.<ref>Keith Brown, Macedonia's Child-grandfathers: The Transnational Politics of Memory, Exile, and Return, 1948-1998; Henry M.
