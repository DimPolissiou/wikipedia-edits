It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

Hill.{{sfnp|Whitfield|1926|pages=356\u2013357}} The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nAmid the \"hard times\", Everett launched a campaign to become [[county seat]] by replacing [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]], which had waned in importance following the completion of several railroads. An election to determine which city would be named county seat was scheduled for November 6, 1894, beginning a heated debate by citizens and newspapers.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|pages=121\u2013122}} The initial count by the commissioners was announced on December 19 in Everett's favor, amid accusations of fraud and bought votes from both sides.

The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

The area had an estimated population of 5,000 by the end of the year, shortly before the completion of the Great Northern Railway across [[Stevens Pass]] on January 6, 1893.

The company's investment into the [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] area yielded ore of poorer quality than expected and it was unable to meet the promises in the \"Remarkable Document\", which was amended several times with the Rucker Brothers, by then junior partners in the company.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|p=119}} Rockefeller called his investment into question and appointed advisory Frederick Gates to begin divestment while Colby and Hoyt remained as the leaders of the company.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|p=119}} Several of the major businesses in Everett closed or failed during the three-year height of the economic depression, but work on [[Alexander McDougall (ship designer)|Alexander McDougall]]'s [[Whaleback]] was finished with the launch of {{SS|City of Everett}} in October 1894, the largest to be built on Puget Sound at the time.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=23}} The Everett Women's Book Club was established in 1894 and opened the city's first [[hospital]] and [[public library]], which would later expand into the [[Everett Public Library]] system.<ref>{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=April 14, 2019 |title=Everett''s museum salutes book club celebrating 125 years |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/everetts-museum-salutes-book-club-celebrating-125-years/ |work=The Everett Herald |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter outside investors withdrew in 1895, the Everett Land Company's holdings were transferred to the [[Everett Improvement Company]], controlled by James J. Hill.{{sfnp|Whitfield|1926|pages=356\u2013357}} The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nAmid the \"hard times\", Everett launched a campaign to become [[county seat]] by replacing [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]], which had waned in importance following the completion of several railroads. An election to determine which city would be named county seat was scheduled for November 6, 1894, beginning a heated debate by citizens and newspapers.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|pages=121\u2013122}} The initial count by the commissioners was announced on December 19 in Everett's favor, amid accusations of fraud and bought votes from both sides. Following an appeal from Snohomish, thee [[Washington Supreme Court]] declared the result to be invalid and blocked the move, but a recount by the commissioners in October 1895 remained in Everett's favor.{{sfnp|Whitfield|1926|pages=136\u2013137}} A long legal battle was fought between the two cities and was decided in October 1895 by the Supreme Court, who ruled that Everett would become county seat per the legal and binding recount.{{sfnp|Whitfield|1926|p=139}} In January 1897, the county government's records were moved by wagons from Snohomish to Everett, where a three-story [[courthouse]] was opened on February 1, 1898.{{sfnp|Cameron|LeWarne|May|O'Donnell|2005|pages=121\u2013122}}{{sfnp|Whitfield|1926|p=140}}\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.

They do this in order to protect their territory from other insect-eating birds that would eat the bell lerps on which they feed.  Whenever the local forests die back, due to increased lerp psyllid infestations, bell miners undergo a population boom.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe bell miner (''Manorina melanophrys'') belongs to the family of [[honeyeater]]s and Australian chats ([[Meliphagidae]]), which is part of the superfamily [[Meliphagoidea]] that also comprises the Australian warblers, scrubwrens, and thornbills ([[Acanthizidae]]); bristlebirds ([[Dasyornithidae]]); fairy-wrens ([[Maluridae]]); and pardalotes ([[Pardalotidae]]).<ref name=\"Phylogeny\">{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Janet L.|last2=Trueman|first2=John W.H.|last3=Ebert|first3=Daniel|last4=Joseph|first4=Leo|last5=Magrath|first5=Robert D.|title=Phylogeny and evolution of the Meliphagoidea, the largest radiation of Australasian songbirds|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|date=June 2010|volume=55|issue=3|pages=1087\u20131102|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005|pmid=20152917}}</ref>\nBell miners share the genus ''[[Manorina]]'' with three other endemic Australian miners: the [[noisy miner]] (''M. melanocephala''), the [[yellow-throated miner]] (''M. flavigula''), and the endangered [[black-eared miner]] (''M. melanotis''). The three other miners were previously classified in the genus ''Myzantha'', which is still sometimes listed as a subgenus for those species. The closest related genus to ''[[Manorina]]'' has been genetically found to be the New Guinea and New Britain ''[[Melidectes]]'' honeyeaters.

The common name refers to their bell-like call. 'Miner' is an old alternative spelling of '[[myna]]', and is shared with other members of the genus ''[[Manorina]]''.<ref>For the derivation of 'miner' from 'myna', see comment at Common Indian Myna [http://fennerschool-associated.anu.edu.au/myna/] Retrieved 12 September 2013</ref>  The birds feed almost exclusively on the dome-like coverings, referred to as 'bell lerps', of certain [[psyllid]] bugs that feed on [[eucalyptus]] sap from the leaves. The psyllids make these bell lerps from their own honeydew secretions in order to protect themselves from predators and the environment.\n\nBell miners live in large, complex, social groups.  Within each group, there are subgroups consisting of several breeding pairs, but also including a number of birds that are not currently breeding.  The nonbreeders help in providing food for the young in all the nests within the subgroup, even though they are not necessarily closely related to them.<ref name=\"Ethology\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = M.
