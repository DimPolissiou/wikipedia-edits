The term has meanings in [[theology]], where it refers to a [[belief]], and in [[art]], where it refers to a [[genre]].\n\nIn theology, ''apotheosis'' refers to the idea that an individual has been raised to godlike stature. In art, the term refers to the treatment of any subject (a figure, group, locale, motif, convention or melody) in a particularly grand or exalted manner.\n\n==Antiquity==\n{{further|imperial cult|divine king}}\nBefore the Hellenistic period, [[imperial cult]]s were known in [[Ancient Egypt]] ([[pharaoh]]s) and [[Mesopotamia]] (since [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]). From the [[New Kingdom]], all deceased pharaohs were deified as the god [[Osiris]].\n\n==Ancient Greece==\n{{Main|Greek hero cult}}\nFrom at least the [[Geometric art|Geometric]] period of the ninth century BC, the long-deceased heroes linked with [[founding myth]]s of Greek sites were accorded [[chthonic]] rites in their ''[[heroon]]'', or \"hero-temple\".\n\nIn the Greek world, the first leader who accorded himself divine honours was [[Philip II of Macedon]]. At his wedding to his sixth wife, Philip's enthroned image was carried in procession among the [[Olympian gods]]; \"his example at [[Vergina|Aigai]] became a custom, passing to the Macedonian kings who were later worshipped in [[Hellenistic civilization|Greek Asia]], from them to [[Julius Caesar]] and so to the emperors of Rome\".<ref>Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'' (1973:20)</ref> Such Hellenistic state leaders might be raised to a status equal to the gods before death (e.g., [[Alexander the Great]]) or afterwards (e.g., members of the\n[[Ptolemaic dynasty]]). A heroic cult status similar to apotheosis was also an honour given to a few revered artists of the distant past, notably [[Homer]].\n\nArchaic and Classical Greek hero-cults became primarily civic, extended from their familial origins, in the sixth century; by the fifth century none of the worshipers based their authority by tracing descent back to the hero, with the exception of some families who inherited particular priestly cults, such as the [[Eumolpides]] (descended from [[Eumolpus]]) of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]], and some inherited priesthoods at [[oracle|oracle site]]s. The Greek hero cults can be distinguished on the other hand from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|cult of dead emperors]], because the hero was not thought of as having ascended to Olympus or become a god: he was beneath the earth, and his power purely local.  For this reason, hero cults were [[chthonic]] in nature, and their rituals more closely resembled those for [[Hecate]] and [[Persephone]] than those for [[Zeus]] and [[Apollo]]. Two exceptions were [[Heracles]] and [[Asclepius]], who might be honoured as either gods or heroes, sometimes by chthonic night-time rites and sacrifice on the following day.\n\n==Ancient Rome==\n{{main|Imperial cult (ancient Rome)}}\nUp to the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the god [[Quirinus]] was the only one the Romans accepted as having undergone apotheosis, for his identification/[[syncretism]] with [[Romulus]]. (See [[Euhemerism]]).{{sfn|Garnett|Mackintosh|1911}} Subsequently, apotheosis in [[ancient Rome]] was a process whereby a deceased ruler was recognized as having been divine by his successor, usually also by a [[S.P.Q.R.|decree of the Senate and popular consent]]. In addition to showing respect, often the present ruler deified a popular predecessor to legitimize himself and gain popularity with the people. The upper-class did not always take part in the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]],{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} and some privately ridiculed the apotheosis of inept and feeble emperors, as in the satire ''[[The Pumpkinification of Claudius|The Pumpkinification of (the Divine) Claudius]]'', usually attributed to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].\n\nAt the height of the imperial cult during the [[Roman Empire]], sometimes the [[Roman emperor|emperor]]'s deceased loved ones\u2014heirs, empresses, or lovers, as Hadrian's [[Antinous]]\u2014were deified as well. Deified people were awarded posthumously the title ''Divus'' (''Diva'' if women) to their names to signify their divinity. [[Religion in ancient Rome|Traditional Roman religion]] distinguished between a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#deus, dea, di, dii|deus]]'' (god) and a ''[[divus]]'' (a mortal who became divine or deified), though not consistently. Temples and columns were erected to provide a space for worship.\n\n==Ancient China==\nThe [[Ming dynasty]] epic ''[[Fengshen Yanyi|Investiture of the Gods]]'' deals heavily with deification legends. Numerous mortals have been deified into the [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], such as [[Guan Yu]], [[Iron-crutch Li]] and [[Fan Kuai]]. [[Song Dynasty]] General [[Yue Fei]] was deified during the [[Ming Dynasty]] and is considered by some practitioners to be one of the three highest-ranking heavenly generals.<ref>Liu, James T.

Traditional mainstream theology, both East and West, views [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] as the preexisting God who undertook mortal existence, not as a mortal being who attained divinity. It holds that he has made it possible for human beings to be raised to the level of sharing the divine nature: he became human to make humans \"partakers of the divine nature\"<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|KJV}}</ref> \"For this is why the Word became man, and the Son of God became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a son of God.''\"<ref>[[Irenaeus of Lyon]], ''Adversus haereses'', 3.19.1</ref> \"For He was made man that we might be made God.\"<ref name=\"AthanasiusOnTheIncarnation54_3\">St. Athanasius, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html ''On the Incarnation of the Word'' 54.3] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QWCtlc7G?url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html |date=2007-07-22 }}.</ref> \"The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods.\"<ref>[[Thomas Aquinas]], Opusc. 57, 1-4</ref>\n\nThe Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology contains the following in an article titled \"Deification\":\n\n:''Deification (Greek theosis) is for Orthodoxy the goal of every Christian. Man, according to the Bible, is 'made in the image and likeness of God.'. . . It is possible for man to become like God, to become deified, to become god by grace. This doctrine is based on many passages of both OT and NT (e.g. Ps. 82 (81).6; II Peter 1.4), and it is essentially the teaching both of St Paul, though he tends to use the language of filial adoption (cf. Rom. 8.9\u201417; Gal. 4.5\u20147), and the Fourth Gospel (cf. 17.21\u201423).''\n\n:''The language of II Peter is taken up by St Irenaeus, in his famous phrase, 'if the Word has been made man, it is so that men may be made gods' (Adv. Haer V, Pref.), and becomes the standard in Greek theology. In the fourth century, St. Athanasius repeats Irenaeus almost word for word, and in the fifth century, St. Cyril of Alexandria says that we shall become sons 'by participation' (Greek methexis). Deification is the central idea in the spirituality of St. Maximus the Confessor, for whom the doctrine is the corollary of the Incarnation: 'Deification, briefly, is the encompassing and fulfillment of all times and ages,' . . . and St. Symeon the New Theologian at the end of the tenth century writes, 'He who is God by nature converses with those whom he has made gods by grace, as a friend converses with his friends, face to face.' . . .''\n\n===Roman Catholic Church===\nThe Roman Catholic Church does not use the term \"apotheosis\".\n\nCorresponding to the Greek word ''theosis'' are the [[Latin]]-derived words \"divinization\" and \"deification\" used in the parts of the [[Catholic Church]] that are of Latin tradition. The concept has been given less prominence in Western theology than in that of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], but is present in the [[Latin Church]]'s liturgical prayers, such as that of the deacon or priest when pouring wine and a little water into the chalice: \"By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity.\"<ref>''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article \"deification\"</ref> The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] quotes with approval [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius's]] saying, \"The Son of God became man so that we might become God.\"<ref name=\"AthanasiusOnTheIncarnation54_3\"/><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 460] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201419/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM |date=February 16, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nCatholic theology stresses the concept of supernatural life, \"a new creation and elevation, a rebirth, it is a participation in and partaking of the divine nature\"<ref>Heinrich Fries, ''[http://www.google.com/search?q=Fries+Catholic+%22partaking+of+the+divine+nature%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1 Bultmann-Barth and Catholic theology]'' (Duquesne University Press 1967), p. 160</ref> (cf. {{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|ESV}}). In Catholic teaching there is a vital distinction between natural life and supernatural life, the latter being \"the life that God, in an act of love, freely gives to human beings to elevate them above their natural lives\" and which they receive through prayer and the sacraments; indeed the Catholic Church sees human existence as having as its whole purpose the acquisition, preservation and intensification of this supernatural life.<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?q=%22stephen+m.+o%27brien%22+%22supernatural+life%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1 Stephen M.

The concept of God's nature that was eventually accepted as Christian doctrine in the 4th century set divinity apart from humanity by defining the [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]] as three persons sharing a common divine substance. That classification of God in terms of a substance is not found in scripture<ref>Thomas Mozley The creed or a philosophy 1893 p303</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/creed_homoian_of_constantinople_360.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925052330/http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/creed_homoian_of_constantinople_360.htm |archivedate=2014-09-25 }} (the wording of the [[Council of Constantinople (360)]] prohibited use of the terms \"substance,\" \"essence,\" and \"ousia\" since they were not included in the scriptures)</ref> but, in many aspects, mirrored the Greek metaphysical philosophies that are known to have influenced the thinking of Church Fathers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/trinity-history.html#Aug|title=Trinity > History of Trinitarian Doctrines (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}</ref> such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Origen]], and [[Augustine]]. Mormons teach that by modern revelation, God restored the knowledge that he is the literal father of our spirits (Hebrews 12:9) and that the Biblical references to God creating mankind in his image and likeness are in no way allegorical. As such, Mormons assert that as the literal offspring of God the Father (Acts 17:28-29), humans have the potential to be heirs of his glory and co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:16-17). The glory, Mormons believe, lies not in God's substance but in his intelligence: in other words, light and truth (Doctrine and Covenants 93:36<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 93|author=|date=|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org|df=}}</ref>). Thus, the purpose of humans is to grow and progress to become like the Father in Heaven. Mortality is seen as a crucial step in the process in which God's spirit children gain a body, which, though formed in the image of the Father's body, is subject to pain, illness, temptation, and death. The purpose of this earth life is to learn to choose the right in the face of that opposition, thereby gaining essential experience and wisdom. The level of intelligence we attain in this life will rise in the Resurrection (Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19). Bodies will then be immortal like those of the Father and the Son (Philippians 3:21), but the degree of glory to which each person will resurrect is contingent upon the Final Judgment (Revelation 20:13, 1 Corinthians 15:40-41). Those who are worthy to return to God's presence can continue to progress towards a fullness of God's glory, which Mormons refer to as eternal life, or [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]] (Doctrine and Covenants 76).\n\nThe LDS concept of apotheosis/exaltation is expressed in LDS scriptures (Mosiah 3:19, Alma 13:12, D&C 78:7, D&C 78:22, D&C 84:4, D&C 84:23, D&C 88:68, D&C 93:28) and is expressed by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: \"Though stretched by our challenges, by living righteously and enduring well we can eventually become sufficiently more like Jesus in our traits and attributes, that one day we can dwell in the Father's presence forever and ever\" (Neal Maxwell, October 1997).\n\nIn early 2014, the LDS church published an essay on the official church website specifically addressing the foundations, history, and official beliefs regarding apotheosis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng|title=Becoming Like God|first=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day|last=Saints|date=|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org|df=}}</ref> The essay addresses the scriptural foundations of this belief, teachings of the early Church Fathers on the subject of deification, and the teachings of LDS church leaders, starting with Joseph Smith.\n\n==In art==\nIn art the matter is practical: the elevation of a figure to divine level entails certain conventions. So it is that the apotheosis genre exists in Christian art as in other art. The features of the apotheosis genre may be seen in subjects that emphasize Christ's divinity ([[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], Christ [[Pantocrator]]) and that depict holy persons \"in glory\"\u2014that is, in their roles as \"God revealed\" (Assumption, Ascension, etc.).\n\n[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|Apotheosis of French soldiers fallen in the Napoleonic Wars, [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], beginning of 19th century.]] [[File:Apotheosis of George Washington.jpg|thumb|Apotheosis of George Washington]]\n\n[[File:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Apotheosis of Homer, 1827.jpg|thumb|Ingres, ''[[The Apotheosis of Homer (Ingres)|The Apotheosis of Homer]]''.]]\n[[File:Apotheosis-of-saint-louis.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Apotheosis of St. Louis]]'', St. Louis MO]]\n[[File:Allegory of Gda\u0144sk trade.jpg|thumb|right|''Apotheosis of Gda\u0144sk'' by [[Isaak van den Blocke]].]]\n\nLater artists have used the concept for motives ranging from genuine respect for the deceased ([[Constantino Brumidi]]'s fresco ''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'' on the dome of the [[United States Capitol]] Building in [[Washington, D.C.]]), to artistic comment ([[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'s or [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s ''[[The Apotheosis of Homer (Ingres)|The Apotheosis of Homer]]''), to [[mock-heroic]] and [[burlesque]] apotheoses for comedic effect.\n\nMany modern leaders have exploited the artistic imagery if not the theology of apotheosis. Examples include [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]'s depictions of [[James I of England]] at the [[Banqueting House]] (an expression of the [[Divine Right of Kings]]) or [[Henry IV of France]], or Appiani's apotheosis of [[Napoleon]]. The [[Charles Henry Niehaus|C. H. Niehaus]]-designed ''[[Apotheosis of St. Louis]]'' ([[Louis IX of France]]) became a symbol for St. Louis MO. The term has come to be used figuratively to refer to the elevation of a dead leader (often one who was assassinated and/or martyred) to a kind of superhuman charismatic figure and an effective erasing of all faults and controversies which were connected with his name in life - for example, [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[US]], [[Lenin]] in the [[USSR]], [[Yitzchak Rabin]] in [[Israel]], or [[Kim Jong-il]] in [[North Korea]].\n\n==In music==\n''Apotheosis'' in music refers to the appearance of a theme in grand or exalted form. It represents the musical equivalent of the apotheosis genre in visual art, especially where the theme is connected in some way with historical persons or dramatic characters. When crowning the end of a large-scale work the apotheosis functions as a [[peroration]], following an analogy with the art of [[rhetoric]].\n\nApotheosis moments abound in music, and the word itself appears in some cases. In the [[List of compositions by Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]] there are 3 suites entitled \"Apotheoses\" (1724), [[Hector Berlioz]] used \"Apotheose\" as the title of the final movement of his ''[[Grande symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale]]'', a work composed in 1846 for the dedication of a monument to France's war dead. Two of  [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballets, ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', contain apotheoses as finales; the same is true of [[Ludwig Minkus]]'s ''[[La Bayad\u00e8re]]''. [[Igor Stravinsky]] composed two ballets, ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' and ''[[Orpheus (ballet)|Orpheus]]'', which both contain episodes entitled \"Apotheose\". The concluding tableau of [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Ma m\u00e8re l'Oye]]'' is also titled  \"Apotheose.\" Czech composer [[Karel Husa]], concerned in 1970 about arms proliferation and environmental deterioration, named his musical response ''Apotheosis for This Earth''. [[Aram Khachaturian]] entitled a segment of his ballet ''[[Spartacus (ballet)|Spartacus]]'' \"Sunrise and Apotheosis.\" [[Richard Wagner]], referring to the lively [[rhythm]]s which permeate [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 7]], called it the \"apotheosis of the dance\".<ref name=\"grove\">{{cite book |title= Beethoven and his nine symphonies |last= Grove |first= Sir George |authorlink= George Grove |year= 1962 |publisher= [[Dover Publications]] |location= [[New York City|New York]] |edition= 3rd |oclc= 705665 |pages= 228\u2013271}}</ref>  [[Alexander Glazunov]]'s ballet ''[[The Seasons (ballet)|The Seasons]]'', Op.67 has as the concluding movement:-  Autumn: Scene and Apotheosis.\n\n==In poetry==\n[[Samuel Menashe]] (1925-2011) wrote a poem entitled ''Apotheosis,'' as did [[Barbara Kingsolver]]. [[Emily Dickinson]] (1830-1886) wrote ''Love, Poem 18: Apotheosis.'' The poet [[Dejan Stojanovi\u0107]]'s ''Dancing of Sounds'' contains the line, \"Art is apotheosis.\" [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]] wrote a poem entitled ''Love's Apotheosis.''\n\n==In science==\nIn an essay entitled ''The Limitless Power of Science'', [[Peter Atkins]] described science as an apotheosis, writing: <blockquote>Science, above all, respects the power of the human intellect.

The term has meanings in [[theology]], where it refers to a [[belief]], and in [[art]], where it refers to a [[genre]].\n\nIn theology, ''apotheosis'' refers to the idea that an individual has been raised to godlike stature. In art, the term refers to the treatment of any subject (a figure, group, locale, motif, convention or melody) in a particularly grand or exalted manner.\n\n==Antiquity==\n{{further|imperial cult|divine king}}\nBefore the Hellenistic period, [[imperial cult]]s were known in [[Ancient Egypt]] ([[pharaoh]]s) and [[Mesopotamia]] (since [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]). From the [[New Kingdom]], all deceased pharaohs were deified as the god [[Osiris]].\n\n==Ancient Greece==\n{{Main|Greek hero cult}}\nFrom at least the [[Geometric art|Geometric]] period of the ninth century BC, the long-deceased heroes linked with [[founding myth]]s of Greek sites were accorded [[chthonic]] rites in their ''[[heroon]]'', or \"hero-temple\".\n\nIn the Greek world, the first leader who accorded himself divine honours was [[Philip II of Macedon]]. At his wedding to his sixth wife, Philip's enthroned image was carried in procession among the [[Olympian gods]]; \"his example at [[Vergina|Aigai]] became a custom, passing to the Macedonian kings who were later worshipped in [[Hellenistic civilization|Greek Asia]], from them to [[Julius Caesar]] and so to the emperors of Rome\".<ref>Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great'' (1973:20)</ref> Such Hellenistic state leaders might be raised to a status equal to the gods before death (e.g., [[Alexander the Great]]) or afterwards (e.g., members of the\n[[Ptolemaic dynasty]]). A heroic cult status similar to apotheosis was also an honour given to a few revered artists of the distant past, notably [[Homer]].\n\nArchaic and Classical Greek hero-cults became primarily civic, extended from their familial origins, in the sixth century; by the fifth century none of the worshipers based their authority by tracing descent back to the hero, with the exception of some families who inherited particular priestly cults, such as the [[Eumolpides]] (descended from [[Eumolpus]]) of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]], and some inherited priesthoods at [[oracle|oracle site]]s. The Greek hero cults can be distinguished on the other hand from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|cult of dead emperors]], because the hero was not thought of as having ascended to Olympus or become a god: he was beneath the earth, and his power purely local.  For this reason, hero cults were [[chthonic]] in nature, and their rituals more closely resembled those for [[Hecate]] and [[Persephone]] than those for [[Zeus]] and [[Apollo]]. Two exceptions were [[Heracles]] and [[Asclepius]], who might be honoured as either gods or heroes, sometimes by chthonic night-time rites and sacrifice on the following day.\n\n==Ancient Rome==\n{{main|Imperial cult (ancient Rome)}}\nUp to the end of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the god [[Quirinus]] was the only one the Romans accepted as having undergone apotheosis, for his identification/[[syncretism]] with [[Romulus]]. (See [[Euhemerism]]).{{sfn|Garnett|Mackintosh|1911}} Subsequently, apotheosis in [[ancient Rome]] was a process whereby a deceased ruler was recognized as having been divine by his successor, usually also by a [[S.P.Q.R.|decree of the Senate and popular consent]]. In addition to showing respect, often the present ruler deified a popular predecessor to legitimize himself and gain popularity with the people. The upper-class did not always take part in the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]],{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} and some privately ridiculed the apotheosis of inept and feeble emperors, as in the satire ''[[The Pumpkinification of Claudius|The Pumpkinification of (the Divine) Claudius]]'', usually attributed to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].\n\nAt the height of the imperial cult during the [[Roman Empire]], sometimes the [[Roman emperor|emperor]]'s deceased loved ones\u2014heirs, empresses, or lovers, as Hadrian's [[Antinous]]\u2014were deified as well. Deified people were awarded posthumously the title ''Divus'' (''Diva'' if women) to their names to signify their divinity. [[Religion in ancient Rome|Traditional Roman religion]] distinguished between a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#deus, dea, di, dii|deus]]'' (god) and a ''[[divus]]'' (a mortal who became divine or deified), though not consistently. Temples and columns were erected to provide a space for worship.\n\n==Ancient China==\nThe [[Ming dynasty]] epic ''[[Fengshen Yanyi|Investiture of the Gods]]'' deals heavily with deification legends. Numerous mortals have been deified into the [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]], such as [[Guan Yu]], [[Iron-crutch Li]] and [[Fan Kuai]]. [[Song Dynasty]] General [[Yue Fei]] was deified during the [[Ming Dynasty]] and is considered by some practitioners to be one of the three highest-ranking heavenly generals.<ref>Liu, James T.

Traditional mainstream theology, both East and West, views [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] as the preexisting God who undertook mortal existence, not as a mortal being who attained divinity. It holds that he has made it possible for human beings to be raised to the level of sharing the divine nature: he became human to make humans \"partakers of the divine nature\"<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|KJV}}</ref> \"For this is why the Word became man, and the Son of God became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a son of God.''\"<ref>[[Irenaeus of Lyon]], ''Adversus haereses'', 3.19.1</ref> \"For He was made man that we might be made God.\"<ref name=\"AthanasiusOnTheIncarnation54_3\">St. Athanasius, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html ''On the Incarnation of the Word'' 54.3] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QWCtlc7G?url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.vii.ii.liv.html |date=2007-07-22 }}.</ref> \"The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods.\"<ref>[[Thomas Aquinas]], Opusc. 57, 1-4</ref>\n\nThe Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology contains the following in an article titled \"Deification\":\n\n:''Deification (Greek theosis) is for Orthodoxy the goal of every Christian. Man, according to the Bible, is 'made in the image and likeness of God.'. . . It is possible for man to become like God, to become deified, to become god by grace. This doctrine is based on many passages of both OT and NT (e.g. Ps. 82 (81).6; II Peter 1.4), and it is essentially the teaching both of St Paul, though he tends to use the language of filial adoption (cf. Rom. 8.9\u201417; Gal. 4.5\u20147), and the Fourth Gospel (cf. 17.21\u201423).''\n\n:''The language of II Peter is taken up by St Irenaeus, in his famous phrase, 'if the Word has been made man, it is so that men may be made gods' (Adv. Haer V, Pref.), and becomes the standard in Greek theology. In the fourth century, St. Athanasius repeats Irenaeus almost word for word, and in the fifth century, St. Cyril of Alexandria says that we shall become sons 'by participation' (Greek methexis). Deification is the central idea in the spirituality of St. Maximus the Confessor, for whom the doctrine is the corollary of the Incarnation: 'Deification, briefly, is the encompassing and fulfillment of all times and ages,' . . . and St. Symeon the New Theologian at the end of the tenth century writes, 'He who is God by nature converses with those whom he has made gods by grace, as a friend converses with his friends, face to face.' . . .''\n\n===Roman Catholic Church===\nThe Roman Catholic Church does not use the term \"apotheosis\".\n\nCorresponding to the Greek word ''theosis'' are the [[Latin]]-derived words \"divinization\" and \"deification\" used in the parts of the [[Catholic Church]] that are of Latin tradition. The concept has been given less prominence in Western theology than in that of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], but is present in the [[Latin Church]]'s liturgical prayers, such as that of the deacon or priest when pouring wine and a little water into the chalice: \"By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity.\"<ref>''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-19-280290-3}}), article \"deification\"</ref> The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] quotes with approval [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius's]] saying, \"The Son of God became man so that we might become God.\"<ref name=\"AthanasiusOnTheIncarnation54_3\"/><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 460] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201419/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM |date=February 16, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nCatholic theology stresses the concept of supernatural life, \"a new creation and elevation, a rebirth, it is a participation in and partaking of the divine nature\"<ref>Heinrich Fries, ''[http://www.google.com/search?q=Fries+Catholic+%22partaking+of+the+divine+nature%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1 Bultmann-Barth and Catholic theology]'' (Duquesne University Press 1967), p. 160</ref> (cf. {{bibleverse|2|Peter|1:4|ESV}}). In Catholic teaching there is a vital distinction between natural life and supernatural life, the latter being \"the life that God, in an act of love, freely gives to human beings to elevate them above their natural lives\" and which they receive through prayer and the sacraments; indeed the Catholic Church sees human existence as having as its whole purpose the acquisition, preservation and intensification of this supernatural life.<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?q=%22stephen+m.+o%27brien%22+%22supernatural+life%22&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1 Stephen M.

The concept of God's nature that was eventually accepted as Christian doctrine in the 4th century set divinity apart from humanity by defining the [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)|Godhead]] as three persons sharing a common divine substance. That classification of God in terms of a substance is not found in scripture<ref>Thomas Mozley The creed or a philosophy 1893 p303</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/creed_homoian_of_constantinople_360.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925052330/http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/public/creed_homoian_of_constantinople_360.htm |archivedate=2014-09-25 }} (the wording of the [[Council of Constantinople (360)]] prohibited use of the terms \"substance,\" \"essence,\" and \"ousia\" since they were not included in the scriptures)</ref> but, in many aspects, mirrored the Greek metaphysical philosophies that are known to have influenced the thinking of Church Fathers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/trinity-history.html#Aug|title=Trinity > History of Trinitarian Doctrines (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}</ref> such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Origen]], and [[Augustine]]. Mormons teach that by modern revelation, God restored the knowledge that he is the literal father of our spirits (Hebrews 12:9) and that the Biblical references to God creating mankind in his image and likeness are in no way allegorical. As such, Mormons assert that as the literal offspring of God the Father (Acts 17:28-29), humans have the potential to be heirs of his glory and co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:16-17). The glory, Mormons believe, lies not in God's substance but in his intelligence: in other words, light and truth (Doctrine and Covenants 93:36<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 93|author=|date=|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org|df=}}</ref>). Thus, the purpose of humans is to grow and progress to become like the Father in Heaven. Mortality is seen as a crucial step in the process in which God's spirit children gain a body, which, though formed in the image of the Father's body, is subject to pain, illness, temptation, and death. The purpose of this earth life is to learn to choose the right in the face of that opposition, thereby gaining essential experience and wisdom. The level of intelligence we attain in this life will rise in the Resurrection (Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19). Bodies will then be immortal like those of the Father and the Son (Philippians 3:21), but the degree of glory to which each person will resurrect is contingent upon the Final Judgment (Revelation 20:13, 1 Corinthians 15:40-41). Those who are worthy to return to God's presence can continue to progress towards a fullness of God's glory, which Mormons refer to as eternal life, or [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]] (Doctrine and Covenants 76).\n\nThe LDS concept of apotheosis/exaltation is expressed in LDS scriptures (Mosiah 3:19, Alma 13:12, D&C 78:7, D&C 78:22, D&C 84:4, D&C 84:23, D&C 88:68, D&C 93:28) and is expressed by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: \"Though stretched by our challenges, by living righteously and enduring well we can eventually become sufficiently more like Jesus in our traits and attributes, that one day we can dwell in the Father's presence forever and ever\" (Neal Maxwell, October 1997).\n\nIn early 2014, the LDS church published an essay on the official church website specifically addressing the foundations, history, and official beliefs regarding apotheosis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/becoming-like-god?lang=eng|title=Becoming Like God|first=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day|last=Saints|date=|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org|df=}}</ref> The essay addresses the scriptural foundations of this belief, teachings of the early Church Fathers on the subject of deification, and the teachings of LDS church leaders, starting with Joseph Smith.\n\n==In art==\nIn art the matter is practical: the elevation of a figure to divine level entails certain conventions. So it is that the apotheosis genre exists in Christian art as in other art. The features of the apotheosis genre may be seen in subjects that emphasize Christ's divinity ([[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]], [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]], Christ [[Pantocrator]]) and that depict holy persons \"in glory\"\u2014that is, in their roles as \"God revealed\" (Assumption, Ascension, etc.).\n\n[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|Apotheosis of French soldiers fallen in the Napoleonic Wars, [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]], beginning of 19th century.]] [[File:Apotheosis of George Washington.jpg|thumb|Apotheosis of George Washington]]\n\n[[File:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Apotheosis of Homer, 1827.jpg|thumb|Ingres, ''[[The Apotheosis of Homer (Ingres)|The Apotheosis of Homer]]''.]]\n[[File:Apotheosis-of-saint-louis.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Apotheosis of St. Louis]]'', St. Louis MO]]\n[[File:Allegory of Gda\u0144sk trade.jpg|thumb|right|''Apotheosis of Gda\u0144sk'' by [[Isaak van den Blocke]].]]\n\nLater artists have used the concept for motives ranging from genuine respect for the deceased ([[Constantino Brumidi]]'s fresco ''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'' on the dome of the [[United States Capitol]] Building in [[Washington, D.C.]]), to artistic comment ([[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'s or [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s ''[[The Apotheosis of Homer (Ingres)|The Apotheosis of Homer]]''), to [[mock-heroic]] and [[burlesque]] apotheoses for comedic effect.\n\nMany modern leaders have exploited the artistic imagery if not the theology of apotheosis. Examples include [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]'s depictions of [[James I of England]] at the [[Banqueting House]] (an expression of the [[Divine Right of Kings]]) or [[Henry IV of France]], or Appiani's apotheosis of [[Napoleon]]. The [[Charles Henry Niehaus|C. H. Niehaus]]-designed ''[[Apotheosis of St. Louis]]'' ([[Louis IX of France]]) became a symbol for St. Louis MO. The term has come to be used figuratively to refer to the elevation of a dead leader (often one who was assassinated and/or martyred) to a kind of superhuman charismatic figure and an effective erasing of all faults and controversies which were connected with his name in life - for example, [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[US]], [[Lenin]] in the [[USSR]], [[Yitzchak Rabin]] in [[Israel]], or [[Kim Jong-il]] in [[North Korea]].\n\n==In music==\n''Apotheosis'' in music refers to the appearance of a theme in grand or exalted form. It represents the musical equivalent of the apotheosis genre in visual art, especially where the theme is connected in some way with historical persons or dramatic characters. When crowning the end of a large-scale work the apotheosis functions as a [[peroration]], following an analogy with the art of [[rhetoric]].\n\nApotheosis moments abound in music, and the word itself appears in some cases. In the [[List of compositions by Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]] there are 3 suites entitled \"Apotheoses\" (1724), [[Hector Berlioz]] used \"Apotheose\" as the title of the final movement of his ''[[Grande symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale]]'', a work composed in 1846 for the dedication of a monument to France's war dead. Two of  [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballets, ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', contain apotheoses as finales; the same is true of [[Ludwig Minkus]]'s ''[[La Bayad\u00e8re]]''. [[Igor Stravinsky]] composed two ballets, ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'' and ''[[Orpheus (ballet)|Orpheus]]'', which both contain episodes entitled \"Apotheose\". The concluding tableau of [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Ma m\u00e8re l'Oye]]'' is also titled  \"Apotheose.\" Czech composer [[Karel Husa]], concerned in 1970 about arms proliferation and environmental deterioration, named his musical response ''Apotheosis for This Earth''. [[Aram Khachaturian]] entitled a segment of his ballet ''[[Spartacus (ballet)|Spartacus]]'' \"Sunrise and Apotheosis.\" [[Richard Wagner]], referring to the lively [[rhythm]]s which permeate [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 7]], called it the \"apotheosis of the dance\".<ref name=\"grove\">{{cite book |title= Beethoven and his nine symphonies |last= Grove |first= Sir George |authorlink= George Grove |year= 1962 |publisher= [[Dover Publications]] |location= [[New York City|New York]] |edition= 3rd |oclc= 705665 |pages= 228\u2013271}}</ref>  [[Alexander Glazunov]]'s ballet ''[[The Seasons (ballet)|The Seasons]]'', Op.67 has as the concluding movement:-  Autumn: Scene and Apotheosis.\n\n==In poetry==\n[[Samuel Menashe]] (1925-2011) wrote a poem entitled ''Apotheosis,'' as did [[Barbara Kingsolver]].

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]].

Originating in 2001, the ''Red Faction'' games have spanned [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] and consoles, including the [[PlayStation 2]], [[GameCube]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. The series is known for its heavy theme including revolutionary undertones.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Communication & Iteration of Visual Effects in Red Faction (6822480836).jpg|thumb|Dave Samuel of Volition presenting at [[Game Developers Conference|GDC]] 2012 on \"Communication & Iteration of Visual Effects in ''Red Faction''\"]]\n\nThe series has had three unique styles of gameplay. The first is a traditional first-person shooter element which was used by the first two games in the series, while the second is a third-person style of [[open world]] gameplay which was used in ''[[Red Faction: Guerrilla]]'', and a third-person style of corridor shooter used in ''[[Red Faction: Armageddon]]''. Both styles share a common element, the series' unique environmental destruction features. This was enhanced in ''Red Faction: Guerrilla'' when it was applied to every building in the game making the game's entire environment (except for the terrain itself) destructible.\n\nThe first two games were traditional first-person shooters with unique environmental destruction features that were praised in both games.

''Guerrilla'' takes place in an [[open world]] environment on the planet of Mars allowing players to freely roam across the environment. ''Armageddon'' is a more linear experience, largely moving through corridors and caverns from objective to objective. In the games, all environments are fully destructible which means that every single building in the game can be destroyed. Players are usually equipped with four weapons, the primary weapon is a [[sledgehammer]] with three more weapons of the player's choice. These weapons are mainly purchased using salvage, the main currency of the game, with the exception of the remote charges and assault rifle, both of which are given to the player by default at the start of the game. Purchasable weapons include an Arc Rifle, Grinder, Rocket Launcher, Proximity Mines and a Nano Rifle, the last of which is effective for remote demolitions.

The game was released on some platforms on June 2, 2009, seven years after its predecessor and featured a vastly different gameplay system. ''Red Faction: Guerrilla'' takes place in 2125. The Earth Defense Force (EDF), the allies in the original \"Red Faction\", has become the main antagonist of Guerrilla. Earth's natural resources have run scarce, and as a result, its global economy has collapsed from rampant speculation of commodities and lack of production. Under pressure by Earth's corporations and leaders to acquire the resources of Mars at any cost and at a pace to meet Earth's high demand, the EDF has forced Martian society into a permanent state of [[unfree labour]].

The game assumes a third-person point of view and an open world to play in. The game was released on some platforms on June 2, 2009, seven years after its predecessor and featured a vastly different gameplay system. ''Red Faction: Guerrilla'' takes place in 2125. The Earth Defense Force (EDF), the allies in the original \"Red Faction\", has become the main antagonist of Guerrilla. Earth's natural resources have run scarce, and as a result, its global economy has collapsed from rampant speculation of commodities and lack of production. Under pressure by Earth's corporations and leaders to acquire the resources of Mars at any cost and at a pace to meet Earth's high demand, the EDF has forced Martian society into a permanent state of [[unfree labour]]. The newly-reformed \"Red Faction\" arises to rebel against the EDF (Earth Defense Force), drive them off the planet, and begin fairer negotiations with Earth.\n\n===''Red Faction: Armageddon'' (2011)===\n{{main|Red Faction: Armageddon}}\n\nOn June 4, 2010, the first footage of ''Red Faction: Armageddon'' debuted in the form of a short teaser trailer on GameTrailers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/red-faction-armageddon-reveal-tomorrow-on-gametrailers-175355.phtml|title=Red Faction: Armageddon reveal tomorrow on GameTrailers|date=June 3, 2010|publisher=Destructoid|author=Nick Chester|accessdate=June 4, 2010}}</ref> THQ announced that the game would be shown at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/02/17/thq-ceo-saints-row-and-red-faction-at-e3-de-blob-going-multipl/ |title=THQ CEO: Saints Row and Red Faction at E3, De Blob going multiplatform |author=JC Fletcher |date=February 17, 2010 |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221101224/http://www.joystiq.com/2010/02/17/thq-ceo-saints-row-and-red-faction-at-e3-de-blob-going-multipl/ |archive-date=February 21, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/02/20/red-faction-4-locked-for-e3|title=Red Faction 4 Locked For E3}}</ref> On June 27, 2011, THQ announced it was dropping the long-running ''Red Faction'' franchise; no more installments are in development due to poor sales of the last game in the franchise, ''Red Faction: Armageddon''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dutton|first=Fred|title=THQ abandons Red Faction franchise|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-27-thq-abandons-red-faction-franchise|publisher=Eurogamer}}</ref>\n\n==Future==\nOn December 19, 2012, THQ filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|chapter 11 bankruptcy]] leading to an auction of THQ's properties that was held on January 22, 2013.

Some common flaws are that the graphics are considered behind their time or unremarkable. Also, the scattered story and limited interactivity in the levels have been criticized overall. On the positive side, the series has been deeply commended for its unique [[Geo-Mod|geometry modification]] capabilities, intelligent AI, and prevalent storytelling themes.\n\nPraised for its long play time, great gameplay, and smart AI, ''Red Faction'' was generally given average to great reviews by critics.

There are two third persons, [[Grammatical person#Additional persons|proximate]] and [[obviative]], and two [[noun class]]es (or genders), [[animacy|animate]] and [[animacy|inanimate]]. It is primarily [[agglutination|agglutinating]] [[linguistic typology|typologically]], and is [[polysynthesis|polysynthetic]], resulting in a great deal of information being encoded on the verb. The most common [[word order]] is Verb-Subject.\n\n===Affixes===\n\nstem-(instrumental affix)-transitivizing affix-object affix <br />\nThe instrumental affix is not obligatory, but if it is present, it determines the type of transitivizing affix that can follow it, (see numbering scheme below) or by the last stem in the theme. <br />\nInstrumental affixes are as follows\n\n<!-- -->\n{| class=\"tg\" \n! class=\"tg-s6z2\" | Instrumental suffix\n! class=\"tg-031e\" |\n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | pw 'by mouth'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" |\n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | n 'by hand'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | h(0) 'by heat'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | hh 'by mechanical instrument'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | l 'by projectile'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | (h)t 'by vocal noise'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \u0161k 'by feet in locomotion'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | h\u0161k 'by feet as agent'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | lhk 'by legs'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|}\n\n===Possessive paradigm: animate nouns===\n\n<!-- -->\n{| class=\"tg\" -- \n! class=\"tg-s6z2\" | Possessor\n! class=\"tg-031e\" | Singular noun\n! class=\"tg-031e\" | Plural noun\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 1s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + ROOT\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + ROOT + ki\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 2s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + ROOT\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + ROOT + ki\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 3s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + ROOT\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + ROOT + ki\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 4s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + ROOT + li\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + ROOT + waa + li\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 1p (excl)\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + ROOT + na\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + ROOT + naa + ki\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 2+1 (incl)\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + ROOT + na\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + ROOT + naa + ki\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 2p\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + ROOT + wa\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + ROOT + waa + ki\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 4p\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + ROOT + hi\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + ROOT + waa + hi\n|}\n\n===Possessive paradigm: inanimate nouns===\n\n-t\u03b8ani (w)- 'bed'\n\n<!-- -->\n{| class=\"tg\" -- \n! class=\"tg-s6z2\" | Possessor\n! class=\"tg-031e\" | Singular noun\n! class=\"tg-031e\" | Plural noun\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 1s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + t0ani\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + t0aniw+ali\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 2s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + t0ani\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + t0aniw+ali\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 3s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + t0ani\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + t0aniw+ali\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 1p (excl)\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + t0ane+na\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + t0ane+na\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 2+1 (incl)\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + t0ane+na\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + t0ane+na\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 2p\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + t0ani+wa\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + t0ani+wa\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 3p\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + t0ani+wa\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + t0ani+wa\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | Locative\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | t0an + eki\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | (unattested)\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | Diminutive\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | t0an + ehi\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|}\n\n==Grammar and syntax==\n\n===Word order===\nShawnee has a fairly free word order, with VSO being the most common: <br />\nteki koos -i -ma <br />\nNEG run.from-IMPER-AO <br />\n'run you from him' (in the negative) <br />\n'you mustn't run away from him' <br />\n<br />\nSOV, SVO, VOS, and OVS are also plausible.<ref name=\"e18\" />\n\n===Grammatical categories===\nParts of speech in the Algonquian languages, Shawnee included, show a basic division between inflecting forms (nouns, verbs and pronouns), and non-inflecting invariant forms (also known as particles). Directional particles (\"piyeci\" meaning \"towards\") incorporate into the verb itself. Although particles are invariant in form, they have different distributions and meanings that correspond to adverbs (\"[hi]noki\" meaning \"now\", \"waapaki\" meaning \"today\", \"lakokwe\" meaning \"so, certainly\", \"mata\" meaning \"not\") postpositions (\"heta'ko\u03b8aki wayeeci\" meaning \"towards the east\") and interjections (\"ce\" meaning \"so!\").<ref name=\"e18\" />\n\n===Case===\nExamples (1) and (2) below show the grammatical interaction of obviation and inverse. The narrative begins in (1) in which grandfather is the grammatical subject [+AGENT] in discourse-focus [+PROXIMATE]. In (2), grandfather remains in discourse-focus [+PROXIMATE], but he is now the grammatical object [+OBJECT]. To align grammatical relations properly in (2), the inverse marker /-ekw-/ is used in the verb stem to signal that the governor is affecting grandfather. (The prefix /ho-/ on 'ho-stakooli' refers to grandfather).<ref name=\"e18\" />\n\n(1) he-meci -naat-aw'ky-aa-ci hina ni-me'soom' -\u03b8a <br />\nSUB-COMPLETED-much-land -TA-3SUB that 1-grandfather-PERSON<br />\n'afterwards my grandfather received land' <br />\n<br />\n(2) wiikiwa ho-staa -ekw-a -li kapenalee-li<br />\nhouse 3-build-INV-DIR-3sOBV governor -3sOBV<br />\n'the governor built (him) a house' <br />\n(/-li/ is the obviative marker)<br />\n<br />\nSince the person building the house (the governor) is disjoint from the person who the house is being built for (the grandfather), this disjunction is marked by placing one participant in the obviative. Since grandfather is the focus in this narrative, the governor is assigned the obviative marking. Grammatically, 'kapenal-ee' (-ee- < -ile- < -ileni- 'person') is the subject who is not in discourse-focus (marked by /-li/ 3sOBVIATIVE), showing that grammatical relations and obviation are independent categories. <br />\n<br />\nSimilar interactions of inverse and obviation are found below. In Shawnee, third person animate beings participate in obviation, including grammatically animate nouns that are semantically inanimate. <br />\n<br />\nwe ni-cis-h -ekw-a hina weepikwa <br />\nthen 1-fear-CAUSE-INV-DIR- that spider <br />\n'then that spider scared me' <br />\n<br />\nho-waap-am-aa-li kisa'\u03b8wa-li <br />\n3-look -TA-DIR-3sOBV- sun -3sOBV <br />\n'he looked at the sun'\n\n====Locative affix /-eki/====\nThe Shawnee /-eki/ meaning \"in\" can be used with either gender. This locative affix cliticizes onto the preceding noun, and thus it appears to be a case ending. <br />\n<br />\ntekwakhwikan-eki<br />\nbox -in <br />\n'in a box' <br />\n<br />\nmsi-wikiwaap-eki <br />\nbig-house -in <br />\n'in a big house' <br />\n<br />\nt\u03b8ene melo'kami-eki <br />\nevery spring -in <br />\n'every spring'\n\n===Modality===\nThe independent and imperative orders are used in independent clauses. The imperative order involves an understood second person affecting first or third persons. <br />\n<br />\nteke ki-e' -memekw-i <br />\nNEG 2-FUT-run  -IMPER <br />\n'you mustn't run' <br />\n<br />\nteki-koos-i-ma <br />\nNEG run.from-IMPER-AO <br />\n'you mustn't run away from him' <br />\n<br />\nteke-wi'\u03b8en-i kola'-waapaki <br />\nNEG eat -IMPER early-morning <br />\n'you mustn't eat early in the morning' <br />\n<br />\nIndependent Mode: <br />\nInanimate Intransitive (II): <br />\n3s---> /-i/ ---> skwaaw-i 'it is red' <br />\n3p---> /-a/ ---> kinwaaw-a 'those are long'\n\n===Demonstrative pronouns===\nRefer to the examples below. 'Yaama' meaning 'this' in examples 1 and 2 refers to someone in front of the speaker. The repetition of 'yaama' in example 1 emphasizes the location of the referent in the immediate presence of the speaker. <br />\n<br />\n(1) yaama-kookwe-nee -\u03b8a -yaama <br />\nthis-strange-appearing-PERSON-this<br />\n'this stranger (the one right in front of me)' <br />\n<br />\n(2) mata-yaama-ha' -pa-skoolii-wi <br />\nnot this TIME-go-school- AI <br />\nni-oos\u03b8e' -0a <br />\n1-grandchild-PERSON <br />\n'this grandchild of mine does not go to school' <br />\n<br />\nRefer to the examples below. 'Hina' functions as a third-person singular pronoun.<br />\n<br />\nhina-ha'\u03b8epati ni-[t]e-si-naa-pe <br />\n3 racoon 1 -call-thus-IN.OBJ-1p <br />\n'we called him (the Indian Agent) racoon' <br />\n<br />\nwe ha'\u03b8epati -si -\u03b8o -hina <br />\nnow raccoon name-PASSIVE 3 <br />\n'then he (the Indian Agent) was named raccoon' <br />\n<br />\nhowe-si taakteli -hina <br />\ngood-AI doctor 3 <br />\n'he was a good doctor' <br />\n<br />\nRefer to the examples below. 'Hini' fulfills the same functions as above for inanimate nouns. Locational and third-person singular pronominal uses are found in the following examples. <br />\n<br />\nna'\u03b8aapi ni-[t]aay-a hini <br />\neven 1-REDUP-go that <br />\n'I would even go there' <br />\n<br />\nhini-h-i-si-ci-howe <br />\nthat [h]-say-thus-3-now <br />\n'(when) he said that (to me)'\n\n==Person, number, and gender==\n\n===Person===\n\nThe choice of person affix may depend on the relative position of agent and object on the animacy hierarchy. According to Dixon <ref>Dixon 1979:85-6</ref> the animacy hierarchy extends from first person pronoun, second person pronoun, third person pronoun, proper nouns, human common nouns, animate common nouns, and inanimate common nouns.\n\nThe affixes in the verb will reflect whether an animate agent is acting on someone or something lower in the animacy scale, or whether he is being acted upon by someone or something lower in the animacy scale.\n\n=== Number ===\nShawnee nouns can be singular or plural. Inflectional affixes in the verb stem that cross-reference objects are often omitted if inanimate objects are involved. Even if an inflectional affix for the inanimate object is present, it usually does not distinguish number. For example, in the TI paradigm (animate\u203ainanimate) when there is a second or third person plural subject, object markers are present in the verb stem, but they are number-indifferent. Overt object markers are omitted for most other subjects. In the inverse situation, (animate\u2039inanimate) the inanimate participants are not cross-referenced morphologically.<ref>Andrew, Kenneth Ralph. ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; 1994.</ref>\n\n===Gender===\n\nThe basic distinction for gender in Shawnee is between animate actors and inanimate objects. Nouns are in two gender classes, inanimate and animate; the latter includes all persons, animals, spirits, and large trees, and some other objects such as tobacco, maize, apple, raspberry (but not strawberry), calf of leg (but not thigh), stomach, spittle, feather, bird's tail, horn, kettle, pipe for smoking, snowshoe.<ref>Bloomfield 1946:449-50; punctuation as in the original</ref>\n\nGrammatical gender in Shawnee is more accurately signaled by the ''phonology'', not the semantics.<br />\nNouns ending in /-a/ are animate, while nouns ending in /-i/ are inanimate.<ref>Chrisley 1992:9</ref> This phonological criterion is not absolute. Modification by a demonstrative (\"hina\" being animate and \"hini\" being inanimate, meaning ''that'') and pluralization are conclusive tests.<br />\n<br />\nIn the singular, Shawnee animate nouns end in /-a/, and the obviative singular morpheme is /-li/.<br />\nShawnee inanimate nouns are usually pluralized with stem +/-ali/. <br />\nThis causes '''animate obviative singular''' and '''inanimate plural''' to look alike on the surface.\n\n<br />\n'''''example'''''<br />\n<br />\nanimate obviative singular<br />\nwiskilo'\u03b8a-'''li'''<br />\nbird<br />\n<br />\ninanimate plural<br />\nniipit-'''ali'''<br />\nmy teeth\n\n==Orthography==\n\nDuring the 19th century a short-lived Roman-based alphabet was designed for Shawnee by the missionary [[Jotham Meeker]]. It was never widely used.<ref name=\"mithun2001\" />{{rp|36}} Later, native Shawnee speaker [[Thomas 'Wildcat' Alford]] devised a highly phonemic and accurate orthography for his 1929 Shawnee translation of the four gospels of the New Testament, but it, too, never attained wide usage.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English\n!Shawnee\n|-\n|beard\n|''Kwenaloonaroll''\n|-\n|general greeting (in the northeastern dialect)\n|''Hatito''\n|-\n|general greeting (in the southern dialect)\n|''Ho''\n|-\n|greetings\n|''Bezon'' (general greeting)\n''Bezon nikanaki'' (general greeting spoken to a friend)\n\n''Howisakisiki'' (daytime greeting)\n\n''Howisiwapani'' (morning greeting)\n\n''Wasekiseki'' (morning greeting)\n|-\n|how are you?\n|''Hakiwisilaasamamo'' ''Waswasimamo''\n|-\n|reply to ''Hakiwisilaasamamo'' and ''Waswasimamo''\n|''Niwisilasimamo''\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*Alford, Thomas Wildcat. 1929.

It was originally spoken in [[Ohio]], [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Pennsylvania]]. It is closely related to other Algonquian languages, such as [[Fox language|Mesquakie-Sauk]] (Sac and Fox) and [[Kickapoo people#Language|Kickapoo]]. It has 260 speakers, according to a 2015 census<ref name=\"e18\" />, although the number is decreasing. It is a polysynthetic language with rather free word ordering.<ref name=\"e18\" /> \n\n== Status ==\nShawnee is severely threatened, with speakers shifting to English. The approximately 200 remaining speakers are older adults.<ref name=e18/> The decline in usage of Shawnee is largely the result of reform schools for Native American children that forced an education in English, causing some Native Americans to cease teaching their languages to children.\n\nOf the 2,000 members of the [[Absentee Shawnee Tribe]] around Shawnee town, more than 100 are speakers; of the 1,500 members of the [[Eastern Shawnee Tribe]] in [[Ottawa County, Oklahoma|Ottawa County]], there are only a few elderly speakers; of the 8,000 members of the [[Loyal Shawnee]] in the [[Cherokee]] region of [[Oklahoma]] around Whiteoak there are fewer than 12 speakers.<ref name=\"e18\"/> All of these low figures, in addition to the fact that most speakers are older adults, make Shawnee an [[endangered language]]. Additionally, development outside of the home is limited; apart from a dictionary and portions of the [[Bible]] from 1842 to 1929,<ref name=\"e18\"/> it appears that there is little literature or technology support for Shawnee.\n\n===Language revitalization===\n\n[[Absentee-Shawnee Tribe of Indians|Absentee-Shawnee]] Elder George Blanchard's Shawnee language classes were profiled on the PBS show \"The [[American Experience]]\" in 2009.<ref>{{Cite episode\n| publisher =  American Experience (in association with [[Native American Public Telecommunications|NAPT]])\n| network = PBS\n| title = Shawnee: A Matter of Funding\n| series = We Shall Remain\n| accessdate = 2013-04-26\n| date = 2009-04-13\n| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/weshallremain/native_now/language_shawnee\n}}</ref> The [[Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma|Eastern Shawnee]] have also taught language classes.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n| title = Shawnee Language Classes\n| work = Eastern Shawnee of Oklahoma\n| accessdate = 2013-04-26\n| url = http://www.estoo-nsn.gov/events/shawnee-language-classes/\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160520014828/https://www.estoo-nsn.gov/events/shawnee-language-classes/\n| archive-date = 2016-05-20\n| url-status = dead\n}}\n</ref>\n\nConversational Shawnee booklets and CDs, and a Learn Shawnee Language website are available.<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Say it in Shawnee!\n| accessdate = 2013-04-26\n| url = http://shawneelanguage.homestead.com/\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Learn Shawnee - Learn Shawnee Language\n| accessdate = 2013-04-26\n| url = http://learnshawnee.com/\n}}</ref>\n\n==Sounds==\n\n===Vowels===\n\nShawnee has six vowels,<ref>Andrew, Kenneth Ralph.

There are two third persons, [[Grammatical person#Additional persons|proximate]] and [[obviative]], and two [[noun class]]es (or genders), [[animacy|animate]] and [[animacy|inanimate]]. It is primarily [[agglutination|agglutinating]] [[linguistic typology|typologically]], and is [[polysynthesis|polysynthetic]], resulting in a great deal of information being encoded on the verb. The most common [[word order]] is Verb-Subject.\n\n===Affixes===\n\nstem-(instrumental affix)-transitivizing affix-object affix <br />\nThe instrumental affix is not obligatory, but if it is present, it determines the type of transitivizing affix that can follow it, (see numbering scheme below) or by the last stem in the theme. <br />\nInstrumental affixes are as follows\n\n<!-- -->\n{| class=\"tg\" \n! class=\"tg-s6z2\" | Instrumental suffix\n! class=\"tg-031e\" |\n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | pw 'by mouth'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" |\n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | n 'by hand'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | h(0) 'by heat'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | hh 'by mechanical instrument'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | l 'by projectile'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | (h)t 'by vocal noise'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \u0161k 'by feet in locomotion'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | h\u0161k 'by feet as agent'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | lhk 'by legs'\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|}\n\n===Possessive paradigm: animate nouns===\n\n<!-- -->\n{| class=\"tg\" -- \n! class=\"tg-s6z2\" | Possessor\n! class=\"tg-031e\" | Singular noun\n! class=\"tg-031e\" | Plural noun\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 1s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + ROOT\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + ROOT + ki\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 2s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + ROOT\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + ROOT + ki\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 3s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + ROOT\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + ROOT + ki\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 4s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + ROOT + li\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + ROOT + waa + li\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 1p (excl)\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + ROOT + na\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + ROOT + naa + ki\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 2+1 (incl)\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + ROOT + na\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + ROOT + naa + ki\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 2p\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + ROOT + wa\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + ROOT + waa + ki\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 4p\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + ROOT + hi\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + ROOT + waa + hi\n|}\n\n===Possessive paradigm: inanimate nouns===\n\n-t\u03b8ani (w)- 'bed'\n\n<!-- -->\n{| class=\"tg\" -- \n! class=\"tg-s6z2\" | Possessor\n! class=\"tg-031e\" | Singular noun\n! class=\"tg-031e\" | Plural noun\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 1s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + t0ani\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + t0aniw+ali\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 2s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + t0ani\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + t0aniw+ali\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 3s\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + t0ani\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + t0aniw+ali\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 1p (excl)\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + t0ane+na\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ni- + t0ane+na\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 2+1 (incl)\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + t0ane+na\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + t0ane+na\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 2p\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + t0ani+wa\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ki- + t0ani+wa\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | 3p\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + t0ani+wa\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | ho- + t0ani+wa\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | Locative\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | t0an + eki\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | (unattested)\n|--- \n| class=\"tg-031e\" | Diminutive\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | t0an + ehi\n| class=\"tg-031e\" | \n|}\n\n==Grammar and syntax==\n\n===Word order===\nShawnee has a fairly free word order, with VSO being the most common: <br />\nteki koos -i -ma <br />\nNEG run.from-IMPER-AO <br />\n'run you from him' (in the negative) <br />\n'you mustn't run away from him' <br />\n<br />\nSOV, SVO, VOS, and OVS are also plausible.<ref name=\"e18\" />\n\n===Grammatical categories===\nParts of speech in the Algonquian languages, Shawnee included, show a basic division between inflecting forms (nouns, verbs and pronouns), and non-inflecting invariant forms (also known as particles). Directional particles (\"piyeci\" meaning \"towards\") incorporate into the verb itself. Although particles are invariant in form, they have different distributions and meanings that correspond to adverbs (\"[hi]noki\" meaning \"now\", \"waapaki\" meaning \"today\", \"lakokwe\" meaning \"so, certainly\", \"mata\" meaning \"not\") postpositions (\"heta'ko\u03b8aki wayeeci\" meaning \"towards the east\") and interjections (\"ce\" meaning \"so!\").<ref name=\"e18\" />\n\n===Case===\nExamples (1) and (2) below show the grammatical interaction of obviation and inverse. The narrative begins in (1) in which grandfather is the grammatical subject [+AGENT] in discourse-focus [+PROXIMATE]. In (2), grandfather remains in discourse-focus [+PROXIMATE], but he is now the grammatical object [+OBJECT]. To align grammatical relations properly in (2), the inverse marker /-ekw-/ is used in the verb stem to signal that the governor is affecting grandfather. (The prefix /ho-/ on 'ho-stakooli' refers to grandfather).<ref name=\"e18\" />\n\n(1) he-meci -naat-aw'ky-aa-ci hina ni-me'soom' -\u03b8a <br />\nSUB-COMPLETED-much-land -TA-3SUB that 1-grandfather-PERSON<br />\n'afterwards my grandfather received land' <br />\n<br />\n(2) wiikiwa ho-staa -ekw-a -li kapenalee-li<br />\nhouse 3-build-INV-DIR-3sOBV governor -3sOBV<br />\n'the governor built (him) a house' <br />\n(/-li/ is the obviative marker)<br />\n<br />\nSince the person building the house (the governor) is disjoint from the person who the house is being built for (the grandfather), this disjunction is marked by placing one participant in the obviative. Since grandfather is the focus in this narrative, the governor is assigned the obviative marking. Grammatically, 'kapenal-ee' (-ee- < -ile- < -ileni- 'person') is the subject who is not in discourse-focus (marked by /-li/ 3sOBVIATIVE), showing that grammatical relations and obviation are independent categories. <br />\n<br />\nSimilar interactions of inverse and obviation are found below. In Shawnee, third person animate beings participate in obviation, including grammatically animate nouns that are semantically inanimate. <br />\n<br />\nwe ni-cis-h -ekw-a hina weepikwa <br />\nthen 1-fear-CAUSE-INV-DIR- that spider <br />\n'then that spider scared me' <br />\n<br />\nho-waap-am-aa-li kisa'\u03b8wa-li <br />\n3-look -TA-DIR-3sOBV- sun -3sOBV <br />\n'he looked at the sun'\n\n====Locative affix /-eki/====\nThe Shawnee /-eki/ meaning \"in\" can be used with either gender. This locative affix cliticizes onto the preceding noun, and thus it appears to be a case ending. <br />\n<br />\ntekwakhwikan-eki<br />\nbox -in <br />\n'in a box' <br />\n<br />\nmsi-wikiwaap-eki <br />\nbig-house -in <br />\n'in a big house' <br />\n<br />\nt\u03b8ene melo'kami-eki <br />\nevery spring -in <br />\n'every spring'\n\n===Modality===\nThe independent and imperative orders are used in independent clauses. The imperative order involves an understood second person affecting first or third persons. <br />\n<br />\nteke ki-e' -memekw-i <br />\nNEG 2-FUT-run  -IMPER <br />\n'you mustn't run' <br />\n<br />\nteki-koos-i-ma <br />\nNEG run.from-IMPER-AO <br />\n'you mustn't run away from him' <br />\n<br />\nteke-wi'\u03b8en-i kola'-waapaki <br />\nNEG eat -IMPER early-morning <br />\n'you mustn't eat early in the morning' <br />\n<br />\nIndependent Mode: <br />\nInanimate Intransitive (II): <br />\n3s---> /-i/ ---> skwaaw-i 'it is red' <br />\n3p---> /-a/ ---> kinwaaw-a 'those are long'\n\n===Demonstrative pronouns===\nRefer to the examples below. 'Yaama' meaning 'this' in examples 1 and 2 refers to someone in front of the speaker. The repetition of 'yaama' in example 1 emphasizes the location of the referent in the immediate presence of the speaker. <br />\n<br />\n(1) yaama-kookwe-nee -\u03b8a -yaama <br />\nthis-strange-appearing-PERSON-this<br />\n'this stranger (the one right in front of me)' <br />\n<br />\n(2) mata-yaama-ha' -pa-skoolii-wi <br />\nnot this TIME-go-school- AI <br />\nni-oos\u03b8e' -0a <br />\n1-grandchild-PERSON <br />\n'this grandchild of mine does not go to school' <br />\n<br />\nRefer to the examples below. 'Hina' functions as a third-person singular pronoun.<br />\n<br />\nhina-ha'\u03b8epati ni-[t]e-si-naa-pe <br />\n3 racoon 1 -call-thus-IN.OBJ-1p <br />\n'we called him (the Indian Agent) racoon' <br />\n<br />\nwe ha'\u03b8epati -si -\u03b8o -hina <br />\nnow raccoon name-PASSIVE 3 <br />\n'then he (the Indian Agent) was named raccoon' <br />\n<br />\nhowe-si taakteli -hina <br />\ngood-AI doctor 3 <br />\n'he was a good doctor' <br />\n<br />\nRefer to the examples below. 'Hini' fulfills the same functions as above for inanimate nouns. Locational and third-person singular pronominal uses are found in the following examples. <br />\n<br />\nna'\u03b8aapi ni-[t]aay-a hini <br />\neven 1-REDUP-go that <br />\n'I would even go there' <br />\n<br />\nhini-h-i-si-ci-howe <br />\nthat [h]-say-thus-3-now <br />\n'(when) he said that (to me)'\n\n==Person, number, and gender==\n\n===Person===\n\nThe choice of person affix may depend on the relative position of agent and object on the animacy hierarchy. According to Dixon <ref>Dixon 1979:85-6</ref> the animacy hierarchy extends from first person pronoun, second person pronoun, third person pronoun, proper nouns, human common nouns, animate common nouns, and inanimate common nouns.\n\nThe affixes in the verb will reflect whether an animate agent is acting on someone or something lower in the animacy scale, or whether he is being acted upon by someone or something lower in the animacy scale.\n\n=== Number ===\nShawnee nouns can be singular or plural. Inflectional affixes in the verb stem that cross-reference objects are often omitted if inanimate objects are involved. Even if an inflectional affix for the inanimate object is present, it usually does not distinguish number. For example, in the TI paradigm (animate\u203ainanimate) when there is a second or third person plural subject, object markers are present in the verb stem, but they are number-indifferent. Overt object markers are omitted for most other subjects. In the inverse situation, (animate\u2039inanimate) the inanimate participants are not cross-referenced morphologically.<ref>Andrew, Kenneth Ralph. ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; 1994.</ref>\n\n===Gender===\n\nThe basic distinction for gender in Shawnee is between animate actors and inanimate objects. Nouns are in two gender classes, inanimate and animate; the latter includes all persons, animals, spirits, and large trees, and some other objects such as tobacco, maize, apple, raspberry (but not strawberry), calf of leg (but not thigh), stomach, spittle, feather, bird's tail, horn, kettle, pipe for smoking, snowshoe.<ref>Bloomfield 1946:449-50; punctuation as in the original</ref>\n\nGrammatical gender in Shawnee is more accurately signaled by the ''phonology'', not the semantics.<br />\nNouns ending in /-a/ are animate, while nouns ending in /-i/ are inanimate.<ref>Chrisley 1992:9</ref> This phonological criterion is not absolute. Modification by a demonstrative (\"hina\" being animate and \"hini\" being inanimate, meaning ''that'') and pluralization are conclusive tests.<br />\n<br />\nIn the singular, Shawnee animate nouns end in /-a/, and the obviative singular morpheme is /-li/.<br />\nShawnee inanimate nouns are usually pluralized with stem +/-ali/. <br />\nThis causes '''animate obviative singular''' and '''inanimate plural''' to look alike on the surface.\n\n<br />\n'''''example'''''<br />\n<br />\nanimate obviative singular<br />\nwiskilo'\u03b8a-'''li'''<br />\nbird<br />\n<br />\ninanimate plural<br />\nniipit-'''ali'''<br />\nmy teeth\n\n==Orthography==\n\nDuring the 19th century a short-lived Roman-based alphabet was designed for Shawnee by the missionary [[Jotham Meeker]]. It was never widely used.<ref name=\"mithun2001\" />{{rp|36}} Later, native Shawnee speaker [[Thomas 'Wildcat' Alford]] devised a highly phonemic and accurate orthography for his 1929 Shawnee translation of the four gospels of the New Testament, but it, too, never attained wide usage.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English\n!Shawnee\n|-\n|beard\n|''Kwenaloonaroll''\n|-\n|general greeting (in the northeastern dialect)\n|''Hatito''\n|-\n|general greeting (in the southern dialect)\n|''Ho''\n|-\n|greetings\n|''Bezon'' (general greeting)\n''Bezon nikanaki'' (general greeting spoken to a friend)\n\n''Howisakisiki'' (daytime greeting)\n\n''Howisiwapani'' (morning greeting)\n\n''Wasekiseki'' (morning greeting)\n|-\n|how are you?\n|''Hakiwisilaasamamo'' ''Waswasimamo''\n|-\n|reply to ''Hakiwisilaasamamo'' and ''Waswasimamo''\n|''Niwisilasimamo''\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*Alford, Thomas Wildcat. 1929.

It is currently coordinated by Professor and Director of Creative Writing Sean Forbes. Each year a selection and interview process is held to find the most qualified students to join the LRR staff. The Long River Review class is only offered once a year, for the production of the magazine in the springtime.\n\nThe class itself is divided into groups of focused panelists and specific position roles. Panelists comb through the multitude of submissions received every year to pick the very best pieces in fiction, poetry, creative non-fiction, or translations to publish.

It is currently coordinated by Professor and Director of Creative Writing Sean Forbes. Each year a selection and interview process is held to find the most qualified students to join the LRR staff. The Long River Review class is only offered once a year, for the production of the magazine in the springtime. \n\nThe class itself is divided into groups of focused panelists and specific position roles. Panelists comb through the multitude of submissions received every year to pick the very best pieces in fiction, poetry, creative non-fiction, or translations to publish.

His primary use of donations of food, household items, cash, medical bills and other donations go straight to impact the poor and victims of disaster in Ghana.\n\nIn 2018, Mensah initiated the <nowiki>''Save a Sick Child''</nowiki> project in collaboration with paediatric medical doctors at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana where he made cash donations to cover the cost of surgeries on sick children who suffer a destruction of their food pipes in the throat as a result of accidental ingestion of caustic soda, a cheap raw material used for manufacturing soap in rural communities in Ghana.\n\nDoctors at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital have raised alarm over the increasing numbers of children of poor parents mostly from remote communities who have to feed through a tube connected through the stomach, until they are able to afford the cost of  undergoing a medical surgery to repair the damaged food pipe. The expensive cost of the surgery has prevented many children from going to school as their lives are a daily struggle with difficulty in swallowing even saliva.\n\nThrough the <nowiki>''</nowiki>Save a sick child<nowiki>''</nowiki> project , Mensah sponsored the treatment of an 11-year boy from Asankragwa in the western region of Ghana and an 8-year old boy from Wa in the Upper West region of Ghana.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.peacefmonline.com/pages/local/social/201805/352025.php|title=Two Sick Children At KATH Benefit From May 9 Project (PHOTOS)|last=Online|first=Peace FM|access-date=2018-09-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, After the Atomic Junction Gas Explosion in Accra, Ghana, Herbert Mensah led a charge to support victims and survivors through donations at the 37-military hospital in Accra.
