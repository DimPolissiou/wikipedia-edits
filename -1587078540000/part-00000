The \"forbidden thoughts factor\" correlated highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent, religious, or sexual nature. The \"cleaning factor\" correlated highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning. The \"hoarding factor\" only involved hoarding-related obsessions and compulsions, and was identified as being distinct from other symptom groupings.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bloch|first1=MH|last2=Landeros-Weisenberger|first2=A|last3=Rosario|first3=MC|last4=Pittenger|first4=C|last5=Leckman|first5=JF|title=Meta-analysis of the symptom structure of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=December 2008|volume=165|issue=12|pages=1532\u201342|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08020320|pmid=18923068|pmc=3972003}}</ref>\n\nWhile OCD has been considered a homogeneous disorder from a neuropsychological perspective, many of the putative neuropsychological deficits may be due to comorbid disorders. Furthermore, some subtypes have been associated with improvement in performance on certain tasks such as [[pattern recognition (psychology)|pattern recognition]] (washing subtype) and spatial working memory (obsessive thought subtype). Subgroups have also been distinguished by neuroimaging findings and treatment response. Neuroimaging studies on this have been too few, and the subtypes examined have differed too much to draw any conclusions.

Within and among individuals, the initial obsessions, or intrusive thoughts, vary in their clarity and vividness. A relatively vague obsession could involve a general sense of disarray or tension accompanied by a belief that life cannot proceed as normal while the imbalance remains. A more intense obsession could be a preoccupation with the thought or image of someone close to them dying{{sfn|Baer|2001|pp=33, 78}}{{sfn|Baer|2001|p=xiv}} or intrusions related to \"[[Relationship obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder|relationship rightness]]\".<ref name = Doron2013>{{cite journal |first1=G|last1=Doron|first2=O|last2=Szepsenwol|first3=E|last3=Karp|first4=N|last4=Gal| title = Obsessing About Intimate-Relationships: Testing the Double Relationship-Vulnerability Hypothesis | journal = [[Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry]] |volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 433\u2013440 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23792752 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbtep.2013.05.003}}</ref> Other obsessions concern the possibility that someone or something other than oneself\u2014such as God, the devil, or disease\u2014will harm either the person with OCD or the people or things that the person cares about.

For example, an individual who engages in [[compulsive hoarding]] might be inclined to treat inorganic matter as if it had the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level.

Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/obsessive-compulsive-disorder.|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, (2005) |accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with [[antibacterial soap]] and hot water can make their skin red and raw with [[dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |title=Hygiene of the Skin: When Is Clean Too Clean?

For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is ''still'' not sure and deems it is ''still'' better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue for as long as necessary.\n\n=== Insight ===\nThe DSM-V contains three specifiers for the level of insight in OCD. Good or fair insight is characterized by the acknowledgment that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are or may not be true. Poor insight is characterized by the belief that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are probably true. Absence of insight makes obsessive-compulsive beliefs [[delusion]]al thoughts, and occurs in about 4% of people with OCD.<ref name=\"Sadock\">{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=P|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|last2=Sadock|first2=B|last3=Sadock|first3=V|publisher=LWW|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|edition=10th|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Overvalued ideas ===\nSome people with OCD exhibit what is known as ''overvalued ideas''. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do [[Exposure and response prevention|ERP therapy]] on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially.

To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] range of worries about conventional problems.<ref name=\"Quick\">''Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR''. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.</ref> A person may attempt to ignore or [[Thought suppression|suppress]] such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational.\n\nCompulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD ''must'' perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive.\n\nMoreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational or scholastic functioning.<ref name=\"Quick\" /> It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the person's estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, concrete tools can be used to gauge the person's condition. This may be done with rating scales, such as the [[Yale\u2013Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized.<ref name=\"Fenske_2009\" />\n\nOCD is sometimes placed in a group of disorders called the [[obsessive\u2013compulsive spectrum]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Starcevic|first1=V|last2=Janca|first2=A|title=Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders: still in search of the concept-affirming boundaries.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=January 2011|volume=24|issue=1|pages=55\u201360|pmid=20827198|doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e32833f3b58}}</ref>\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\nOCD is often confused with the separate condition [[obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD).

OCPD, on the other hand, is [[egosyntonic]]\u2014marked by the person's acceptance that the characteristics and behaviours displayed as a result are compatible with their [[self-image]], or are otherwise appropriate, correct or reasonable.\n\nAs a result, people with OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational, are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them.<ref name=\"carter\">Carter, K. \"Obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder.\" PSYC 210 lecture: Oxford College of Emory University.

At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly \"contaminated\" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a \"contaminated\" location, such as a school). That is the \"exposure\". The \"ritual prevention\" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly [[Habituation|habituates]] to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level drops considerably; they can then progress to touching something more \"contaminated\" or not checking the lock at all\u2014again, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.<ref name=\"baojournal.com\">Huppert & Roth: (2003) Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Exposure and Response Prevention.

These groups are sometimes viewed as dimensions or clusters that may reflect an underlying process.

The \"forbidden thoughts factor\" correlated highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent, religious, or sexual nature. The \"cleaning factor\" correlated highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning.

Subgroups have also been distinguished by neuroimaging findings and treatment response.

Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/obsessive-compulsive-disorder.|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, (2005) |accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfill their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with [[antibacterial soap]] and hot water can make their skin red and raw with [[dermatitis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |title=Hygiene of the Skin: When Is Clean Too Clean?

For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is ''still'' not sure and deems it is ''still'' better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue for as long as necessary.\n\n=== Insight ===\nThe DSM-V contains three specifiers for the level of insight in OCD. Good or fair insight is characterized by the acknowledgment that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are or may not be true. Poor insight is characterized by the belief that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are probably true. Absence of insight makes obsessive-compulsive beliefs [[delusion]]al thoughts, and occurs in about 4% of people with OCD.<ref name=\"Sadock\">{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=P|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|last2=Sadock|first2=B|last3=Sadock|first3=V|publisher=LWW|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|edition=10th|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Overvalued ideas ===\nSome people with OCD exhibit what is known as ''overvalued ideas''. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do [[Exposure and response prevention|ERP therapy]] on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially.

To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] range of worries about conventional problems.<ref name=\"Quick\">''Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR''. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.</ref> A person may attempt to ignore or [[Thought suppression|suppress]] such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational.\n\nCompulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD ''must'' perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive.\n\nMoreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational or scholastic functioning.<ref name=\"Quick\" /> It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the person's estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, concrete tools can be used to gauge the person's condition. This may be done with rating scales, such as the [[Yale\u2013Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized.<ref name=\"Fenske_2009\" />\n\nOCD is sometimes placed in a group of disorders called the [[obsessive\u2013compulsive spectrum]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Starcevic|first1=V|last2=Janca|first2=A|title=Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders: still in search of the concept-affirming boundaries.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=January 2011|volume=24|issue=1|pages=55\u201360|pmid=20827198|doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e32833f3b58}}</ref>\n\n=== Differential diagnosis ===\nOCD is often confused with the separate condition [[obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD).

At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly \"contaminated\" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a \"contaminated\" location, such as a school). That is the \"exposure\". The \"ritual prevention\" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention).
