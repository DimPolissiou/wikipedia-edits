It showcases historical and cultural artefacts relating to the [[London Borough of Croydon]] and its people. The museum is owned and run by [[Croydon London Borough Council|Croydon Council]].\n\nIt is located on the upper ground floor of Croydon Clocktower, but also incorporates the Riesco Gallery, on the lower ground floor, which displays Roman and Anglo-Saxon collections and a collection of [[Chinese ceramics]]. The museum originally opened under the name '''Lifetimes''' in 1995; and re-opened under its present name, following a major redevelopment and redesign, in 2006. Admission is free, and many of the displays are hands-on and interactive.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the end of the 20th century, the [[County Borough of Croydon|County Borough]] and its successor the [[London Borough of Croydon]] did not run a local museum, despite many decades of lobbying by, among others, the [[Croydon Natural History & Scientific Society]].<ref name=\"shaw\">{{cite journal |first=Muriel |last=Shaw |title=Being original [letter] |journal=[[Museums Journal]] |publisher=[[Museums Association]] |volume=95 |issue=11 |date=November 1995 |page=19 }}</ref> However, the two councils had acquired an art collection of over 2,000 items, and also the Riesco Collection of [[Chinese ceramics|Chinese pottery and porcelain]], assembled by local collector [[Raymond Riesco]] and bequeathed to the County Borough in 1964.<ref>MacDonald 1992, p. 21.</ref> In 1987, conscious that the borough had an \"identity problem\" \u2013 it was perceived as \"boring, bland and mediocre\" \u2013 the Council committed \u00a330 million towards a new arts, library and cultural complex, subsequently named [[Croydon Clocktower]], which was to include a new local museum.<ref>MacDonald 1995, p. 166.</ref><ref>Fussell 1997, p. 39.</ref><ref name=\"macd9862\">MacDonald 1998, p. 62.</ref>\n\nPlans for the museum were developed over five years, from 1989 to 1994. The development process included an extensive programme of [[market research]], undertaken in order to ascertain what the public wanted from a museum, and to make it accessible and relevant to the wider community.<ref>MacDonald 1992.</ref><ref>MacDonald 1995.</ref> A particular effort was made to involve non-traditional museum users: participants in 8 out of 10 [[focus group]]s were selected on the basis of their ethnic diversity, their lack of educational qualifications, and their agreement with the statement that \"I wouldn't be seen dead in a museum or arts centre\".<ref>MacDonald 1992, p. 23.</ref> The research found that the words \"Croydon\" and \"museum\" both held negative connotations, and so the new institution was given the neutral name of \"Lifetimes\".<ref>MacDonald 1995, pp. 166\u20137.</ref><ref>MacDonald 1998, p. 61.</ref> Sally MacDonald, the principal museum officer, later explained:\n{{quote|Croydon's museum had to be new, different, modern, daring, high profile, glossy, sponsorable and popular. It would be a symbol to help market Croydon to a hostile outside world.<ref name=\"macd9862\"/>}}\n\nLifetimes opened in March 1995.<ref name=\"dav95\">Davies 1995.</ref> It set out to tell the story of Croydon and its people from 1840 to the present (and into the future), with the main emphasis being on the period from 1939 onwards. Exhibits were mainly borrowed from local residents; much information was drawn from [[oral history]] interviews; and there were no glass cases or labels (interpretation and explanation being supplied entirely through [[multimedia]] computer terminals). In a token acknowledgement of the borough's earlier history, an entrance sculpture was commissioned tracing Croydon's story back to the [[Big Bang]].<ref>MacDonald 1998, p. 70.</ref>\n\nLifetimes won an [[Association for Heritage Interpretation|Interpret Britain Award]] in 1995; and the National Heritage Multimedia Award in 1996. Gaynor Kavanagh, lecturer in [[Museology|Museum Studies]] at the [[University of Leicester]], hailed it as:\n{{quote|a brave, bold and intelligent approach to exploring the contradictions and continuities which lie behind the complex histories of modern-day Croydon. ... After decades of striving for exhibitions that work against the grain of a male, white, middle class view of history, it is both refreshing and empowering to find an exhibition which is confident, uninhibited yet sensitive in its handling of the plurality of life.<ref>Kavanagh 1995.</ref>}}\n\nHowever, it was also criticised for being \"[[politically correct]]\" (for example, in over-emphasising the presence of ethnic minorities in Croydon, even in historical periods at which their presence was highly exceptional); for its excessive populism; and for its over-reliance on new technology.<ref name=\"dav95\"/><ref name=\"rein\">Reinhardt 1998.</ref> \"In the absence of labelling,\" wrote Maurice Davies in the ''[[Museums Journal]]'', \"screens are a cumbersome way to present basic information.\"<ref name=\"dav95\"/> The late start date of 1840, which left much of the borough's story unaddressed, particularly irked local historians.<ref name=\"shaw\"/> Caroline Reinhardt in ''[[The Spectator]]'' wrote:\n{{quote|There is nothing in the displays about Croydon's putative origins as a Roman staging post; nothing about its thousand-odd years of growth as a manor and [[Croydon Palace|palace]] of the [[Archbishops of Canterbury]]; nothing about its early industrial history. There was no room for any of the remarkable swords, shield-bosses, brooches and other items excavated from the early Saxon cemetery. Room has been found instead for a [[Hells Angels|Hell's Angel]]'s jacket, a plastic condom demonstrator, and an [[Ann Summers]] posing pouch. A drug addict's syringes jostle for space with the blanket and bag of a homeless man named Kash.<ref>Reinhardt 1998, p. 43.</ref>}}\n\nThe museum published three leaflets relating to ethnic minority groups in Croydon, titled ''Black Lifetimes'', ''South Asian Lifetimes'' and ''Irish Lifetimes''.

It showcases historical and cultural artefacts relating to the [[London Borough of Croydon]] and its people. The museum is owned and run by [[Croydon London Borough Council|Croydon Council]].\n\nIt is located on the upper ground floor of Croydon Clocktower, but also incorporates the Riesco Gallery, on the lower ground floor, which displays Roman and Anglo-Saxon collections and a collection of [[Chinese ceramics]]. The museum originally opened under the name '''Lifetimes''' in 1995; and re-opened under its present name, following a major redevelopment and redesign, in 2006. Admission is free, and many of the displays are hands-on and interactive.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the end of the 20th century, the [[County Borough of Croydon|County Borough]] and its successor the [[London Borough of Croydon]] did not run a local museum, despite many decades of lobbying by, among others, the [[Croydon Natural History & Scientific Society]].<ref name=\"shaw\">{{cite journal |first=Muriel |last=Shaw |title=Being original [letter] |journal=[[Museums Journal]] |publisher=[[Museums Association]] |volume=95 |issue=11 |date=November 1995 |page=19 }}</ref> However, the two councils had acquired an art collection of over 2,000 items, and also the Riesco Collection of [[Chinese ceramics|Chinese pottery and porcelain]], assembled by local collector [[Raymond Riesco]] and bequeathed to the County Borough in 1964.<ref>MacDonald 1992, p. 21.</ref> In 1987, conscious that the borough had an \"identity problem\" \u2013 it was perceived as \"boring, bland and mediocre\" \u2013 the Council committed \u00a330 million towards a new arts, library and cultural complex, subsequently named [[Croydon Clocktower]], which was to include a new local museum.<ref>MacDonald 1995, p. 166.</ref><ref>Fussell 1997, p. 39.</ref><ref name=\"macd9862\">MacDonald 1998, p. 62.</ref>\n\nPlans for the museum were developed over five years, from 1989 to 1994. The development process included an extensive programme of [[market research]], undertaken in order to ascertain what the public wanted from a museum, and to make it accessible and relevant to the wider community.<ref>MacDonald 1992.</ref><ref>MacDonald 1995.</ref> A particular effort was made to involve non-traditional museum users: participants in 8 out of 10 [[focus group]]s were selected on the basis of their ethnic diversity, their lack of educational qualifications, and their agreement with the statement that \"I wouldn't be seen dead in a museum or arts centre\".<ref>MacDonald 1992, p. 23.</ref> The research found that the words \"Croydon\" and \"museum\" both held negative connotations, and so the new institution was given the neutral name of \"Lifetimes\".<ref>MacDonald 1995, pp. 166\u20137.</ref><ref>MacDonald 1998, p. 61.</ref> Sally MacDonald, the principal museum officer, later explained:\n{{quote|Croydon's museum had to be new, different, modern, daring, high profile, glossy, sponsorable and popular. It would be a symbol to help market Croydon to a hostile outside world.<ref name=\"macd9862\"/>}}\n\nLifetimes opened in March 1995.<ref name=\"dav95\">Davies 1995.</ref> It set out to tell the story of Croydon and its people from 1840 to the present (and into the future), with the main emphasis being on the period from 1939 onwards. Exhibits were mainly borrowed from local residents; much information was drawn from [[oral history]] interviews; and there were no glass cases or labels (interpretation and explanation being supplied entirely through [[multimedia]] computer terminals). In a token acknowledgement of the borough's earlier history, an entrance sculpture was commissioned tracing Croydon's story back to the [[Big Bang]].<ref>MacDonald 1998, p. 70.</ref>\n\nLifetimes won an [[Association for Heritage Interpretation|Interpret Britain Award]] in 1995; and the National Heritage Multimedia Award in 1996. Gaynor Kavanagh, lecturer in [[Museology|Museum Studies]] at the [[University of Leicester]], hailed it as:\n{{quote|a brave, bold and intelligent approach to exploring the contradictions and continuities which lie behind the complex histories of modern-day Croydon. ... After decades of striving for exhibitions that work against the grain of a male, white, middle class view of history, it is both refreshing and empowering to find an exhibition which is confident, uninhibited yet sensitive in its handling of the plurality of life.<ref>Kavanagh 1995.</ref>}}\n\nHowever, it was also criticised for being \"[[politically correct]]\" (for example, in over-emphasising the presence of ethnic minorities in Croydon, even in historical periods at which their presence was highly exceptional); for its excessive populism; and for its over-reliance on new technology.<ref name=\"dav95\"/><ref name=\"rein\">Reinhardt 1998.</ref> \"In the absence of labelling,\" wrote Maurice Davies in the ''[[Museums Journal]]'', \"screens are a cumbersome way to present basic information.\"<ref name=\"dav95\"/> The late start date of 1840, which left much of the borough's story unaddressed, particularly irked local historians.<ref name=\"shaw\"/> Caroline Reinhardt in ''[[The Spectator]]'' wrote:\n{{quote|There is nothing in the displays about Croydon's putative origins as a Roman staging post; nothing about its thousand-odd years of growth as a manor and [[Croydon Palace|palace]] of the [[Archbishops of Canterbury]]; nothing about its early industrial history. There was no room for any of the remarkable swords, shield-bosses, brooches and other items excavated from the early Saxon cemetery. Room has been found instead for a [[Hells Angels|Hell's Angel]]'s jacket, a plastic condom demonstrator, and an [[Ann Summers]] posing pouch. A drug addict's syringes jostle for space with the blanket and bag of a homeless man named Kash.<ref>Reinhardt 1998, p. 43.</ref>}}\n\nThe museum published three leaflets relating to ethnic minority groups in Croydon, titled ''Black Lifetimes'', ''South Asian Lifetimes'' and ''Irish Lifetimes''. The last of these was withdrawn after it drew complaints from [[David Trimble]], leader of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], of pro-[[Irish republicanism|republican]] bias.<ref>Reinhardt 1998, p. 44.</ref>\n\nLifetimes closed for a major refurbishment and redesign in December 2004.

In its yearly to biyearly reports, the Panel makes recommendations to minimize the project's negative externalities and maximize the positive effects.  Along with other groups, including NGOs, the Panel provides oversight to the dam project and provided the initial social and environmental reasoning for the dam's creation.  Despite its goals, it has received allegations from scholars and NGOs.\n\n=== Overview of the Project ===\n\nThe [[Nam Theun 2 Dam]] is a hydroelectric dam on the [[Nam Theun River]] in [[Laos]].  Before the commercial operations of the plant began in March 2010, the World Bank along with other investors conducted various tests of the projects social, environmental, and economic impacts.

Next they spent eight days in the field observing and communicating with villages in the Upper Nam Hinboun Basin.  They also meet with district officials and staff involved with resettlement to ensure that the project was fulfilling World Bank guidelines. Like every visit, the panel sought to examine developments that have taken place since the Panel's most recent visits, to visit areas not previously seen, and to participate in the review of documentation being prepared under Company auspices as a World Bank requirement for project appraisal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/09/09/000011823_20050909173336/Rendered/PDF/E385v2006thPOEReport.pdf |title=World Bank Document |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Factors that limit the POE\u2019s evaluations ===\n\nThere are important institutional factors that guide the POE and other independent groups that work with the Nam Theun 2 project.  In exchange for unique research opportunities, access to formerly inaccessible research sites, and high wages, the Bank specifies what kind of information is needed, the time frame for the research, and the deadline for the written report.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Imperial nature the World Bank and struggles for social justice in the age of globalization|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0-300-10408-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold/page/160 160]}}</ref> The terms of reference also give the Bank, the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft, and other groups exclusive ownership of the raw data and the finished reports which means that the data cannot be distributed without permission from the contractor.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  The World Bank has chosen to make the POE reports public.  \nIn response to the time constraints, between one and two weeks, POE members employ \u201crapid rural appraisal\u201d methods.  These methods involve the quick and cost effectively extraction and analysis of information from respondents and secondary data.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chamberlain|first=James|title=Environmental and Social Action Plan for Nakai-Nam Theun Catchment and Corridor Areas|journal=iUCN|date=1997}}</ref>  As a result of this research model, the Bank incentives researchers to work quickly with less contact with locals.  Many researchers also argue that the complexities of the Mekong River, it changes from season to season and tributary to tributary, require more researchers and time to properly analyze.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Imperial nature the World Bank and struggles for social justice in the age of globalization|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0-300-10408-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold/page/163 163]}}</ref> More importantly, because the Bank pays researchers to answer specific questions through the terms of reference, some researchers state that they are unable to discuss the more intricate facets of their research thereby reducing the reports viability.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burchell|first=Graham|title=The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality|date=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=134}}</ref>\n\n=== Rational for the POE's Endorsement of the Initial Project ===\n\nWhile the POE acknowledge that large scale projects such as the Nam Theun 2 dam present future environmental and social disadvantages which are often overlooked or impossible to predict, the POE wrote that they endorsed the World Bank's participation based on five major considerations. \n\t\nThe panel was concerned with what they measured to be the significantly deteriorating living standard of the inhabits of the NNT Conservation and the Nakai Plateau and the NNT Conservation Area.  They also pointed to the area's deteriorating environment and biodiversity.  In the Naki Plateau, the POE estimated that 50 percent of the people were below the Lao PDR's poverty line.  Furthermore, the poor in these areas were increasingly reliant on food relief due to crop failures.  They also had no access to medical facilities.  Intensifying these problems, the population growth rate was nearing three percent.  The POE attributes many of these problems to the declining populations of natural predators in the ecosystem due to overhunting by the indigenous people and foreign poachers.  These opinions are grounded with correlational evidence that shows a sharp increase of insects and rodents that intensified the famines and diseases in the area.   The POE also found four indigenous cultures: the Atel, the Themarou, the Mlengbrou, and the Ahoe that would become extinct by the early 21st century without foreign intervention.  The POE believed that a wider range of economic opportunities created by the project would provide members of these cultures with the means of survival and an escape from poverty.<ref name=\"POE Report 2\">{{cite web|title=Report 2|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/10/000094946_00101705305775/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf}}</ref>\n\tThe POE was also swayed by the commitment of the consortium (NTEC) to improve the living standards of impacted people beyond the standards required by the World Bank. Its involvement in the drafting of a national resettlement policy for development projects would help the Nam Theun 2 project become a model for future development projects both in Laos and the rest of the world.  Most importantly, the consortium agreed to make one million dollars available annually for thirty years to protect National Biodiversity Conservation Area.\n\n\tThe POE determined that the dam would be built regardless of the World Bank's Participation and, with its involvement, greater credence and would be given to remedy the social and environmental externalities associated with the project.  The POE deemed that Laos had two major resources that could be exploited to generate enough revenue to raise the living standards throughout the country.  In 1997, the POE estimated that large-scale deforestation and lumbering provided 40 percent of the foreign exchange for Laos.  Due to deforestation caused by the conversion to agriculture and this lumbering, the POE believed that this process was unsustainable.  As such, the government would seek to utilize hydropower to facilitate development.  Given previous projects in the [[Bolaven Plateau]] in southern Laos, the POE believed that the government alone could not be looked to account and provide for the negative externalities associated with the project.\n\n\tIn the interest of biodiversity and other environmental concerns, five large vertebrate mammals had been newly discovered in the five years before the 1997 report.  The area is the largest contiguous forest in Laos with extraordinary botanical richness.  With out the World Bank's participation, the logging halted by the project would resume along with road building without consideration for local flora and fauna and the Vietnamese and Hmong hunters and traders who depend on them.  Therefore, although the dam would destroy some of the wide life in the area, it was preferable to the deforestation that would continue without intervention.<ref name=\"POE Report 2\" />\n\n\tFinally, the POE believed that they would loss the ability to establish a model in which environmental and cultural concerns are integral to the interplay between the government, the World Bank, and the private sector.  Also, a failure to implement the project would be a significant blow and a justifiable source of criticism for the parties involved.  This blow would undermine the World Bank's ability to fund more development projects and accomplish its goals.<ref>http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/10/000094946_00101705305775/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Opposition to the POE\u2019s Initial Recommendation ===\n\nAfter the project got approved, NGOs based in Berkeley and Bangkok evaluated the POE's report and the report of the Australian engineering firm, Snowy Mountains Engineering Company, which the World Bank had contracted to conduct a feasibility study.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Imperial nature the World Bank and struggles for social justice in the age of globalization|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0-300-10408-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold/page/159 159]}}</ref> These NGOs argued that the POE's assessment was seriously flawed and the Bank eventually agreed with the NGOs.  After another attempt to approve the project using the Thai-based engineering group TEAM, the Bank continued to be challenged by international activists and called for a third round of feasibility studies.  Finally, the bank incorporated NGOs into the process adding the multiple layers of social and environmental oversight that exist today.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n=== Current Recommendations ===\n\nThe POE recommends various actions to local and international actors in each report.  Its twenty first and most recent report in March 2013 demonstrates is mentality towards advancing social and environmental concerns in the region.\n\nIn this report, the POE was most interested in reducing poaching in the watershed areas created by the project.  They advise that conservation patrols intensify especially during the wet season.  They advise the Provincial and Central Government authorities to take effective action to recognize and halt the subversion of village authorities in the NPA for the illegal Rosewood trade.  This includes cracking down on the participants, supporters and enablers of the trade within and outside of government at village, district, province or higher level.\n\nGenerally, recommendation also extend the scope of law enforcement by supplying them with more equipment and giving them control over various groups to more effectively and efficiently manage the local resources.  These resources include the reservoir, fishery, and other natural resources.\n\nThe POE also recommends that the WMPA and other groups elevate the educational requirements for staff members and replace existing staff with university graduates or experienced staff from conservation organizations.\n\nFinally, recommendations, including the most recent report, stress increased monitoring of track construction and other forms of development.  The POE advised the destruction of any track that was created without the approval of the WMPA plans.  The POE grounds this recommendation with their goal to reduce poaching and other social and environmental ills caused by locals or other non-World Bank influences.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\n=== Allegations of Suppression of Negative Findings ===\n\nWhile few allegations of suppression are directed at the POE specifically, many scholars believe that the issue is widespread creating a culture of compliance to neoliberal ideas and recommendations. For example, Tyson Roberts is an ichthyologist who specializes in the Mekong fisheries.  He was hired to conduct a fishery study for the Nam Theun 2 project.  Like a number of his peers, Roberts publicly cautioned the government and the Bank against rapid assessments of the river without extensive data on fish migration.  Halfway through this consultancy, he was fired and his visa was removed and another Northern scientist conducted rapid appraisals the World Bank needed to continue the project.  Since EIAs and SIAs can delay or event prevent a projects implementation, scholars believe that the World Bank is incentivized to rush and suppress the assessments in order to make the loans required for the project to continue.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Imperial nature the World Bank and struggles for social justice in the age of globalization|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0-300-10408-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold/page/164 164]}}</ref>\nAlso narrowing the POE's intellectual scope, the reports focus on the knowledge of three experts thereby subjugating the knowledge of the millions of \u201cnonexperts\u201d that are perceived as the object of study and of development.  Scholars show that surveys characterize populations based on enduring social categories such as fisher or hunter while ignoring their local knowledge of the fish and animals in the area.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Imperial nature the World Bank and struggles for social justice in the age of globalization|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0-300-10408-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold/page/170 170]}}</ref>\n\n=== Allegations of a Neocolonialist Mindset ===\n\nMany scholars assert that environmental projects such as the Nam Theun 2 dam are a legitimizing vehicle for the establishment of western property rights and oversight by the state that accompanies the development of fixed capital infrastructure.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Constructing an Environmental State: Eco-Governmentality and Other Transnational Practices of a \"Green\" World Bank|journal=Social Problems|date=Nov 2001|volume=48|series=Special Issue on Globalization and Social Problems|issue=4|pages=499\u2013523|doi=10.1525/sp.2001.48.4.499|url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9239/35f6da55b652352bf3f79d6c6fe94c21b8fd.pdf}}</ref>  For these scholars, including Goldman, the POE is a pro-active response to transnational environmental organizations, networks, and movements.\n\nSome scholars believe that the POE composition reflects neo-colonial goals and mentalities.  The large portion of the POE's budget spent sending the western members of the Panel to Laos and back from their home countries instead of relying upon local professionals shows distrust in the competency of the Laotian researchers and analysts.   Similarly, Laotian civil servants are paid a tiny fraction of what their western counterparts earn for their work.  Additionally, many of these local officials are relegated to translators.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Constructing an Environmental State: Eco-Governmentality and Other Transnational Practices of a \"Green\" World Bank|journal=Social Problems|date=Nov 2001|volume=48|series=Special Issue on Globalization and Social Problems|page=512|doi=10.1525/sp.2001.48.4.499}}</ref>\nThis aligns with the argument that the POE and the World Bank suppress local knowledge.  Scholars argue that as the indigenous people become increasingly commoditized an asymmetric relationship develops between development experts and the beneficiaries who are perceived as irrational, environmentally degrading, and in dire need of development at almost any cost.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The POE funding proposals involved teaching Laotian proto-professional English and sending the abroad to learn to identify endogenous species only to return to Laos to staff conservation agencies.<ref name=autogenerated4 />  Even when the POE or other groups discuss the project in the numerous public consultations on the dam, they use language that the villagers cannot understand.  The Banks failure to communicate with the \u201cobjects\u201d of development shows to some scholars that the project is informed by a neocolonial mindset.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!-- Just press the \"Save page\" button below without changing anything!

They also meet with district officials and staff involved with resettlement to ensure that the project was fulfilling World Bank guidelines. Like every visit, the panel sought to examine developments that have taken place since the Panel's most recent visits, to visit areas not previously seen, and to participate in the review of documentation being prepared under Company auspices as a World Bank requirement for project appraisal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/09/09/000011823_20050909173336/Rendered/PDF/E385v2006thPOEReport.pdf |title=World Bank Document |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Factors that limit the POE\u2019s evaluations ===\n\nThere are important institutional factors that guide the POE and other independent groups that work with the Nam Theun 2 project.  In exchange for unique research opportunities, access to formerly inaccessible research sites, and high wages, the Bank specifies what kind of information is needed, the time frame for the research, and the deadline for the written report.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Imperial nature the World Bank and struggles for social justice in the age of globalization|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0-300-10408-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold/page/160 160]}}</ref> The terms of reference also give the Bank, the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft, and other groups exclusive ownership of the raw data and the finished reports which means that the data cannot be distributed without permission from the contractor.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  The World Bank has chosen to make the POE reports public.  \nIn response to the time constraints, between one and two weeks, POE members employ \u201crapid rural appraisal\u201d methods.  These methods involve the quick and cost effectively extraction and analysis of information from respondents and secondary data.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chamberlain|first=James|title=Environmental and Social Action Plan for Nakai-Nam Theun Catchment and Corridor Areas|journal=iUCN|date=1997}}</ref>  As a result of this research model, the Bank incentives researchers to work quickly with less contact with locals.  Many researchers also argue that the complexities of the Mekong River, it changes from season to season and tributary to tributary, require more researchers and time to properly analyze.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Imperial nature the World Bank and struggles for social justice in the age of globalization|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0-300-10408-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold/page/163 163]}}</ref> More importantly, because the Bank pays researchers to answer specific questions through the terms of reference, some researchers state that they are unable to discuss the more intricate facets of their research thereby reducing the reports viability.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burchell|first=Graham|title=The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality|date=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=134}}</ref>\n\n=== Rational for the POE's Endorsement of the Initial Project ===\n\nWhile the POE acknowledge that large scale projects such as the Nam Theun 2 dam present future environmental and social disadvantages which are often overlooked or impossible to predict, the POE wrote that they endorsed the World Bank's participation based on five major considerations. \n\t\nThe panel was concerned with what they measured to be the significantly deteriorating living standard of the inhabits of the NNT Conservation and the Nakai Plateau and the NNT Conservation Area.  They also pointed to the area's deteriorating environment and biodiversity.  In the Naki Plateau, the POE estimated that 50 percent of the people were below the Lao PDR's poverty line.  Furthermore, the poor in these areas were increasingly reliant on food relief due to crop failures.  They also had no access to medical facilities.  Intensifying these problems, the population growth rate was nearing three percent.  The POE attributes many of these problems to the declining populations of natural predators in the ecosystem due to overhunting by the indigenous people and foreign poachers.  These opinions are grounded with correlational evidence that shows a sharp increase of insects and rodents that intensified the famines and diseases in the area.   The POE also found four indigenous cultures: the Atel, the Themarou, the Mlengbrou, and the Ahoe that would become extinct by the early 21st century without foreign intervention.  The POE believed that a wider range of economic opportunities created by the project would provide members of these cultures with the means of survival and an escape from poverty.<ref name=\"POE Report 2\">{{cite web|title=Report 2|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/10/000094946_00101705305775/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf}}</ref>\n\tThe POE was also swayed by the commitment of the consortium (NTEC) to improve the living standards of impacted people beyond the standards required by the World Bank. Its involvement in the drafting of a national resettlement policy for development projects would help the Nam Theun 2 project become a model for future development projects both in Laos and the rest of the world.  Most importantly, the consortium agreed to make one million dollars available annually for thirty years to protect National Biodiversity Conservation Area.\n\n\tThe POE determined that the dam would be built regardless of the World Bank's Participation and, with its involvement, greater credence and would be given to remedy the social and environmental externalities associated with the project.  The POE deemed that Laos had two major resources that could be exploited to generate enough revenue to raise the living standards throughout the country.  In 1997, the POE estimated that large-scale deforestation and lumbering provided 40 percent of the foreign exchange for Laos.  Due to deforestation caused by the conversion to agriculture and this lumbering, the POE believed that this process was unsustainable.  As such, the government would seek to utilize hydropower to facilitate development.  Given previous projects in the Bolevan Plateau in southern Laos, the POE believed that the government alone could not be looked to account and provide for the negative externalities associated with the project.\n\n\tIn the interest of biodiversity and other environmental concerns, five large vertebrate mammals had been newly discovered in the five years before the 1997 report.  The area is the largest contiguous forest in Laos with extraordinary botanical richness.  With out the World Bank's participation, the logging halted by the project would resume along with road building without consideration for local flora and fauna and the Vietnamese and Hmong hunters and traders who depend on them.  Therefore, although the dam would destroy some of the wide life in the area, it was preferable to the deforestation that would continue without intervention.<ref name=\"POE Report 2\" />\n\n\tFinally, the POE believed that they would loss the ability to establish a model in which environmental and cultural concerns are integral to the interplay between the government, the World Bank, and the private sector.  Also, a failure to implement the project would be a significant blow and a justifiable source of criticism for the parties involved.  This blow would undermine the World Bank's ability to fund more development projects and accomplish its goals.<ref>http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/10/000094946_00101705305775/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Opposition to the POE\u2019s Initial Recommendation ===\n\nAfter the project got approved, NGOs based in Berkeley and Bangkok evaluated the POE's report and the report of the Australian engineering firm, Snowy Mountains Engineering Company, which the World Bank had contracted to conduct a feasibility study.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Imperial nature the World Bank and struggles for social justice in the age of globalization|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0-300-10408-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold/page/159 159]}}</ref> These NGOs argued that the POE's assessment was seriously flawed and the Bank eventually agreed with the NGOs.  After another attempt to approve the project using the Thai-based engineering group TEAM, the Bank continued to be challenged by international activists and called for a third round of feasibility studies.  Finally, the bank incorporated NGOs into the process adding the multiple layers of social and environmental oversight that exist today.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n=== Current Recommendations ===\n\nThe POE recommends various actions to local and international actors in each report.  Its twenty first and most recent report in March 2013 demonstrates is mentality towards advancing social and environmental concerns in the region.\n\nIn this report, the POE was most interested in reducing poaching in the watershed areas created by the project.  They advise that conservation patrols intensify especially during the wet season.  They advise the Provincial and Central Government authorities to take effective action to recognize and halt the subversion of village authorities in the NPA for the illegal Rosewood trade.  This includes cracking down on the participants, supporters and enablers of the trade within and outside of government at village, district, province or higher level.\n\nGenerally, recommendation also extend the scope of law enforcement by supplying them with more equipment and giving them control over various groups to more effectively and efficiently manage the local resources.  These resources include the reservoir, fishery, and other natural resources.\n\nThe POE also recommends that the WMPA and other groups elevate the educational requirements for staff members and replace existing staff with university graduates or experienced staff from conservation organizations.\n\nFinally, recommendations, including the most recent report, stress increased monitoring of track construction and other forms of development.  The POE advised the destruction of any track that was created without the approval of the WMPA plans.  The POE grounds this recommendation with their goal to reduce poaching and other social and environmental ills caused by locals or other non-World Bank influences.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\n=== Allegations of Suppression of Negative Findings ===\n\nWhile few allegations of suppression are directed at the POE specifically, many scholars believe that the issue is widespread creating a culture of compliance to neoliberal ideas and recommendations. For example, Tyson Roberts is an ichthyologist who specializes in the Mekong fisheries.  He was hired to conduct a fishery study for the Nam Theun 2 project.  Like a number of his peers, Roberts publicly cautioned the government and the Bank against rapid assessments of the river without extensive data on fish migration.  Halfway through this consultancy, he was fired and his visa was removed and another Northern scientist conducted rapid appraisals the World Bank needed to continue the project.  Since EIAs and SIAs can delay or event prevent a projects implementation, scholars believe that the World Bank is incentivized to rush and suppress the assessments in order to make the loans required for the project to continue.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Imperial nature the World Bank and struggles for social justice in the age of globalization|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0-300-10408-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold/page/164 164]}}</ref>\nAlso narrowing the POE's intellectual scope, the reports focus on the knowledge of three experts thereby subjugating the knowledge of the millions of \u201cnonexperts\u201d that are perceived as the object of study and of development.  Scholars show that surveys characterize populations based on enduring social categories such as fisher or hunter while ignoring their local knowledge of the fish and animals in the area.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Imperial nature the World Bank and struggles for social justice in the age of globalization|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0-300-10408-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/imperialnaturewo0000gold/page/170 170]}}</ref>\n\n=== Allegations of a Neocolonialist Mindset ===\n\nMany scholars assert that environmental projects such as the Nam Theun 2 dam are a legitimizing vehicle for the establishment of western property rights and oversight by the state that accompanies the development of fixed capital infrastructure.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Constructing an Environmental State: Eco-Governmentality and Other Transnational Practices of a \"Green\" World Bank|journal=Social Problems|date=Nov 2001|volume=48|series=Special Issue on Globalization and Social Problems|issue=4|pages=499\u2013523|doi=10.1525/sp.2001.48.4.499|url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9239/35f6da55b652352bf3f79d6c6fe94c21b8fd.pdf}}</ref>  For these scholars, including Goldman, the POE is a pro-active response to transnational environmental organizations, networks, and movements.\n\nSome scholars believe that the POE composition reflects neo-colonial goals and mentalities.  The large portion of the POE's budget spent sending the western members of the Panel to Laos and back from their home countries instead of relying upon local professionals shows distrust in the competency of the Laotian researchers and analysts.   Similarly, Laotian civil servants are paid a tiny fraction of what their western counterparts earn for their work.  Additionally, many of these local officials are relegated to translators.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Michael|title=Constructing an Environmental State: Eco-Governmentality and Other Transnational Practices of a \"Green\" World Bank|journal=Social Problems|date=Nov 2001|volume=48|series=Special Issue on Globalization and Social Problems|page=512|doi=10.1525/sp.2001.48.4.499}}</ref>\nThis aligns with the argument that the POE and the World Bank suppress local knowledge.  Scholars argue that as the indigenous people become increasingly commoditized an asymmetric relationship develops between development experts and the beneficiaries who are perceived as irrational, environmentally degrading, and in dire need of development at almost any cost.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The POE funding proposals involved teaching Laotian proto-professional English and sending the abroad to learn to identify endogenous species only to return to Laos to staff conservation agencies.<ref name=autogenerated4 />  Even when the POE or other groups discuss the project in the numerous public consultations on the dam, they use language that the villagers cannot understand.  The Banks failure to communicate with the \u201cobjects\u201d of development shows to some scholars that the project is informed by a neocolonial mindset.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!-- Just press the \"Save page\" button below without changing anything!

The association was then about 170 strong with a committee of 30 members. They were part of the formation of the only settlement in India that Europeans and Eurasians could call their own. Mr. White, the then president of the E&AI Association., took a lively interest in it and helped in its advancement which at the beginning was an uphill task.\n\nIn the first decade of the 1900s, there were about 45 houses: 18 were on the village site and the remainder were on farms throughout the settlement and contained about {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of land fit for cultivation. The number of residents in 1907 was 130. [[Robert Bourke, 1st Baron Connemara|Lord Connemara]], the then governor of Madras (1890) and General Sir [[Harry Prendergast]], a British resident in Mysore, visited the settlement and lent support to the development of Whitefield.

Established in the late 1800s as a settlement for the Eurasians and [[Anglo Indian]]s of Bangalore, Whitefield remained a quaint little settlement at the eastern periphery of Bangalore city till the late 1990s when the local IT boom turned it into a major suburb.

The association was then about 170 strong with a committee of 30 members. They were part of the formation of the only settlement in India that Europeans and Eurasians could call their own. Mr. White, the then president of the E&AI Association., took a lively interest in it and helped in its advancement which at the beginning was an uphill task.\n\nIn the first decade of the 1900s, there were about 45 houses: 18 were on the village site and the remainder were on farms throughout the settlement and contained about {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of land fit for cultivation. The number of residents in 1907 was 130. [[Robert Bourke, 1st Baron Connemara|Lord Connemara]], the then governor of Madras (1890) and General Sir [[Harry Prendergast]], a British resident in Mysore, visited the settlement and lent support to the development of Whitefield. Subsequently, there were regular visits to Whitefield by the Bangalore District officials and high dignitaries from the [[Madras Presidency]].<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.children-of-bangalore.com/whitefld.htm Whitefield, the last of the Settlements, ... near Bangalore<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe settlement was {{convert|3|km}} south of the Bangalore-Madras (now Chennai) line and a station was built. It led to the influx of residents and their families who worked at [[Kolar Gold Fields]], about {{convert|50|km}} (by train) to the east. It became convenient for those working at KGF to catch a train (running 3 to 4 times a day) and return to their families. There were frequent trains running to Bangalore {{convert|20|km}} to the west (by train). Reaching the settlement from the railway station was possible only by writing a letter to Mrs. Hamilton (wife of a James Hamilton, the keeper of the Waverly Inn) who would arrange for a bullock cart trip for 8 annas.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n[[Winston Churchill]], two-time prime minister of the UK, is said to have paid frequent visits to the Waverly Inn while in India.<ref>[http://www.oocities.org/athens/2960/places.htm Bangalore: Karnataka, India, Some Places in Bangalore that refused to die<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.deccanherald.com/content/94376/of-circle-circle.html%3Cu%3E%3C/u%3E Of a circle within a circle<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Legend has it that Churchill courted the daughter of the innkeepers, Rose Hamilton.<ref>[http://schools.papyrusclubs.com/gis/voice/heritage-our-backyard Heritage In Our Backyard - Voice | Gopalan International School Online Campus Newspaper|KALEIDOSCOPE - PapyrusClubs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://aturquoisecloud.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/whitefield-remembered-guest-photograper-series/ Whitefield remembered- Guest Photographer series | a turquoise cloud<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nUntil the late 1990s, Whitefield was a small village.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the Federal Security Service Employee Day in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that would not be able to detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{in lang|ru}} [http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm Today is the Federal Security Service Employee Day: Satisfied with the year summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |date=31 January 2011 }}, [[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]], 20 December 2001, [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&u=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244%26m=8.htm computer translation]</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei Pinyayev of the 137th Regiment, who guarded a military facility near the city of Ryazan, together with a friend.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.
