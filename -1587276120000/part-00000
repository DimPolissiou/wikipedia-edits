It was released on December 4, 2001. It is the last film to feature [[Judge Reinhold]] as Richard Newton, [[Julia Sweeney]] as Beth Newton, [[Joe Pichler]] as Brennan Newton, and Michaela Gallo as Sara Newton.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nRichard Newton checks in with his two children, Sara and Brennan, before school. The children love their [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] dog, [[Beethoven (film)|Beethoven]], who they are keeping for a relative family, but their parents do not, and want to get rid of him. So the children begin taking the dog to Obedience Training led by a former army sergeant. Brennan falls in love with a girl named Hayley, while Beethoven literally destroys the [[obstacle course]] in one day. To top it all off, Beethoven hits the army sergeant in the groin with a leash causing him to kneel over in pain.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich Sedgewick family owns a pampered and well-behaved St. Bernard that looks exactly like Beethoven, named Michelangelo. Michelangelo and young Madison Sedgewick are friends, but her busy parents, Reginald and Martha, are always neglecting her. In fact, Reginald is the only one who seems to try to play with her. Beethoven, meanwhile, runs after a loose [[hot dog cart]], and ends up on a merry-go-round. Michelangelo has gotten loose, as weel, and is now on the same [[merry-go-round]]. Brennan and Sara mistake him for Beethoven and take him home. The real Beethoven is mistaken for Michelangelo, and grabbed by Jonathan Simmons, the Sedgewick family's [[butler]] and taken to their mansion.\n\nSara is surprised when Michelangelo wipes his feet on the welcome mat and folds the napkins with his teeth at dinner. The Sedgewicks notice the change in \"their dog\" too, when he bolts Simmons to the ground to get a piece of [[turkey meat|turkey]]. That night, Beethoven hears Madison whimpering because of a bad dream, and comforts her. At the next obedience class, Michelangelo leaves everyone in astonishment, by finishing the entire new obstacle course, while the sergeant is announcing about the course.\n\nMeanwhile, Beethoven ruins a dinner party, when a man named Nigel tries to kidnap him. A [[therapist]] points out to Martha that the reason \"Michelangelo\" is acting this way is because he is the first one exhibiting \"symptoms\". The therapist suggests that it may be because Martha does not care about anyone but herself. Richard is concerned about \"Beethoven\", and starts acting out to get \"Beethoven\" to misbehave again too. Richard drinks toilet water, chases the mailman, etc. Michelangelo ends up catching on, and starts behaving like Beethoven.\n\nThe Sedgewick family start playing fetch and swimming with Beethoven. But as the Sedgewicks and Beethoven are [[hiking]], Nigel (who turns out to be Simmons' sidekick) kidnaps Beethoven and locks him in a [[warehouse]], for a ransom of $250,000. But Beethoven breaks out and secretly switches places with Michelangelo at the obedience graduation. The real Michelangelo is found by the Sedgewicks, and Simmons and Nigel are arrested by two FBI agents. The real Beethoven is found by the Newtons, and he graduates. The Sedgewicks and Newtons then meet up at a fork on the road, though, they never find out about the switching of Beethoven and Michelangelo.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Judge Reinhold]] as Richard Newton\n* [[Julia Sweeney]] as Beth Newton\n* [[Joe Pichler]] as Brennan Newton\n* [[Michaela Gallo]] as Sara Newton\n* [[Kaleigh Krish]] as Madison Sedgewick\n* [[Matt McCoy (actor)|Matt McCoy]] as Reginald Sedgewick\n* [[Veanne Cox]] as Martha Sedgewick\n* [[Jeff Coopwood]] as Bill\n* [[Dorien Wilson]] as Marlowe\n* [[Mark Lindsay Chapman]] as Jonathan \"Johnnie\" Simmons\n* [[Nick Meaney]] as Nigel Bigalow\n* [[Natalie Marston]] as Hayley (as Natalie Elizabeth Marston)\n* [[Art LaFleur]] as Sergeant Rutledge\n* [[June Lu]] as Mrs. Florence Rutledge\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a score of 0% based on reviews from 8 critics.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beethovens_4th/ | title = Beethoven's 4th |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |access-date= October 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0294345|title=Beethoven's 4th}}\n\n{{Beethoven film series}}\n{{David M.

Their parent label, [[Decca Records]] offered them a chance to record a [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] LP that combined their music with orchestral interludes. They decided to compose a suite of songs about the life of everyday man, with the group and orchestra mostly playing separately and mixed together. It was a moderate success upon release, but following steady radio airplay, particularly of the hit single \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\", it became a top ten US hit in 1972. It has since been listed among the most important albums of 1967 by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.\n\n== Background and recording ==\nThe Moody Blues had started out as a [[rhythm and blues]] band, but by late 1966, they had run into financial difficulties. New arrival singer and guitarist [[Justin Hayward]] said \"we had no money, nothing\".<ref name=ucr>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/moody-blues-days-of-future-passed-album/|title=50 Years Ago: Moody Blues Broke Rules|work=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> According to the group, in September 1967 they were asked by their record company, [[Decca Records|Decca]] to record an adaptation of [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Symphony No. 9]]'' for Decca's newly formed [[Deram Records]] division in order to demonstrate their latest recording techniques, which were named \"Deramic Sound\".<ref name=\"RS67\"/> However, [[recording engineer]] Derek Varnals disputes this story, claiming that even at the start of the sessions in 1967 there was no intent to record a Dvo\u0159\u00e1k album and that talk of this project did not emerge until the mid-1970s.<ref name=sos>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul09/articles/classictracks_0709.htm |title=Sound On Sound (Classic Tracks: The Moody Blues \"Nights In White Satin\") |publisher=soundonsound.com |accessdate=17 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nDecca had experimented with [[stereophonic sound]] for classical recordings, and hoped to capture the pop market in the same \nway, by interweaving classical recordings with the group's interpretation of the same music.<ref name=ucr/> Instead, the band (initially without the label's knowledge) decided to focus on an album based on an original stage show that they'd been working on, and mix that with classical arrangements of those songs.<ref name=ucr/><ref name=sos/> Keyboardist [[Mike Pinder]] had purchased a [[Mellotron]], a tape replay keyboard, and written a song, \"Dawn Is A Feeling\" as a starting point for a concept piece about a day in the life of everyday man. Hayward wrote \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\" about the changes between one relationship and another, using bedsheets as a metaphor. When Pinder added a string line on the Mellotron to accompany Hayward's basic song framework, the group realised they had written something notable and a suitable ending for the song cycle.<ref name=ucr/>\n\nRecording sessions for the album took place at [[Decca Studios]] in [[West Hampstead]], London between 9 May and 3 November 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7680710&style=music&fulldesc=T|title=Moody Blues - Days of Future Passed CD Album|publisher=[[CD Universe]].

The flute interlude is also played twice towards the end of the song before the orchestral segue.\n* The orchestral intro \"Lunch Break\" goes on about 15 seconds longer before fading out.\n* The bridges to \"(Evening) Time to Get Away\" have John Lodge singing alone; all the backing vocals on that part have been lost.\n* The end of \"(Evening) Time to Get Away\" is missing a Mellotron part and only repeats twice, instead of three times.\n* \"The Sun Set\" is missing some piano parts, percussion parts, and the reverb on \"through the night\" is different.\n* \"Twilight Time\" begins more abruptly after the orchestral interlude.\n* The backing vocals on \"Twilight Time\" are heard through the entire song instead of only coming in at certain points.\n* At the beginning of \"Nights in White Satin\", as the orchestral prelude ends, there is one less beat of time before the rhythm section starts in.\n* Some of the strings near the end of \"Nights in White Satin\" (before \"Late Lament\") are out of sync with the main body of the song.\n\n== Release ==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |last=Eder |first=Bruce |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r13367|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Days of Future Passed > Overview ))) |publisher=[[AllMusic]].

Their parent label, [[Decca Records]] offered them a chance to record a [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] LP that combined their music with orchestral interludes. They decided to compose a suite of songs about the life of everyday man, with the group and orchestra mostly playing separately and mixed together. It was a moderate success upon release, but following steady radio airplay, particularly of the hit single \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\", it became a top ten US hit in 1972. It has since been listed among the most important albums of 1967 by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.\n\n== Background and recording ==\nThe Moody Blues had started out as a [[rhythm and blues]] band, but by late 1966, they had run into financial difficulties. New arrival singer and guitarist [[Justin Hayward]] said \"we had no money, nothing\".<ref name=ucr>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/moody-blues-days-of-future-passed-album/|title=50 Years Ago: Moody Blues Broke Rules|work=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> According to the group, in September 1967 they were asked by their record company, [[Decca Records|Decca]] to record an adaptation of [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|Symphony No. 9]]'' for Decca's newly formed [[Deram Records]] division in order to demonstrate their latest recording techniques, which were named \"Deramic Sound\".<ref name=\"RS67\"/> However, [[recording engineer]] Derek Varnals disputes this story, claiming that even at the start of the sessions in 1967 there was no intent to record a Dvo\u0159\u00e1k album and that talk of this project did not emerge until the mid-1970s.<ref name=sos>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul09/articles/classictracks_0709.htm |title=Sound On Sound (Classic Tracks: The Moody Blues \"Nights In White Satin\") |publisher=soundonsound.com |accessdate=17 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nDecca had experimented with [[stereophonic sound]] for classical recordings, and hoped to capture the pop market in the same \nway, by interweaving classical recordings with the group's interpretation of the same music.<ref name=ucr/> Instead, the band (initially without the label's knowledge) decided to focus on an album based on an original stage show that they'd been working on, and mix that with classical arrangements of those songs.<ref name=ucr/><ref name=sos/> Keyboardist [[Mike Pinder]] had purchased a [[Mellotron]], a tape replay keyboard, and written a song, \"Dawn Is A Feeling\" as a starting point for a concept piece about a day in the life of everyday man. Hayward wrote \"[[Nights in White Satin]]\" about the changes between one relationship and another, using bedsheets as a metaphor. When Pinder added a string line on the Mellotron to accompany Hayward's basic song framework, the group realised they had written something notable and a suitable ending for the song cycle.<ref name=ucr/>\n\nRecording sessions for the album took place at [[Decca Studios]] in [[West Hampstead]], London between 9 May and 3 November 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7680710&style=music&fulldesc=T|title=Moody Blues - Days of Future Passed CD Album|publisher=[[CD Universe]].

The flute interlude is also played twice towards the end of the song before the orchestral segue.\n* The orchestral intro \"Lunch Break\" goes on about 15 seconds longer before fading out.\n* The bridges to \"(Evening) Time to Get Away\" have John Lodge singing alone; all the backing vocals on that part have been lost.\n* The end of \"(Evening) Time to Get Away\" is missing a Mellotron part and only repeats twice, instead of three times.\n* \"The Sun Set\" is missing some piano parts, percussion parts, and the reverb on \"through the night\" is different.\n* \"Twilight Time\" begins more abruptly after the orchestral interlude.\n* The backing vocals on \"Twilight Time\" are heard through the entire song instead of only coming in at certain points.\n* At the beginning of \"Nights in White Satin\", as the orchestral prelude ends, there is one less beat of time before the rhythm section starts in.\n* Some of the strings near the end of \"Nights in White Satin\" (before \"Late Lament\") are out of sync with the main body of the song.\n\n== Release ==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |last=Eder |first=Bruce |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r13367|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Days of Future Passed > Overview ))) |publisher=[[AllMusic]].

Werribee recorded a population of 40,345 at the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 Census]].\n\nWerribee is situated on the [[Werribee River]], approximately halfway between Melbourne and [[Geelong]], on the [[Princes Highway]].

Due to this urban sprawl Wyndham and its suburbs have merged into the Melbourne conurbation.\n\nIt was established as an agricultural settlement in the 1850s, originally named Wyndham and was renamed Werribee (derived from the Aboriginal name meaning \"backbone\" or \"spine\") in 1904.\n\nThe suburb is best known for its major tourist attractions, which include the former estate of wealthy pastoralist [[Thomas Chirnside]], known as [[Werribee Park]], the [[Victoria State Rose Garden]], the [[Werribee Park National Equestrian Centre]] and the [[Werribee Open Range Zoo]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Werribee River Spring 2017 - where pasture meets suburban sprawl.jpg|thumb|left|Werribee River, near Riverbend Historic Park]] \nThe name \"Werribee\" originated from the [[Victorian Aboriginal]] name for the [[Werribee River]], ''Wirribi-yaluk'' in [[Wathawurrung language|Wathawurrung]] and [[Bunwurrung language|Boonwurrung]], ''wirribi'' meaning \"backbone\" or \"spine\".<ref name=\"VICNAMES\">{{cite web|url=https://services.land.vic.gov.au/vicnames/historicalInformation.html?method=edit&id=5711|title=Historical Information: Werribee River|last1=Clark|first1=Ian|author-link1=Ian D.

A rural township began in the early 1850s. This village was named Wyndham (the name of the local Municipality today). The name derived from a suggestion by the owner of a local village inn, Elliott Armstrong, who sought to honour Scottish soldier Sir [[Henry Wyndham (British Army officer)|Henry Wyndham]]. The Post Office opened on 12 January 1858 as Wyndham and was renamed Werribee in 1904.<ref name=\"a\">{{Citation | last = Premier Postal History | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&country= | accessdate = 11 April 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080510053152/http://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&country= | archive-date = 10 May 2008 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> However, its adjacent river was called the Werribee River, and the town's name was later changed to Werribee in 1884, and the Shire Council at that time was also renamed Werribee in 1909.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM01598b.htm|title=Werribee - Place - eMelbourne - The Encyclopedia of Melbourne Online|last=School of Historical Studies|first=Department of History|website=www.emelbourne.net.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref>\n\nWerribee at this time was very popular for development. Thomas Chirnside, a person famous in this area even today, was attracted to the open plain's suitability for agricultural uses. By 1863 he controlled more than 280 square kilometres around Werribee. Chirnside bought other smaller holdings of land at this time. The town grew steadily, helped by a [[Werribee railway line|railway line]] from Melbourne to Geelong, with a [[Werribee railway station|station]] at Werribee in 1857.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Shire was huge, extending from the inner suburbs of [[Melbourne]] to [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] to the northward town of [[Melton, Victoria|Melton]] and covering 715 square kilometres.\n\nThomas Chirnside committed suicide in 1887. He was found dead in the laundry at Werribee Park with a shotgun lying beside him. His brother Andrew died three years later, and the property was now divided between Andrew's two sons. A new mansion was built, called \"The Manor\" (not in the same place as the current suburb of [[Manor Lakes, Victoria|Manor Lakes]]).\n\n[[File:Aerial perspective of the K Road cliffs along the Werribee River.jpg|thumb|Aerial perspective of the K Road cliffs along the Werribee River]]\n\nIn 1881 a quarter of the Shire's population lived in the Werribee Township. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}} There were hotels there, as well as recreational venues such as the Werribee Racecourse (built in 1879) as well as the [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics' Institute]] (built in 1883).\n\nFrom 1923 to 1973, Chirnside's property was the site of [[Corpus Christi College, Melbourne|Corpus Christi College]], the seminary of the Catholic Church for Victoria and Tasmania.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.corpuschristicollege.org.au/werribee |title=Corpus Christi College: The Werribee years |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=April 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Neighbouring suburbs==\n\nWerribee's [[central business district]] is located along Watton Street; the [[civic centre]] ([[Local government in Australia|council chambers]]) being just 500 metres away also makes it the administrative centre of the [[City of Wyndham]].

Ballan Road is the major arterial to Wyndham's north-west.\n\nThe [[Central business district|CBD]] also links with the [[Princes Freeway]] via Duncans Road to the south-east, and via Geelong Road (the continuation of the [[Princes Highway]]) to the south west.  The Princes Freeway circumvents the township via a section, known as the Maltby Bypass, which opened in June 1961.<ref>[http://www.street-directory.com.au/vic/melbourne Melbourne, VIC \u2013 Map of Melbourne, VIC, 3004 \u2013 Melway, Sydway, Brisway, Ausway, Street Smart].

Due to this urban sprawl Wyndham and its suburbs have merged into the Melbourne conurbation.\n\nIt was established as an agricultural settlement in the 1850s, originally named Wyndham and was renamed Werribee (derived from the Aboriginal name meaning \"backbone\" or \"spine\") in 1904.\n\nThe suburb is best known for its major tourist attractions, which include the former estate of wealthy pastoralist [[Thomas Chirnside]], known as [[Werribee Park]], the [[Victoria State Rose Garden]], the [[Werribee Park National Equestrian Centre]] and the [[Werribee Open Range Zoo]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Werribee River Spring 2017 - where pasture meets suburban sprawl.jpg|thumb|left|Werribee River, near Riverbend Historic Park]] \nThe name \"Werribee\" originated from the [[Victorian Aboriginal]] name for the [[Werribee River]], ''Wirribi-yaluk'' in [[Wathawurrung language|Wathawurrung]] and [[Bunwurrung language|Boonwurrung]], ''wirribi'' meaning \"backbone\" or \"spine\".<ref name=\"VICNAMES\">{{cite web|url=https://services.land.vic.gov.au/vicnames/historicalInformation.html?method=edit&id=5711|title=Historical Information: Werribee River|last1=Clark|first1=Ian|author-link1=Ian D.

A rural township began in the early 1850s. This village was named Wyndham (the name of the local Municipality today). The name derived from a suggestion by the owner of a local village inn, Elliott Armstrong, who sought to honour Scottish soldier Sir [[Henry Wyndham (British Army officer)|Henry Wyndham]].

Thomas Chirnside, a person famous in this area even today, was attracted to the open plain's suitability for agricultural uses. By 1863 he controlled more than 280 square kilometres around Werribee. Chirnside bought other smaller holdings of land at this time. The town grew steadily, helped by a [[Werribee railway line|railway line]] from Melbourne to Geelong, with a [[Werribee railway station|station]] at Werribee in 1857.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Shire was huge, extending from the inner suburbs of [[Melbourne]] to [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] to the northward town of [[Melton, Victoria|Melton]] and covering 715 square kilometres.\n\nThomas Chirnside committed suicide in 1887. He was found dead in the laundry at Werribee Park with a shotgun lying beside him. His brother Andrew died three years later, and the property was now divided between Andrew's two sons. A new mansion was built, called \"The Manor\" (not in the same place as the current suburb of [[Manor Lakes, Victoria|Manor Lakes]]).\n\n[[File:Aerial perspective of the K Road cliffs along the Werribee River.jpg|thumb|Aerial perspective of the K Road cliffs along the Werribee River]]\n\nIn 1881 a quarter of the Shire's population lived in the Werribee Township. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}} There were hotels there, as well as recreational venues such as the Werribee Racecourse (built in 1879) as well as the [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics' Institute]] (built in 1883).\n\nFrom 1923 to 1973, Chirnside's property was the site of [[Corpus Christi College, Melbourne|Corpus Christi College]], the seminary of the Catholic Church for Victoria and Tasmania.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.corpuschristicollege.org.au/werribee |title=Corpus Christi College: The Werribee years |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=April 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Neighbouring suburbs==\n\nWerribee's [[central business district]] is located along Watton Street; the [[civic centre]] ([[Local government in Australia|council chambers]]) being just 500 metres away also makes it the administrative centre of the [[City of Wyndham]].

On the surface of a topological insulator there are special states that fall within the bulk energy gap and allow surface metallic conduction. Carriers in these surface states have their [[Spin quantum number|spin]] locked at a right-angle to their momentum (spin-momentum locking). At a given energy the only other available electronic states have different spin, so the [[Umklapp scattering|\"U\"-turn scattering]] is strongly suppressed and conduction on the surface is highly metallic. Non-interacting topological insulators are characterized by an index (known as <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math> topological invariants) similar to the [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] in topology.<ref name=KM/>\n\nAs long as time-reversal symmetry is preserved (i.e., there is no magnetism), the <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math> index cannot change by small perturbations and the conducting states at the surface are symmetry-protected. On the other hand, in the presence of magnetic impurities, the surface states will generically become insulating. Nevertheless, if certain crystalline symmetries like inversion are present, the <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math> index is still well defined. These materials are known as [[magnetic topological insulators]] and their insulating surfaces exhibit a half-quantized surface [[Hall effect|anomalous Hall conductivity]].\n\n[[Photonic topological insulator]]s are the classical-wave electromagnetic counterparts of (electronic) topological insulators, that provide unidirectional propagation of electromagnetic waves.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lu |first1=Ling |last2=Joannopoulos |first2=John D. |last3=Solja\u010di\u0107 |first3=Marin |title=Topological photonics |journal=Nature Photonics |date=November 2014 |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=821\u2013829 |doi=10.1038/nphoton.2014.248 |language=en |issn=1749-4893|arxiv=1408.6730 }}</ref>\n\n==Prediction==\nTime-reversal symmetry-protected two-dimensional edge states were predicted in 1987 by Oleg Pankratov<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/0038-1098(87)90934-3 | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 93\u201396 | date=January 1987 | first1 = O.A. | last1 = Pankratov | first2 = S.V. | last2 = Pakhomov | first3 = B.A. | last3 = Volkov | title = Supersymmetry in heterojunctions: Band-inverting contact on the basis of Pb1-xSnxTe and Hg1-xCdxTe | journal = Solid State Communications |bibcode = 1987SSCom..61...93P }}</ref> to occur in [[quantum well]]s (very thin layers) of [[mercury telluride]] sandwiched between [[cadmium telluride]], and were observed in 2007.<ref name=Konig>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1148047 | volume = 318 | issue = 5851 | pages = 766\u2013770 | pmid = 17885096 | first1 = Markus | last1 = K\u00f6nig | first2 = Steffen | last2 = Wiedmann | first3 = Christoph | last3 = Br\u00fcne | first4 = Andreas | last4 = Roth | first5 = Hartmut | last5 = Buhmann | first6 = Laurens W. | last6 = Molenkamp | first7 = Xiao-Liang | last7 = Qi | first8 = Shou-Cheng | last8 = Zhang | title = Quantum Spin Hall Insulator State in HgTe Quantum Wells | journal = Science | date = 2007-11-02 |arxiv = 0710.0582 |bibcode = 2007Sci...318..766K }}</ref> It was discovered that electrons that are confined to two dimensions and subject to strong magnetic field show a different topological ordering, which underlies the quantum Hall effect.<ref name=\":0\" /> The effect of this topological ordering results in the emergence of particles with fractional charges and non-[[dissipation]] transport.

MBE has an advantage over other methods due to the fact that the synthesis is performed in high vacuum hence resulting in less contamination.

On the surface of a topological insulator there are special states that fall within the bulk energy gap and allow surface metallic conduction. Carriers in these surface states have their [[Spin quantum number|spin]] locked at a right-angle to their momentum (spin-momentum locking). At a given energy the only other available electronic states have different spin, so the [[Umklapp scattering|\"U\"-turn scattering]] is strongly suppressed and conduction on the surface is highly metallic. Non-interacting topological insulators are characterized by an index (known as <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math> topological invariants) similar to the [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] in topology.<ref name=KM/>\n\nAs long as time-reversal symmetry is preserved (i.e., there is no magnetism), the <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math> index cannot change by small perturbations and the conducting states at the surface are symmetry-protected. On the other hand, in the presence of magnetic impurities, the surface states will generically become insulating. Nevertheless, if certain crystalline symmetries like inversion are present, the <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math> index is still well defined. These materials are known as [[magnetic topological insulators]] and their insulating surfaces exhibit a half-quantized surface [[Hall effect|anomalous Hall conductivity]].\n\n[[Photonic topological insulator]]s are the classical-wave electromagnetic counterparts of (electronic) topological insulators, that provide unidirectional propagation of electromagnetic waves.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lu |first1=Ling |last2=Joannopoulos |first2=John D. |last3=Solja\u010di\u0107 |first3=Marin |title=Topological photonics |journal=Nature Photonics |date=November 2014 |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=821\u2013829 |doi=10.1038/nphoton.2014.248 |language=en |issn=1749-4893|arxiv=1408.6730 }}</ref>\n\n==Prediction==\nTime-reversal symmetry-protected two-dimensional edge states were predicted in 1987 by Oleg Pankratov<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/0038-1098(87)90934-3 | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 93\u201396 | date=January 1987 | first1 = O.A. | last1 = Pankratov | first2 = S.V. | last2 = Pakhomov | first3 = B.A. | last3 = Volkov | title = Supersymmetry in heterojunctions: Band-inverting contact on the basis of Pb1-xSnxTe and Hg1-xCdxTe | journal = Solid State Communications |bibcode = 1987SSCom..61...93P }}</ref> to occur in [[quantum well]]s (very thin layers) of [[mercury telluride]] sandwiched between [[cadmium telluride]], and were observed in 2007.<ref name=Konig>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1148047 | volume = 318 | issue = 5851 | pages = 766\u2013770 | pmid = 17885096 | first1 = Markus | last1 = K\u00f6nig | first2 = Steffen | last2 = Wiedmann | first3 = Christoph | last3 = Br\u00fcne | first4 = Andreas | last4 = Roth | first5 = Hartmut | last5 = Buhmann | first6 = Laurens W. | last6 = Molenkamp | first7 = Xiao-Liang | last7 = Qi | first8 = Shou-Cheng | last8 = Zhang | title = Quantum Spin Hall Insulator State in HgTe Quantum Wells | journal = Science | date = 2007-11-02 |arxiv = 0710.0582 |bibcode = 2007Sci...318..766K }}</ref> It was discovered that electrons that are confined to two dimensions and subject to strong magnetic field show a different topological ordering, which underlies the quantum Hall effect.<ref name=\":0\" /> The effect of this topological ordering results in the emergence of particles with fractional charges and non-[[dissipation]] transport.
