A second ''First Life'' or ''Vita Prima'' of St Brigid is by an unknown author, although it is often attributed to St [[Brocc\u00e1n Cl\u00f3en]] (d. 650). This book is occasionally argued to be the first written Life of St. Brigid, although most scholars reject this claim. The ''Life'' attributed to Coelan dating ca. 625, derives further significance from the fact that a foreword was later added to it by St [[Donatus of Fiesole|Donatus]], also an Irish monk, who became Bishop of Fiesole in 824. Donatus refers to earlier biographies by [[Saint Ultan|St Ultan]] and [[Ailer\u00e1n|St Ailer\u00e1n]]. These differing biographies, giving conflicting accounts of her life, have much literary merit in themselves.<ref name=catholic/>\n\nIn the controversy about the historical existence of Brigid that erupted in the last third of the 20th century, researchers noted that eleven people with whom Brigid is associated in her ''Lives'' are independently attested in annalistic sources which place her death at AD 523 (in the ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' and ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'') and her birth at 451 (calculated from her reputed age of 72 at death).<ref>\nDiscussion on dates for the annals and the accuracy of dates relating to St Brigid continues, see AP Smyth, \"The earliest Irish Annals: their first contemporary entries and the earliest centres of recording\", ''Proceedings of the [[Royal Irish Academy]]'' lxxii C (1972), pp1\u201348 Daniel McCarthy: ''The chronology of St Brigit of Kildare'', in ''Peritia'', xiv (2000), pp255\u201381.</ref>\n\n===Early life===\nAccording to tradition, Brigid was born in the year 451 AD in [[Faughart]],<ref name=Joyce/> just north of [[Dundalk]]<ref name=\"Story of St. Brigid\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stbrigid.ie/story-of-st-brigid.html|title=Story of St. Brigid|work=St. Brigid's GNS, Glasnevin}}</ref><ref name=\"irishcatholic.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://irishcatholic.ie/article/following-brigid%E2%80%99s-way|title=Following Brigid\u2019s Way \u2013 The Irish Catholic|publisher=}}</ref> in [[County Louth]], [[Ireland]]. Because of the legendary quality of the earliest accounts of her life, there is debate among many secular scholars and Christians as to the authenticity of her biographies. Three biographies agree that her mother was Brocca, a Christian [[Picts|Pict]] slave who had been baptized by [[Saint Patrick]]. They name her father as Dubhthach, a chieftain of [[Leinster]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T201002/index.html|title=Bethu Brigte|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe ''vitae'' say that Dubthach's wife forced him to sell Brigid's mother to a druid when she became pregnant. Brigid herself was born into slavery. Legends of her early holiness include her vomiting when the druid tried to feed her, due to his impurity; a white cow with red ears appeared to sustain her instead.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nAs she grew older, Brigid performed miracles, including healing and feeding the poor. According to one tale, as a child, she once gave away her mother's entire store of butter. The butter was then replenished in answer to Brigid's prayers.<ref>Wallace, Martin. ''A Little Book of Celtic Saints''. Belfast. Appletree Press, 1995 {{ISBN|0-86281-456-1}}, p.13</ref> Around the age of ten, she was returned as a household servant to her father, where her habit of charity led her to donate his belongings to anyone who asked.\n\nIn two ''Lives'', Dubthach was so annoyed with her that he took her in a chariot to [[Crimthann mac \u00c9nnai|the King of Leinster]] to sell her. While Dubthach was talking to the king, Brigid gave away his jewelled sword to a beggar to barter it for food to feed his family. The king recognized her holiness and convinced Dubthach to grant his daughter her freedom.<ref name=Bitel>{{cite web|url=http://monasticmatrix.osu.edu/commentaria/st-brigit-ireland#_ftn1|title=St Brigit of Ireland \u2013 Monastic Matrix|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Religious life===\n[[File:Saint Non's Chapel - Fenster 3 St.Bride.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint Brigid as depicted in Saint Non's chapel, [[St Davids]], Wales.]]\nIt is said that Brigid was \"veiled\" or received either by St Mac Caill, Bishop of Cruachu Brig Ele ([[Croghan, County Offaly|Croghan]], [[County Offaly]]),<ref>[[John O'Donovan (scholar)|O'Donovan, J.]], ''Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland'', Vol 5 (Dublin: Hodges, Smith, and Co., 1856), p. 1249.</ref> or by St [[M\u00e9l of Ardagh]] at M\u00e1g Tulach (the present barony of [[Tyrrellspass|Fartullagh, County Westmeath]]), who granted her abbatial powers. It is said that in about 468, she and a [[Croghan_Hill#Historical_associations|Bishop MacCaille]] followed St M\u00e9l into the Kingdom of [[Tethbae]], which was made up of parts of the modern counties [[County Meath|Meath]], [[County Westmeath|Westmeath]] and [[County Longford|Longford]].\n\nAccording to tradition, around 480 Brigid founded a monastery at [[Kildare]] (''Cill Dara'': \"church of the oak\"), on the site of a pagan shrine to the Celtic goddess Brigid, served by a group of young women who tended an [[eternal flame]]. The site was under a large oak tree on the ridge of Drum Criadh.<ref name=Kildare>{{cite web|url=http://kildarelocalhistory.ie/kildare/history-of-kildare-town/|title=History of Kildare Town|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBrigid, with an initial group of seven companions, is credited with organizing communal consecrated religious life for women in Ireland.<ref name=cna>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=134ST.|title=ST. BRIGID OF IRELAND :: Catholic News Agency (CNA)|work=Catholic News Agency}}</ref> She founded two monastic institutions, one for men, and the other for women, and invited [[Conleth]] (Conl\u00e1ed), a hermit from Old Connell near Newbridge, to help her in Kildare as pastor of them. It has often been said that she gave canonical jurisdiction to Conleth, [[Bishop of Kildare]], but Archbishop Healy says that she simply \"selected the person to whom the Church gave this jurisdiction\", and her biographer tells us that she chose Saint Conleth \"to govern the church along with herself\". For centuries, Kildare was ruled by a double line of abbot-bishops and of abbesses, the Abbess of Kildare being regarded as [[superior general]] of the monasteries in Ireland.<ref name=catholic/> Her successors have always been accorded episcopal honour.<ref>Edward Sellnor, ''Wisdom of the Celtic Saints'' (Ave Maria Press, 1993)</ref> Brigid's oratory at Kildare became a centre of religion and learning, and developed into a cathedral city.<ref name=catholic/>\n\nBrigid is credited with founding a school of art, including metalwork and illumination, which Conleth oversaw. The Kildare scriptorium made the [[Book of Kildare]], which drew high praise from [[Gerald of Wales]] (Giraldus Cambrensis), but disappeared during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. According to Giraldus, nothing that he ever saw was at all comparable to the book, every page of which was gorgeously illuminated, and the interlaced work and the harmony of the colours left the impression that \"all this is the work of angelic, and not human skill\".<ref name=catholic/>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Trias Thaumaturga]]'' Brigid spent time in Connacht and founded many churches in the Diocese of Elphin. She is said to have visited Longford, Tipperary, Limerick, and South Leinster.<ref name=Joyce/> Her friendship with Saint Patrick is noted in the following paragraph from the [[Book of Armagh]]: ''\"inter sanctum Patricium Brigitanque Hibernesium columpnas amicitia caritatis inerat tanta, ut unum cor consiliumque haberent unum. Christus per illum illamque virtutes multas peregit\"'' (''Between St Patrick and St Brigid, the pillars of the Irish people, there was so great a friendship of charity that they had but one heart and one mind. Through him and through her Christ performed many great works.'')<ref name=catholic/>\n\n===Death===\nThe monk [[Ultan of Ardbraccan]], who wrote a life of Brigid, recounts a story that [[Dar Lugdach|Darlugdach]], Brigid's favourite pupil, fell in love with a young man and, hoping to meet him, sneaked out of the bed in which she and Brigid were sleeping. However, recognising her spiritual peril, she prayed for guidance, then placed burning embers in her shoes and put them on. \u201cThus, by fire,\u201dUltan wrote, \u201cshe put out fire, and by pain extinguished pain.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |title=Darlugdach |journal=Dictionary of National Biography |date=1888 |volume=14 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSwJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=she+put+out+fire,+and+by+pain+extinguished+pain.&source=bl&ots=-p4oWc4v9p&sig=ACfU3U162RWPDufxStWArN2kvJf1DdDnSA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3ku6j4fbfAhXii60KHQ_lAzcQ6AEwC3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=she%20put%20out%20fire%2C%20and%20by%20pain%20extinguished%20pain.&f=false |accessdate=18 January 2019}}</ref> She then returned to bed. Brigid feigned sleep, but was aware of Darlugdach's departure. The next day, Darlugdach revealed to Brigid the experience of the night before. Brigid reassured her that she was \u201cnow safe from the fire of passion and the fire of hell hereafter\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |title=Darlugdach}}</ref> and then healed her student's feet. So devoted was the student to her teacher that when Brigid lay dying Darlugdach expressed the wish to die with her, but Brigid replied that Darlugdach should die on the anniversary of her (Brigid's) death.\n\nSt Brigid is said to have been given the [[last rites]] by St Ninnidh when she was dying. Afterwards, he reportedly had his right hand encased in metal so that it would never be defiled, and became known as \"Ninnidh of the Clean Hand\".<ref name=catholic/> Tradition says she died at Kildare on 1 February 525.<ref name=sisters>[http://www.brigidine.org.au/about-us/index.cfm?loadref=13 ''Our Patroness'', Brigidine Sisters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202194641/http://www.brigidine.org.au/about-us/index.cfm?loadref=13 |date=2 February 2015 }}</ref>\n\nUpon St Brigid's death, Darlugdach became the second abbess of Kildare. Brigid's prediction has traditionally been considered to have been realized inasmuch as the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church]] records Darlugdach's date of death as 522 and Brigid's as 521 and has assigned 1 February as the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of both saints.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Olden|editor-first1=Thomas|title=Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Vol. 14|date=1885\u20131900|publisher=Smith & Elder|location=London|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Darlugdach_(DNB00)|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> (The name Darlugdach (also spelled Dar Lugdach, Dar Lugdacha, or Dar Lughdacha) means \"daughter of the god [[Lugh]]\".)<ref>Wright, p.41</ref>\n\n==Miracles associated with Brigid==\nBrigid is celebrated for her generosity to the poor. In her case, most of the miracles associated with her relate to healing and household tasks usually attributed to women.\n\n*Brigid, who had a reputation as an expert dairywoman and brewer, was reputed to turn water into beer.<ref name=Bitel/> \n*The prayers of Saint Brigid were said to still the wind and the rain.<ref>[http://irishamerica.com/2018/01/wild-irish-women-saint-brigid-mary-of-the-gaels/ Rogers, Rosemary. \"Wild Irish Women: Saint Brigid\u2014Mary of the Gaels\", ''Irish American'', February/March 2018]</ref> \n*When Brigid was of marital age, a man by the name of [[Dubthach maccu Lugair]] came to woo her. Since Brigid had offered her virginity to God, she told the man that she could not accept him but that he should go to the woods behind his house where he would find a beautiful maiden to marry. Everything that he said to the maiden's parents would be pleasing to them. The man followed her instructions and it was as she said.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n*In one story, Brigid protected a woman from a nobleman who had entrusted a silver brooch to the woman for safekeeping but then secretly had thrown it into the sea. He charged her with stealing it, knowing that he could take her as a slave if a judge ruled in his favour. The woman fled and sought refuge with Brigid's community. By chance, one of her fishermen hauled in a fish which, when cut open, proved to have swallowed the brooch. The nobleman freed the woman, confessed his sin, and bowed in submission to Brigid.<ref name=Bitel/> A similar story is told of [[Saint Mungo]].\n*On an occasion when Brigid was travelling to see a doctor for a headache, she stayed at the house of a Leinster couple who had two mute daughters. The daughters were travelling with Brigid when her horse startled, causing her to fall and graze her head on a stone. A touch of Brigid's blood healed the girls of their muteness.<ref name=Bitel/>\n*When on the bank of the [[River Inny, Westmeath|River Inny]], Brigid was given a gift of apples and sweet sloes. She later entered a house where many lepers begged her for these apples, which she offered willingly. The woman who had given the gift to Brigid was angered by this, saying that she had not given the gift to the lepers. Brigid was angry at the nun for withholding from the lepers and cursed her trees so they would no longer bear fruit.  Yet another woman also gave Brigid the same gift, and again Brigid gave them to begging lepers. This woman asked that she and her garden be blessed. Brigid then said that a large tree in the virgin's garden would have twofold fruit from its offshoots, and this was done.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n*One of the more commonly told stories is of Brigid asking the King of Leinster for land. She told the king that the place where she stood was the perfect spot for a convent. It was beside a forest where the members could collect firewood and berries, there was a lake nearby that would provide water and the land was fertile. The king laughed at her and refused to give her any land. Brigid prayed and asked God to soften the king's heart. Then she smiled at the king and said, \"Will you give me as much land as my cloak will cover?\" The king thought that she was joking and agreed. She told four of her sisters to take up the cloak, but instead of laying it flat on the turf, each sister, with face turned to a different point of the compass, began to run swiftly, the cloth growing in all directions. The cloak began to cover many acres of land. \"Oh, Brigid!\" said the frighted king, \"what are you about?\" \"I am, or rather my cloak is about covering your whole province to punish you for your stinginess to the poor.\" \"Call your maidens back. I will give you a decent plot of ground.\" The saint was persuaded, and if the king held his purse-strings tight in future, she had only to allude to her cloak to bring him to reason. Soon afterwards, the king became a Christian, began to help the poor and commissioned the building of the convent. Legend has it, the convent was known for making jam from the local blueberries which was sought for all over Ireland. A new tradition is to eat jam on 1 February in honour of this miracle.<ref>[http://www.stbrigid.ie/content/story-st-brigid Story of St. Brigid, November 14, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127102537/http://www.stbrigid.ie/content/story-st-brigid |date=27 January 2013 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.libraryireland.com/LegendaryFictionsIrishCelts/V-12-1.php/ Kennedy, Patrick.

When she was outside carrying a load past a group of poor people, some began to laugh at her. A man named Bacene said to her, \"The beautiful eye which is in your head will be betrothed to a man though you like it or not.\" In response, Brigid thrust her finger in her eye and said, \"Here is that beautiful eye for you. I deem it unlikely that anyone will ask you for a blind girl.\" Her brothers tried to save her and wash away the blood from her wound, but there was no water to be found. Brigid said to them, \"Put my staff about this sod in front of you\", and after they did, a stream came forth from the ground. Then she said to Bacene, \"Soon your two eyes will burst in your head\", and it happened as she said.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n*She is associated with the preservation of a nun's chastity in unusual circumstances.

A second ''First Life'' or ''Vita Prima'' of St Brigid is by an unknown author, although it is often attributed to St [[Brocc\u00e1n Cl\u00f3en]] (d. 650). This book is occasionally argued to be the first written Life of St. Brigid, although most scholars reject this claim. The ''Life'' attributed to Coelan dating ca. 625, derives further significance from the fact that a foreword was later added to it by St [[Donatus of Fiesole|Donatus]], also an Irish monk, who became Bishop of Fiesole in 824. Donatus refers to earlier biographies by [[Saint Ultan|St Ultan]] and [[Ailer\u00e1n|St Ailer\u00e1n]]. These differing biographies, giving conflicting accounts of her life, have much literary merit in themselves.<ref name=catholic/>\n\nIn the controversy about the historical existence of Brigid that erupted in the last third of the 20th century, researchers noted that eleven people with whom Brigid is associated in her ''Lives'' are independently attested in annalistic sources which place her death at AD 523 (in the ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' and ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'') and her birth at 451 (calculated from her reputed age of 72 at death).<ref>\nDiscussion on dates for the annals and the accuracy of dates relating to St Brigid continues, see AP Smyth, \"The earliest Irish Annals: their first contemporary entries and the earliest centres of recording\", ''Proceedings of the [[Royal Irish Academy]]'' lxxii C (1972), pp1\u201348 Daniel McCarthy: ''The chronology of St Brigit of Kildare'', in ''Peritia'', xiv (2000), pp255\u201381.</ref>\n\n===Early life===\nAccording to tradition, Brigid was born in the year 451 AD in [[Faughart]],<ref name=Joyce/> just north of [[Dundalk]]<ref name=\"Story of St. Brigid\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stbrigid.ie/story-of-st-brigid.html|title=Story of St. Brigid|work=St. Brigid's GNS, Glasnevin}}</ref><ref name=\"irishcatholic.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://irishcatholic.ie/article/following-brigid%E2%80%99s-way|title=Following Brigid\u2019s Way \u2013 The Irish Catholic|publisher=}}</ref> in [[County Louth]], [[Ireland]]. Because of the legendary quality of the earliest accounts of her life, there is debate among many secular scholars and Christians as to the authenticity of her biographies.

Brigid herself was born into slavery. Legends of her early holiness include her vomiting when the druid tried to feed her, due to his impurity; a white cow with red ears appeared to sustain her instead.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nAs she grew older, Brigid performed miracles, including healing and feeding the poor. According to one tale, as a child, she once gave away her mother's entire store of butter. The butter was then replenished in answer to Brigid's prayers.<ref>Wallace, Martin.

However, recognising her spiritual peril, she prayed for guidance, then placed burning embers in her shoes and put them on. \u201cThus, by fire,\u201dUltan wrote, \u201cshe put out fire, and by pain extinguished pain.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |title=Darlugdach |journal=Dictionary of National Biography |date=1888 |volume=14 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSwJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=she+put+out+fire,+and+by+pain+extinguished+pain.&source=bl&ots=-p4oWc4v9p&sig=ACfU3U162RWPDufxStWArN2kvJf1DdDnSA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3ku6j4fbfAhXii60KHQ_lAzcQ6AEwC3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=she%20put%20out%20fire%2C%20and%20by%20pain%20extinguished%20pain.&f=false |accessdate=18 January 2019}}</ref> She then returned to bed. Brigid feigned sleep, but was aware of Darlugdach's departure. The next day, Darlugdach revealed to Brigid the experience of the night before. Brigid reassured her that she was \u201cnow safe from the fire of passion and the fire of hell hereafter\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |title=Darlugdach}}</ref> and then healed her student's feet. So devoted was the student to her teacher that when Brigid lay dying Darlugdach expressed the wish to die with her, but Brigid replied that Darlugdach should die on the anniversary of her (Brigid's) death.\n\nSt Brigid is said to have been given the [[last rites]] by St Ninnidh when she was dying. Afterwards, he reportedly had his right hand encased in metal so that it would never be defiled, and became known as \"Ninnidh of the Clean Hand\".<ref name=catholic/> Tradition says she died at Kildare on 1 February 525.<ref name=sisters>[http://www.brigidine.org.au/about-us/index.cfm?loadref=13 ''Our Patroness'', Brigidine Sisters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202194641/http://www.brigidine.org.au/about-us/index.cfm?loadref=13 |date=2 February 2015 }}</ref>\n\nUpon St Brigid's death, Darlugdach became the second abbess of Kildare.

In her case, most of the miracles associated with her relate to healing and household tasks usually attributed to women.\n\n*Brigid, who had a reputation as an expert dairywoman and brewer, was reputed to turn water into beer.<ref name=Bitel/> \n*The prayers of Saint Brigid were said to still the wind and the rain.<ref>[http://irishamerica.com/2018/01/wild-irish-women-saint-brigid-mary-of-the-gaels/ Rogers, Rosemary. \"Wild Irish Women: Saint Brigid\u2014Mary of the Gaels\", ''Irish American'', February/March 2018]</ref> \n*When Brigid was of marital age, a man by the name of [[Dubthach maccu Lugair]] came to woo her. Since Brigid had offered her virginity to God, she told the man that she could not accept him but that he should go to the woods behind his house where he would find a beautiful maiden to marry. Everything that he said to the maiden's parents would be pleasing to them. The man followed her instructions and it was as she said.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n*In one story, Brigid protected a woman from a nobleman who had entrusted a silver brooch to the woman for safekeeping but then secretly had thrown it into the sea. He charged her with stealing it, knowing that he could take her as a slave if a judge ruled in his favour. The woman fled and sought refuge with Brigid's community. By chance, one of her fishermen hauled in a fish which, when cut open, proved to have swallowed the brooch. The nobleman freed the woman, confessed his sin, and bowed in submission to Brigid.<ref name=Bitel/> A similar story is told of [[Saint Mungo]].\n*On an occasion when Brigid was travelling to see a doctor for a headache, she stayed at the house of a Leinster couple who had two mute daughters. The daughters were travelling with Brigid when her horse startled, causing her to fall and graze her head on a stone. A touch of Brigid's blood healed the girls of their muteness.<ref name=Bitel/>\n*When on the bank of the [[River Inny, Westmeath|River Inny]], Brigid was given a gift of apples and sweet sloes. She later entered a house where many lepers begged her for these apples, which she offered willingly. The woman who had given the gift to Brigid was angered by this, saying that she had not given the gift to the lepers. Brigid was angry at the nun for withholding from the lepers and cursed her trees so they would no longer bear fruit.  Yet another woman also gave Brigid the same gift, and again Brigid gave them to begging lepers. This woman asked that she and her garden be blessed. Brigid then said that a large tree in the virgin's garden would have twofold fruit from its offshoots, and this was done.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n*One of the more commonly told stories is of Brigid asking the King of Leinster for land. She told the king that the place where she stood was the perfect spot for a convent. It was beside a forest where the members could collect firewood and berries, there was a lake nearby that would provide water and the land was fertile. The king laughed at her and refused to give her any land. Brigid prayed and asked God to soften the king's heart. Then she smiled at the king and said, \"Will you give me as much land as my cloak will cover?\" The king thought that she was joking and agreed. She told four of her sisters to take up the cloak, but instead of laying it flat on the turf, each sister, with face turned to a different point of the compass, began to run swiftly, the cloth growing in all directions. The cloak began to cover many acres of land. \"Oh, Brigid!\" said the frighted king, \"what are you about?\" \"I am, or rather my cloak is about covering your whole province to punish you for your stinginess to the poor.\" \"Call your maidens back. I will give you a decent plot of ground.\" The saint was persuaded, and if the king held his purse-strings tight in future, she had only to allude to her cloak to bring him to reason. Soon afterwards, the king became a Christian, began to help the poor and commissioned the building of the convent. Legend has it, the convent was known for making jam from the local blueberries which was sought for all over Ireland. A new tradition is to eat jam on 1 February in honour of this miracle.<ref>[http://www.stbrigid.ie/content/story-st-brigid Story of St. Brigid, November 14, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127102537/http://www.stbrigid.ie/content/story-st-brigid |date=27 January 2013 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.libraryireland.com/LegendaryFictionsIrishCelts/V-12-1.php/ Kennedy, Patrick.

When she was outside carrying a load past a group of poor people, some began to laugh at her. A man named Bacene said to her, \"The beautiful eye which is in your head will be betrothed to a man though you like it or not.\" In response, Brigid thrust her finger in her eye and said, \"Here is that beautiful eye for you. I deem it unlikely that anyone will ask you for a blind girl.\" Her brothers tried to save her and wash away the blood from her wound, but there was no water to be found. Brigid said to them, \"Put my staff about this sod in front of you\", and after they did, a stream came forth from the ground. Then she said to Bacene, \"Soon your two eyes will burst in your head\", and it happened as she said.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n*She is associated with the preservation of a nun's chastity in unusual circumstances.

At Cologne I found great difficulty in securing a portion of this relic. It was at first peremptorily refused. The Pastor of St. Martin\u2019s declared that his parishioners would be at once in revolt if they heard that their great parochial treasure was being interfered with. I then had to invoke the aid of an influential Canon of the [[Cologne Cathedral|Cathedral of Cologne]], whom I had assisted in some of his literary pursuits and he set his heart on procuring the coveted relic. One of his arguments was somewhat amusing: It was the first time that an Irish Archbishop of the remote See of Sydney had solicited a favour from Cologne. It was the new Christian world appealing to the old for a share of its sacred wealth.

In her ''Lives'', Brigid is portrayed as having the power to multiply such things as butter, bacon and milk, to bestow sheep and cattle and to control the weather.\n\nPlant motifs associated with St Brigid include the white ''[[Lilium candidum]]'' popularly known since medieval times as the Madonna Lily for its association with the [[Virgin Mary]], and the Windflower ''[[Anemone coronaria]]'', called the \"Brigid anemone\"  since the early 19th century. Kildare, the church of the oak ''[[Quercus petraea]]'', is associated with a tree sacred to the [[Druid#Irish literature and law codes|druids]].

However, the woman who has the name Oh Hae-young (soil) ([[Seo Hyun-jin]]) was actually just a stranger who coincidentally has the same name with the other Oh Hae-young (gold) who left him.\n\nCoincidentally, Oh Hae-young (soil) is the girl that Do-kyung had been seeing lately in his visions, and he sees snapshots of the future with her in it.\n\nTae-jin was soon to be sent to jail due to bankruptcy, and hence before his imprisonment he meets fianc\u00e9e, Hae-young (soil), and tells her that he doesn't love her that much to marry her and wants to call off their wedding.

After sharing similar unfortunate experiences of being dumped before their weddings, the two of them got even closer. Will Do-kyung start to fall in love with Hae-young (soil)?

Thus, FHC's reelection campaign was based on the idea that the continuity of his government was essential for the stabilization to reach areas other than the economy, such as health, agriculture, employment, education, and [[public security]].<ref name=\"MAS\" />\n\n==Presidential election==\n\n=== Candidates ===\nThe 1998 presidential race had twelve candidates, the largest number of candidates since the [[1989 Brazilian presidential election|1989 election]], when over twenty candidacies were launched. The number could have been as high as fifteen, but the Electoral Justice withdrew the candidacy of impeached President Fernando Collor de Mello,<ref>[http://www.tse.jus.br/internet/jurisprudencia/julgados_historicos/1990/collor3.htm \"O Caso Collor - A tentativa de retorno\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609172849/http://www.tse.jus.br/internet/jurisprudencia/julgados_historicos/1990/collor3.htm |date=June 9, 2009 }}.

They were joined by the [[Progressive Party (Brazil)|Progressive Party]], the [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|Social Democratic Party]], and the [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)|Social Liberal Party]]. Once again, Liberal Front Party member [[Marco Maciel]] was FHC's running mate.\n\nThe [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] reprised its past two candidacies, by launching Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva as its candidate and forming a coalition with the [[Communist Party of Brazil]], and the [[Brazilian Socialist Party]]. The novelty in this election was the choice of [[Leonel Brizola]] from the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]] as his running mate. Prior to that, the Workers' Party refrained from forming coalitions with parties linked to ''[[Get\u00falio Vargas|varguista]]'' labour unions as a way of sustaining its union branch, the [[Central \u00danica dos Trabalhadores]], as independent. As a result, the [[United Socialist Workers' Party]] left the coalition and launched [[Jos\u00e9 Maria de Almeida]] as its candidate.\n\nFormer [[Cear\u00e1]] state Governor [[Ciro Gomes]] run for president, and, therefore, his [[Socialist People's Party (Brazil)|Socialist People's Party]] did not join the Workers' Party coalition as they did in the previous election. After Oswaldo Souza Oliveira's quit the race, his [[Party of the Nation's Retirees]] decided to support Gomes.\n\nAfter securing the third place in the 1994 election, [[En\u00e9as Carneiro]] from the [[far-right]] [[Party of the Reconstruction of the National Order]] also run in 1998. This time, however, he only received 1.4 million votes, against 4.6 million in 1994.\n\nThis election also brought the second woman candidate ever: Thereza Tinajero Ruiz from the [[Podemos (Brazil)|National Labor Party]], which replaced Dorival Masci de Abreu.<ref>LARANJEIRA, Leandro.

Shortly before these elections were held, the federal government was able to approve in the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] a constitutional amendment bill allowing the re-election of members of the [[Executive (government)|Executive branch of government]].

His margin over [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] candidate [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]] was of 21.3%, giving him a second [[landslide victory]]; it would be the last time the Workers' Party nominee was not elected President until [[2018 Brazilian general election|2018]], and is the last time to date a candidate for President has won an absolute majority in the first round. Lula da Silva received almost 32% of the votes. [[Ciro Gomes]], then a member of the [[Socialist People's Party (Brazil)|Socialist People's Party]] came in third, with almost 11% of the votes.\n\n==Historical context==\nFernando Henrique Cardoso, better known as FHC, had been inaugurated as President on January 1, 1995, after defeating Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, his main rival in the [[1994 Brazilian general election|1994 election]], in the [[two-round system|first round]] by an advantage of almost 30 million votes.<ref name=\"MAS\">MASON, Anthony.

[[Rio de Janeiro]]: Reader's Digest, 2004. {{ISBN|85-7645-016-X}}</ref> FHC had based his first presidential campaign in the then newly launched [[Real Plan]] and the promise of stabilizing the [[economy of Brazil]]. As a matter of fact, the plan had a positive effect during the first years of his administration, being able to curb the exorbitant [[inflation rate]]s, stabilize the exchange rate, and increase the [[purchasing power]] of the Brazilian population without [[shock (economics)|shocks]] or [[price freeze|price freezing]].<ref name=\"MAS\" />\n\nOn the very first day of his administration, the [[Treaty of Asunci\u00f3n]] came into force.<ref name=\"MAS\" /> Signed by [[Fernando Collor de Mello]], it predicted the implementation of [[Mercosur]], a [[free trade area]] between Brazil, [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Paraguay]].<ref name=\"MAS\" /> Moreover, the first FHC administration was marked by political and economic reforms, such as the end of the state monopolies in [[petrobras|oil]] and [[Telebr\u00e1s|telecommunications]], the reform on the [[social security]] plans, and the change in the concept of \"national company\".<ref name=\"MAS\" /> Although approved in the Congress, the reforms carried by the federal government met strong resistance from the opposition, most notably the Workers' Party, which fiercely criticized the [[privatization]] of companies such as [[Vale (mining company)|Vale do Rio Doce]] and the constitutional amendment that allowed the re-election of officeholders in the Executive branch.<ref name=\"MAS\" /> As a result, [[Peter Mandelson]], a close aide to then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Tony Blair]], stated that the Workers' Party's proposals represented \"an old-fashioned and out-of-date [[socialism]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/138231.stm |title=Mandelson under fire in Brazil |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-07-23 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref> At that time, FHC-Blair relations were magnified, once both of them were adherents of the [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]].\n\nDespite its political victories, the government needed to impose measures to cool down the domestic demand and help the [[trade balance]], which eventually caused [[unemployment]] to grow and made the economy show signs of [[recession]].<ref name=\"MAS\" /> Other areas, such as [[health]], [[education]] and [[land reform]] also suffered major crises.<ref name=\"MAS\" /> The violent conflict in the countryside reached its peak with the [[Eldorado dos Caraj\u00e1s massacre]]. Thus, FHC's reelection campaign was based on the idea that the continuity of his government was essential for the stabilization to reach areas other than the economy, such as health, agriculture, employment, education, and [[public security]].<ref name=\"MAS\" />\n\n==Presidential election==\n\n=== Candidates ===\nThe 1998 presidential race had twelve candidates, the largest number of candidates since the [[1989 Brazilian presidential election|1989 election]], when over twenty candidacies were launched. The number could have been as high as fifteen, but the Electoral Justice withdrew the candidacy of impeached President Fernando Collor de Mello,<ref>[http://www.tse.jus.br/internet/jurisprudencia/julgados_historicos/1990/collor3.htm \"O Caso Collor - A tentativa de retorno\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609172849/http://www.tse.jus.br/internet/jurisprudencia/julgados_historicos/1990/collor3.htm |date=June 9, 2009 }}.

They were joined by the [[Progressive Party (Brazil)|Progressive Party]], the [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|Social Democratic Party]], and the [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)|Social Liberal Party]]. Once again, Liberal Front Party member [[Marco Maciel]] was FHC's running mate.\n\nThe [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] reprised its past two candidacies, by launching Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva as its candidate and forming a coalition with the [[Communist Party of Brazil]], and the [[Brazilian Socialist Party]]. The novelty in this election was the choice of [[Leonel Brizola]] from the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]] as his running mate. Prior to that, the Workers' Party refrained from forming coalitions with parties linked to ''[[Get\u00falio Vargas|varguista]]'' labour unions as a way of sustaining its union branch, the [[Central \u00danica dos Trabalhadores]], as independent. As a result, the [[United Socialist Workers' Party]] left the coalition and launched [[Jos\u00e9 Maria de Almeida]] as its candidate.\n\nFormer [[Cear\u00e1]] state Governor [[Ciro Gomes]] run for President, and, therefore, his [[Socialist People's Party (Brazil)|Socialist People's Party]] did not join the Workers' Party coalition as they did in the previous election. After Oswaldo Souza Oliveira's quit the race, his [[Party of the Nation's Retirees]] decided to support Gomes.\n\nAfter securing the third place in the 1994 election, [[En\u00e9as Carneiro]] from the [[far-right]] [[Party of the Reconstruction of the National Order]] also run in 1998.
