In the 19th century, the rulers of Tunisia became aware of the ongoing efforts at political and social [[Tanzimat|reform in the Ottoman capital]]. The Bey of Tunis then, by his own lights but informed by the Turkish example, attempted to effect a modernizing reform of institutions and the economy. Tunisian international debt grew unmanageable. This was the reason or pretext for French forces to [[History of French-era Tunisia|establish a Protectorate]] in 1881.\n\nA remnant of the centuries of Turkish rule is the presence of [[Turks in Tunisia|a population of Turkish origin]], historically the male descendants were referred to as the ''[[Kouloughlis]]''.\n\n=== French protectorate ===\n{{see also|History of French-era Tunisia|French protectorate of Tunisia|}}\n\n=== Republic and Revolution ===\n{{see also|History of modern Tunisia|Tunisian Revolution}}\n\nIndependence from [[France]] was achieved on March 20, 1956. The State was established as a [[constitutional monarchy]] with the [[Bey of Tunis]], [[Muhammad VIII al-Amin]] Bey, as the king of [[Tunisia]]. In 1957, the Prime Minister [[Habib Bourguiba]] abolished the monarchy and firmly established his [[Neo Destour]] (New Constitution) party. In the 1970s the economy of Tunisia expanded at a very healthy rate. Oil was discovered and tourism continued. City and countryside populations drew roughly equal in number. Yet agricultural problems and urban unemployment led to increased migration to Europe.\n\nThe 84-year-old President Bourguiba was overthrown and replaced by [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]] his Prime Minister on November 7, 1987.<ref>John P.

[[History of Tunisia|Ancient Tunisia]] was a major civilization crossing through history; different cultures, civilizations and multiple successive dynasties contributed to the culture of the country over centuries with a varying degrees of influence. Among these cultures were the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] \u2013 their native civilization, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ([[Roman Africans]]), [[Vandals|Vandal]], [[Jewish]], [[Christians|Christian]], [[Arab]], [[Islamic]], [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]], and [[France|French]], in addition to native [[Berber people|Amazigh]]. This unique mixture of cultures made [[Tunisia]], with its strategic geographical location in the Mediterranean, the core of some great civilizations of [[Mare Nostrum]].\n\nThe important elements of Tunisian culture are diverse and represent a unique, mixed heritage. This heritage can be experienced first-hand in: museums such as the [[Bardo Museum]], the contrast and diversity of city architecture such as [[Sidi Bou Said]] or the [[medina of Tunis]], cuisine such as cheeses and French croissants, music reflecting Andalusian and Ottoman influences, literature, cinema, religion, the arts, and sports and other areas of Tunisian culture.\n\n===Cultural diversity===\n[[File:Head man Carthage Louvre AO3783.jpg|right|thumb|Tunisian [[amulet]]]]\nIn his thesis study on Tunisian Cultural Policy, Rafik Said has mused that, \"this relatively small area has produced estates, overlapping of cultures, and a confrontation of morals and doctrines throughout its history.<ref>Sa\u00efd (1970), p. 11</ref> Janice Rhodes Deledalle has referred to Tunisian culture as \"cosmopolitan\" and has said that \"Tunisia cannot be considered in the category of as other colonies\", because of the diversity of cultures embedded in Tunisia's heritage throughout the ages.<ref name=\"prot\u00e9e\">{{cite document|author=Deledalle-Rhodes, Janice|url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/pr/2002/v30/n2/006732ar.html|title=L'iconographie du timbre-poste tunisien pendant et apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode coloniale|publisher= Prot\u00e9e |date=Autumn 2002|volume=vol. 30, n\u00b02 |doi=10.7202/006732ar|language=French|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural symbols===\nNational identity is strong and Tunisian efforts to create a national culture have proved stronger than in the nineteenth century. National culture and heritage is constantly referred to with reference to the country's modern history, in particular, the construction of the modern state that followed the French protectorate from the 1950s. This is celebrated through national holidays, in the names of streets recalling historical figures or key dates or the subject of films or documentaries.\n\n====Flag====\n{{Main|Flag of Tunisia}}\nThe national [[flag of Tunisia]] is predominantly red and consists of a white circle in the middle containing a red [[crescent]] around a [[five-pointed star]].

Its distinctive spicy fieriness comes from neighbouring Mediterranean countries and the many civilizations who have ruled Tunisian land: [[ancient Rome|Roman]]s, [[Vandals]], [[Byzantine]]s, [[Arab]]s, [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]], [[Italy|Italians]] ([[Sicilians]]), [[France|French]], and the native [[Punics]]-[[Berber people]]. Tunisian food uses a variety of ingredients and in different ways. The main dish that is served in Tunisia is [[Couscous]], made of minuscule grains that are cooked and usually served with meat and vegetables. In cooking they also use a variety of flavors such as: [[olive oil]], [[aniseed]], [[coriander]], [[cumin]], [[caraway]], [[cinnamon]], [[saffron]], [[Mentha|mint]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[blossom]], and rose water.\n\nLike all Mediterranean cultures, Tunisian culture offers a \"sun cuisine\", based mainly on olive oil, spices, tomatoes, seafood (a wide range of fish) and meat from rearing (lamb).\n\n===Architecture===\nTunisian architecture is traditionally expressed in various facets in Tunisia through [[Roman architecture]] and [[Islamic architecture]]. Through many buildings, [[Kairouan]] forms the epicenter of an architectural movement expressing the relationship between buildings and spirituality with the ornamental decoration of religious buildings in the holy city. In [[Djerba]], the architecture such as the fortress of [[El Kef|Kef]] reflects the military and spiritual destiny of a [[Sufi]] influence in the region.\n\n[[File:Kairouan barbier05.jpg|left|thumb|Mosque in [[Kairouan]]]]\n\nThe influential role of the various dynasties that ruled the country, particularly in building cities and princes of Raqqada Mahdia, illuminates the role of the geopolitical context in the architectural history of the country. Thus, many original fortresses that protected the coast from Byzantine invasions evolved into cities, like [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]], [[Sousse]] or [[Lamta]].\n\nThe [[medina of Tunis]], is [[World Heritage Site]] of UNESCO, and is a typical example of Islamic architecture. However, in the areas between the ports of [[Bizerte]] and [[Ghar El Melh]], settlements founded by the [[Moors]] fleeing Andalusia were reconquered by Catholic sovereigns and has more of a Christian influence.\n\n[[File:Tozeur - Medina's entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Medina of [[Tozeur]]]]\n\nGiven the cosmopolitan nature of cities in Tunisia, they have retained a diversity and juxtaposition of styles. Many buildings were designed by many different architects, artisans and entrepreneurs during the French protectorate. Among the most famous architects of that time were [[Victor Valensi]], [[Guy Raphael]], [[Henri Saladin]], [[Joss Ellenon]] and [[Jean-Emile Resplandy]].<ref name=\"Borsali\">Noura Borsali, \u00ab Le mois du patrimoine.

Between 1881 and 1900 and then again until 1920 the style was neo-Mauresque, between 1925 and 1940 it was in the [[Art Deco]] style and then the modernist style between 1943 and 1947.<ref name=\"Borsali\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Tunisia}}\n[[File:Bendir.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Tunisian [[Bendir]] (frame drum) with snare]]\nAccording to [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab]], Tunisian music has been influenced by old Andalusian songs injected with Turkish, Persian and Greek influences. Of major note in Tunisian classical music is the Malouf. Deriving from the reign of the [[Aghlabids]] in the 15th century, it is a particular type of Andalusian music. In urban areas it uses stringed instruments ([[fiddle]], [[oud]] and [[Qanun (instrument)|Kanun]]) and percussion ([[darbuka]]) while in rural areas, it may also be accompanied by instruments like the [[mezoued]], [[gasba]] and the [[zurna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saisonstunisiennes.com/panorama_txt07.html|title=La Tunisie de A \u00e0 Z, Instruments de musique|publisher=Saisons tunisiennes|language=French|accessdate=September 10, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20081121025123/http://www.saisonstunisiennes.com/panorama_txt07.html|archivedate=November 21, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of new patterns of racial and improvised music since the late 1990s changed the musical landscape of Tunisia. At the same time, the majority of the population is attracted by the music of Levantine origin (Egyptian, Lebanese or Syrian). Popular western music has also had major success with the emergence of many groups and festivals, including [[rock music]], [[hip hop]], [[reggae]] and [[jazz]].\n\nAmong the major Tunisian contemporary artists include [[Hedi Habbouba]], [[Saber Reba\u00ef]], [[Dhafer Youssef]], [[Belgacem Bouguenna]], [[Sonia M'barek]] and [[Latifa (singer)|Latifa]]. Other notable musicians include [[Salah El Mahdi]], [[Anouar Brahem]], [[Zied Gharsa]] and [[Lotfi Bouchnak]].\n\n===Cinema===\n{{main|Cinema of Tunisia}}\nTunisian cinema is today recognized as one of the most liberal, most inventive (and one of the most prize-winning) cinemas of Africa and the Middle-east.

In the 19th century, the rulers of Tunisia became aware of the ongoing efforts at political and social [[Tanzimat|reform in the Ottoman capital]]. The Bey of Tunis then, by his own lights but informed by the Turkish example, attempted to effect a modernizing reform of institutions and the economy. Tunisian international debt grew unmanageable.

The State was established as a [[constitutional monarchy]] with the [[Bey of Tunis]], [[Muhammad VIII al-Amin]] Bey, as the king of [[Tunisia]]. In 1957, the Prime Minister [[Habib Bourguiba]] abolished the monarchy and firmly established his [[Neo Destour]] (New Constitution) party. In the 1970s the economy of Tunisia expanded at a very healthy rate. Oil was discovered, and tourism continued. City and countryside populations drew roughly equal in number. Yet agricultural problems and urban unemployment led to increased migration to Europe.\n\nThe 84-year-old President Bourguiba was overthrown and replaced by [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]] his Prime Minister on November 7, 1987.<ref>John P.

[[History of Tunisia|Ancient Tunisia]] was a major civilization crossing through history; different cultures, civilizations and multiple successive dynasties contributed to the culture of the country over centuries with a varying degrees of influence. Among these cultures were the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] \u2013 their native civilization, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ([[Roman Africans]]), [[Vandals|Vandal]], [[Jewish]], [[Christians|Christian]], [[Arab]], [[Islamic]], [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]], and [[France|French]], in addition to native [[Berber people|Amazigh]]. This unique mixture of cultures made [[Tunisia]], with its strategic geographical location in the Mediterranean, the core of some great civilizations of [[Mare Nostrum]].\n\nThe important elements of Tunisian culture are diverse and represent a unique, mixed heritage. This heritage can be experienced first-hand in: museums such as the [[Bardo Museum]], the contrast and diversity of city architecture such as [[Sidi Bou Said]] or the [[medina of Tunis]], cuisine such as cheeses and French croissants, music reflecting Andalusian and Ottoman influences, literature, cinema, religion, the arts, and sports and other areas of Tunisian culture.\n\n===Cultural diversity===\n[[File:Head man Carthage Louvre AO3783.jpg|right|thumb|Tunisian [[amulet]]]]\nIn his thesis study on Tunisian Cultural Policy, Rafik Said has mused that, \"this relatively small area has produced estates, overlapping of cultures, and a confrontation of morals and doctrines throughout its history.<ref>Sa\u00efd (1970), p. 11</ref> Janice Rhodes Deledalle has referred to Tunisian culture as \"cosmopolitan\" and has said that \"Tunisia cannot be considered in the category of as other colonies\", because of the diversity of cultures embedded in Tunisia's heritage throughout the ages.<ref name=\"prot\u00e9e\">{{cite document|author=Deledalle-Rhodes, Janice|url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/pr/2002/v30/n2/006732ar.html|title=L'iconographie du timbre-poste tunisien pendant et apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode coloniale|publisher= Prot\u00e9e |date=Autumn 2002|volume=vol. 30, n\u00b02 |doi=10.7202/006732ar|language=French|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural symbols===\nNational identity is strong and Tunisian efforts to create a national culture have proved stronger than in the nineteenth century.

Its distinctive spicy fieriness comes from neighbouring Mediterranean countries and the many civilizations who have ruled Tunisian land: [[ancient Rome|Roman]]s, [[Vandals]], [[Byzantine]]s, [[Arab]]s, [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]], [[Italy|Italians]] ([[Sicilians]]), [[France|French]], and the native [[Punics]]-[[Berber people]]. Tunisian food uses a variety of ingredients and in different ways. The main dish that is served in Tunisia is [[Couscous]], made of minuscule grains that are cooked and usually served with meat and vegetables. In cooking they also use a variety of flavors such as: [[olive oil]], [[aniseed]], [[coriander]], [[cumin]], [[caraway]], [[cinnamon]], [[saffron]], [[Mentha|mint]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[blossom]], and rose water.\n\nLike all Mediterranean cultures, Tunisian culture offers a \"sun cuisine\", based mainly on olive oil, spices, tomatoes, seafood (a wide range of fish) and meat from rearing (lamb).\n\n===Architecture===\nTunisian architecture is traditionally expressed in various facets in Tunisia through [[Roman architecture]] and [[Islamic architecture]]. Through many buildings, [[Kairouan]] forms the epicenter of an architectural movement expressing the relationship between buildings and spirituality with the ornamental decoration of religious buildings in the holy city. In [[Djerba]], the architecture such as the fortress of [[El Kef|Kef]] reflects the military and spiritual destiny of a [[Sufi]] influence in the region.\n\n[[File:Kairouan barbier05.jpg|left|thumb|Mosque in [[Kairouan]]]]\n\nThe influential role of the various dynasties that ruled the country, particularly in building cities and princes of Raqqada Mahdia, illuminates the role of the geopolitical context in the architectural history of the country. Thus, many original fortresses that protected the coast from Byzantine invasions evolved into cities, like [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]], [[Sousse]] or [[Lamta]].\n\nThe [[medina of Tunis]], is [[World Heritage Site]] of UNESCO, and is a typical example of Islamic architecture. However, in the areas between the ports of [[Bizerte]] and [[Ghar El Melh]], settlements founded by the [[Moors]] fleeing Andalusia were reconquered by Catholic sovereigns and has more of a Christian influence.\n\n[[File:Tozeur - Medina's entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Medina of [[Tozeur]]]]\n\nGiven the cosmopolitan nature of cities in Tunisia, they have retained a diversity and juxtaposition of styles. Many buildings were designed by many different architects, artisans and entrepreneurs during the French protectorate. Among the most famous architects of that time were [[Victor Valensi]], [[Guy Raphael]], [[Henri Saladin]], [[Joss Ellenon]] and [[Jean-Emile Resplandy]].<ref name=\"Borsali\">Noura Borsali, \u00ab Le mois du patrimoine.

Between 1881 and 1900 and then again until 1920 the style was neo-Mauresque, between 1925 and 1940 it was in the [[Art Deco]] style and then the modernist style between 1943 and 1947.<ref name=\"Borsali\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Tunisia}}\n[[File:Bendir.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Tunisian [[Bendir]] (frame drum) with snare]]\nAccording to [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab]], Tunisian music has been influenced by old Andalusian songs injected with Turkish, Persian and Greek influences. Of major note in Tunisian classical music is the Malouf. Deriving from the reign of the [[Aghlabids]] in the 15th century, it is a particular type of Andalusian music. In urban areas it uses stringed instruments ([[fiddle]], [[oud]] and [[Qanun (instrument)|Kanun]]) and percussion ([[darbuka]]) while in rural areas, it may also be accompanied by instruments like the [[mezoued]], [[gasba]] and the [[zurna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saisonstunisiennes.com/panorama_txt07.html|title=La Tunisie de A \u00e0 Z, Instruments de musique|publisher=Saisons tunisiennes|language=French|accessdate=September 10, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20081121025123/http://www.saisonstunisiennes.com/panorama_txt07.html|archivedate=November 21, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of new patterns of racial and improvised music since the late 1990s changed the musical landscape of Tunisia. At the same time, the majority of the population is attracted by the music of Levantine origin (Egyptian, Lebanese or Syrian). Popular western music has also had major success with the emergence of many groups and festivals, including [[rock music]], [[hip hop]], [[reggae]] and [[jazz]].\n\nAmong the major Tunisian contemporary artists include [[Hedi Habbouba]], [[Saber Reba\u00ef]], [[Dhafer Youssef]], [[Belgacem Bouguenna]], [[Sonia M'barek]] and [[Latifa (singer)|Latifa]]. Other notable musicians include [[Salah El Mahdi]], [[Anouar Brahem]], [[Zied Gharsa]] and [[Lotfi Bouchnak]].\n\n===Cinema===\n{{main|Cinema of Tunisia}}\nTunisian cinema is today recognized as one of the most liberal, most inventive (and one of the most prize-winning) cinemas of Africa and the Middle-east. Since the 90s, Tunisia became an attractive place for filming and numerous companies emerged, serving the foreign film industry and became successful.<ref name=\"cff\"/> Tunisia also hosts the [[Carthage Film Festival]] which has been taking place since 1966.

The economy of Chhattisgarh recorded a growth rate of 6.7% in 2017\u201318.<ref name=\"Budget Analysis\" /> Chhattisgarh's success factors in achieving high growth rate are growth in agriculture and industrial production.\n\n=== Tea production ===\nChhattisgarh State is ranked as the 17th-largest tea-producing state in India. The districts of Jashpur and Surguja are favourable tea production areas. In Jashpur district, the first tea plantation, Brahmnishthajaya Sogara Ashram was established under the direction of Pujya Pad Gurupad. Tea production started after two years at the Sogara Ashram. A tea processing unit was established in Sogara Ashram and the unit name set as the Aghor Tea Processing Plant. The forestry department has also started a tea plantation motivated by the Sogara Ashram. In Surguja district, a tea nursery is being developed by the Margdarshan Sansthan Agriculture College in Ambikapur, Surguja.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nAgriculture is counted as the chief economic occupation of the state. According to a government estimate, net sown area of the state is 4.828&nbsp;million hectares and the gross sown area is 5.788&nbsp;million hectares.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Chhattisgarh\">{{cite web|title=Agriculture in Chhattisgarh |url=http://cg.gov.in/development/cdevelopment.htm#irrigation |accessdate=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721155523/http://cg.gov.in/development/cdevelopment.htm |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}</ref> Horticulture and animal husbandry also engage a major share of the total population of the state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Economy of Chhattisgarh|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/|accessdate=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507072918/http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/|archive-date=7 May 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> About 80% of the population of the state is rural and the main livelihood of the villagers is agriculture and agriculture-based small industry.\n\nThe majority of the farmers are still practising the traditional methods of cultivation, resulting in low growth rates and productivity. The farmers have to be made aware of modern technologies suitable to their holdings. Providing adequate knowledge to the farmers is essential for better implementation of the agricultural development plans and to improve productivity.<ref name=\"nhm.nic.in\">http://nhm.nic.in/ActionPlan/ActionPlan_Chhattisgarh.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nConsidering this and a very limited irrigated area, the productivity of not only rice but also other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now.\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chloroxylon from India.JPG|Chloroxylon is used for pest management in organic rice cultivation in Chhattisgarh\nFile:Medicinal Rice.jpg|Medicinal rice of Chhattisgarh used as an immune booster\nFile:Aloe Farming.jpg|Aloe vera farming in Chhattisgarh\nFile:Gulbakawali Farming.jpg|Herbal farming in Chhattisgarh: Gulbakawali\nFile:Pigeonpea cultivation on Safed Musli Bed.jpg|Herbal farming in Chhattisgarh: Safed Musli with Arhar\n</gallery>\n\n==== Agricultural products ====\nThe main crops are rice, maize,<ref>Oudhia, P. (1999) Allelopathic effects of Lantana camara L. on germination of soybean. Legume Research 22(4): 273\u2013274.</ref> ''kodo-kutki'' and other small millets and pulses (''tuar''<ref>Oudhia, P.

In the mid-1990s, most of Chhattisgarh was still a monocrop belt. Only one-fourth to one-fifth of the sown area was double-cropped. When a very substantial portion of the population is dependent on agriculture, a situation where nearly 80% of a state's area is covered only by one crop, immediate attention to turn them into double crop areas is needed. Also, very few cash crops are grown in Chhattisgarh, so there is a need to diversify the agriculture produce towards oilseeds and other cash crops. Chhattisgarh is also called the \"rice bowl of central India\".<ref name=\"Agriculture in Chhattisgarh\" />\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Kodo Millet in Chhattisgarh.jpg|Kodo Millet is used as a life saving medicine in Chhattisgarh\nFile:Bastar Beer.jpg|Bastar beer prepared from Sulfi\n</gallery>\n\n==== Irrigation ====\nIn Chhattisgarh, rice, the main crop, is grown on about 77% of the net sown area. Only about 20% of the area is under irrigation; the rest depends on rain. Of the three agroclimatic zones, about 73% of the Chhattisgarh plains, 97% of the Bastar plateau and 95% of the northern hills are rainfed. The irrigated area available for double cropping is only 87,000&nbsp;ha in Chhattisgarh plains and 2300&nbsp;ha in Bastar plateau and northern hills. Due to this, the productivity of rice and other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now, though agriculture is the main occupation of more than 80% of the population.<ref name=\"nhm.nic.in\" />\n\nIn Chhattisgarh region, about 22% of net cropped area was under irrigation as compared to 36.5% in Madhya Pradesh in 1998\u201399, whereas the average national irrigation was about 40%. The irrigation is characterised by a high order of variability ranging from 1.6% in Bastar to 75.0% in Dhamtari. Based on an average growth trend in the irrigated area, about 0.43% additional area is brought under irrigation every year as compared to 1.89% in Madhya Pradesh and 1.0% in the country as a whole. Thus, irrigation has been growing at a very low rate in Chhattisgarh and the pace of irrigation is so slow, it would take about 122 years to reach the 75% level of net irrigated area in Chhattisgarh at the present rate of growth.<ref name=\"nhm.nic.in\" />\n\nChhattisgarh has a limited [[irrigation]] system, with dams and [[canal]]s on some rivers. Average rainfall in the state is around 1400&nbsp;mm and the entire state falls under the rice agroclimatic zone. The Large variation in the yearly rainfall directly affects the production of rice. Irrigation is the prime need of the state for its overall development and therefore the state government has given top priority to development of irrigation.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Chhattisgarh\" />\n\nA total of four major, 33 medium and 2199 minor irrigation projects have been completed and five major, nine medium and 312 minor projects are under construction, as of 31 March 2006.{{Update inline|date=August 2019|reason=These numbers are from over ten years ago. Needs updating}}\n\n=== Industrial sector ===\n\n==== Power sector ====\nChhattisgarh is one of the few states of India where the power sector is effectively developed. Based on the current production of surplus electric power, the position of the State is comfortable and profitable. The Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (CSEB) is in a strong position to meet the electricity requirement of the state and is in good financial health. According to [[Central Electricity Authority (India)|Central Electricity Authority]] (CEA), Chhattisgarh provides electricity to several other states because of surplus production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/chhattisgarh-is-power-surplus-state--confirms-cea-report.html|title=Chhattisgarh is power surplus state, confirms CEA report|last=Pioneer|first=The|website=The Pioneer|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn Chhattisgarh, [[National Thermal Power Corporation Limited]] (|NTPC) has [[Sipat Thermal Power Station]] with a capacity of 2,980 MW at Sipat, Bilaspur; [[LARA Super Thermal Power Station]] with a nameplate capacity of 1600MW and [[Korba Super Thermal Power Station]] with a capacity of 2,600 MW at Korba, while CSEB's units have a thermal capacity of 1,780 MW and hydel capacity of 130 MW. Apart from NTPC and CSEB, there are a number of private generation units of large and small capacity. The state government has pursued a liberal policy with regard to captive generation which has resulted in a number of private companies coming up.<ref name=\"Power Sector in Chhattisgarh\">{{cite web|title=Power Sector in Chhattisgarh|url=http://cserc.nic.in/power_sector.htm|accessdate=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211023325/http://www.cserc.nic.in/power_sector.htm|archive-date=11 December 2004|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe state has a potential of 61,000 MW of additional thermal power in terms of availability of coal for more than 100 years and more than 2,500 MW hydel capacity. To use this vast potential, substantial additions to the existing generation capacity are already underway.<ref name=\"Power Sector in Chhattisgarh\" />\n\n==== Steel sector ====\nThe steel industry is one of the biggest heavy industries of Chhattisgarh. Bhilai Steel Plant, Bhilai operated by [[Steel Authority of India Limited|SAIL]], with a capacity of 5.4&nbsp;million tonnes per year, is regarded as a significant growth indicator of the state. More than 100 steel rolling mills, 90 sponge iron plants and ferro-alloy units are in Chhattisgarh. Along with Bhilai, today Raipur, Bilaspur, Korba and Raigarh have become the steel hub of Chhattisgarh. Today, Raipur has become the centre of the steel sector, the biggest market for steel in India.<ref name=\"Industries in Chhattisgarh\">{{cite web|title=Industries in Chhattisgarh|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/chhattisgarh-industries.html|accessdate=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810083204/http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/chhattisgarh-industries.html|archive-date=10 August 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Aluminium sector ====\nThe aluminium industry of Chhattisgarh was established by Bharat Aluminium Company Limited, which has a capacity of around 600,000 tonnes each year.<ref name=\"Industries in Chhattisgarh\" />\n\n==== Natural resources ====\n\n===== Forest =====\nForests occupy 41.33% of the total area (as per the latest report by the [[Indian Forest Service]]) and the rich forest resources include wood, tendu leaves, [[honey]] and lac.

Its government is also promoting IT and has set up a body to take care of IT solutions. The body, known as CHiPS, is providing large IT projects such as Choice, Swan, etc.\n\n===== Major companies =====\nMajor companies with a presence in the state include:\n* Metal: [[Bhilai Steel Plant]], [[Jindal Steel and Power]], [[Bharat Aluminium Company]]\n* Oil: [[Indian Oil Corporation]], [[Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited]]\n* Mining: [[National Mineral Development Corporation|NMDC]], [[South Eastern Coalfields]]\n* Power : [[NTPC Limited|NTPC]], [[Lanco Infratech]], [[KSK Energy Ventures]], [[Jindal Power Limited]]\n\n=== Exports ===\nChhattisgarh's total exports were US$353.3&nbsp;million in 2009\u201310. Nearly 75% of exports comes from Bhilai and the remaining from Urla, Bhanpuri, and Sirgitti. The major exports products include steel, handicrafts, handlooms, blended yarn, food and agri-products, iron, aluminium, cement, minerals, and engineering products.

Total literates in the urban region of Chhattisgarh were 4,370,966.<ref name=\"census2011.co.in\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census2011.co.in/census/state/chhattisgarh.html|title=Chhattisgarh Population Sex Ratio in Chhattisgarh Literacy rate data|website=census2011.co.in|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808042246/http://www.census2011.co.in/census/state/chhattisgarh.html|archive-date=8 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAccording to NSS (2007\u201308), the literacy rate for [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Scheduled Castes (SCs)]] was better than the corresponding national average.\n\nAmong the marginalised groups, STs are at the bottom of the rankings, further emphasising the lack of social development in the state. Bastar and Dantewada in south Chhattisgarh are the most illiterate districts and the drop out ratio is the highest among all the districts. The reason for this is the extreme poverty in rural areas.\n\n=== Health Index ===\nAs per census 2011, the State has population of 25.5&nbsp;million and six medical colleges ( five Government and one private) with intake capacity of 700 students and doctor patient ratio of 1:17,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chhattisgarh a poor State with low health indices: CAG |url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2017/state-editions/chhattisgarh-a-poor-state-with-low-health-indices-cag.html |website=The Pioneer |accessdate=29 September 2018 |date=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929233452/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2017/state-editions/chhattisgarh-a-poor-state-with-low-health-indices-cag.html |archive-date=29 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nUnder The NITI Aayog released Health Index report titled, \"Healthy States, Progressive India.\"- Chhattisgarh has an index of 52.02 Out of 100, which is better than states such as Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha, Bihar, Assam, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pandey |first1=Kundan |title=NITI Aayog's Health Index: Kerala on top; Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh among worst performers |url=https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/niti-aayog-s-health-index-kerala-on-top-rajasthan-uttar-pradesh-among-worst-performers-59663 |website=Down To Earth |accessdate=29 September 2018 |date=9 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810142701/https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/niti-aayog-s-health-index-kerala-on-top-rajasthan-uttar-pradesh-among-worst-performers-59663 |archive-date=10 August 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite different health related schemes and programmes, the health indicators such as the percentage of women with BMI<18.5, Under Five Mortality Rate and underweight children are poor. This may be due to the difficulty in accessing the remote areas in the state. The prevalence of female malnutrition in Chhattisgarh is higher than the national average\u2014half of the ST females are malnourished. The performance of SCs is a little better than the corresponding national and state average. The Under Five Mortality Rate among STs is significantly higher than the national average.\n\n=== Net state domestic product ===\nChhattisgarh is one of the emerging states with relatively high growth rates of net state domestic product (NSDP) (8.2% vs. 7.1% All India over 2002\u20132008) and per capita NSDP (6.2% vs. 5.4% All India over 2002\u20132008). The growth rates of the said parameters are above the national averages and thus it appears that Chhattisgarh is catching up with other states in this respect. However, the state still has very low levels of per capita income as compared to the other states.\n\n=== Urbanisation ===\nOut of total population of Chhattisgarh, 23.24% people live in urban regions. The total figure of population living in urban areas is 5,937,237 of which 3,035,469 are males and while remaining 2,901,768 are females.\n\nRaipur, Durg, Bhilai Nagar, Bilaspur, Korba, Jagdalpur, Rajnandgaon and Raigarh are some of the urban towns and cities in the region.<ref name=\"census2011.co.in\" />\n\n=== Sex ratio ===\nThere are more than 13 million males and 12.9&nbsp; million females in Chhattisgarh, which constitutes 2.11% of the country's population. The [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] in the state is one of the most balanced in India with 991 females per 1,000 males, as is the child sex-ratio with 964 females per 1,000 males (Census 2011)\n\n=== Fertility rate ===\nChhattisgarh has a fairly high fertility rate (3.1) as compared to All India (2.6) and the replacement rate (2.1). It has a rural fertility rate of 3.2 and urban fertility rate of 2.1.\n\n=== SC and ST population ===\nWith the exception of the hilly states of the north-east, Chhattisgarh has one of highest shares of Scheduled Tribe (ST) populations within a state, accounting for about 10 percent of the STs in India. Scheduled Tribes make up 30.62% of the population. The tribals are an important part of the state population and mainly inhabit the dense forests of Bastar and other districts of south Chhattisgarh. The percentage increase in the population of the scheduled list of tribals during the 2001\u20132011 decade had been at the rate of 18.23%. The Scheduled Caste (SC) population of Chhattisgarh is 2,418,722 as per 2001 census constituting 11.6 percent of the total population (20,833,803). The proportion of Scheduled Castes has increased from 11.6 percent in 2001 to 12.8% in 2011.\n\n=== Poverty ===\n[[File:Diospyros melanoxylon Tendu.jpg|thumb|[[Tendu (tree)|Tendu]] Patta (Leaf) collection in Chhattisgarh, India.]]\nThe incidence of poverty in Chhattisgarh is very high. The estimated poverty ratio in 2004\u201305 based on uniform reference period consumption was around 50 per cent, which is approximately double the all India level. The incidence of poverty in the rural and urban areas is almost the same.\n\nMore than half of the rural STs and urban SCs are poor. In general, the proportion of poor SC and ST households in the state is higher than the state average and their community's respective national averages (except for rural SC households). Given that more than 50 percent of the state's population is ST and SC, the high incidence of income poverty among them is a matter of serious concern in the state.\n\nThis indicates that the good economic performance in recent years has not percolated to this socially deprived group, which is reflected in their poor performance in human development indicators.\n\n=== Access to drinking water ===\nIn terms of access to improved drinking water sources, at the aggregate level, Chhattisgarh fared better than the national average and the SCs of the state performed better than the corresponding national average. Scheduled Tribes are marginally below the state average, but still better than the STs at the all India level.\n\nThe proportion of households with access to improved sources of drinking water in 2008\u201309 was 91%. This proportion was over 90% even in states like Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. This was largely because these states had over 70% of their households accessing tube wells/hand-pumps as sources of drinking water.\n\n=== Sanitation ===\nSanitation facilities in the state were abysmally low with only about 41 percent having toilet facilities before the [[Swachh Bharat Mission]] was Launched by the Government of India. The Urban areas of Chhattisgarh attained the title of open defecation free on 2 October 2017 and the rural areas have achieved a 90.31% sanitation coverage. What sets Chhattisgarh apart from other states of India is an approach to bring in behavioural change in order to get open defecation free status. In Chhattisgarh, people don't get toilet incentives, they have to construct the toilet with their own money, after using the toilet for 3 months they are entitled for the incentive amount.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/commendable-progress-urban-rural-sanitation-chhattisgarh-way-open-defecation-free-12041/|title=With Commendable Progress in Both Urban And Rural Sanitation, Chhattisgarh Is on Its Way To Be Open Defecation Free \u2013 Swachh Report Card|date=19 September 2017|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810143753/https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/commendable-progress-urban-rural-sanitation-chhattisgarh-way-open-defecation-free-12041/|archive-date=10 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Teledensity ===\nAcross states, it has been found that [[teledensity]] (telephone density) was below 10 percent in 2010 for Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, reflecting a lack of access to telephones in these relatively poorer states. But due to development of new technology the teledensity in 2017 is 68.08 percent which shows improvement of telecom infrastructure. On the other hand, for states like Delhi and Himachal Pradesh and metropolitan cities like Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai, teledensity was over 100 percent in 2010 implying that individuals have more than one telephone connection.\n\n=== Road density ===\nThe total density of National Highways (NHs) in Chhattisgarh is at 23.4&nbsp;km per 1,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> out of the total length of 3,168&nbsp;km in the State, the Central Government has informed.\nChhattisgarh Government had completed construction of 5,266 cement concrete (CC) roads having a total length of 1,530&nbsp;km in various villages of the State as on 31 May 2016 under 'Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana'.<ref>{{cite web |title=23.4&nbsp;km per 1000 sq. kms NH road density in Chhattisgarh: Centre |url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2016/state-editions/234-kms-per-1000-sq-kms-nh-road-density-in-chhattisgarh-centre.html |website=The Pioneer |accessdate=29 September 2018 |date=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929233445/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2016/state-editions/234-kms-per-1000-sq-kms-nh-road-density-in-chhattisgarh-centre.html |archive-date=29 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n=== Witchcraft ===\n[[File:Mission Against Witchcraft.jpg|thumb|Social Mission Against Blind Faith|alt=|left]]To bring about social reforms and with a view to discourage undesirable social practices, Chhattisgarh government has enacted the Chhattisgarh Tonhi Atyachar (Niwaran) Act, 2005 against witchery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dark Spell|url=http://newsblaze.com/story/20091108150914shan.nb/topstory.html|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=8 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125204907/http://newsblaze.com/story/20091108150914shan.nb/topstory.html|archive-date=25 November 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Much has to be done on the issue of law enforcement by judicial authorities to protect women in this regard, bringing such persecution to an end.<ref name=\"womennewsnetwork.net\" />\n\nSome sections of tribal population of Chhattisgarh state believe in [[witchcraft]].<ref name=\"womennewsnetwork.net\">{{cite web|title=India: Protective Laws Fall Short for Women Charged with Witchcraft|url=http://womennewsnetwork.net/2010/03/21/witchcraft-india-89/|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=21 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702111614/http://womennewsnetwork.net/2010/03/21/witchcraft-india-89/|archive-date=2 July 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Women are believed to have access to supernatural forces and are accused of being witches (''tonhi'') often to settle personal scores.\n\nAs of 2010, they are still hounded out of villages on the basis of flimsy accusations by male village sorcerers paid to do so by villagers with personal agendas, such as property and goods acquisition.<ref name=\"womennewsnetwork.net\" /> According to [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] Channel's investigations, those accused are fortunate if they are only verbally bullied and shunned or exiled from their village.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n| title= Population Growth\n| 1951= 7457000\n| 1961= 9154000\n| 1971= 11637000\n| 1981= 14010000\n| 1991= 17615000\n| 2001= 20834000\n| 2011= 25540198\n| estimate=\n| estyear=\n| estref=\n| footnote=Source:Census of India<ref name=\"Census Population\">{{cite web|url=http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2006-07/chapt2007/tab97.pdf|title=Census Population|work=Census of India|publisher=Ministry of Finance India|accessdate=18 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219073658/http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2006-07/chapt2007/tab97.pdf|archive-date=19 December 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"2011census\">{{cite web|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/states.php|title=States Census 2011|work=Census of India|publisher=Ministry of Finance India|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214170814/http://www.census2011.co.in/states.php|archive-date=14 February 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|1901=4181554|1911=5191583|1921=5264976|1931=6028778|1941=6814886}}\nChhattisgarh has an urban population of 23.4% (around 5.1&nbsp;million people in 2011) residing in urban areas.

According to another local custom, women can choose to terminate a marriage relationship through a custom called ''chudi pahanana'', if she desires. Most of the old temples and shrines follow [[Shaktism]] and are goddess-centric (e.g., [[Shabari]], [[Mahamaya]], [[Danteshwari Temple|Danteshwari]]) and the existence of these temples gives insight into historical and current social fabric of this state. However, a mention of these progressive local customs in no way suggests that the ideology of female subservience does not exist in Chhattisgarh.

[[Champaran, Chhattisgarh|Champaran]] is a small town with religious significance as the birthplace of the saint [[Vallabha|Vallabhacharya]], increasingly important as a pilgrimage site for the Gujarati community.\n\nChhattisgarh has a significant role in the life of the Lord [[Rama]]. Lord Rama along with his wife Sita and his younger brother [[Lakshmana]] had started his ''[[Vanvas]]'' (exile) in the Bastar, then known as Dandakarayna. They lived more than 10 of their 14 years of Vanvas in different places of Chhattisgarh. One of the remarkable places is [[Shivrinarayan]] which is nearby [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh|Bilaspur]] district of Chhattisgarh. Shivrinarayan was named after an old lady [[Shabari]]. When Ram visited Shabari she said \"I do not have anything to offer other than my heart, but here are some berry fruits. May it please you, my Lord.\" Saying so, Shabari offered the fruits she had meticulously collected to Rama. When Rama was tasting them, Lakshmana raised the concern that Shabari had already tasted them and therefore unworthy of eating. To this Rama said that of the many types of food he had tasted, \"nothing could equal these berry fruits, offered with such devotion. You taste them, then alone will you know. Whomsoever offers a fruit, leaf, flower or some water with love, I partake it with great joy.\"\n\nThe [[Odia culture]] is prominent in the eastern parts of Chhattisgarh bordering Odisha.\n\n=== Literature ===\nChhattisgarh is a storehouse of literature, performing arts and crafts\u2014all of which derives its substance and sustenance from the day-to-day life experiences of its people. Religion, mythology, social and political events, nature and folklore are favourite motifs. Traditional crafts include painting, woodcarving, bell metal craft, bamboo ware, and tribal jewellery. Chhattisgarh has a rich literary heritage with roots that lie deep in the sociological and historical movements of the region. Its literature reflects the regional consciousness and the evolution of an identity distinct from others in Central India.\n\n=== Crafts ===\nChhattisgarh is known for \"Kosa silk\" and \"lost wax art\". Besides saris and salwar suits, the fabric is used to create lehengas, stoles, shawls and menswear including jackets, shirts, achkans and sherwanis. Works by the internationally renowned sculptor, Sushil Sakhuja's Dhokra Nandi, are available at the government's Shabagcrafts emporium, Raipur.\n\n=== Dance ===\nPanthi, Raut Nacha, Pandwani, Chaitra, Kaksar, Saila, Khamb-swang, Bhatra Naat, Rahas, Raai, Maao-Pata and Soowa are the several indigenous dance styles of Chhattisgarh.\n\nPanthi, the folk dance of the Satnami community, has religious overtones. Panthi is performed on Maghi Purnima, the anniversary of the birth of [[Ghasidas|Guru Ghasidas]]. The dancers dance around a jaitkhamb set up for the occasion, to songs eulogising their spiritual head. The songs reflect a view of ''[[nirvana]]'', conveying the spirit of their guru's renunciation and the teachings of saint poets like [[Kabir]], Ramdas and Dadu. Dancers with bent torsos and swinging arms dance, carried away by their devotion. As the rhythm quickens, they perform acrobatics and form human pyramids.<ref>{{cite web|title=Panthi Dance|url=http://www.sangeetnatak.org/deshparva/desaj/panthi.htm|accessdate=27 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002123235/http://www.sangeetnatak.org/deshparva/desaj/panthi.htm|archivedate=2 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Pandwani ====\n[[Pandavani]] is a folk ballad form performed predominantly in Chhattisgarh. It depicts the story of the Pandavas, the leading characters in the epic Mahabharata. The artists in the Pandavani narration consist of a lead artist and some supporting singers and musicians. There are two styles of narration in Pandavani, Vedamati, and Kapalik. In the Vedamati style, the lead artist narrates in a simple manner by sitting on the floor throughout the performance. The Kaplik style is livelier, where the narrator actually enacts the scenes and characters. Padmvibhushan Tijan Bai is most popular artist of Pandwani<ref>{{cite web|title=Pandawani|url=http://durg.gov.in/DistrictProfile_ArtsAndCulture.html|accessdate=27 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830152418/http://durg.gov.in/DistrictProfile_ArtsAndCulture.html|archive-date=30 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Raut Nacha ====\nRaut Nacha, the folk dance of cowherds, is a traditional dance of Yaduvanshis (clan of [[Yadu]]) as symbol of worship to [[Krishna]] from the 4th day of Diwali (Goverdhan Puja) till the time of Dev Uthani Ekadashi (day of awakening of the gods after a brief rest) which is the 11th day after Diwali according to the Hindu calendar.

In 1905, the [[Sambalpur district]] was transferred to Odisha and the estates of Surguja were transferred from Bengal to Chhattisgarh.\n\nThe area constituting the new state merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956, under the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]] and remained a part of that state for 44 years. Prior to its becoming a part of the new state of Madhya Pradesh, the region was part of old Madhya Pradesh State, with its capital at Bhopal. Prior to that, the region was part of the [[Central Provinces and Berar]] (CP and Berar) under British rule. Some areas constituting the Chhattisgarh state were [[princely state]]s under the British rule, but later on were merged into Madhya Pradesh.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cgfinance.nic.in/FSFC/State%20Finance%20Report/English/Chap-4.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502133300/http://cgfinance.nic.in/FSFC/State%20Finance%20Report/English/Chap-4.pdf |archive-date=2 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Separation of Chhattisgarh ===\n[[File:Secretariat in Naya Raipur.JPG|thumb|Mantralaya in Naya (New) Raipur]]\nThe present state of Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 2000.<ref name=\"cgfinance.nic.in\" /><ref name=\"zeenews.india.com\" /> The demand for a separate state was first raised in the 1920s.

In the mid-1990s, most of Chhattisgarh was still a monocrop belt. Only one-fourth to one-fifth of the sown area was double-cropped. When a very substantial portion of the population is dependent on agriculture, a situation where nearly 80% of a state's area is covered only by one crop, immediate attention to turn them into double crop areas is needed. Also, very few cash crops are grown in Chhattisgarh, so there is a need to diversify the agriculture produce towards oilseeds and other cash crops. Chhattisgarh is also called the \"rice bowl of central India\".<ref name=\"Agriculture in Chhattisgarh\" />\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Kodo Millet in Chhattisgarh.jpg|Kodo Millet is used as a life saving medicine in Chhattisgarh\nFile:Bastar Beer.jpg|Bastar beer prepared from Sulfi\n</gallery>\n\n==== Irrigation ====\nIn Chhattisgarh, rice, the main crop, is grown on about 77% of the net sown area. Only about 20% of the area is under irrigation; the rest depends on rain. Of the three agroclimatic zones, about 73% of the Chhattisgarh plains, 97% of the Bastar plateau and 95% of the northern hills are rainfed. The irrigated area available for double cropping is only 87,000&nbsp;ha in Chhattisgarh plains and 2300&nbsp;ha in Bastar plateau and northern hills. Due to this, the productivity of rice and other crops is low, hence the farmers are unable to obtain economic benefits from agriculture and it has remained as subsistence agriculture till now, though agriculture is the main occupation of more than 80% of the population.<ref name=\"nhm.nic.in\" />\n\nIn Chhattisgarh region, about 22% of net cropped area was under irrigation as compared to 36.5% in Madhya Pradesh in 1998\u201399, whereas the average national irrigation was about 40%. The irrigation is characterised by a high order of variability ranging from 1.6% in Bastar to 75.0% in Dhamtari. Based on an average growth trend in the irrigated area, about 0.43% additional area is brought under irrigation every year as compared to 1.89% in Madhya Pradesh and 1.0% in the country as a whole. Thus, irrigation has been growing at a very low rate in Chhattisgarh and the pace of irrigation is so slow, it would take about 122 years to reach the 75% level of net irrigated area in Chhattisgarh at the present rate of growth.<ref name=\"nhm.nic.in\" />\n\nChhattisgarh has a limited [[irrigation]] system, with dams and [[canal]]s on some rivers. Average rainfall in the state is around 1400&nbsp;mm and the entire state falls under the rice agroclimatic zone. The Large variation in the yearly rainfall directly affects the production of rice. Irrigation is the prime need of the state for its overall development and therefore the state government has given top priority to development of irrigation.<ref name=\"Agriculture in Chhattisgarh\" />\n\nA total of four major, 33 medium and 2199 minor irrigation projects have been completed and five major, nine medium and 312 minor projects are under construction, as of 31 March 2006.{{Update inline|date=August 2019|reason=These numbers are from over ten years ago.

Based on the current production of surplus electric power, the position of the State is comfortable and profitable. The Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (CSEB) is in a strong position to meet the electricity requirement of the state and is in good financial health. According to [[Central Electricity Authority (India)|Central Electricity Authority]] (CEA), Chhattisgarh provides electricity to several other states because of surplus production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/chhattisgarh-is-power-surplus-state--confirms-cea-report.html|title=Chhattisgarh is power surplus state, confirms CEA report|last=Pioneer|first=The|website=The Pioneer|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn Chhattisgarh, [[National Thermal Power Corporation Limited]] (|NTPC) has [[Sipat Thermal Power Station]] with a capacity of 2,980 MW at Sipat, Bilaspur; [[LARA Super Thermal Power Station]] with a nameplate capacity of 1600MW and [[Korba Super Thermal Power Station]] with a capacity of 2,600 MW at Korba, while CSEB's units have a thermal capacity of 1,780 MW and hydel capacity of 130 MW. Apart from NTPC and CSEB, there are a number of private generation units of large and small capacity.

To use this vast potential, substantial additions to the existing generation capacity are already underway.<ref name=\"Power Sector in Chhattisgarh\" />\n\n==== Steel sector ====\nThe steel industry is one of the biggest heavy industries of Chhattisgarh. Bhilai Steel Plant, Bhilai operated by [[Steel Authority of India Limited|SAIL]], with a capacity of 5.4&nbsp;million tonnes per year, is regarded as a significant growth indicator of the state. More than 100 steel rolling mills, 90 sponge iron plants and ferro-alloy units are in Chhattisgarh. Along with Bhilai, today Raipur, Bilaspur, Korba and Raigarh have become the steel hub of Chhattisgarh. Today, Raipur has become the centre of the steel sector, the biggest market for steel in India.<ref name=\"Industries in Chhattisgarh\">{{cite web|title=Industries in Chhattisgarh|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/chhattisgarh-industries.html|accessdate=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810083204/http://www.mapsofindia.com/chhattisgarh/economy/chhattisgarh-industries.html|archive-date=10 August 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Aluminium sector ====\nThe aluminium industry of Chhattisgarh was established by Bharat Aluminium Company Limited, which has a capacity of around 600,000 tonnes each year.<ref name=\"Industries in Chhattisgarh\" />\n\n==== Natural resources ====\n\n===== Forest =====\nForests occupy 41.33% of the total area (as per the latest report by the [[Indian Forest Service]]) and the rich forest resources include wood, tendu leaves, [[honey]] and lac.

The Average Literacy rate in Chhattisgarh for Urban regions was 84.05 percent in which males were 90.58% literate while female literacy stood at 73.39%. Total literates in the urban region of Chhattisgarh were 4,370,966.<ref name=\"census2011.co.in\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census2011.co.in/census/state/chhattisgarh.html|title=Chhattisgarh Population Sex Ratio in Chhattisgarh Literacy rate data|website=census2011.co.in|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808042246/http://www.census2011.co.in/census/state/chhattisgarh.html|archive-date=8 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAccording to NSS (2007\u201308), the literacy rate for [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Scheduled Castes (SCs)]] was better than the corresponding national average.\n\nAmong the marginalised groups, STs are at the bottom of the rankings, further emphasising the lack of social development in the state. Bastar and Dantewada in south Chhattisgarh are the most illiterate districts and the drop out ratio is the highest among all the districts. The reason for this is the extreme poverty in rural areas.\n\n=== Health Index ===\nAs per census 2011, the State has population of 25.5&nbsp;million and six medical colleges ( five Government and one private) with intake capacity of 700 students and doctor patient ratio of 1:17,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chhattisgarh a poor State with low health indices: CAG |url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2017/state-editions/chhattisgarh-a-poor-state-with-low-health-indices-cag.html |website=The Pioneer |accessdate=29 September 2018 |date=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929233452/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2017/state-editions/chhattisgarh-a-poor-state-with-low-health-indices-cag.html |archive-date=29 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nUnder The NITI Aayog released Health Index report titled, \"Healthy States, Progressive India.\"- Chhattisgarh has an index of 52.02 Out of 100, which is better than states such as Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha, Bihar, Assam, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pandey |first1=Kundan |title=NITI Aayog's Health Index: Kerala on top; Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh among worst performers |url=https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/niti-aayog-s-health-index-kerala-on-top-rajasthan-uttar-pradesh-among-worst-performers-59663 |website=Down To Earth |accessdate=29 September 2018 |date=9 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810142701/https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/niti-aayog-s-health-index-kerala-on-top-rajasthan-uttar-pradesh-among-worst-performers-59663 |archive-date=10 August 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite different health related schemes and programmes, the health indicators such as the percentage of women with BMI<18.5, Under Five Mortality Rate and underweight children are poor. This may be due to the difficulty in accessing the remote areas in the state. The prevalence of female malnutrition in Chhattisgarh is higher than the national average\u2014half of the ST females are malnourished. The performance of SCs is a little better than the corresponding national and state average. The Under Five Mortality Rate among STs is significantly higher than the national average.\n\n=== Net state domestic product ===\nChhattisgarh is one of the emerging states with relatively high growth rates of net state domestic product (NSDP) (8.2% vs. 7.1% All India over 2002\u20132008) and per capita NSDP (6.2% vs. 5.4% All India over 2002\u20132008). The growth rates of the said parameters are above the national averages and thus it appears that Chhattisgarh is catching up with other states in this respect. However, the state still has very low levels of per capita income as compared to the other states.\n\n=== Urbanisation ===\nOut of total population of Chhattisgarh, 23.24% people live in urban regions. The total figure of population living in urban areas is 5,937,237 of which 3,035,469 are males and while remaining 2,901,768 are females.\n\nRaipur, Durg, Bhilai Nagar, Bilaspur, Korba, Jagdalpur, Rajnandgaon and Raigarh are some of the urban towns and cities in the region.<ref name=\"census2011.co.in\" />\n\n=== Sex ratio ===\nThere are more than 13 million males and 12.9&nbsp; million females in Chhattisgarh, which constitutes 2.11% of the country's population. The [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] in the state is one of the most balanced in India with 991 females per 1,000 males, as is the child sex-ratio with 964 females per 1,000 males (Census 2011)\n\n=== Fertility rate ===\nChhattisgarh has a fairly high fertility rate (3.1) as compared to All India (2.6) and the replacement rate (2.1). It has a rural fertility rate of 3.2 and urban fertility rate of 2.1.\n\n=== SC and ST population ===\nWith the exception of the hilly states of the north-east, Chhattisgarh has one of highest shares of Scheduled Tribe (ST) populations within a state, accounting for about 10 percent of the STs in India. Scheduled Tribes make up 30.62% of the population. The tribals are an important part of the state population and mainly inhabit the dense forests of Bastar and other districts of south Chhattisgarh. The percentage increase in the population of the scheduled list of tribals during the 2001\u20132011 decade had been at the rate of 18.23%. The Scheduled Caste (SC) population of Chhattisgarh is 2,418,722 as per 2001 census constituting 11.6 percent of the total population (20,833,803). The proportion of Scheduled Castes has increased from 11.6 percent in 2001 to 12.8% in 2011.\n\n=== Poverty ===\n[[File:Diospyros melanoxylon Tendu.jpg|thumb|[[Tendu (tree)|Tendu]] Patta (Leaf) collection in Chhattisgarh, India.]]\nThe incidence of poverty in Chhattisgarh is very high. The estimated poverty ratio in 2004\u201305 based on uniform reference period consumption was around 50 per cent, which is approximately double the all India level. The incidence of poverty in the rural and urban areas is almost the same.\n\nMore than half of the rural STs and urban SCs are poor. In general, the proportion of poor SC and ST households in the state is higher than the state average and their community's respective national averages (except for rural SC households). Given that more than 50 percent of the state's population is ST and SC, the high incidence of income poverty among them is a matter of serious concern in the state.\n\nThis indicates that the good economic performance in recent years has not percolated to this socially deprived group, which is reflected in their poor performance in human development indicators.\n\n=== Access to drinking water ===\nIn terms of access to improved drinking water sources, at the aggregate level, Chhattisgarh fared better than the national average and the SCs of the state performed better than the corresponding national average. Scheduled Tribes are marginally below the state average, but still better than the STs at the all India level.\n\nThe proportion of households with access to improved sources of drinking water in 2008\u201309 was 91%. This proportion was over 90% even in states like Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. This was largely because these states had over 70% of their households accessing tube wells/hand-pumps as sources of drinking water.\n\n=== Sanitation ===\nSanitation facilities in the state were abysmally low with only about 41 percent having toilet facilities before the [[Swachh Bharat Mission]] was Launched by the Government of India. The Urban areas of Chhattisgarh attained the title of open defecation free on 2 October 2017 and the rural areas have achieved a 90.31% sanitation coverage. What sets Chhattisgarh apart from other states of India is an approach to bring in behavioural change in order to get open defecation free status. In Chhattisgarh, people don't get toilet incentives, they have to construct the toilet with their own money, after using the toilet for 3 months they are entitled for the incentive amount.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/commendable-progress-urban-rural-sanitation-chhattisgarh-way-open-defecation-free-12041/|title=With Commendable Progress in Both Urban And Rural Sanitation, Chhattisgarh Is on Its Way To Be Open Defecation Free \u2013 Swachh Report Card|date=19 September 2017|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810143753/https://swachhindia.ndtv.com/commendable-progress-urban-rural-sanitation-chhattisgarh-way-open-defecation-free-12041/|archive-date=10 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Teledensity ===\nAcross states, it has been found that [[teledensity]] (telephone density) was below 10 percent in 2010 for Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, reflecting a lack of access to telephones in these relatively poorer states. But due to development of new technology the teledensity in 2017 is 68.08 percent which shows improvement of telecom infrastructure. On the other hand, for states like Delhi and Himachal Pradesh and metropolitan cities like Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai, teledensity was over 100 percent in 2010 implying that individuals have more than one telephone connection.\n\n=== Road density ===\nThe total density of National Highways (NHs) in Chhattisgarh is at 23.4&nbsp;km per 1,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> out of the total length of 3,168&nbsp;km in the State, the Central Government has informed.\nChhattisgarh Government had completed construction of 5,266 cement concrete (CC) roads having a total length of 1,530&nbsp;km in various villages of the State as on 31 May 2016 under 'Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana'.<ref>{{cite web |title=23.4&nbsp;km per 1000 sq. kms NH road density in Chhattisgarh: Centre |url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2016/state-editions/234-kms-per-1000-sq-kms-nh-road-density-in-chhattisgarh-centre.html |website=The Pioneer |accessdate=29 September 2018 |date=15 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929233445/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2016/state-editions/234-kms-per-1000-sq-kms-nh-road-density-in-chhattisgarh-centre.html |archive-date=29 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n=== Witchcraft ===\n[[File:Mission Against Witchcraft.jpg|thumb|Social Mission Against Blind Faith|alt=|left]]To bring about social reforms and with a view to discourage undesirable social practices, Chhattisgarh government has enacted the Chhattisgarh Tonhi Atyachar (Niwaran) Act, 2005 against witchery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dark Spell|url=http://newsblaze.com/story/20091108150914shan.nb/topstory.html|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=8 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125204907/http://newsblaze.com/story/20091108150914shan.nb/topstory.html|archive-date=25 November 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Much has to be done on the issue of law enforcement by judicial authorities to protect women in this regard, bringing such persecution to an end.<ref name=\"womennewsnetwork.net\" />\n\nSome sections of tribal population of Chhattisgarh state believe in [[witchcraft]].<ref name=\"womennewsnetwork.net\">{{cite web|title=India: Protective Laws Fall Short for Women Charged with Witchcraft|url=http://womennewsnetwork.net/2010/03/21/witchcraft-india-89/|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=21 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702111614/http://womennewsnetwork.net/2010/03/21/witchcraft-india-89/|archive-date=2 July 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Women are believed to have access to supernatural forces and are accused of being witches (''tonhi'') often to settle personal scores.\n\nAs of 2010, they are still hounded out of villages on the basis of flimsy accusations by male village sorcerers paid to do so by villagers with personal agendas, such as property and goods acquisition.<ref name=\"womennewsnetwork.net\" /> According to [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] Channel's investigations, those accused are fortunate if they are only verbally bullied and shunned or exiled from their village.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{IndiaCensusPop\n| title= Population Growth\n| 1951= 7457000\n| 1961= 9154000\n| 1971= 11637000\n| 1981= 14010000\n| 1991= 17615000\n| 2001= 20834000\n| 2011= 25540198\n| estimate=\n| estyear=\n| estref=\n| footnote=Source:Census of India<ref name=\"Census Population\">{{cite web|url=http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2006-07/chapt2007/tab97.pdf|title=Census Population|work=Census of India|publisher=Ministry of Finance India|accessdate=18 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219073658/http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2006-07/chapt2007/tab97.pdf|archive-date=19 December 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"2011census\">{{cite web|url=http://www.census2011.co.in/states.php|title=States Census 2011|work=Census of India|publisher=Ministry of Finance India|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214170814/http://www.census2011.co.in/states.php|archive-date=14 February 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|1901=4181554|1911=5191583|1921=5264976|1931=6028778|1941=6814886}}\nChhattisgarh has an urban population of 23.4% (around 5.1&nbsp;million people in 2011) residing in urban areas.

Although this ratio is small compared to other states, it is unique in India because Chhattisgarh is the 10th-largest state in India.\n\nThe gender ratio (number of females per 1,000 males) has been steadily declining over 20th century in Chhattisgarh. But it is conspicuous that Chhattisgarh always had a better female-to-male ratio compared with national average.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

According to another local custom, women can choose to terminate a marriage relationship through a custom called ''chudi pahanana'', if she desires. Most of the old temples and shrines follow [[Shaktism]] and are goddess-centric (e.g., [[Shabari]], [[Mahamaya]], [[Danteshwari Temple|Danteshwari]]) and the existence of these temples gives insight into historical and current social fabric of this state. However, a mention of these progressive local customs in no way suggests that the ideology of female subservience does not exist in Chhattisgarh. On the contrary, the male authority and dominance is seen quite clearly in the social and cultural life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Social Structure in Chhattisgarh |url=http://www.korbacity.com/index.php/know-more-about-chhattisgarh/chhattisgarh-social-structure.html |accessdate=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720005404/http://www.korbacity.com/index.php/know-more-about-chhattisgarh/chhattisgarh-social-structure.html |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Temple Carvings in Malhar Bilaspur Chhattisgarh 2009.jpg|thumb|A carving in the 10th- or 11th-century Hindu temple of Malhar village.

[[Champaran, Chhattisgarh|Champaran]] is a small town with religious significance as the birthplace of the saint [[Vallabha|Vallabhacharya]], increasingly important as a pilgrimage site for the Gujarati community.\n\nChhattisgarh has a significant role in the life of the Lord [[Rama]]. Lord Rama along with his wife Sita and his younger brother [[Lakshmana]] had started his ''[[Vanvas]]'' (exile) in the Bastar, then known as Dandakarayna. They lived more than 10 of their 14 years of Vanvas in different places of Chhattisgarh. One of the remarkable places is [[Shivrinarayan]] which is nearby [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh|Bilaspur]] district of Chhattisgarh. Shivrinarayan was named after an old lady [[Shabari]]. When Ram visited Shabari she said \"I do not have anything to offer other than my heart, but here are some berry fruits. May it please you, my Lord.\" Saying so, Shabari offered the fruits she had meticulously collected to Rama. When Rama was tasting them, Lakshmana raised the concern that Shabari had already tasted them and therefore unworthy of eating. To this Rama said that of the many types of food he had tasted, \"nothing could equal these berry fruits, offered with such devotion. You taste them, then alone will you know. Whomsoever offers a fruit, leaf, flower or some water with love, I partake it with great joy.\"\n\nThe [[Odia culture]] is prominent in the eastern parts of Chhattisgarh bordering Odisha.\n\n=== Literature ===\nChhattisgarh is a storehouse of literature, performing arts and crafts\u2014all of which derives its substance and sustenance from the day-to-day life experiences of its people. Religion, mythology, social and political events, nature and folklore are favourite motifs. Traditional crafts include painting, woodcarving, bell metal craft, bamboo ware, and tribal jewellery. Chhattisgarh has a rich literary heritage with roots that lie deep in the sociological and historical movements of the region. Its literature reflects the regional consciousness and the evolution of an identity distinct from others in Central India.\n\n=== Crafts ===\nChhattisgarh is known for \"Kosa silk\" and \"lost wax art\". Besides saris and salwar suits, the fabric is used to create lehengas, stoles, shawls and menswear including jackets, shirts, achkans and sherwanis. Works by the internationally renowned sculptor, Sushil Sakhuja's Dhokra Nandi, are available at the government's Shabagcrafts emporium, Raipur.\n\n=== Dance ===\nPanthi, Raut Nacha, Pandwani, Chaitra, Kaksar, Saila, Khamb-swang, Bhatra Naat, Rahas, Raai, Maao-Pata and Soowa are the several indigenous dance styles of Chhattisgarh.\n\nPanthi, the folk dance of the Satnami community, has religious overtones. Panthi is performed on Maghi Purnima, the anniversary of the birth of [[Ghasidas|Guru Ghasidas]]. The dancers dance around a jaitkhamb set up for the occasion, to songs eulogising their spiritual head. The songs reflect a view of ''[[nirvana]]'', conveying the spirit of their guru's renunciation and the teachings of saint poets like [[Kabir]], Ramdas and Dadu. Dancers with bent torsos and swinging arms dance, carried away by their devotion. As the rhythm quickens, they perform acrobatics and form human pyramids.<ref>{{cite web|title=Panthi Dance|url=http://www.sangeetnatak.org/deshparva/desaj/panthi.htm|accessdate=27 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002123235/http://www.sangeetnatak.org/deshparva/desaj/panthi.htm|archivedate=2 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==== Pandwani ====\n[[Pandavani]] is a folk ballad form performed predominantly in Chhattisgarh. It depicts the story of the Pandavas, the leading characters in the epic Mahabharata. The artists in the Pandavani narration consist of a lead artist and some supporting singers and musicians. There are two styles of narration in Pandavani, Vedamati, and Kapalik. In the Vedamati style, the lead artist narrates in a simple manner by sitting on the floor throughout the performance. The Kaplik style is livelier, where the narrator actually enacts the scenes and characters.

{"title_page": "Justice delayed is justice denied", "text_new": "{{short description|Legal maxim}}\n'''\"Justice delayed is justice denied\"''' is a [[legal maxim]] meaning that if [[Legal remedy|legal redress]] or [[Equitable relief|equitable relief]] is available for a party that has suffered some injury, but is not forthcoming in a timely fashion, it is effectively the same as having no redress at all. This principle is the basis for the right to a [[speedy trial]] and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because it is unfair for the injured party to have to sustain the injury with little hope for resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for [[law reform|legal reformers]] who view [[court]]s or [[government]]s as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues either because the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour. When a court takes a matter \"under advisement\" {{ndash}} awaiting the issuance of a [[judicial opinion]], [[Court order|order]] or [[judgement]] and forestalls [[Adjudication|adjudication]] {{ndash}} the issue of timeliness of the decision comes into play.\n\n== Origin ==\nThere are conflicting accounts of who first noted the phrase.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

He used as illustrated \"a synonym of delay\" which yielded only disastrous consequences for the participants. The estate's court case goes on for 12 years, for reasons no one understands, and the entire estate is itself dissipated in the battle. As one writer notes:\n<blockquote>In the Victorian era, the Court of Chancery was a synonym of delay. In Bleak House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated, that no man alive knows what it means\" (BH1 16). As a consequence of this protraction, many characters involved in Jarndyce and Jarndyce are tortured by being held in painful anxiety\" one goes insand and another's mind is consumed with \u201ccorroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt\u201d (BH 630).\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickens.jp/archive/bh/bh-tsutsui.pdf|title=Delay and Suspense in Bleak House |last1=Mizuki |first1=Tsutsui |format=PDF |access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the preface to ''Bleak House'', Dickens cites two Chancery cases as especial inspirations, one of which was a \"[[friendly suit]]\":\n\n{{Quote|text=At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

He used as illustrated \"a synonym of delay\" which yielded only disastrous consequences for the participants. The estate's court case goes on for 12 years, for reasons no one understands, and the entire estate is itself dissipated in the battle. As one writer notes:\n<blockquote>In the Victorian era, the Court of Chancery was a synonym of delay. In Bleak House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated, that no man alive knows what it means\" (BH1 16). As a consequence of this protraction, many characters involved in Jarndyce and Jarndyce are tortured by being held in painful anxiety\" one goes insand and another's mind is consumed with \u201ccorroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt\u201d (BH 630).\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickens.jp/archive/bh/bh-tsutsui.pdf|title=Delay and Suspense in Bleak House |last1=Mizuki |first1=Tsutsui |format=PDF |access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the preface to ''Bleak House'', Dickens cites two Chancery cases as especial inspirations, one of which was a \"[[friendly suit]]\":\n\n{{Quote|text=At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun.

Kautsky was recognized as one of the most authoritative promulgators of [[Orthodox Marxism]] after the death of [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1895 until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914.\n\nFollowing the war, Kautsky was an outspoken critic of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], engaging in polemics with [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]], and [[Joseph Stalin]] on the nature of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet state]].\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n===Early years===\nKarl Kautsky was born in [[Prague]] of an artistic and middle class family - his parents were [[Johann Kautsky]] (a scenic designer) and Minna (an actress and writer). The family moved to [[Vienna]] when Kautsky was the age of seven. He studied [[history]], [[philosophy]] and [[economics]] at the [[University of Vienna]] from 1874, and became a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6) in 1875. In 1880 he joined a group of German socialists in [[Z\u00fcrich]] who were supported financially by [[Karl H\u00f6chberg]], and who smuggled socialist material into Germany at the time of the [[Anti-Socialist Laws]] (1878&ndash;1890).\n\n===Political career===\nIn 1883, Kautsky founded the monthly ''[[Die Neue Zeit]]'' (\"The New Times\") in [[Stuttgart]], which became a weekly in 1890. He edited the magazine until September 1917: this gave him a steady income and allowed him to propagate [[Marxism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.goucher.edu/history231/steenson.htm |author=Gary P Steenson |title= \"Not One Man!

His position as a prominent Marxist theorist was assured in 1888, when Engels put him to the task of editing Marx's three-volume work ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blackledge|first=Paul|title=Karl Kautsky and Marxist Historiography|journal=Science & Society|date=July 2006|volume=70|issue=3|pages=338|jstor=40404839}}</ref> In 1891 he co-authored the [[Erfurt Program]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) together with [[August Bebel]] and [[Eduard Bernstein]].\n\nFollowing the death of Engels in 1895, Kautsky became one of the most important and influential theoreticians of Marxism, representing the mainstream of the party together with [[August Bebel]], and outlining a Marxist theory of [[imperialism]]. When Bernstein attacked the traditional Marxist position of the necessity for revolution in the late 1890s, Kautsky denounced him, arguing that Bernstein's emphasis on the ethical foundations of Socialism opened the road to a call for an alliance with the \"progressive\" bourgeoisie and a non-class approach.\n\n===Wartime years===\nIn 1914, when the German Social-Democrat deputies in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] voted for war credits, Kautsky (who was not a deputy but attended their meetings) suggested abstaining.  Kautsky claimed that Germany was waging a defensive war against the threat of Czarist Russia. However, in June 1915, about ten months after the war had begun and when it had become obvious that this was going to be a sustained, appallingly brutal and costly struggle, he issued an appeal with Eduard Bernstein and [[Hugo Haase]] against the pro-war leaders of the SPD and denounced the German government's annexationist aims. In 1917 he left the SPD for the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD) with united Socialists who opposed the war.\n\nAfter the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|November Revolution]] in Germany, Kautsky served as under-secretary of State in the Foreign Office in the short-lived SPD-USPD revolutionary government and worked at finding documents which proved the war guilt of Imperial Germany.\n\n===Post-War Years===\n[[File:E.

He visited [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in 1920 and wrote a book on the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] that at that moment was still independent of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]]. By the time it was published in 1921, Georgia had been thoroughly influenced by the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Red Army had invaded Georgia]], and the Bolsheviks had [[Soviet Occupation Day (Georgia)|imposed]] the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. He assisted in the creation of the party program adopted in Heidelberg (1925) by the German Social Democratic Party. In 1924, at the age of 70, Kautsky moved back to Vienna with his family, and remained there until 1938. At the time of Hitler's [[Anschluss]], he fled to [[Czechoslovakia]] and thence by plane to [[Amsterdam]], where he died in the same year.\n\nKarl Kautsky lived in [[Berlin]]-[[Friedenau]] for many years; his wife, [[Luise Kautsky]], became a close friend of [[Rosa Luxemburg]], who also lived in Friedenau. A commemorative plaque marks where Kautsky lived at Saarstra\u00dfe 14.\n\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] described Kautsky as a \"renegade\" in his classic pamphlet \"The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky\"; Kautsky in turn castigated Lenin in his 1934 work ''Marxism and Bolshevism: Democracy and Dictatorship'':\n\n{{quote|The Bolsheviki under Lenin's leadership, however, succeeded in capturing control of the armed forces in Petrograd and later in Moscow and thus laid the foundation for a new dictatorship in place of the old Czarist dictatorship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1934/bolshevism/index.htm|title=Karl Kautsky: Marxism and Bolshevism (1934)|website=www.marxists.org}}</ref>}}\n\nBoth Lenin and Trotsky, however,  defended the Bolshevik Revolution as a legitimate and historic social upheaval akin to the [[French Revolution]], casting themselves and the Bolsheviks in the role of the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]], and viewing the \"opportunism\" of Kautsky and similar figures as a function of \"social bribery\" rooted in their increasing intimacy with the privileged classes.\n\nA collection of excerpts of Kautsky's writings, ''Social Democracy vs. Communism,'' discussed Bolshevist rule in Russia. He saw the Bolsheviks (or Communists) as a conspiratorial organization that had gained power by a coup and initiated revolutionary changes for which there was no economic rationale in Russia. Instead, a bureaucracy-dominated society developed, the miseries of which outweighed the problems of Western [[capitalism]].  He stated:\n\n{{quote|Foreign tourists in Russia stand in silent amazement before the gigantic enterprises created there, as they stand before the pyramids, for example. Only seldom does the thought occur to them what enslavement, what lowering of human self-esteem was connected with the construction of those gigantic establishments.<ref name=\"SDvC\">{{cite book|last=Kautsky |first=Karl |title=Social Democracy vs. Communism |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1930s/demvscom/index.htm |chapter=Is Soviet Russia A Socialist State?}}</ref>}}\n\nAnd:\n\n{{quote|They extracted the means for the creation of material productive forces by destroying the most essential productive force of all - the laboring man.

His son, {{Interlanguage link multi|Benedikt Kautsky|de|3=Benedikt Kautsky}} spent seven years in [[concentration camp]]s; his wife [[Luise Kautsky]] died in [[Auschwitz]].<ref>\nCallinicos, A.

Kautsky was recognized as one of the most authoritative promulgators of [[Orthodox Marxism]] after the death of [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1895 until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914.\n\nFollowing the war, Kautsky was an outspoken critic of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], engaging in polemics with [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]], and [[Joseph Stalin]] on the nature of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet state]].\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n===Early years===\nKarl Kautsky was born in [[Prague]] of an artistic and middle class family - his parents were [[Johann Kautsky]] (a scenic designer) and Minna (an actress and writer). The family moved to [[Vienna]] when Kautsky was the age of seven. He studied [[history]], [[philosophy]] and [[economics]] at the [[University of Vienna]] from 1874, and became a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6) in 1875. In 1880 he joined a group of German socialists in [[Z\u00fcrich]] who were supported financially by [[Karl H\u00f6chberg]], and who smuggled socialist material into Germany at the time of the [[Anti-Socialist Laws]] (1878&ndash;1890).\n\n===Political career===\nIn 1883, Kautsky founded the monthly ''[[Die Neue Zeit]]'' (\"The New Times\") in [[Stuttgart]], which became a weekly in 1890. He edited the magazine until September 1917: this gave him a steady income and allowed him to propagate [[Marxism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.goucher.edu/history231/steenson.htm |author=Gary P Steenson |title= \"Not One Man!

His position as a prominent Marxist theorist was assured in 1888, when Engels put him to the task of editing Marx's three-volume work ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Blackledge|first=Paul|title=Karl Kautsky and Marxist Historiography|journal=Science & Society|date=July 2006|volume=70|issue=3|pages=338|jstor=40404839}}</ref> In 1891 he co-authored the [[Erfurt Program]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) together with [[August Bebel]] and [[Eduard Bernstein]].\n\nFollowing the death of Engels in 1895, Kautsky became one of the most important and influential theoreticians of Marxism, representing the mainstream of the party together with [[August Bebel]], and outlining a Marxist theory of [[imperialism]]. When Bernstein attacked the traditional Marxist position of the necessity for revolution in the late 1890s, Kautsky denounced him, arguing that Bernstein's emphasis on the ethical foundations of Socialism opened the road to a call for an alliance with the \"progressive\" bourgeoisie and a non-class approach.\n\n===Wartime years===\nIn 1914, when the German Social-Democrat deputies in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] voted for war credits, Kautsky (who was not a deputy but attended their meetings) suggested abstaining.  Kautsky claimed that Germany was waging a defensive war against the threat of Czarist Russia. However, in June 1915, about ten months after the war had begun and when it had become obvious that this was going to be a sustained, appallingly brutal and costly struggle, he issued an appeal with Eduard Bernstein and [[Hugo Haase]] against the pro-war leaders of the SPD and denounced the German government's annexationist aims. In 1917 he left the SPD for the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD) with united Socialists who opposed the war.\n\nAfter the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|November Revolution]] in Germany, Kautsky served as under-secretary of State in the Foreign Office in the short-lived SPD-USPD revolutionary government and worked at finding documents which proved the war guilt of Imperial Germany.\n\n===Post-War Years===\n[[File:E.

He visited [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in 1920 and wrote a book on the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] that at that moment was still independent of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]]. By the time it was published in 1921, Georgia had been thoroughly influenced by the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Red Army had invaded Georgia]], and the Bolsheviks had [[Soviet Occupation Day (Georgia)|imposed]] the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. He assisted in the creation of the party program adopted in Heidelberg (1925) by the German Social Democratic Party. In 1924, at the age of 70, Kautsky moved back to Vienna with his family, and remained there until 1938. At the time of Hitler's [[Anschluss]], he fled to [[Czechoslovakia]] and thence by plane to [[Amsterdam]], where he died in the same year.\n\nKarl Kautsky lived in [[Berlin]]-[[Friedenau]] for many years; his wife, [[Luise Kautsky]], became a close friend of [[Rosa Luxemburg]], who also lived in Friedenau. A commemorative plaque marks where Kautsky lived at Saarstra\u00dfe 14.\n\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] described Kautsky as a \"renegade\" in his classic pamphlet \"The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky\"; Kautsky in turn castigated Lenin in his 1934 work ''Marxism and Bolshevism: Democracy and Dictatorship'':\n\n{{quote|The Bolsheviki under Lenin's leadership, however, succeeded in capturing control of the armed forces in Petrograd and later in Moscow and thus laid the foundation for a new dictatorship in place of the old Czarist dictatorship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1934/bolshevism/index.htm|title=Karl Kautsky: Marxism and Bolshevism (1934)|website=www.marxists.org}}</ref>}}\n\nBoth Lenin and Trotsky, however,  defended the Bolshevik Revolution as a legitimate and historic social upheaval akin to the [[French Revolution]], casting themselves and the Bolsheviks in the role of the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]], and viewing the \"opportunism\" of Kautsky and similar figures as a function of \"social bribery\" rooted in their increasing intimacy with the privileged classes.\n\nA collection of excerpts of Kautsky's writings, ''Social Democracy vs. Communism,'' discussed Bolshevist rule in Russia. He saw the Bolsheviks (or Communists) as a conspiratorial organization that had gained power by a coup and initiated revolutionary changes for which there was no economic rationale in Russia. Instead, a bureaucracy-dominated society developed, the miseries of which outweighed the problems of Western [[capitalism]].  He stated:\n\n{{quote|Foreign tourists in Russia stand in silent amazement before the gigantic enterprises created there, as they stand before the pyramids, for example. Only seldom does the thought occur to them what enslavement, what lowering of human self-esteem was connected with the construction of those gigantic establishments.<ref name=\"SDvC\">{{cite book|last=Kautsky |first=Karl |title=Social Democracy vs. Communism |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1930s/demvscom/index.htm |chapter=Is Soviet Russia A Socialist State?}}</ref>}}\n\nAnd:\n\n{{quote|They extracted the means for the creation of material productive forces by destroying the most essential productive force of all - the laboring man. In the terrible conditions created by the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Piatiletka]], people rapidly perished.

His son, {{Interlanguage link multi|Benedikt Kautsky|de|3=Benedikt Kautsky}} spent seven years in [[concentration camp]]s; his wife [[Luise Kautsky]] died in [[Auschwitz]].<ref>\nCallinicos, A. ''Social Theory: a historical introduction''.\n</ref>\n\nKautsky is notable for, in addition to his anti-[[Bolshevik]] polemics, his editing and publication of Marx's ''[[Capital, Volume IV]]'' (usually published as ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'').\n\n==Works in English==\n\n* ''The Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx.''

{"title_page": "Heliciculture", "text_new": "[[File:Eyragues-l-Escargot-des-Alpilles-5738.jpg|thumb|A snail farm near [[Eyragues]], [[Provence]], [[France]]]]\n'''Heliciculture''', commonly known as '''snail farming''', is the process of raising edible [[land snail]]s, primarily for human consumption or cosmetic use. The meat and  [[Snail caviar|snail eggs]] can be consumed as [[escargot]] and as a type of caviar respectively. Mucus, commonly known as [[snail slime]], has medical properties and is used in [[cosmetics]].\n\nPerhaps the best known edible land snail species in the [[Western world]] is the [[Helix pomatia]], commonly known as [[Roman snail]] or [[Burgundy snail]]. This species is however not fit for profitable snail farming, and normally harvested from nature.\n\nCommercial snail farming in the Western world is typically done with either the ''[[Cornu aspersum]],'' formerly known as Helix ''aspersa'' M\u00fcller'','' or the [[Helix aspersa Maxima|Helix ''aspersa'' Maxima]]. In tropical climates snail farming is typically done with the ''[[African snail]],'' which biologically does not fall in the family of [[Helicidae]], and the meat of which therefore may not be called escargot.\n\n== History ==\nRoasted snail shells have been found in [[archaeological]] excavations, an indication that snails have been eaten since prehistoric times.<ref>[http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~dlubell/Antibes.pdf Prehistoric edible land snails in the circum-Mediterranean: the archaeological evidence.], D.

Lubell.</ref>\n\n''Lumaca romana'', (translation: Roman snail), was an ancient method of snail farming or heliciculture in the region about [[Tarquinia]]. This snail farming method was described by [[:la:Quintus Fulvius Lippinus|Fulvius Lippinus]] (49 BC) and mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in ''De Re rustica'' III, 12.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/3*.html#12 De Re Rustica III, 12]</ref> The snails were fattened for human consumption using [[spelt]] and aromatic herbs. People usually raised snails in pens near the house, and these pens were called \"[[:la:Cochlea (animal)|cochlea]].\"\n\nThe Romans, in particular, are known to have considered escargot as an elite food, as noted in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. The Romans selected the best snails for breeding. Shells of the edible land snail species ''[[Otala lactea]]'' have been recovered in [[archaeological]] excavations of [[Volubilis]] in present-day [[Morocco]].<ref>C.

Andy Burnham (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906]</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described the snail garden of [[Fulvius Hirpinus]] 2,000 years ago as having separate sections for different species of snails. [[Hirpinus]] allegedly fed his snails on meal and wine.\n\n\"Wall fish\" were also often eaten in Britain, but were never as popular as on the continent. There, people often ate snails during [[Lent]], and in a few places, they consumed large quantities of snails at Mardi Gras or Carnival, as a foretaste of Lent.\n\nAccording to some sources, the French exported [[Helix aspersa|brown garden snails]] to California in the 1850s, raising them as the delicacy [[escargot]]. Other sources claim that Italian immigrants were the first to bring the snail to the United States.\n\n== Economic impact ==\nU.S. imports of snails were worth more than $4.5 million in 1995 and came from 24 countries. This includes preserved or prepared snails and snails that are live, fresh, chilled, or frozen. Major exporters to the U.S. are [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Greece]] and [[China]]. The U.S. exported live, fresh, chilled, or frozen snails worth $55,000 to 13 countries; most were shipped to [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Individual statistics are not available for U.S. exports of prepared or processed snails from the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]].\n\n== Edible land snail species ==\n[[File:Snails-Italy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Three different species of snails for sale in a market in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]\nEdible land snails range in size from about one millimeter long to the giant African snails, which occasionally grow up to {{convert|312|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in length. \"Escargot\" most commonly refers to either ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' or to ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', although other varieties of snails are eaten. ''[[Achatina fulica]]'', a giant African snail, is sliced and [[Canning|canned]] and passed off on some consumers as escargot. Terms such as \"garden snail\" or \"common brown garden snail\" are rather meaningless since they refer to so many types of snails, but they sometimes mean ''H. aspersa''.\n* ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' is also known as the French \"petit gris,\" \"small grey snail,\" the \"escargot chagrine,\" or \"la zigrinata.\" The shell of a mature adult has four to five whorls and measures 30 to 45&nbsp;mm across. It is native to the shores of the Mediterranean and up the coast of Spain and France. It is found on many British Isles, where the Romans introduced it in the 1st century AD (Some references say it dates to the Early Bronze Age.) In the early 19th century the French brought it into California, where it has become a serious pest. These snails are now common throughout the U.S. It was introduced into several Eastern and Gulf states even before 1850 and, later introduced into other countries such as Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, and Argentina. ''C. aspersum'' has a life span of 2 to 5 years. This species is more adaptable to different climates and conditions than many snails, and is found in woods, fields, sand dunes, and gardens. This adaptability not only increases ''C. aspersum's'' range, but it also makes farming ''C. aspersum'' easier and less risky.\n* ''[[Helix pomatia]]'' measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It also is called the \"Roman snail,\" \"apple snail,\" \"lunar,\" \"la vignaiola,\" the German \"Weinbergschnecke,\" the French \"escargot de Bourgogne\" or \"Burgundy snail,\" or \"gros blanc.\" Native over a large part of Europe, it lives in wooded mountains and valleys up to {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} altitude and in vineyards and gardens. The Romans may have introduced it into Britain. Immigrants introduced it into the U.S. in Michigan and Wisconsin. Many prefer ''H. pomatia'' to ''H. aspersa'' for its flavor and its larger size, as the \"escargot par excellence.\"\n* ''[[Otala lactea]]'' is sometimes called the \"vineyard snail,\" \"milk snail,\" or \"Spanish snail.\" The shell is white with reddish brown spiral bands and measures about 26 to 35&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n* ''[[Iberus alonensis]]'', the Spanish \"vaqueta\" or \"serrana,\" measures about 30&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n[[File:Cepaea nemoralis pair banded shells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'']]\n* ''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'', the \"grove snail,\" or the Spanish \"vaqueta,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm across the shell. It inhabits Central Europe and was introduced into, and is now naturalized in many U.S. states, from Massachusetts to California, and from Tennessee to Canada. Its habitat ranges widely from woods to dunes. It mainly eats dead plant material, but it likes nettles and buttercups and will eat dead worms and dead snails.\n* ''[[Cepaea hortensis]]'', the \"white-lipped snail,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm across the shell which often has distinct dark stripes. It is native to central and northern Europe. This species was introduced into Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire in colonial times, but it never became established in these states. Its habitat varies but ''C. hortensis'' is found in colder and wetter places than ''C. nemoralis''. Their smaller size and some people's opinion that they do not taste as good make ''C. hortensis'' and ''C. nemoralis'' less popular than the larger European land snails.\n* ''[[Otala punctata]]'', called \"vaqueta\" in some parts of Spain, measures about 35&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n* ''[[Eobania vermiculata]]'', the \"vinyala,\" \"mongeta,\" or \"xona,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm. It is found in Mediterranean countries and was introduced into Louisiana and Texas.\n* ''[[Helix lucorum]]'', sometimes called \"escargo turc,\" measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It is found in central Italy and from Yugoslavia through the Crimea to Turkey and around the Black Sea.\n* ''[[Helix adanensis]]'' comes from around Turkey.\n* ''[[Helix aperta]]'' measures about 25&nbsp;mm. Its meat is highly prized. It is native to France, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries and has become established in California and Louisiana. Sometimes known as the \"burrowing snail,\" it is found above ground only during rainy weather. In hot, dry weather, it burrows three to six inches into the ground and becomes dormant until rain soften the soil.\n* ''[[Theba pisana]]'', also called the \"banded snail\"or the \"cargol avellanenc,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm and lives on dry, exposed sites, usually near the sea. Native to Sicily, it has been spread to several European countries, including England. This snail is a serious garden pest and is the \"white snail\" that California once eradicated by using flamethrowers to burn off whole areas. In large numbers, up to 3,000 snails per tree, it can ravage a garden in 24 hours and a citrus or other crop in a couple of nights.\n* ''[[Sphincterochila candidissima]]'' or ''[[Leucochroa candidisima]]'', the \"cargol mongeta,\" or \"cargol jueu\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm.\n[[File:Achatina fulica Thailand.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Achatina fulica]]'']]\n* ''[[Achatina fulica]]'' and other ''Achatina'' species, giant African snails. They can grow up to 326&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;ft \u00be in) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odor that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S. has made considerable effort to eradicate ''Achatina''. The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live Giant African snails.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/29/illegal-giant-snails-threatening-america/|title=Illegal giant snails threatening America|date=2014-08-29|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant \"tiger stripes\" on their shells.\n\n== Biology ==\n\n=== Mating and egg laying ===\n\n==== General ====\nSnails are [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although they have both male and female [[reproductive organ]]s, they must mate with another snail of the same species before they lay eggs. Some snails may act as males one season and as females the next. Other snails play both roles at once and [[fertilize]] each other simultaneously. When the snail is large enough and mature enough, which may take several years, mating occurs in the late spring or early summer after several hours of [[courtship]]. Sometimes there is a second mating in summer. (In tropical climates, mating may occur several times a year. In some climates, snails mate around October and may mate a second time 2 weeks later.) After mating, the snail can store sperm received for up to a year, but it usually lays eggs within a few weeks. Snails are sometimes uninterested in mating with another snail of the same species that originated from a considerable distance away. For example, a ''H. aspersa'' from southern France may reject a ''H. aspersa'' from northern France.\n\n==== Helix ''pomatia''====\nSnails need soil at least 2&nbsp;inches deep in which to lay their eggs. For ''H. pomatia'', the soil should be at least 3&nbsp;inches deep to keep out pests such as [[ants]], [[earwig]]s, [[millipede]]s, etc. Dry soil is not suitable for the preparation of a nest, nor is soil that is too heavy. In clay soil that becomes hard, reproduction rates may decrease because the snails are unable to bury their eggs and the hatchlings have difficulty emerging from the nest. Hatchability of eggs depends on soil temperature, soil humidity, soil composition, etc. Soil consisting of 20% to 40% organic material is good. The soil should be kept at {{convert|41|to|50|F|C}}, and is best around {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Soil moisture should be maintained at 80%. One researcher removes eggs immediately after they are deposited, counts them, then keeps them on moist cotton until the eggs hatch and the young start to eat. Snails lose substantial weight by laying eggs. Some do not recover. About one-third of the snails will die after the breeding season.\n\n''H. pomatia'' eggs measure about 3&nbsp;mm in diameter and have a [[calcareous]] shell and a high [[yolk]] content. ''H. pomatia'' lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after mating, in holes dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head into the hole or may crawl in until only the top of the shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about a dozen more a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is [[glycoprotein]] similar to eggwhite.\n\nFully developed baby ''H. pomatia'' snails hatch about 3 to 4 weeks after the eggs are laid, depending on temperature and humidity. Birds, insects, mice, toads and other predators take a heavy toll on the young snails. The snails eat and grow until the weather turns cold. They then dig a deep hole, sometimes as deep as {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on}}, and seal themselves inside their shell and hibernate for the winter. This is a response to both decreasing temperature and shorter hours of daylight. When the ground warms up in spring, the snail emerges and goes on a binge of replacing lost moisture and eating.\n\n==== Helix ''aspersa''====\n''H. aspersa'' eggs are white, spherical, about {{cvt|3|mm|in|frac=8}} in diameter and are laid 5 days to 3 weeks after mating. (Data varies widely due to differences in climate and regional variations in the snails' habitats.) ''H. aspersa'' lays an average of 85 eggs in a nest that is {{convert|1|to|1+1/2|in|cm}} deep. Data varies from 30 to over 120 eggs, but high figures may be from when more than one snail lays eggs in the same nest.\n\nIn warm, damp climates, ''H. aspersa'' may lay eggs as often as five times from February through October, depending on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when there are at least 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days to break out of the sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, ''H. aspersa'' matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, ''H. aspersa'' hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early [[hatchlings]], the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some ''H. aspersa'' mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of ''H. aspersa's'' reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.\n\n====Achatina ''fulica''====\nBy contrast, one giant African snail, ''Achatina fulica'', lays 100 to 400 [[elliptical]] eggs that each measure about 5&nbsp;mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, usually in the wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in the ground like ''H. pomatia'', or lay eggs on the surface of a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs hatch releasing snails about 4&nbsp;mm long. These snails grow up to 10&nbsp;mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35&nbsp;mm long and may already be sexually mature. [[Sexual maturity]] takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of [[calcium]]. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.\n\n=== Growth ===\nWithin the same snail population and under the same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature. This may help the species survive bad weather, etc., in the wild. However, a snail farmer should obviously select and keep the largest and fastest maturing snails for breeding stock and sell the smaller snails. By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in only a couple of generations. Most of the differences in growth are probably due to environmental factors including stocking density. However, to whatever extent these differences are genetic, farmers generally breed large, fast-growing snails instead of small, slower-growing ones.\n\nSeveral factors can greatly influence the growth of snails including: population density, stress (snails are sensitive to noise, light, vibration, unsanitary conditions, irregular feedings, being touched, etc.), feed, temperature and moisture, and the breeding technology used.\n\n''H. aspersa'' requires at least 3% to 4% calcium in the soil (or another source of calcium) for good growth. Most snails need more calcium in the soil than ''H. aspersa''. Low calcium intake will slow the growth rate and cause the shell to be thinner. Calcium may be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. Food is only one calcium source. Snails may eat paint or attack walls of buildings seeking calcium, and they also will eat dirt.\n\nA newborn's shell size depends on the egg size since the shell develops from the egg's surface membrane. As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell will develop a flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; there will be no further shell growth. Growth is measured by shell size, since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.\n\nDryness inhibits growth and even stops activity. When it becomes too hot and dry in summer, the snail becomes inactive, seals its shell and [[estivation|estivates]] (becomes dormant) until cooler, moister weather returns. Some snails estivate in groups on tree trunks, posts, or walls. They seal themselves to the surface, thus sealing up the shell opening.\n\nPeak snail activity (including feeding and thus growth) occurs a few hours after sunset, when the temperature is lower and the water content (in the form of [[dew]]) is higher. During daytime snails usually seek shelter.\n\n<br />\n\n== Values of the snail ==\n\n=== Nutritional value ===\nThe nutrient composition of raw snails (per 100&nbsp;grams of edible portion), according to information from the nutrient databank of France,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} is:\n\n*[[Food energy|Energy]]: 80.5 [[calorie|kcal]] (337 [[kilojoule|kJ]])\n*[[Water]]: 79 g\n*[[Protein]]: 16 g\n* Available [[carbohydrates]]: 2 g\n*[[Fiber]]: 0 g\n*[[Fat]]: 1 g\n*[[Magnesium]]: 250&nbsp;mg\n*[[Calcium]]: 170&nbsp;mg\n*[[Iron]]: 3.5&nbsp;mg\n*[[Vitamin C]]: 0&nbsp;mg\n\n=== Biochemical content ===\n\n== Farming snails ==\nSuccessful snail culture requires the correct equipment and supplies, including: [[snail pens]] or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity ([[hygrometer]]), temperature ([[thermometer]]), soil moisture ([[soil moisture sensor]]), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and an instrument to measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate ([[temperature]] and [[humidity]]), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails of the same kind and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.\n\nFour systems of snail farms can be distinguished:\n* Outdoor pens.\n* In buildings with a controlled climate.\n* In closed systems such as plastic tunnel houses or \"[[greenhouse]]s.\"\n* In addition, snails may breed and hatch inside in a controlled environment and then (after 6 to 8 weeks) may be placed in outside pens to mature.\n\n=== Favorable conditions ===\n\n'''Climate''': A mild climate {{convert|15|-|25|C|F}} with high humidity (75% to 95%) is best for snail farming, though most varieties can stand a wider range of temperatures. The optimal temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for many varieties. When the temperature falls below {{convert|7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, snails hibernate. Under {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} the snails are inactive, and under {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, all growth stops. When the temperature rises much above {{convert|27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} or conditions become too dry, snails estivate. Wind is bad for snails because it speeds up moisture loss, and snails must retain moisture.\n\n'''Moisture''': Snails thrive in damp but not waterlogged environments and thus a well-draining soil is required. Research indicates that water content around 80% of the carrying capacity of the soil and air [[humidity]] over 80% (during darkness) are the most favorable conditions. Many farmers use [[Aerosol spray|mist-producing devices]] to maintain proper moisture in the air and/or soil.<ref>http://publications.cta.int/publications/publication/1497/</ref> Also, if the system contains alive vegetation, the leaves are to be periodically wet.\n\n'''[[Soil]]''': Snails dig in soil and ingest it. Good soil favors snail growth and provides some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may cause fragile shells even when the snails have well-balanced feed; the snails growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails will often eat feed, then go eat dirt. Sometimes, they will eat only one or the other.\n\nA well-functional soil would have the following characteristics:\n* Containing neither a lot of [[sand]] nor too much [[clay]], as snails strive to dig into hard clay and sand dries out easily.\n* 20\u201340% organic matter content. Organic matter enhances [[cation exchange capacity]] of calcium and [[magnesium]] which in turn stimulates growth.\n* [[pH]] around 7.\n* Adequate [[calcium]], the primary constituent of shells (up to 98%). A common way to introduce calcium is to add ground [[limestone]] at a suggested concentration of {{convert|0.5|kg/m2|lb/sqft}}. Calcium may also be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. More advanced techniques involve the addition of [[polyacrylamide]] with the following concentration: 12.5&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of a 160&nbsp;g M.A./one preparation in 250 cc of water per kilogram of dry soil. Such stabilization treatment helps the soil structure resist washing and allows regular cleaning without destroying the crumb structure of the soil that is beneficial for egg laying.\n\nSoil care: A farmer must find a way to prevent the soil from becoming fouled with mucus and droppings and also tackle undesirable [[Soil chemistry|chemical changes]] that may occur in time.\n\nSoil mix suggestions:\n* [[peat]], clay, [[compost]] and [[calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]]\n* [[Leaf mold]] (at pH 7)\n\n=== Pens and enclosures ===\n\nThe U.S. [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] ([[APHIS]]) Standards for [[Snail-Rearing Facilities]] were revised March 2001 and are available on the APHIS website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415075557/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |archive-date=2006-04-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEnclosures for snails are usually long and thin instead of square. This allows the workers to walk around (without harming the snails) and reach into the whole pen. The enclosure may be a trough with sides made of [[wood]], [[Concrete masonry unit|block]], [[fiber cement sheets]], or [[galvanized]] [[sheet steel]]. Cover it with [[Sieve|screen]] or [[netting]]. The covering confines the snails and keeps out birds and other predators. Fences or walls are usually {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} high plus at least {{convert|5|in|cm}} into the ground. Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain. Shade (which may be a fine mesh screen) on warm winter days helps keep the snails dormant. 5&nbsp;mm mesh or finer is used for pen screens or fences. Pens containing baby snails need a finer mesh.\n\nSnails need hiding places, especially during the warm daytime. Plastic soil drainage pipes from the local [[garden center]] can be split in two lengthwise, and stacked one layer one way and the next layer at a right angle, providing shelter and also increasing by 50% the number of snails that can live in the pen.\n\nA sprinkler system ensures moisture when needed and can be turned on at sunset rather than earlier in the day, when the moisture may drive snails out into hot sunshine. Temperature and humidity can be monitored using a thermometer and a hygrometer.\n\nThe bottom of the enclosure, if it is not the ground or trays of dirt, needs be a surface more solid than screening. A snail placed in a wire-mesh-bottom pen will keep crawling, trying to get off the wires and onto solid, more comfortable ground.\n\nIn order to prevent escapes, in an open pen, the top of the fences curve inward in a half circle; this works to confine the vineyard snail. However, ''H. aspersa'' can escape from such an open pen, and an electric fence may be needed to contain them. [The [[electric fence]] top has two or more thin wires that are 2 to 4&nbsp;mm apart. Each wire carries the opposite charge of the wire next to it. A battery or transformer is used to supply 4 to 12 [[volt]]s to the wire. A snail will get a mild shock and retract when it crawls over a wire and touches a second wire.]\n\nAnother technique to confine snails is to bend the fence top inward into a sharp \"V\" shape with about a 20-degree angle. The snail's shell will hit the bent-back part of the screen before the snail can reach up and start crawling on it. This blocks the snail, and the angled screen automatically compensates for the size of the snail.\n\nAnother alternative, suitable for solid wall enclosures, is to attach to the wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls on the underside of the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.\n\nBecause snails usually will not cross a [[copper]] band, another solution is to top the fence with a copper band at least {{convert|3|in|cm|round=5}} wide. The band can be bent so that part of it faces inward and is parallel to the pen floor. The band must not be placed very close to the ground, because rain may wash soil against the copper and leave a residue that may enable the snail to cross it. The bottom of the fence must be buried deep enough into the ground so that the snails cannot dig under it.\n\nAn alternate method is to make a square pen with a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}}-square garden in it. Plant about six crops, e.g., [[Urtica|nettles]] and [[artichoke]]s, inside the pen. The snails will choose what they want to eat. If it has not rained, turn sprinklers on for about 15 minutes at dusk, unless the snails are dormant. A disadvantage to this method is that, if the snails are not mature at the end of the year, it is difficult to replant fresh plant crops in the pens.\n\nPlastic tunnels make cheap, easy snail enclosures, but it is difficult to regulate heat and humidity. The tunnel will be {{convert|10|to|20|F-change|C-change|0}} warmer than the outside, and snails become dormant when the temperature climbs above {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhen snails are raised indoors under controlled conditions, reproduction varies according to the geographic origin of the [[breeding stock]]. For example, one researcher found that ''H. aspersa'' snails from [[Brittany]] seem to do better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at {{convert|70|F|C}} and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night. The [[Center for Heliciculture]] once recommended 65\u201375% humidity during the day and 85\u201395% at night at {{convert|68|F|C}}. In any event, avoid humidity higher than 95% (some say 90%) for any length of time. Excessive humidity can kill snails. Optimum temperature and relative humidity depend on several things, including the snail variety and even where breeding stock was gathered. For ''H. aspersa'', the optimum temperature for hatching eggs seems to be {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} at 100% relative humidity. The second best temperature/humidity combination depends on where the snails came from and results can drop drastically to 0% hatching at {{convert|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and 100% humidity. The soil must not be kept wet when the humidity is maintained at 100%, as the eggs will absorb water, swell up, and burst.\n\n[[Fluorescent lamp]]s can be used to give artificial daylight. Different snails respond to day length in different ways. The ratio of light to darkness influences activity, feeding, and mating and egg-laying. Eighteen or more hours of light apparently stimulate ''H. aspersa'' growth, while less than 12 hours inhibit it. Some snail species may associates the long hours of light with the start of summer\u2014the peak growing season. Eighteen hours of daylight also appear optimal for breeding (mating and egg laying), but snails will breed in darkness.\n\nSnails can be bred in boxes or cages stacked several units high. An automatic sprinkler system can be used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about {{convert|3|in|cm}} deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.)\n\nWhen the snails have laid their eggs, the pots are put in a nursery where the eggs will hatch. The young snails are kept in the nursery for about 6 weeks, and then moved to a separate pen, as young snails do best if kept with other snails of similar size. Eight hours of daylight is optimal for young snails.\n\nBaby snails are fed on tender [[lettuce]] leaves ([[Boston lettuce|Boston]] type, but [[head lettuce|head]] type is probably also good.)\n\nSome who raise ''H. aspersa'' separate the five stages: reproduction, hatching, young, fattening, and final fattening.\n\nIn a typical example, the [[Reproduction|breeding]] box has [[concrete]] sides, soil with [[earthworm]]s (to cleanse the soil) on the bottom, vegetation, curved tiles to provide shelter, feeders, and a chicken waterer. [[Mosquito]] netting or screening covers the top. These breeding boxes may be outside, or better results may be obtained when the boxes are inside a greenhouse\u2014as long as the greenhouse does not get too hot or too dry. One researcher reported that in outdoor boxes, each breeder snail had about seven young. In greenhouses, each breeder snail had about 9 to 12 young. The researcher felt that under better weather conditions than those he had that year, each adult breeder snail would have produced 15 young snails.\n\n[[Fattening pens]] can be outside or in a greenhouse. High summer temperatures and insufficient moisture cause dwarfing and malformations of some snails. This is more a problem inside greenhouses if the sun overheats the building. A sprinkler system (e.g., a [[horticultural]] system or common lawn sprinklers) can supply moisture. Make sure excess water can drain.\n\nFattening pens may contain {{convert|2|by|3|ft|m|adj=on}} pieces (or other convenient size) of heavy plastic sheets, hung from boards resting on a rack that lets the tips of the plastic sheets just touch the ground. The plastic sheets are about {{convert|4|in|cm}} apart. The sheets give the snails a resting and hiding place. Feeders may be located on the rack that supports the plastic sheets.\n\nA layer of coarse sand and [[topsoil]] with earthworms is placed on the fattening pen's bottom. The worms help clean up the snail droppings.\n\nSnails that hatched the previous summer can be put in a chilled room for hibernation over winter. About 1 April, (adjusted for local climate), they are moved to the final fattening pen. IN cases where there are several fattening pens, the smaller snails are placed in one, medium in another, large in another. One-third of a pound of ''H. aspersa'' snails require one square foot of pen. Snails lose weight when they estivate in summer, therefore some growers do not stock pens by weight but by count. For ''H. aspersa'', 10 to 12 snails per square foot is the maximum.\n\n=== Cannibalism by hatchlings ===\nThe first snails to hatch eat the shells of their eggs. This gives them calcium needed for their shells. They may then begin eating unhatched eggs. If the snail eggs are kept at the optimum temperature, {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} (for some varieties), and if none of the eggs lose moisture, most eggs will hatch within 1 to 3 days of each other. [[Cannibalism]] also will be low. If hatching extends over a longer period, cannibalism may increase. Some eggs eaten are eggs that were not fertile or did not develop properly, but sometimes, properly developing embryos might be eaten. A high density of \"clutches\" of egg masses increases the rate of cannibalism, as other nearby egg masses are more likely to be found and eaten. Snail egg has 12 to 20 times the protein of lettuce. The protein helps the baby snails start developing quickly and be healthier. Snail egg is an excellent starter food for newly hatched snails, but they tend to only eat eggs of their own species.\n\n=== Feeding ===\nFeeding season is April through October, (or may vary with the local climate), with a \"rest period\" during the summer. Do not place food in one small clump so that there is not enough room for all the snails to get to it. Snails eat solid food by [[rasping]] it away with their [[radula]]. Feeding activity depends on the weather, and snails may not necessarily feed every day. Evening irrigation in dry weather may encourage feeding since the moisture makes it easier for the snails to move about.\n\nPut the breeding snails in the breeding pens in April or early May. Feed until mid June when mating begins and the snails stop feeding. Snails resume eating after they lay eggs. Once snails have laid their eggs, the adult snails can be removed. This leaves more food and less crowding for the hatchlings.\n\nSnails of the same species collected from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: [[Alyssum]], fruit and leaves of [[apple]], [[apricot]], [[artichoke]] (a favorite), [[Aster (genus)|aster]], [[barley]], [[beans]], [[bindweed]], [[California boxwood]], almost any [[cabbage]] variety, [[camomile]], [[carnation]], [[carrot]], [[cauliflower]], [[celeriac]] (root celery), [[celery]], ripe [[cherries]], [[chive]], citrus, [[clover]], [[cucumber]]s (a favorite snail food), [[dandelion]], [[Elderberry|elder]], [[henbane]], [[hibiscus]], [[hollyhock]], [[kale]], larkspur ([[Consolida]] or [[Delphinium]] genera), [[leek]], lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), [[lily]], [[magnolia]], [[mountain ash]], [[mulberry]], [[chrysanthemum]], [[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]], [[Urtica|nettle]], [[nightshade]] berries, [[oats]], [[onion]] greens, [[pansy]], [[parsley]], [[peach]], ripe [[pear]]s, [[pea]]s, [[petunia]], [[phlox]], [[plum]], [[potato]]es (raw or cooked), [[pumpkin]]s, [[radish]], [[rapeseed|rape]], [[rose]], [[sorrel]], [[spinach]], [[sweet pea]], [[thistle]], [[tomato]]es (well liked), [[turnip]], [[wheat]], [[yarrow]], [[zinnia]]. They will eat sweet [[lupin]]es, but will reject bitter [[lupin]]es and other plants with high [[quinolizidine]] [[alkaloid]]s. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.\n\nSnails usually prefer juicy leaves and vegetables over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed as it will quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% [[wheat bran]] while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use [[oats]], [[corn meal]], [[soybean meal]], or [[chicken]] mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed [[oyster]] shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their [[body weight]]. Active snails deprived of food will lose more than one-third of their weight before they starve to death\u2014a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.\n\nSupply calcium at least once a week if it is not available in the soil. It should not contain harmful salts or be so alkaline as to burn the snails. Mix calcium with wet bran or mashed potatoes and serve on a pan; this will keep any leftover food from rotting on the ground.\n\nSome researchers use chicken mash for feed. A plastic pipe can be cut in half lengthwise to make two troughs which can be used as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).\n\nPellets are fine for larger snails, but mash is better for younger ones. Pellets should be partially crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. Easy access to enough water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.\n\nBe sure to frequently clean the feed and water dishes. The amount of feed a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and on the availability of drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container to reduce the risk of the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.\n\nYoung ''H. aspersa'' readily eats [[milk powder]]. Its rapid rate of assimilation promotes rapid growth.\n\n=== Diseases and pests ===\nGood hygiene can prevent the spread of disease and otherwise improve the health and growth rate of snails. Food is replaced daily in order to prevent spoilage. Earthworms added to the soil help keep the pen clean.\n\n[[Parasitism|Parasites]], [[nematode]]s, [[trematoda|trematodes]], [[fungi]], and micro[[arthropod]]s can attack snails, and such problems can spread rapidly when snail populations are dense. The bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' causes intestinal infections that can spread rapidly in a crowded snail pen.\n\nPossible predators include [[rat]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], [[Mole (animal)|moles]], [[skunk]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bird]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[lizard]]s, walking insects (e.g., some [[beetle]] and [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] varieties), some types of [[Fly|flies]], [[centipede]]s, and even certain carnivorous snail species, such as ''[[Strangesta capillacea]]''.\n\n=== Population density ===\nPopulation density also affects successful snail production. Pens should contain no more than six to eight fair-sized snails per square foot, or about four large ''H. pomatias''; or figure one kilogram per square meter (about .2 pounds of snail per square foot), which automatically compensates for the size of the snails. To encourage breeding, best results will occur with not more than eight snails per square meter (0.8 per square foot). Some sources say that, for ''H. pomatia'' to breed, 2 to 4 snails per square meter (0.2 to 0.4 per square foot) is the maximum.\n\nSnails tend not to breed when packed too densely or when the [[wikt:slime|slime]] in the pen accumulates too much. The slime apparently works like a [[pheromone]] and suppresses reproduction. On the other hand, snails in groups of about 100 seem to breed better than when only a few snails are confined together. Perhaps they have more potential mates from which to choose. Snails in a densely populated area grow more slowly even when food is abundant, and they also have a higher mortality rate. These snails then become smaller adults who lay fewer clutches of eggs, have fewer eggs per clutch, and the eggs have a lower hatch rate. Smaller adult snails sell for less. [[Dwarfing]] is quite common in snail farming and is attributable mainly to rearing conditions rather than [[heredity]] factors. Crowding snails is false economy. A recommended rate for ''H. aspersa'' is not more than one-third pound per square foot (3.6&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of soil surface for snails that weigh more than 1&nbsp;gram and not more than 0.2 pound per square foot (2.2&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) for snails that weigh less. (One ounce is about 28&nbsp;grams.)\n\n=== Harvest ===\n{{Main|Escargot}}\nSnails are mature when a lip forms at the opening of their shell. Before they mature, their shells are more easily broken, making them undesirable. For ''H. aspersa'', commercial weight is 8&nbsp;grams or larger. \n\nSnail eggs are also harvested and processed to produce [[snail caviar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2007-12-15-snail-caviar-the-new-gourmet-frontier |title=Snail caviar! The new gourmet frontier |newspaper=[[Mail & Guardian]] |date=December 15, 2007 |accessdate=21 January 2015 |author=Bertrand, Jordane}}</ref>\n\n== Restrictions and regulations ==\n\n=== United States ===\nThe same snails that some people raise or gather as food also are agricultural pests that cause considerable crop damage. Introduced slug and snail varieties tend to be worse pests than native species, probably due in part to the lack of natural controls. Snail pests attack crops ranging from leafy vegetables to fruits that grow near the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes, to citrus fruits high up on trees.\n\nThe [[Federal Plant Pest Act]] defines a plant pest as \"any living stage (including active and dormant forms) of [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[protozoa]], or other [[invertebrate]] animals, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], other [[parasite|parasitic plants]] or reproductive parts thereof; viruses; or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing; or any [[infection|infectious]] substances, which can directly or indirectly injure or cause disease or damage in or to any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants...\" The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) categorizes giant African snails as a \"quarantine significant plant pest.\" The United States does not allow live giant African snails into the country under any circumstances. It is illegal to own or to possess them. APHIS vigorously enforces this regulation and destroys or returns these snails to their country of origin.\n\nSince large infestations of snails can do devastating damage, many states have quarantines against nursery products, and other products, from infested states. Further, it is illegal to import snails (or slugs) into the U.S. without permission from the [[Plant Protection and Quarantine Division]] (PPQ), [[Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service]], U.S. Department of Agriculture. APHIS also oversees interstate transportation of snails. Anyone who plans to \"import, release, or make interstate shipments of\" snails, must complete APHIS's PPQ Form 526, Application and Permit to Move Live Plant Pests and Noxious Weeds. This form should be submitted to the State regulatory official. The state will process the request and make a recommendation to APHIS who will then make a decision.\n\nInformation on Plant Pest Permits is available at APHIS's website [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm].\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates the canning of low-[[acid]] foods such as snails. According to FDA, \"establishments engaged in the manufacture of Low-acid or Acidified Canned Foods (LACF) offered for interstate commerce in the United States are required...to register their facility...and file scheduled processes for their products with\" the FDA. This does not refer to fresh products. For appropriate forms, contact: LACF Registration Coordinator, HFS-618, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 200 C Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20204. Telephone: (202) 205-5282. FAX: (202) 205-4758 or (202) 205-4128.\n\nImproper canning of low-acid meats, e.g., snails, involves a risk of [[botulism]]. When canning snails for home consumption, carefully follow canning instructions for low-acid meats to prevent food poisoning.\n\nState laws also may apply to imports into certain states and to raising snails in a given state. Some states may want to inspect and approve facilities. Thus anyone who plans to raise snails also should check with their State's Agriculture Department.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n* Rebecca Thompson and Sheldon Cheney [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm '''Raising Snails'''] \"[[National Agricultural Library]], [[Agricultural Research Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].\"\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm |date=June 8, 2004 |title=Source of this article in Russian }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060711074205/http://bursaagricola.ro/Info-CRESTEREA_MELCILOR-4-23640-1.html Source of this article in] Romanian\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080728004505/http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/NAP/00-188.htm Breeding and Growing Snails Commercially in Australia]\n* [http://escargot.free.fr/eng/index.html Escargot Passion]\n* [https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/items/06-104 Free-range Snail Farming in Australia] Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, Australian government\n* [http://www.manandmollusc.net/molluscan_food_files/molluscan_food_terrestrial.html Man and Mollusc's Data Base of Edible Molluscs]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080416174658/http://www.sdnetwork.kabissa.org/newscollection/ideanews_1.htm#GrowSnail Snail Farming in Africa]\n* [http://www.snailcream.co.uk/heliculture/ Snail Farming (Heliculture)]\n* [http://africabusinessclassroom.com/snail-farming-in-nigeria-how-to-start-make-money/  Snail Farming in Nigeria]\n\n{{Edible molluscs}}\n\n[[Category:Agriculture]]\n[[Category:Gastropods and humans]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Eyragues-l-Escargot-des-Alpilles-5738.jpg|thumb|A snail farm near [[Eyragues]], [[Provence]], [[France]]]]\n'''Heliciculture''', commonly known as '''snail farming''', is the process of raising edible [[land snail]]s, primarily for human consumption or cosmetic use. The meat and  [[Snail caviar|snail eggs]] can be consumed as [[escargot]] and as a type of caviar respectively. Mucus, commonly known as [[snail slime]], has medical properties and is used in [[cosmetics]].\n\nPerhaps the best known edible land snail species in the [[Western world]] is the [[Helix pomatia]], commonly known as [[Roman snail]] or [[Burgundy snail]]. This species is however not fit for profitable snail farming, and normally harvested from nature.\n\nCommercial snail farming in the Western world is typically done with either the ''[[Cornu aspersum]],'' formerly known as Helix ''aspersa'' M\u00fcller'','' or the [[Helix aspersa Maxima|Helix ''aspersa'' Maxima]]. In tropical climates snail farming is typically done with the ''[[African snail]],'' which biologically does not fall in the family of [[Helicidae]], and the meat of which therefore may not be called escargot.\n\n== History ==\nRoasted snail shells have been found in [[archaeological]] excavations, an indication that snails have been eaten since prehistoric times.<ref>[http://watarts.uwaterloo.ca/~dlubell/Antibes.pdf Prehistoric edible land snails in the circum-Mediterranean: the archaeological evidence.], D.

Lubell.</ref>\n\n''Lumaca romana'', (translation: Roman snail), was an ancient method of snail farming or heliciculture in the region about [[Tarquinia]]. This snail farming method was described by [[:la:Quintus Fulvius Lippinus|Fulvius Lippinus]] (49 BC) and mentioned by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in ''De Re rustica'' III, 12.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Varro/de_Re_Rustica/3*.html#12 De Re Rustica III, 12]</ref> The snails were fattened for human consumption using [[spelt]] and aromatic herbs. People usually raised snails in pens near the house, and these pens were called \"[[:la:Cochlea (animal)|cochlea]].\"\n\nThe Romans, in particular, are known to have considered escargot as an elite food, as noted in the writings of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. The Romans selected the best snails for breeding. Shells of the edible land snail species ''[[Otala lactea]]'' have been recovered in [[archaeological]] excavations of [[Volubilis]] in present-day [[Morocco]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan, ''Volubilis'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham (2007) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=14906]</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described the snail garden of [[Fulvius Hirpinus]] 2,000 years ago as having separate sections for different species of snails. [[Hirpinus]] allegedly fed his snails on meal and wine.\n\n\"Wall fish\" were also often eaten in Britain, but were never as popular as on the continent. There, people often ate snails during [[Lent]], and in a few places, they consumed large quantities of snails at Mardi Gras or Carnival, as a foretaste of Lent.\n\nAccording to some sources, the French exported [[Helix aspersa|brown garden snails]] to California in the 1850s, raising them as the delicacy [[escargot]]. Other sources claim that Italian immigrants were the first to bring the snail to the United States.\n\n== Economic impact ==\nU.S. imports of snails were worth more than $4.5 million in 1995 and came from 24 countries. This includes preserved or prepared snails and snails that are live, fresh, chilled, or frozen. Major exporters to the U.S. are [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Greece]] and [[China]]. The U.S. exported live, fresh, chilled, or frozen snails worth $55,000 to 13 countries; most were shipped to [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Individual statistics are not available for U.S. exports of prepared or processed snails from the U.S. [[Department of Commerce]].\n\n== Edible land snail species ==\n[[File:Snails-Italy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Three different species of snails for sale in a market in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]\nEdible land snails range in size from about one millimeter long to the giant African snails, which occasionally grow up to {{convert|312|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in length. \"Escargot\" most commonly refers to either ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' or to ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', although other varieties of snails are eaten. ''[[Achatina fulica]]'', a giant African snail, is sliced and [[Canning|canned]] and passed off on some consumers as escargot. Terms such as \"garden snail\" or \"common brown garden snail\" are rather meaningless since they refer to so many types of snails, but they sometimes mean ''H. aspersa''.\n* ''[[Cornu aspersum]]'' is also known as the French \"petit gris,\" \"small grey snail,\" the \"escargot chagrine,\" or \"la zigrinata.\" The shell of a mature adult has four to five whorls and measures 30 to 45&nbsp;mm across. It is native to the shores of the Mediterranean and up the coast of Spain and France. It is found on many British Isles, where the Romans introduced it in the 1st century AD (Some references say it dates to the Early Bronze Age.) In the early 19th century the French brought it into California, where it has become a serious pest. These snails are now common throughout the U.S. It was introduced into several Eastern and Gulf states even before 1850 and, later introduced into other countries such as Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Mexico, and Argentina. ''C. aspersum'' has a life span of 2 to 5 years. This species is more adaptable to different climates and conditions than many snails, and is found in woods, fields, sand dunes, and gardens. This adaptability not only increases ''C. aspersum's'' range, but it also makes farming ''C. aspersum'' easier and less risky.\n* ''[[Helix pomatia]]'' measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It also is called the \"Roman snail,\" \"apple snail,\" \"lunar,\" \"la vignaiola,\" the German \"Weinbergschnecke,\" the French \"escargot de Bourgogne\" or \"Burgundy snail,\" or \"gros blanc.\" Native over a large part of Europe, it lives in wooded mountains and valleys up to {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} altitude and in vineyards and gardens. The Romans may have introduced it into Britain. Immigrants introduced it into the U.S. in Michigan and Wisconsin. Many prefer ''H. pomatia'' to ''H. aspersa'' for its flavor and its larger size, as the \"escargot par excellence.\"\n* ''[[Otala lactea]]'' is sometimes called the \"vineyard snail,\" \"milk snail,\" or \"Spanish snail.\" The shell is white with reddish brown spiral bands and measures about 26 to 35&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n* ''[[Iberus alonensis]]'', the Spanish \"vaqueta\" or \"serrana,\" measures about 30&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n[[File:Cepaea nemoralis pair banded shells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'']]\n* ''[[Cepaea nemoralis]]'', the \"grove snail,\" or the Spanish \"vaqueta,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm across the shell. It inhabits Central Europe and was introduced into, and is now naturalized in many U.S. states, from Massachusetts to California, and from Tennessee to Canada. Its habitat ranges widely from woods to dunes. It mainly eats dead plant material, but it likes nettles and buttercups and will eat dead worms and dead snails.\n* ''[[Cepaea hortensis]]'', the \"white-lipped snail,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm across the shell which often has distinct dark stripes. It is native to central and northern Europe. This species was introduced into Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire in colonial times, but it never became established in these states. Its habitat varies but ''C. hortensis'' is found in colder and wetter places than ''C. nemoralis''. Their smaller size and some people's opinion that they do not taste as good make ''C. hortensis'' and ''C. nemoralis'' less popular than the larger European land snails.\n* ''[[Otala punctata]]'', called \"vaqueta\" in some parts of Spain, measures about 35&nbsp;mm across the shell.\n* ''[[Eobania vermiculata]]'', the \"vinyala,\" \"mongeta,\" or \"xona,\" measures about 25&nbsp;mm. It is found in Mediterranean countries and was introduced into Louisiana and Texas.\n* ''[[Helix lucorum]]'', sometimes called \"escargo turc,\" measures about 45&nbsp;mm across the shell. It is found in central Italy and from Yugoslavia through the Crimea to Turkey and around the Black Sea.\n* ''[[Helix adanensis]]'' comes from around Turkey.\n* ''[[Helix aperta]]'' measures about 25&nbsp;mm. Its meat is highly prized. It is native to France, Italy, and other Mediterranean countries and has become established in California and Louisiana. Sometimes known as the \"burrowing snail,\" it is found above ground only during rainy weather. In hot, dry weather, it burrows three to six inches into the ground and becomes dormant until rain soften the soil.\n* ''[[Theba pisana]]'', also called the \"banded snail\"or the \"cargol avellanenc,\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm and lives on dry, exposed sites, usually near the sea. Native to Sicily, it has been spread to several European countries, including England. This snail is a serious garden pest and is the \"white snail\" that California once eradicated by using flamethrowers to burn off whole areas. In large numbers, up to 3,000 snails per tree, it can ravage a garden in 24 hours and a citrus or other crop in a couple of nights.\n* ''[[Sphincterochila candidissima]]'' or ''[[Leucochroa candidisima]]'', the \"cargol mongeta,\" or \"cargol jueu\" measures about 20&nbsp;mm.\n[[File:Achatina fulica Thailand.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Achatina fulica]]'']]\n* ''[[Achatina fulica]]'' and other ''Achatina'' species, giant African snails. They can grow up to 326&nbsp;mm (1&nbsp;ft \u00be in) in length. Their native range is south of the Sahara in East Africa. This snail was purposely introduced into India in 1847. There was an unsuccessful attempt to establish it in Japan in 1925. It has been purposely and accidentally transported to other Pacific locations and was inadvertently released in California after World War II, in Hawaii, and later in North Miami Florida in the 1970s. In many places, it is a serious agricultural pest that causes considerable crop damage. Also, due to its large size, its slime and fecal material create a nuisance as does the odor that occurs when something like poison bait causes large numbers to die. The U.S. has made considerable effort to eradicate ''Achatina''. The [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has banned the importation and possession of live Giant African snails.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/29/illegal-giant-snails-threatening-america/|title=Illegal giant snails threatening America|date=2014-08-29|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> However, they are still sought after as pets due to the vibrant \"tiger stripes\" on their shells.\n\n== Biology ==\n\n=== Mating and egg laying ===\n\n==== General ====\nSnails are [[hermaphrodite]]s. Although they have both male and female [[reproductive organ]]s, they must mate with another snail of the same species before they lay eggs. Some snails may act as males one season and as females the next. Other snails play both roles at once and [[fertilize]] each other simultaneously. When the snail is large enough and mature enough, which may take several years, mating occurs in the late spring or early summer after several hours of [[courtship]]. Sometimes there is a second mating in summer. (In tropical climates, mating may occur several times a year. In some climates, snails mate around October and may mate a second time 2 weeks later.) After mating, the snail can store sperm received for up to a year, but it usually lays eggs within a few weeks. Snails are sometimes uninterested in mating with another snail of the same species that originated from a considerable distance away. For example, a ''H. aspersa'' from southern France may reject a ''H. aspersa'' from northern France.\n\n==== Helix ''pomatia''====\nSnails need soil at least 2&nbsp;inches deep in which to lay their eggs. For ''H. pomatia'', the soil should be at least 3&nbsp;inches deep to keep out pests such as [[ants]], [[earwig]]s, [[millipede]]s, etc. Dry soil is not suitable for the preparation of a nest, nor is soil that is too heavy. In clay soil that becomes hard, reproduction rates may decrease because the snails are unable to bury their eggs and the hatchlings have difficulty emerging from the nest. Hatchability of eggs depends on soil temperature, soil humidity, soil composition, etc. Soil consisting of 20% to 40% organic material is good. The soil should be kept at {{convert|41|to|50|F|C}}, and is best around {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Soil moisture should be maintained at 80%. One researcher removes eggs immediately after they are deposited, counts them, then keeps them on moist cotton until the eggs hatch and the young start to eat. Snails lose substantial weight by laying eggs. Some do not recover. About one-third of the snails will die after the breeding season.\n\n''H. pomatia'' eggs measure about 3&nbsp;mm in diameter and have a [[calcareous]] shell and a high [[yolk]] content. ''H. pomatia'' lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after mating, in holes dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head into the hole or may crawl in until only the top of the shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about a dozen more a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is [[glycoprotein]] similar to eggwhite.\n\nFully developed baby ''H. pomatia'' snails hatch about 3 to 4 weeks after the eggs are laid, depending on temperature and humidity. Birds, insects, mice, toads and other predators take a heavy toll on the young snails. The snails eat and grow until the weather turns cold. They then dig a deep hole, sometimes as deep as {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on}}, and seal themselves inside their shell and hibernate for the winter. This is a response to both decreasing temperature and shorter hours of daylight. When the ground warms up in spring, the snail emerges and goes on a binge of replacing lost moisture and eating.\n\n==== Helix ''aspersa''====\n''H. aspersa'' eggs are white, spherical, about {{cvt|3|mm|in|frac=8}} in diameter and are laid 5 days to 3 weeks after mating. (Data varies widely due to differences in climate and regional variations in the snails' habitats.) ''H. aspersa'' lays an average of 85 eggs in a nest that is {{convert|1|to|1+1/2|in|cm}} deep. Data varies from 30 to over 120 eggs, but high figures may be from when more than one snail lays eggs in the same nest.\n\nIn warm, damp climates, ''H. aspersa'' may lay eggs as often as five times from February through October, depending on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when there are at least 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures are still too cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days to break out of the sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, ''H. aspersa'' matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, ''H. aspersa'' hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early [[hatchlings]], the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some ''H. aspersa'' mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of ''H. aspersa's'' reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.\n\n====Achatina ''fulica''====\nBy contrast, one giant African snail, ''Achatina fulica'', lays 100 to 400 [[elliptical]] eggs that each measure about 5&nbsp;mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, usually in the wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in the ground like ''H. pomatia'', or lay eggs on the surface of a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs hatch releasing snails about 4&nbsp;mm long. These snails grow up to 10&nbsp;mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35&nbsp;mm long and may already be sexually mature. [[Sexual maturity]] takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of [[calcium]]. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.\n\n=== Growth ===\nWithin the same snail population and under the same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature. This may help the species survive bad weather, etc., in the wild. However, a snail farmer should obviously select and keep the largest and fastest maturing snails for breeding stock and sell the smaller snails. By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in only a couple of generations. Most of the differences in growth are probably due to environmental factors including stocking density. However, to whatever extent these differences are genetic, farmers generally breed large, fast-growing snails instead of small, slower-growing ones.\n\nSeveral factors can greatly influence the growth of snails including: population density, stress (snails are sensitive to noise, light, vibration, unsanitary conditions, irregular feedings, being touched, etc.), feed, temperature and moisture, and the breeding technology used.\n\n''H. aspersa'' requires at least 3% to 4% calcium in the soil (or another source of calcium) for good growth. Most snails need more calcium in the soil than ''H. aspersa''. Low calcium intake will slow the growth rate and cause the shell to be thinner. Calcium may be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. Food is only one calcium source. Snails may eat paint or attack walls of buildings seeking calcium, and they also will eat dirt.\n\nA newborn's shell size depends on the egg size since the shell develops from the egg's surface membrane. As the snail grows, the shell is added onto in increments. Eventually the shell will develop a flare or reinforcing lip at its opening. This shows that the snail is now mature; there will be no further shell growth. Growth is measured by shell size, since a snail's body weight varies and fluctuates, even in 100% humidity. The growth rate varies considerably between individuals in each population group. Adult size, which is related to the growth rate, also varies, thus the fastest growers are usually the largest snails. Eggs from larger, healthier snails also tend to grow faster and thus larger.\n\nDryness inhibits growth and even stops activity. When it becomes too hot and dry in summer, the snail becomes inactive, seals its shell and [[estivation|estivates]] (becomes dormant) until cooler, moister weather returns. Some snails estivate in groups on tree trunks, posts, or walls. They seal themselves to the surface, thus sealing up the shell opening.\n\nPeak snail activity (including feeding and thus growth) occurs a few hours after sunset, when the temperature is lower and the water content (in the form of [[dew]]) is higher. During daytime snails usually seek shelter.\n\n== Farming snails ==\nSuccessful snail culture requires the correct equipment and supplies, including: [[snail pens]] or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity ([[hygrometer]]), temperature ([[thermometer]]), soil moisture ([[soil moisture sensor]]), and light (in foot candles); a weight scale and an instrument to measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate ([[temperature]] and [[humidity]]), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails of the same kind and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.\n\nFour systems of snail farms can be distinguished:\n* Outdoor pens.\n* In buildings with a controlled climate.\n* In closed systems such as plastic tunnel houses or \"[[greenhouse]]s.\"\n* In addition, snails may breed and hatch inside in a controlled environment and then (after 6 to 8 weeks) may be placed in outside pens to mature.\n\n=== Favorable conditions ===\n\n'''Climate''': A mild climate {{convert|15|-|25|C|F}} with high humidity (75% to 95%) is best for snail farming, though most varieties can stand a wider range of temperatures. The optimal temperature is {{convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for many varieties. When the temperature falls below {{convert|7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, snails hibernate. Under {{convert|12|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} the snails are inactive, and under {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, all growth stops. When the temperature rises much above {{convert|27|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} or conditions become too dry, snails estivate. Wind is bad for snails because it speeds up moisture loss, and snails must retain moisture.\n\n'''Moisture''': Snails thrive in damp but not waterlogged environments and thus a well-draining soil is required. Research indicates that water content around 80% of the carrying capacity of the soil and air [[humidity]] over 80% (during darkness) are the most favorable conditions. Many farmers use [[Aerosol spray|mist-producing devices]] to maintain proper moisture in the air and/or soil.<ref>http://publications.cta.int/publications/publication/1497/</ref> Also, if the system contains alive vegetation, the leaves are to be periodically wet.\n\n'''[[Soil]]''': Snails dig in soil and ingest it. Good soil favors snail growth and provides some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may cause fragile shells even when the snails have well-balanced feed; the snails growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails will often eat feed, then go eat dirt. Sometimes, they will eat only one or the other.\n\nA well-functional soil would have the following characteristics:\n* Containing neither a lot of [[sand]] nor too much [[clay]], as snails strive to dig into hard clay and sand dries out easily.\n* 20\u201340% organic matter content. Organic matter enhances [[cation exchange capacity]] of calcium and [[magnesium]] which in turn stimulates growth.\n* [[pH]] around 7.\n* Adequate [[calcium]], the primary constituent of shells (up to 98%). A common way to introduce calcium is to add ground [[limestone]] at a suggested concentration of {{convert|0.5|kg/m2|lb/sqft}}. Calcium may also be set out in a feeding dish or trough so the snails can eat it at will. More advanced techniques involve the addition of [[polyacrylamide]] with the following concentration: 12.5&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of a 160&nbsp;g M.A./one preparation in 250 cc of water per kilogram of dry soil. Such stabilization treatment helps the soil structure resist washing and allows regular cleaning without destroying the crumb structure of the soil that is beneficial for egg laying.\n\nSoil care: A farmer must find a way to prevent the soil from becoming fouled with mucus and droppings and also tackle undesirable [[Soil chemistry|chemical changes]] that may occur in time.\n\nSoil mix suggestions:\n* [[peat]], clay, [[compost]] and [[calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]]\n* [[Leaf mold]] (at pH 7)\n\n=== Pens and enclosures ===\n\nThe U.S. [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] ([[APHIS]]) Standards for [[Snail-Rearing Facilities]] were revised March 2001 and are available on the APHIS website.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2020-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415075557/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ppq/permits/plantpest/rearing.pdf |archive-date=2006-04-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEnclosures for snails are usually long and thin instead of square. This allows the workers to walk around (without harming the snails) and reach into the whole pen. The enclosure may be a trough with sides made of [[wood]], [[Concrete masonry unit|block]], [[fiber cement sheets]], or [[galvanized]] [[sheet steel]]. Cover it with [[Sieve|screen]] or [[netting]]. The covering confines the snails and keeps out birds and other predators. Fences or walls are usually {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}} high plus at least {{convert|5|in|cm}} into the ground. Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain. Shade (which may be a fine mesh screen) on warm winter days helps keep the snails dormant. 5&nbsp;mm mesh or finer is used for pen screens or fences. Pens containing baby snails need a finer mesh.\n\nSnails need hiding places, especially during the warm daytime. Plastic soil drainage pipes from the local [[garden center]] can be split in two lengthwise, and stacked one layer one way and the next layer at a right angle, providing shelter and also increasing by 50% the number of snails that can live in the pen.\n\nA sprinkler system ensures moisture when needed and can be turned on at sunset rather than earlier in the day, when the moisture may drive snails out into hot sunshine. Temperature and humidity can be monitored using a thermometer and a hygrometer.\n\nThe bottom of the enclosure, if it is not the ground or trays of dirt, needs be a surface more solid than screening. A snail placed in a wire-mesh-bottom pen will keep crawling, trying to get off the wires and onto solid, more comfortable ground.\n\nIn order to prevent escapes, in an open pen, the top of the fences curve inward in a half circle; this works to confine the vineyard snail. However, ''H. aspersa'' can escape from such an open pen, and an electric fence may be needed to contain them. [The [[electric fence]] top has two or more thin wires that are 2 to 4&nbsp;mm apart. Each wire carries the opposite charge of the wire next to it. A battery or transformer is used to supply 4 to 12 [[volt]]s to the wire. A snail will get a mild shock and retract when it crawls over a wire and touches a second wire.]\n\nAnother technique to confine snails is to bend the fence top inward into a sharp \"V\" shape with about a 20-degree angle. The snail's shell will hit the bent-back part of the screen before the snail can reach up and start crawling on it. This blocks the snail, and the angled screen automatically compensates for the size of the snail.\n\nAnother alternative, suitable for solid wall enclosures, is to attach to the wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls on the underside of the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.\n\nBecause snails usually will not cross a [[copper]] band, another solution is to top the fence with a copper band at least {{convert|3|in|cm|round=5}} wide. The band can be bent so that part of it faces inward and is parallel to the pen floor. The band must not be placed very close to the ground, because rain may wash soil against the copper and leave a residue that may enable the snail to cross it. The bottom of the fence must be buried deep enough into the ground so that the snails cannot dig under it.\n\nAn alternate method is to make a square pen with a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}}-square garden in it. Plant about six crops, e.g., [[Urtica|nettles]] and [[artichoke]]s, inside the pen. The snails will choose what they want to eat. If it has not rained, turn sprinklers on for about 15 minutes at dusk, unless the snails are dormant. A disadvantage to this method is that, if the snails are not mature at the end of the year, it is difficult to replant fresh plant crops in the pens.\n\nPlastic tunnels make cheap, easy snail enclosures, but it is difficult to regulate heat and humidity. The tunnel will be {{convert|10|to|20|F-change|C-change|0}} warmer than the outside, and snails become dormant when the temperature climbs above {{convert|80|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhen snails are raised indoors under controlled conditions, reproduction varies according to the geographic origin of the [[breeding stock]]. For example, one researcher found that ''H. aspersa'' snails from [[Brittany]] seem to do better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at {{convert|70|F|C}} and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night. The [[Center for Heliciculture]] once recommended 65\u201375% humidity during the day and 85\u201395% at night at {{convert|68|F|C}}. In any event, avoid humidity higher than 95% (some say 90%) for any length of time. Excessive humidity can kill snails. Optimum temperature and relative humidity depend on several things, including the snail variety and even where breeding stock was gathered. For ''H. aspersa'', the optimum temperature for hatching eggs seems to be {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} at 100% relative humidity. The second best temperature/humidity combination depends on where the snails came from and results can drop drastically to 0% hatching at {{convert|17|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and 100% humidity. The soil must not be kept wet when the humidity is maintained at 100%, as the eggs will absorb water, swell up, and burst.\n\n[[Fluorescent lamp]]s can be used to give artificial daylight. Different snails respond to day length in different ways. The ratio of light to darkness influences activity, feeding, and mating and egg-laying. Eighteen or more hours of light apparently stimulate ''H. aspersa'' growth, while less than 12 hours inhibit it. Some snail species may associates the long hours of light with the start of summer\u2014the peak growing season. Eighteen hours of daylight also appear optimal for breeding (mating and egg laying), but snails will breed in darkness.\n\nSnails can be bred in boxes or cages stacked several units high. An automatic sprinkler system can be used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about {{convert|3|in|cm}} deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.)\n\nWhen the snails have laid their eggs, the pots are put in a nursery where the eggs will hatch. The young snails are kept in the nursery for about 6 weeks, and then moved to a separate pen, as young snails do best if kept with other snails of similar size. Eight hours of daylight is optimal for young snails.\n\nBaby snails are fed on tender [[lettuce]] leaves ([[Boston lettuce|Boston]] type, but [[head lettuce|head]] type is probably also good.)\n\nSome who raise ''H. aspersa'' separate the five stages: reproduction, hatching, young, fattening, and final fattening.\n\nIn a typical example, the [[Reproduction|breeding]] box has [[concrete]] sides, soil with [[earthworm]]s (to cleanse the soil) on the bottom, vegetation, curved tiles to provide shelter, feeders, and a chicken waterer. [[Mosquito]] netting or screening covers the top. These breeding boxes may be outside, or better results may be obtained when the boxes are inside a greenhouse\u2014as long as the greenhouse does not get too hot or too dry. One researcher reported that in outdoor boxes, each breeder snail had about seven young. In greenhouses, each breeder snail had about 9 to 12 young. The researcher felt that under better weather conditions than those he had that year, each adult breeder snail would have produced 15 young snails.\n\n[[Fattening pens]] can be outside or in a greenhouse. High summer temperatures and insufficient moisture cause dwarfing and malformations of some snails. This is more a problem inside greenhouses if the sun overheats the building. A sprinkler system (e.g., a [[horticultural]] system or common lawn sprinklers) can supply moisture. Make sure excess water can drain.\n\nFattening pens may contain {{convert|2|by|3|ft|m|adj=on}} pieces (or other convenient size) of heavy plastic sheets, hung from boards resting on a rack that lets the tips of the plastic sheets just touch the ground. The plastic sheets are about {{convert|4|in|cm}} apart. The sheets give the snails a resting and hiding place. Feeders may be located on the rack that supports the plastic sheets.\n\nA layer of coarse sand and [[topsoil]] with earthworms is placed on the fattening pen's bottom. The worms help clean up the snail droppings.\n\nSnails that hatched the previous summer can be put in a chilled room for hibernation over winter. About 1 April, (adjusted for local climate), they are moved to the final fattening pen. IN cases where there are several fattening pens, the smaller snails are placed in one, medium in another, large in another. One-third of a pound of ''H. aspersa'' snails require one square foot of pen. Snails lose weight when they estivate in summer, therefore some growers do not stock pens by weight but by count. For ''H. aspersa'', 10 to 12 snails per square foot is the maximum.\n\n=== Cannibalism by hatchlings ===\nThe first snails to hatch eat the shells of their eggs. This gives them calcium needed for their shells. They may then begin eating unhatched eggs. If the snail eggs are kept at the optimum temperature, {{convert|68|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} (for some varieties), and if none of the eggs lose moisture, most eggs will hatch within 1 to 3 days of each other. [[Cannibalism]] also will be low. If hatching extends over a longer period, cannibalism may increase. Some eggs eaten are eggs that were not fertile or did not develop properly, but sometimes, properly developing embryos might be eaten. A high density of \"clutches\" of egg masses increases the rate of cannibalism, as other nearby egg masses are more likely to be found and eaten. Snail egg has 12 to 20 times the protein of lettuce. The protein helps the baby snails start developing quickly and be healthier. Snail egg is an excellent starter food for newly hatched snails, but they tend to only eat eggs of their own species.\n\n=== Feeding ===\nFeeding season is April through October, (or may vary with the local climate), with a \"rest period\" during the summer. Do not place food in one small clump so that there is not enough room for all the snails to get to it. Snails eat solid food by [[rasping]] it away with their [[radula]]. Feeding activity depends on the weather, and snails may not necessarily feed every day. Evening irrigation in dry weather may encourage feeding since the moisture makes it easier for the snails to move about.\n\nPut the breeding snails in the breeding pens in April or early May. Feed until mid June when mating begins and the snails stop feeding. Snails resume eating after they lay eggs. Once snails have laid their eggs, the adult snails can be removed. This leaves more food and less crowding for the hatchlings.\n\nSnails of the same species collected from different regions may have different food preferences. Some foods that snails eat are: [[Alyssum]], fruit and leaves of [[apple]], [[apricot]], [[artichoke]] (a favorite), [[Aster (genus)|aster]], [[barley]], [[beans]], [[bindweed]], [[California boxwood]], almost any [[cabbage]] variety, [[camomile]], [[carnation]], [[carrot]], [[cauliflower]], [[celeriac]] (root celery), [[celery]], ripe [[cherries]], [[chive]], citrus, [[clover]], [[cucumber]]s (a favorite snail food), [[dandelion]], [[Elderberry|elder]], [[henbane]], [[hibiscus]], [[hollyhock]], [[kale]], larkspur ([[Consolida]] or [[Delphinium]] genera), [[leek]], lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), [[lily]], [[magnolia]], [[mountain ash]], [[mulberry]], [[chrysanthemum]], [[Tropaeolum|nasturtium]], [[Urtica|nettle]], [[nightshade]] berries, [[oats]], [[onion]] greens, [[pansy]], [[parsley]], [[peach]], ripe [[pear]]s, [[pea]]s, [[petunia]], [[phlox]], [[plum]], [[potato]]es (raw or cooked), [[pumpkin]]s, [[radish]], [[rapeseed|rape]], [[rose]], [[sorrel]], [[spinach]], [[sweet pea]], [[thistle]], [[tomato]]es (well liked), [[turnip]], [[wheat]], [[yarrow]], [[zinnia]]. They will eat sweet [[lupin]]es, but will reject bitter [[lupin]]es and other plants with high [[quinolizidine]] [[alkaloid]]s. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.\n\nSnails usually prefer juicy leaves and vegetables over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed as it will quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% [[wheat bran]] while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use [[oats]], [[corn meal]], [[soybean meal]], or [[chicken]] mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed [[oyster]] shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through shipping cartons and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their [[body weight]]. Active snails deprived of food will lose more than one-third of their weight before they starve to death\u2014a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.\n\nSupply calcium at least once a week if it is not available in the soil. It should not contain harmful salts or be so alkaline as to burn the snails. Mix calcium with wet bran or mashed potatoes and serve on a pan; this will keep any leftover food from rotting on the ground.\n\nSome researchers use chicken mash for feed. A plastic pipe can be cut in half lengthwise to make two troughs which can be used as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).\n\nPellets are fine for larger snails, but mash is better for younger ones. Pellets should be partially crushed if fed to young snails. Snails do not grow well if rabbit pellets are their primary diet. Snails show a distinct preference for moist feed. Easy access to enough water must be ensured if snails are fed dry mash.\n\nBe sure to frequently clean the feed and water dishes. The amount of feed a snail eats depends very much on air humidity and on the availability of drinking water. Clean drinking water can be served in a shallow container to reduce the risk of the snail drowning. Some types of chicken waterers may be suitable. Other factors (e.g., temperature, light intensity, food preferences versus food supplied, etc.) also affect feeding. A compromise, until the optimum feed is found, is to feed half green vegetable material and half chicken feed/grain/animal protein.\n\nYoung ''H. aspersa'' readily eats [[milk powder]]. Its rapid rate of assimilation promotes rapid growth.\n\n=== Diseases and pests ===\nGood hygiene can prevent the spread of disease and otherwise improve the health and growth rate of snails. Food is replaced daily in order to prevent spoilage. Earthworms added to the soil help keep the pen clean.\n\n[[Parasitism|Parasites]], [[nematode]]s, [[trematoda|trematodes]], [[fungi]], and micro[[arthropod]]s can attack snails, and such problems can spread rapidly when snail populations are dense. The bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' causes intestinal infections that can spread rapidly in a crowded snail pen.\n\nPossible predators include [[rat]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], [[Mole (animal)|moles]], [[skunk]]s, [[weasel]]s, [[bird]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[lizard]]s, walking insects (e.g., some [[beetle]] and [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] varieties), some types of [[Fly|flies]], [[centipede]]s, and even certain carnivorous snail species, such as ''[[Strangesta capillacea]]''.\n\n=== Population density ===\nPopulation density also affects successful snail production. Pens should contain no more than six to eight fair-sized snails per square foot, or about four large ''H. pomatias''; or figure one kilogram per square meter (about .2 pounds of snail per square foot), which automatically compensates for the size of the snails. To encourage breeding, best results will occur with not more than eight snails per square meter (0.8 per square foot). Some sources say that, for ''H. pomatia'' to breed, 2 to 4 snails per square meter (0.2 to 0.4 per square foot) is the maximum.\n\nSnails tend not to breed when packed too densely or when the [[wikt:slime|slime]] in the pen accumulates too much. The slime apparently works like a [[pheromone]] and suppresses reproduction. On the other hand, snails in groups of about 100 seem to breed better than when only a few snails are confined together. Perhaps they have more potential mates from which to choose. Snails in a densely populated area grow more slowly even when food is abundant, and they also have a higher mortality rate. These snails then become smaller adults who lay fewer clutches of eggs, have fewer eggs per clutch, and the eggs have a lower hatch rate. Smaller adult snails sell for less. [[Dwarfing]] is quite common in snail farming and is attributable mainly to rearing conditions rather than [[heredity]] factors. Crowding snails is false economy. A recommended rate for ''H. aspersa'' is not more than one-third pound per square foot (3.6&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) of soil surface for snails that weigh more than 1&nbsp;gram and not more than 0.2 pound per square foot (2.2&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) for snails that weigh less. (One ounce is about 28&nbsp;grams.)\n\n== Turning snails into escargots ==\n{{Main|Escargot}}\nSnails are mature when a lip forms at the opening of their shell. Before they mature, their shells are more easily broken, making them undesirable. For ''H. aspersa'', commercial weight is 8&nbsp;grams or larger. The nutrient composition of raw snails (per 100&nbsp;grams of edible portion), according to information from the nutrient databank of France,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} is:\n* [[Food energy|Energy]]: 80.5 [[calorie|kcal]] (337 [[kilojoule|kJ]])\n* [[Water]]: 79 g\n* [[Protein]]: 16 g\n* Available [[carbohydrates]]: 2 g\n* [[Fiber]]: 0 g\n* [[Fat]]: 1 g\n* [[Magnesium]]: 250&nbsp;mg\n* [[Calcium]]: 170&nbsp;mg\n* [[Iron]]: 3.5&nbsp;mg\n* [[Vitamin C]]: 0&nbsp;mg\n\nSnail eggs are also harvested and processed to produce [[snail caviar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2007-12-15-snail-caviar-the-new-gourmet-frontier |title=Snail caviar!

Introduced slug and snail varieties tend to be worse pests than native species, probably due in part to the lack of natural controls. Snail pests attack crops ranging from leafy vegetables to fruits that grow near the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes, to citrus fruits high up on trees.\n\nThe [[Federal Plant Pest Act]] defines a plant pest as \"any living stage (including active and dormant forms) of [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[protozoa]], or other [[invertebrate]] animals, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], other [[parasite|parasitic plants]] or reproductive parts thereof; viruses; or any organisms similar to or allied with any of the foregoing; or any [[infection|infectious]] substances, which can directly or indirectly injure or cause disease or damage in or to any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants...\" The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS) categorizes giant African snails as a \"quarantine significant plant pest.\" The United States does not allow live giant African snails into the country under any circumstances. It is illegal to own or to possess them. APHIS vigorously enforces this regulation and destroys or returns these snails to their country of origin.\n\nSince large infestations of snails can do devastating damage, many states have quarantines against nursery products, and other products, from infested states. Further, it is illegal to import snails (or slugs) into the U.S. without permission from the [[Plant Protection and Quarantine Division]] (PPQ), [[Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service]], U.S. Department of Agriculture. APHIS also oversees interstate transportation of snails. Anyone who plans to \"import, release, or make interstate shipments of\" snails, must complete APHIS's PPQ Form 526, Application and Permit to Move Live Plant Pests and Noxious Weeds. This form should be submitted to the State regulatory official. The state will process the request and make a recommendation to APHIS who will then make a decision.\n\nInformation on Plant Pest Permits is available at APHIS's website [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm].\n\nThe [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates the canning of low-[[acid]] foods such as snails. According to FDA, \"establishments engaged in the manufacture of Low-acid or Acidified Canned Foods (LACF) offered for interstate commerce in the United States are required...to register their facility...and file scheduled processes for their products with\" the FDA. This does not refer to fresh products. For appropriate forms, contact: LACF Registration Coordinator, HFS-618, Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 200 C Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20204. Telephone: (202) 205-5282. FAX: (202) 205-4758 or (202) 205-4128.\n\nImproper canning of low-acid meats, e.g., snails, involves a risk of [[botulism]]. When canning snails for home consumption, carefully follow canning instructions for low-acid meats to prevent food poisoning.\n\nState laws also may apply to imports into certain states and to raising snails in a given state. Some states may want to inspect and approve facilities. Thus anyone who plans to raise snails also should check with their State's Agriculture Department.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n* Rebecca Thompson and Sheldon Cheney [https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm '''Raising Snails'''] \"[[National Agricultural Library]], [[Agricultural Research Service]], [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].\"\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608020604/http://shellsclub.by.ru/files/review_hel.htm |date=June 8, 2004 |title=Source of this article in Russian }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060711074205/http://bursaagricola.ro/Info-CRESTEREA_MELCILOR-4-23640-1.html Source of this article in] Romanian\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080728004505/http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/NAP/00-188.htm Breeding and Growing Snails Commercially in Australia]\n* [http://escargot.free.fr/eng/index.html Escargot Passion]\n* [https://rirdc.infoservices.com.au/items/06-104 Free-range Snail Farming in Australia] Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, Australian government\n* [http://www.manandmollusc.net/molluscan_food_files/molluscan_food_terrestrial.html Man and Mollusc's Data Base of Edible Molluscs]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080416174658/http://www.sdnetwork.kabissa.org/newscollection/ideanews_1.htm#GrowSnail Snail Farming in Africa]\n* [http://www.snailcream.co.uk/heliculture/ Snail Farming (Heliculture)]\n* [http://africabusinessclassroom.com/snail-farming-in-nigeria-how-to-start-make-money/  Snail Farming in Nigeria]\n\n{{Edible molluscs}}\n\n[[Category:Agriculture]]\n[[Category:Gastropods and humans]]\n", "name_user": "Chescargot", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTurning snails into escargots", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliciculture"}

W. Hoffmann and H.

Exceptions included [[the Platters]], with songs including \"[[The Great Pretender]]\" (1955){{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 5, track 3}} and [[the Coasters]] with humorous songs like \"[[Yakety Yak]]\" (1958),{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 13}} both of which ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the era.<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop/> Towards the end of the decade there were increasing numbers of white, particularly Italian-American, singers taking up Doo Wop, creating all-white groups like [[the Mystics]] and [[Dion and the Belmonts]] and racially integrated groups like [[the Del-Vikings]] and [[the Impalas]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop/> Doo-wop would be a major influence on vocal surf music, soul and early Merseybeat, including the Beatles.<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop/>\n\n=== Cover versions ===\n{{Main article|Cover version}}\nMany of the earliest white rock and roll hits were [[cover version|cover]]s or partial re-writes of earlier black rhythm and blues or blues songs.{{sfn |Gilliland|1969 |loc=show 4, track 5}} Through the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[R&B]] music had been gaining a stronger beat and a wilder style, with artists such as Fats Domino and [[Johnny Otis]] speeding up the [[tempos]] and increasing the [[beat (music)|backbeat]] to great popularity on the [[juke joint]] circuit.<ref>Ennis, Philip H.

Deffaa, ''Blue rhythms: six lives in rhythm and blues'' (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1996), pp. 183\u20134.</ref> The racial lines, however, are rather more clouded by the fact that some of these R&B songs originally recorded by black artists had been written by white songwriters, such as the team of [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]]. Songwriting credits were often unreliable; many publishers, record executives, and even managers (both white and black) would insert their name as a composer in order to collect royalty checks.\n\n[[File:Little Richard in 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rock and roller [[Little Richard]] performing in 2007]]\nCovers were customary in the music industry at the time; it was made particularly easy by the [[compulsory license]] provision of [[United States copyright law]] (still in effect).<ref>J.

The more familiar sound of these covers may have been more palatable to white audiences, there may have been an element of prejudice, but labels aimed at the white market also had much better distribution networks and were generally much more profitable.<ref>R.

The lyrics of rock and roll songs described events and conflicts that most listeners could relate to through personal experience. Topics such as sex that had generally been considered taboo began to appear in rock and roll lyrics. This new music tried to break boundaries and express emotions that people were actually feeling but had not talked about. An awakening began to take place in American youth culture.<ref name=\"Schafer, William J 1972\">Schafer, William J. ''Rock Music: Where It's Been, What It Means, Where It's Going''.

Fisher, ''Something in the air: radio, rock, and the revolution that shaped a generation'' (Marc Fisher, 2007), p. 53.</ref> Rock and roll appeared at a time when racial tensions in the United States were entering a new phase, with the beginnings of the [[civil rights]] movement for [[Racial segregation|desegregation]], leading to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling that abolished the policy of \"[[separate but equal]]\" in 1954, but leaving a policy which would be extremely difficult to enforce in parts of the United States.<ref>H. Zinn, ''A people's history of the United States: 1492\u2013present'' (Pearson Education, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 450.</ref> The coming together of white youth audiences and [[African American music|black music]] in rock and roll inevitably provoked strong white racist reactions within the US, with many whites condemning its breaking down of barriers based on color.<ref name=Altshuler2003p35/> Many observers saw rock and roll as heralding the way for desegregation, in creating a new form of music that encouraged racial cooperation and shared experience.<ref>M.

The youth culture exemplified by rock and roll was a recurring source of concern for older generations, who worried about juvenile delinquency and social rebellion, particularly because to a large extent rock and roll culture was shared by different racial and social groups.<ref name=Coleman2007 />\n\nIn America, that concern was conveyed even in youth cultural artifacts such as [[comic books]].

If everything that came before laid the groundwork, \"Rock Around the Clock\" introduced the music to a global audience.<ref name=AllmusicHaley>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4426/biography|label=Bill Haley|accessdate=August 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, the arrival of rockabilly was underlined by the success of songs like \"[[Folsom Prison Blues]]\" by [[Johnny Cash]], \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]]\" by Perkins and the No. 1 hit \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\" by Presley.<ref name=AllmusicRbilly /> For a few years it became the most commercially successful form of rock and roll.

W. Hoffmann and H. Ferstler, ''Encyclopedia of recorded sound, Volume 1'' (CRC Press, 2nd edn., 2004), pp. 327\u20138.</ref> Its origins were in African-American vocal groups of the 1930s and 40s, such as the [[Ink Spots]] and the [[Mills Brothers]], who had enjoyed considerable commercial success with arrangements based on close harmonies.<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop>{{harvnb |Bogdanov |Woodstra |Erlewine |2002 |pp=1306\u20137}}</ref> They were followed by 1940s R&B vocal acts such as [[the Orioles]], [[the Ravens]] and [[the Clovers]], who injected a strong element of traditional gospel and, increasingly, the energy of [[jump blues]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop/> By 1954, as rock and roll was beginning to emerge, a number of similar acts began to cross over from the R&B charts to mainstream success, often with added honking brass and saxophone, with [[the Crows]], [[the Penguins]], [[the El Dorados]] and [[the Turbans]] all scoring major hits.<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop/> Despite the subsequent explosion in records from doo wop acts in the later '50s, many failed to chart or were one-hit wonders. Exceptions included [[the Platters]], with songs including \"[[The Great Pretender]]\" (1955){{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 5, track 3}} and [[the Coasters]] with humorous songs like \"[[Yakety Yak]]\" (1958),{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 13}} both of which ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the era.<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop/> Towards the end of the decade there were increasing numbers of white, particularly Italian-American, singers taking up Doo Wop, creating all-white groups like [[the Mystics]] and [[Dion and the Belmonts]] and racially integrated groups like [[the Del-Vikings]] and [[the Impalas]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop/> Doo-wop would be a major influence on vocal surf music, soul and early Merseybeat, including the Beatles.<ref name=Bogdanov2002DooWop/>\n\n=== Cover versions ===\n{{Main article|Cover version}}\nMany of the earliest white rock and roll hits were [[cover version|cover]]s or partial re-writes of earlier black rhythm and blues or blues songs.{{sfn |Gilliland|1969 |loc=show 4, track 5}} Through the late 1940s and early 1950s, [[R&B]] music had been gaining a stronger beat and a wilder style, with artists such as Fats Domino and [[Johnny Otis]] speeding up the [[tempos]] and increasing the [[beat (music)|backbeat]] to great popularity on the [[juke joint]] circuit.<ref>Ennis, Philip H.

Deffaa, ''Blue rhythms: six lives in rhythm and blues'' (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1996), pp. 183\u20134.</ref> The racial lines, however, are rather more clouded by the fact that some of these R&B songs originally recorded by black artists had been written by white songwriters, such as the team of [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]]. Songwriting credits were often unreliable; many publishers, record executives, and even managers (both white and black) would insert their name as a composer in order to collect royalty checks.\n\n[[File:Little Richard in 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rock and roller [[Little Richard]] performing in 2007]]\nCovers were customary in the music industry at the time; it was made particularly easy by the [[compulsory license]] provision of [[United States copyright law]] (still in effect).<ref>J.

The more familiar sound of these covers may have been more palatable to white audiences, there may have been an element of prejudice, but labels aimed at the white market also had much better distribution networks and were generally much more profitable.<ref>R.

C. Altschuler, ''All shook up: how rock 'n' roll changed America'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press US, 2003), p. 121.</ref> In addition, rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both African-American and white American teens enjoyed the music.<ref name=\"Altshuler2003p35\"/>\n\nMany early rock and roll songs dealt with issues of cars, school, dating, and clothing. The lyrics of rock and roll songs described events and conflicts that most listeners could relate to through personal experience. Topics such as sex that had generally been considered taboo began to appear in rock and roll lyrics. This new music tried to break boundaries and express emotions that people were actually feeling but had not talked about. An awakening began to take place in American youth culture.<ref name=\"Schafer, William J 1972\">Schafer, William J. ''Rock Music: Where It's Been, What It Means, Where It's Going''. Minneapolis: Augsburg Publishing House, 1972.</ref>\n\n=== Race ===\nIn the crossover of African-American \"race music\" to a growing white youth audience, the popularization of rock and roll involved both black performers reaching a white audience and white musicians performing African-American music.<ref>M. Fisher, ''Something in the air: radio, rock, and the revolution that shaped a generation'' (Marc Fisher, 2007), p. 53.</ref> Rock and roll appeared at a time when racial tensions in the United States were entering a new phase, with the beginnings of the [[civil rights]] movement for [[Racial segregation|desegregation]], leading to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling that abolished the policy of \"[[separate but equal]]\" in 1954, but leaving a policy which would be extremely difficult to enforce in parts of the United States.<ref>H. Zinn, ''A people's history of the United States: 1492\u2013present'' (Pearson Education, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 450.</ref> The coming together of white youth audiences and [[African American music|black music]] in rock and roll inevitably provoked strong white racist reactions within the US, with many whites condemning its breaking down of barriers based on color.<ref name=Altshuler2003p35/> Many observers saw rock and roll as heralding the way for desegregation, in creating a new form of music that encouraged racial cooperation and shared experience.<ref>M. T. Bertrand, ''Race, rock, and Elvis'' (University of Illinois Press, 2000), pp. 95\u20136.</ref> Many authors have argued that early rock and roll was instrumental in the way both white and black teenagers identified themselves.<ref>{{cite book \n| last = Carson\n| first = Mina\n| title = Girls Rock!: Fifty Years of Women Making Music\n| publisher = Lexington\n| series =\n| edition =\n| year = 2004\n| page = 24\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Teen culture ===\n{{Main|Youth subculture}}\n[[File:True Life Romance 3.jpg|thumb|upright|\"There's No Romance in Rock and Roll\" made the cover of ''True Life Romance'' in 1956]]\nSeveral rock historians have claimed that rock and roll was one of the first music genres to define an age group.<ref name=\"padel\" /> It gave teenagers a sense of belonging, even when they were alone.<ref name=\"padel\">{{cite book |last=Padel |first=Ruth |title=I'm a Man: Sex, Gods, and Rock 'n' Roll |publisher=Faber and Faber |year=2000 |pages=46\u201348}}</ref> Rock and roll is often identified with the emergence of teen culture among the first [[baby boomer]] generation, who had greater relative affluence and leisure time and adopted rock and roll as part of a distinct subculture.<ref name=Coleman2007>M. Coleman, L. H. Ganong, K. Warzinik, ''Family Life in Twentieth-Century America'' (Greenwood, 2007), pp. 216\u201317.</ref> This involved not just music, absorbed via radio, record buying, jukeboxes and TV programs like ''[[American Bandstand]]'', but also extended to film, clothes, hair, cars and motorbikes, and distinctive language. The youth culture exemplified by rock and roll was a recurring source of concern for older generations, who worried about juvenile delinquency and social rebellion, particularly because to a large extent rock and roll culture was shared by different racial and social groups.<ref name=Coleman2007 />\n\nIn America, that concern was conveyed even in youth cultural artifacts such as [[comic books]]. In \"There's No Romance in Rock and Roll\" from ''True Life Romance'' (1956), a defiant teen dates a rock and roll-loving boy but drops him for one who likes traditional adult music\u2014to her parents' relief.<ref>Nolan, Michelle. ''Love on the Racks'' (McFarland, 2008) p.150</ref> In Britain, where postwar prosperity was more limited, rock and roll culture became attached to the pre-existing [[Teddy Boy]] movement, largely working class in origin, and eventually to the [[Rocker (subculture)|rockers]].<ref name=\"D. O'Sullivan, 1974 pp. 38\u20139\" /> Rock and roll has been seen as reorienting popular music toward a youth market, as in [[Dion and the Belmonts]]' \"[[A Teenager in Love]]\" (1960).<ref>Lisa A. Lewis, ''The Adoring Audience: Fan Culture and Popular Media'' (Routledge, 1992), p. 98.</ref>\n\n=== Dance styles ===\nFrom its early 1950s beginnings through the early 1960s, rock and roll spawned new [[Novelty and fad dances|dance crazes]]<ref>[http://www.sixtiescity.com/Culture/dance.shtm sixtiescity.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324225234/http://www.sixtiescity.com/Culture/dance.shtm |date=March 24, 2012 }} ''Sixties Dance and Dance Crazes''</ref> including the [[Twist (dance)|twist]]. Teenagers found the syncopated [[backbeat]] rhythm especially suited to reviving Big Band-era [[jitterbug]] dancing.
