He reveals he has traveled from [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino, California]], to catch the musical. Two security guards tell Patchy to leave, as the show is about to begin. Patchy objects but gets kicked out as Patchy claims he is a victim of pirate discrimination and sings a protest chant. One of the guards apologizes, then tells the audience to enjoy the show. In the television special, this prologue is replaced by an animated segment about theatre etiquette.\n\n===Act One===\n[[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] awakens and welcomes the day with his pet sea snail, Gary (\"Bikini Bottom Day\"). He greets various friends in his hometown of Bikini Bottom&mdash;including his best friend [[Patrick Star|Patrick]], his neighbor [[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]], and his friend [[Sandy Cheeks]]&mdash;as he walks to the Krusty Krab restaurant. At work, his boss [[Mr. Krabs]] tells his daughter [[Pearl Krabs|Pearl]] that she will manage the restaurant one day. With Pearl uninterested, SpongeBob hints at his desire to become the manager. Mr. Krabs laughs at the idea, telling SpongeBob he is \"just a simple sponge\" (\"Bikini Bottom Day\" (Reprise 1)). Then, a violent tremor suddenly rocks the entire town.\n\nA news report reveals that the tremor was caused by the nearby Mount Humongous, a [[volcano]] that will soon erupt (\"No Control\"). SpongeBob cheers up an upset Patrick by reiterating that they are best friends forever (\"BFF\"). With the town in a panic over the impending doom, married villains [[Plankton and Karen]] try to convince the citizens to enter an escape pod that ensures safety&mdash;a cover-up for their secret scheme to hypnotize the citizens in the pod into liking the chum that they serve at their restaurant, the Chum Bucket (\"When the Going Gets Tough\"). The townspeople, unknowingly, support this idea and decide to hold a last-minute music concert to raise money. Squidward's idea of his one-man show is immediately shut down. Instead, Pearl suggests that the famous rock band, the Electric Skates, play at the concert. Everyone agrees and Squidward is named manager of the event. Despite Sandy's pleas that science could help them solve the problem, the townsfolk ignore her for being a land mammal.\n\nSpongeBob, however, is against the idea of leaving town and believes the citizens should save Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob thinks back on Mr. Krabs' words from earlier and wonders if he could save the town (\"(Just a) Simple Sponge\"). He goes to Patrick and Sandy for help. Mr. Krabs sees the upcoming disaster as a money-making opportunity, holding an \"apocalypse sale\". Pearl worries about her father's greed, believing that it overshadows his care for her (\"Daddy Knows Best\").\n\nMeanwhile, SpongeBob convinces Patrick and Sandy to team up, climb the volcano, and stop it from erupting with a bubble device Sandy will build. The friends are determined to succeed (\"Hero Is My Middle Name\"). Before they start their plan, a group of cultist [[sardines]] appear. They found wisdom in Patrick's thoughts at the town meeting and decide to make him their new leader (\"Super Star Sea Savior\"). Patrick likes the idea and decides to back out of SpongeBob's plan so that he can bask in self-glory, angering SpongeBob. The two argue and end their \"BFF\" status. After Patrick leaves, Sandy reminds SpongeBob that things are bound to be okay. The entire company reveals their personal thoughts and feelings about the impending disaster (\"Tomorrow Is\").\n\n===Act Two===\nPatchy again sneaks onstage, telling the audience that [[pirates]] are persecuted by others because of [[stereotypes]] (\"Poor Pirates\"), supported in song by a group of [[pirates]] he discovered during the show's first act, wandering into a [[dive bar]] in the nearby [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]]. The theater's security again intervenes to chase Patchy away.\n\nSpongeBob wakes up and greets a new day&mdash;the day when the volcano is expected to erupt (\"Bikini Bottom Day\" (Reprise 2)). Bikini Bottom has fallen into anarchy and chaos: the mayor has employed a dictatorship over the people and an angry mob has started to hunt down Sandy, thinking her science is the cause for the volcano's impending eruption. Sandy hides from the mob and shows SpongeBob the ingenious bubble device, the Eruptor Interrupter. They plan to throw it inside the volcano and save the town.\n\nBack in Bikini Bottom, Plankton worries that Sandy and SpongeBob will successfully climb up the mountain and save the town, but Karen tells him that she found his avalanche maker. She says they can use it to create an avalanche that SpongeBob and Sandy will not survive. The Electric Skates finally arrive (\"Bikini Bottom Boogie\"). Squidward asks if he can perform with them as an opening act. The band will only allow it if Squidward buys every item on a long shopping list. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Sandy make their way up the volcano with great difficulty. Sandy tries to lift their spirits by reminding them of what they have learned in karate class about never giving up (\"Chop to the Top\"). SpongeBob cannot help but think of how he misses Patrick and wishes he were there to help them. In Bikini Bottom, Patrick finds life as a guru unexciting and misses SpongeBob as well, prompting him to leave his followers behind to help SpongeBob (\"(I Guess) I Miss You\").\n\nSquidward obtains all but one of the items on the Electric Skates' list, so the band refuses to let him perform despite his pleas, calling him a \"loser\" in the process. Their use of this word causes Squidward\u2014constantly called a loser in childhood&mdash;to snap back at the band in anger. The band quits, leaving Squidward alone; he insists that he is not a loser and performs a song with a tap dance number and back-up chorus in his imagination (\"I'm Not a Loser\"). However, due to the band being gone, there is no concert or escape pod, which makes the town citizens start fighting violently. Back on the mountain, Plankton and Karen use the avalanche maker to cause an avalanche, sending SpongeBob falling off the mountain. Patrick saves him with a jetpack Sandy invented, and the two reaffirm their friendship and follow Sandy to the summit of the mountain. When they reach the top, neither Sandy nor Patrick are able to reach the rim where they need to throw the device in. They turn to SpongeBob, who doubts his skills (\"(Just a) Simple Sponge\" (Reprise)). They remind him that he is the only one who can squeeze through tight areas and that his optimism has gotten them this far. With new determination, SpongeBob throws the Eruptor Interrupter in. They soon discover the chaos Bikini Bottom is having, and they immediately parachute down to the town to stop the fighting from getting worse.\n\nSpongeBob tries to calm everyone down, insisting that, despite whatever happens, they have each other (\"Best Day Ever\"). When the time comes for the volcano to erupt, everyone braces for their deaths. Time passes without an eruption along with bubbles in the air, signaling that the Eruptor Interrupter worked. With Bikini Bottom safe, everyone apologizes for their behavior and decide that they should celebrate by having a new concert led by Pearl and Squidward, much to his delight. Patchy descends from above on a rope, having finally managed to sneak into the show. He makes the cast reluctantly agree to let him be a part of the finale as the townspeople welcome the brand new day (\"Bikini Bottom Day\" (Reprise 3)). During the curtain call, the cast performs one final song (\"SpongeBob SquarePants Theme Song\").\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* \"Bikini Bottom Day\" by [[Jonathan Coulton]] \u2013 SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Karen & Company\n* \"Bikini Bottom Day\" (reprise) by Coulton \u2013 SpongeBob\n* \"[[Outside (David Bowie album)|No Control]]\" by [[David Bowie]] & [[Brian Eno]] \u2013 Perch Perkins, SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, Pearl, Squidward, Patrick, Sandy, Plankton, Karen & Company<big>{{ref|2|2}}</big>\n* \"BFF\" by [[Plain White T's]] \u2013 SpongeBob & Patrick\n* \"When the Going Gets Tough\" by [[T.I.]] \u2013 Plankton, Karen, SpongeBob & Company\n* \"(Just a) Simple Sponge\" by [[Panic!

He reveals he has traveled from [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino, California]], to catch the musical. Two security guards tell Patchy to leave, as the show is about to begin. Patchy objects but gets kicked out as Patchy claims he is a victim of pirate discrimination and sings a protest chant. One of the guards apologizes, then tells the audience to enjoy the show. In the television special, this prologue is replaced by an animated segment about theatre etiquette.\n\n===Act One===\n[[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] awakens and welcomes the day with his pet sea snail, Gary (\"Bikini Bottom Day\"). He greets various friends in his hometown of Bikini Bottom&mdash;including his best friend [[Patrick Star|Patrick]], his neighbor [[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]], and his friend [[Sandy Cheeks]]&mdash;as he walks to the Krusty Krab restaurant. At work, his boss [[Mr. Krabs]] tells his daughter [[Pearl Krabs|Pearl]] that she will manage the restaurant one day. With Pearl uninterested, SpongeBob hints at his desire to become the manager. Mr. Krabs laughs at the idea, telling SpongeBob he is \"just a simple sponge\" (\"Bikini Bottom Day\" (Reprise 1)). Then, a violent tremor suddenly rocks the entire town.\n\nA news report reveals that the tremor was caused by the nearby Mount Humongous, a [[volcano]] that will soon erupt (\"No Control\"). SpongeBob cheers up an upset Patrick by reiterating that they are best friends forever (\"BFF\"). With the town in a panic over the impending doom, married villains [[Plankton and Karen]] try to convince the citizens to enter an escape pod that ensures safety&mdash;a cover-up for their secret scheme to hypnotize the citizens in the pod into liking the chum that they serve at their restaurant, the Chum Bucket (\"When the Going Gets Tough\"). The townspeople, unknowingly, support this idea and decide to hold a last-minute music concert to raise money. Squidward's idea of his one-man show is immediately shut down. Instead, Pearl suggests that the famous rock band, the Electric Skates, play at the concert. Everyone agrees and Squidward is named manager of the event. Despite Sandy's pleas that science could help them solve the problem, the townsfolk ignore her for being a land mammal.\n\nSpongeBob, however, is against the idea of leaving town and believes the citizens should save Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob thinks back on Mr. Krabs' words from earlier and wonders if he could save the town (\"(Just a) Simple Sponge\"). He goes to Patrick and Sandy for help. Mr. Krabs sees the upcoming disaster as a money-making opportunity, holding an \"apocalypse sale\". Pearl worries about her father's greed, believing that it overshadows his care for her (\"Daddy Knows Best\").\n\nMeanwhile, SpongeBob convinces Patrick and Sandy to team up, climb the volcano, and stop it from erupting with a bubble device Sandy will build. The friends are determined to succeed (\"Hero is My Middle Name\"). Before they start their plan, a group of cultist [[sardines]] appear. They found wisdom in Patrick's thoughts at the town meeting and decide to make him their new leader (\"Super Star Sea Savior\"). Patrick likes the idea and decides to back out of SpongeBob's plan so that he can bask in self-glory, angering SpongeBob. The two argue and end their \"BFF\" status. After Patrick leaves, Sandy reminds SpongeBob that things are bound to be okay. The entire company reveals their personal thoughts and feelings about the impending disaster (\"Tomorrow Is\").\n\n===Act Two===\nPatchy again sneaks onstage, telling the audience that [[pirates]] are persecuted by others because of [[stereotypes]] (\"Poor Pirates\"), supported in song by a group of [[pirates]] he discovered during the show's first act, wandering into a [[dive bar]] in the nearby [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]]. The theater's security again intervenes to chase Patchy away.\n\nSpongeBob wakes up and greets a new day&mdash;the day when the volcano is expected to erupt (\"Bikini Bottom Day\" (Reprise 2)). Bikini Bottom has fallen into anarchy and chaos: the mayor has employed a dictatorship over the people and an angry mob has started to hunt down Sandy, thinking her science is the cause for the volcano's impending eruption. Sandy hides from the mob and shows SpongeBob the ingenious bubble device, the Eruptor Interrupter. They plan to throw it inside the volcano and save the town.\n\nBack in Bikini Bottom, Plankton worries that Sandy and SpongeBob will successfully climb up the mountain and save the town, but Karen tells him that she found his avalanche maker. She says they can use it to create an avalanche that SpongeBob and Sandy will not survive. The Electric Skates finally arrive (\"Bikini Bottom Boogie\"). Squidward asks if he can perform with them as an opening act. The band will only allow it if Squidward buys every item on a long shopping list. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Sandy make their way up the volcano with great difficulty. Sandy tries to lift their spirits by reminding them of what they have learned in karate class about never giving up (\"Chop to the Top\"). SpongeBob cannot help but think of how he misses Patrick and wishes he were there to help them. In Bikini Bottom, Patrick finds life as a guru unexciting and misses SpongeBob as well, prompting him to leave his followers behind to help SpongeBob (\"(I Guess) I Miss You\").\n\nSquidward obtains all but one of the items on the Electric Skates' list, so the band refuses to let him perform despite his pleas, calling him a \"loser\" in the process. Their use of this word causes Squidward\u2014constantly called a loser in childhood&mdash;to snap back at the band in anger. The band quits, leaving Squidward alone; he insists that he is not a loser and performs a song with a tap dance number and back-up chorus in his imagination (\"I'm Not a Loser\"). However, due to the band being gone, there is no concert or escape pod, which makes the town citizens start fighting violently. Back on the mountain, Plankton and Karen use the avalanche maker to cause an avalanche, sending SpongeBob falling off the mountain. Patrick saves him with a jetpack Sandy invented, and the two reaffirm their friendship and follow Sandy to the summit of the mountain. When they reach the top, neither Sandy nor Patrick are able to reach the rim where they need to throw the device in. They turn to SpongeBob, who doubts his skills (\"(Just a) Simple Sponge\" (Reprise)). They remind him that he is the only one who can squeeze through tight areas and that his optimism has gotten them this far. With new determination, SpongeBob throws the Eruptor Interrupter in. They soon discover the chaos Bikini Bottom is having, and they immediately parachute down to the town to stop the fighting from getting worse.\n\nSpongeBob tries to calm everyone down, insisting that, despite whatever happens, they have each other (\"Best Day Ever\"). When the time comes for the volcano to erupt, everyone braces for their deaths. Time passes without an eruption along with bubbles in the air, signaling that the Eruptor Interrupter worked. With Bikini Bottom safe, everyone apologizes for their behavior and decide that they should celebrate by having a new concert led by Pearl and Squidward, much to his delight. Patchy descends from above on a rope, having finally managed to sneak into the show. He makes the cast reluctantly agree to let him be a part of the finale as the townspeople welcome the brand new day (\"Bikini Bottom Day\" (Reprise 3)). During the curtain call, the cast performs one final song (\"SpongeBob SquarePants Theme Song\").\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* \"Bikini Bottom Day\" by [[Jonathan Coulton]] \u2013 SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Karen & Company\n* \"Bikini Bottom Day\" (reprise) by Coulton \u2013 SpongeBob\n* \"[[Outside (David Bowie album)|No Control]]\" by [[David Bowie]] & [[Brian Eno]] \u2013 Perch Perkins, SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, Pearl, Squidward, Patrick, Sandy, Plankton, Karen & Company<big>{{ref|2|2}}</big>\n* \"BFF\" by [[Plain White T's]] \u2013 SpongeBob & Patrick\n* \"When the Going Gets Tough\" by [[T.I.]] \u2013 Plankton, Karen, SpongeBob & Company\n* \"(Just a) Simple Sponge\" by [[Panic!

He is the former [[Coach (basketball)|head coach]] of [[EuroLeague]] powerhouse [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] and the senior [[Greece national basketball team|Greek national basketball team]]. Under Giannakis' guidance, the Greek national team won the gold medal at the [[EuroBasket 2005]], and the silver medal at the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]] in Japan. Giannakis also coached an Athenian professional team, [[Maroussi B.C.|Maroussi]], which he led to the forefront of the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]]. He has also been the head coach of the senior [[China men's national basketball team|Chinese national team]].\n\nA true floor general from the [[point guard]] position, Giannakis began his pro basketball playing career in Greece, with [[Ionikos Nikaias B.C.|Ionikos Nikaias]], before moving to [[Aris B.C.|Aris]], where he spent the most important part of his playing career. In [[Thessaloniki]], he helped to lead the Yellows (Aris) to three consecutive [[EuroLeague Final Four]]s between 1988 and 1990, as well as to a [[FIBA European Cup]] (later renamed to Saporta Cup) title [[1992-93 FIBA European Cup|in 1993]]. In the summer of 1993, he was transferred to [[Panionios B.C.|Panionios]], and finally a year later, to [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], with whom he won a [[EuroLeague]] championship [[1996 EuroLeague Final Four|in 1996]]. On February 3, 2008, Giannakis was chosen as one of the [[50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors]] over the previous half-century by the [[EuroLeague]] Basketball Experts Committee.<ref>[http://www.euroleague.net/item/24016 Euroleague official website, ''Experts decide European Club Basketball's 50 greatest contributors.'']</ref>\n\nGiannakis was, along with [[Nikos Galis]], [[Panagiotis Fasoulas]], and [[Fanis Christodoulou]], one of the main stars of the legendary late 1980s [[Greece national basketball team|Greek National Team]] that put Greece on the world basketball map. He was their [[captain (sports)|captain]] when they won the [[EuroBasket]] of [[EuroBasket 1987|1987]], and were the silver-medalists at the same championship [[EuroBasket 1989|two years later]]. Furthermore, Giannakis was an important member of the Greek national team when they reached the EuroBasket semifinals in [[EuroBasket 1993|1993]] and [[EuroBasket 1995|1995]], as well as the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup|FIBA World Championship]] semifinals in [[1994 FIBA World Championship|1994]].\n\n==Early years==\nGiannakis was born and raised in a [[working poor|poor]] neighborhood of [[Nikaia, Attica|Nikaia]], [[Athens]]. \u0397is parents, Dimitris, owner of a motorbike workshop, and Kalliope, a [[weaving|weaver]], gave birth to five boys.

He showed an early inclination to sports, and tried [[basketball]]. He began watching the games of a local basketball club, and he was later approached by the coach of the youth team of [[Ionikos Nikaias B.C.|Ionikos Nikaias]], who asked him to join their team.\n\n==Club playing career==\n===Ionikos Nikaias===\nGiannakis began his [[sports club|club]] career with the youth teams of [[Ionikos Nikaias B.C.|Ionikos Nikaias]] in 1971. His first coach, [[George Vassilakopoulos]], moved Giannakis up to the [[sports club|club's]] senior men's first team, from the youth squad, in 1972, when he was at the age of just 13. The club was playing in the [[Greek B Basket League|Greek 2nd Division]] at the time. In 1975, the club was [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] up to the top-tier level [[Greek Basket League|Greek First Division]]. Giannakis' exceptional play with Ionikos Nikaias at such a young age, drew the eyes of pro basketball experts on him.\n\nOn January 24, 1981, Ionikos Nikaias, led by a 22-year-old Giannakis, played against [[Aris B.C.|Aris Thessaloniki]], which was led by [[Nikos Galis]]. Aris won in a tight game, by a score of 113\u2013114. The game is memorable in the history of Greek pro club basketball, because in the game, Giannakis scored 73 points, and Galis scored 62 points,<ref>[http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/11052/180/athens-basketball-devotion-through-the-decades Euroleague.net My name is Giannakis. Panayotis Giannakis.]</ref> achieving the 2nd and 4th most points scored in a single game of the Greek League basketball championship.<ref name=\"High Scores\">[[Greek Basket League statistical leaders]]</ref> In 1982, Giannakis was selected by the [[Boston Celtics]], with the 205th pick of the [[1982 NBA draft]].\n\n===Aris Thessaloniki===\nOn August 3, 1984, Giannakis transferred to the Greek club [[Aris B.C.|Aris Thessaloniki]], after the club paid a transfer fee contract buyout to [[Ionikos Nikaias B.C.|Ionikos Nikaias]] for his player rights, in the amount of 42 million [[Greek drachma|Greek Drachmas]],<ref>[http://www.sport24.gr/Basket/ElladaBasket/EthnikiBasket/seismos-sthn-thessalonikh-o-giannakhs-ston-arh.4791726.html \"\u03a3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7, \u03bf \u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0386\u03c1\u03b7\" {{in lang|el}}.]</ref> which was considered a huge amount of money for a transfer buyout at that time. Giannakis also personally received a [[BMW]] car, a [[sporting goods store]], and 8 million drachmas from Aris. With Aris, Giannakis teamed up with [[Nikos Galis]], to form one half of an historic \"tag-team\" that took Greek and European basketball by storm for the years to come.\n\nHis first season with Aris, the 1984\u201385 season, was a great success. He won both the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] championship, and the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]] title.  In the final of the latter, Giannakis made 8 out of 12 3-pointers, leading his team to victory over [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]]. And this was only the beginning, as 6 more consecutive Greek League championships, and 5 more Greek Cup titles with Aris were to follow.\n\nWith [[Aris B.C.|Aris]], Giannakis took part in 3 consecutive [[EuroLeague Final Four]]s: [[1988 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|Ghent 1988]], [[1989 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|Munich 1989]], and [[1990 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|Zaragoza 1990]]. Aris joined the elite of European basketball clubs, but a European title did not come for Giannakis until much later, in 1993, when he won the [[FIBA European Cup]] (later renamed Saporta Cup), in [[1992\u201393 FIBA European Cup|the final in Turin]]. By then, [[Nikos Galis]] had left Aris, and joined [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], and Giannakis had become the de facto leader and franchise player of Aris.\n\n===Panionios===\nAfter 9 years with [[Aris B.C.|Aris Thessaloniki]], Giannakis moved to the Greek club [[Panionios B.C.|Panionios]], for the 1993\u201394 season.\n\n===Panathinaikos Athens===\nAfter spending a season with [[Panionios B.C.|Panionios]], Giannakis then moved to the Greek club, [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], where he played from 1994\u201396, and he finished his career as a player there. With Panathinaikos, he finally won the [[EuroLeague]] title, as he won the [[1996 FIBA European League Final Four|Final in 1996, in Paris]]. He also won the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]] title with Panathinaikos that same year, making it the 7th Greek Cup title he won in his playing career, to go along with his 7 [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] championships. He ended his pro club playing career in 1996, having competed in 5 [[EuroLeague Final Four]]s (3 with [[Aris B.C.|Aris]] and 2 with [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]]).\n\n==National team playing career==\nGiannakis led the [[Greece men's national under-16 and under-17 basketball team|Greek junior national team]] to the silver medal at the [[FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship]] of [[1975 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship|1975]]. A year later, he debuted with the senior men's [[Greece national basketball team|Greek national basketball team]], as a 17-year-old, versus the [[Czechoslovakian national basketball team]].\n\nIn 1979, he won the gold medal at the [[Basketball at the 1979 Mediterranean Games|Mediterranean Games]]. He was also the [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the senior men's Greek national team that won the gold medal at the [[EuroBasket 1987]], and the silver medal at the [[EuroBasket 1989]]. During his playing time with the Greek national team, Greece participated in 27 international competitions. He retired from the national team as a player on August 2, 1996, after taking part in the [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996 Summer Olympics]] at Atlanta.\n\n==Career as a head coach==\n===National teams===\n====Greece====\nUnconventionally, the very next year after he retired from playing with the Greek national team, Giannakis started his [[basketball coach|coaching]] career as the [[head coach]] of the [[Greece national basketball team|Greek National Team]] in 1997. He stayed the head coach of the national team for 2 years, leading the team to a 4th-place finish at the [[EuroBasket 1997]], and a 4th-place finish at the [[1998 FIBA World Championship]].\n\nHe returned to coach the national team in 2004, for the [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2004 Summer Olympics]], where he led the Greek team to a 5th-place finish. The next year, under his coaching, Greece won the [[EuroBasket 2005]], marking the second time that Greece had won the [[EuroBasket]]. After 2006, he no longer simultaneously coached on the professional [[sports club|club]] level and [[national team]] level, as he decided to focus his full attention on the Greek national team only. In 2006, he coached the national team of Greece to a second-place finish at the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]]. In the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup|World Championship]]'s semifinal game, held on September 1, 2006, Giannakis' Greek team beat the heavily favored [[United States men's national basketball team|United States national basketball team]] for the first time, by a score of 101\u201395.\n\nIn December 2008, he ended his tenure as the head coach of Greece's national team, and was succeeded by [[Jonas Kazlauskas]].<ref>[http://www.talkbasket.net/news/giannakis-era-is-over.html Giannakis era is over.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206013456/http://www.talkbasket.net/news/giannakis-era-is-over.html |date=2008-12-06 }}</ref>\n\n====China====\nGiannakis was the head coach of the senior men's [[China men's national basketball team|Chinese national basketball team]], at the [[2013 FIBA Asia Championship]].\n\n===Pro clubs===\nAfter starting work as a [[head coach|head]] [[basketball coach|coach]] with the [[Greek national basketball team]], Giannakis moved to the professional [[sports club|club]] level, and coached [[Panionios B.C.|Panionios]], until 2002, when he was then named the head coach of [[Maroussi B.C.|Maroussi]]. He stayed with Maroussi until 2006, having taken over the team in relative obscurity, and having turned it into the 3rd most prominent team in the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]], along with the help of his star [[point guard]], [[Vassilis Spanoulis]], whose playing style and player attributes were often compared to Giannakis'.\n\nOn the 3rd of February 2008, Giannakis signed on to coach the [[EuroLeague]] power [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], with a 2-and-a-half year contract, at an annual salary of [[euro sign|\u20ac]]1.1 million euros [[net income]]. Giannakis also made an additional annual salary of \u20ac1.2 million euros net income while coaching the [[Greece national basketball team]].\n\nIn June 2010, Olympiacos announced that Giannakis would not coach the team next season. During the two-and-a-half year period that he coached Olympiacos, Giannakis had led the team to the 2010 [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]] title (which was the team's first trophy in eight years), to two consecutive [[EuroLeague Final Four]]s (which included one [[2010 EuroLeague Final Four|EuroLeague Final]], and were the club's first EuroLeague Final Four appearances since [[1999 EuroLeague Final Four|1999]]), and to three consecutive [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] Finals appearances.<ref name=\"Giannakis-Olympiakos\">{{cite web|title= OLYMPIACOS, coach Giannakis part ways.|url=http://www.euroleague.net/euroleaguenews/transactions/2010-11-signings/i/72717/4465/olympiacos-coach-giannakis-part-ways|publisher=euroleague.net|accessdate=18 June 2010|date=2010-06-18}}</ref>\n\nGiannakis was also the head coach of the [[LNB Pro A|French League]] club [[Limoges CSP]], during the 2012\u201313 season. He became the head coach of [[Aris B.C.|Aris]] in 2017.\n\n==Personal life==\nGiannakis is married to Eugenia, and he has two children, Kalliope and Dimitris. In 2010, he lost his brother (all four of his brothers died during a 10-year span) before an [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] [[Derby of the eternal enemies (basketball)|derby]] with [[Panathinaikos

He began watching the games of a local basketball club, and he was later approached by the coach of the youth team of [[Ionikos Nikaias B.C.|Ionikos Nikaias]], who asked him to join their team.\n\n==Club playing career==\n===Ionikos Nikaias===\nGiannakis began his [[sports club|club]] career with the youth teams of [[Ionikos Nikaias B.C.|Ionikos Nikaias]] in 1971. His first coach, [[George Vassilakopoulos]], moved Giannakis up to the [[sports club|club's]] senior men's first team, from the youth squad, in 1972, when he was at the age of just 13. The club was playing in the [[Greek B Basket League|Greek 2nd Division]] at the time. In 1975, the club was [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] up to the top-tier level [[Greek Basket League|Greek First Division]]. Giannakis' exceptional play with Ionikos Nikaias at such a young age, drew the eyes of pro basketball experts on him.\n\nOn January 24, 1981, Ionikos Nikaias, led by a 22-year-old Giannakis, played against [[Aris B.C.|Aris Thessaloniki]], which was led by [[Nikos Galis]]. Aris won in a tight game, by a score of 113\u2013114. The game is memorable in the history of Greek pro club basketball, because in the game, Giannakis scored 73 points, and Galis scored 62 points,<ref>[http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/11052/180/athens-basketball-devotion-through-the-decades Euroleague.net My name is Giannakis. Panayotis Giannakis.]</ref> achieving the 2nd and 4th most points scored in a single game of the Greek League basketball championship.<ref name=\"High Scores\">[[Greek Basket League statistical leaders]]</ref> In 1982, Giannakis was selected by the [[Boston Celtics]], with the 205th pick of the [[1982 NBA draft]].\n\n===Aris Thessaloniki===\nOn August 3, 1984, Giannakis transferred to the Greek club [[Aris B.C.|Aris Thessaloniki]], after the club paid a transfer fee contract buyout to [[Ionikos Nikaias B.C.|Ionikos Nikaias]] for his player rights, in the amount of 42 million [[Greek drachma|Greek Drachmas]],<ref>[http://www.sport24.gr/Basket/ElladaBasket/EthnikiBasket/seismos-sthn-thessalonikh-o-giannakhs-ston-arh.4791726.html \"\u03a3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7, \u03bf \u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0386\u03c1\u03b7\" {{in lang|el}}.]</ref> which was considered a huge amount of money for a transfer buyout at that time. Giannakis also personally received a [[BMW]] car, a [[sporting goods store]], and 8 million drachmas from Aris. With Aris, Giannakis teamed up with [[Nikos Galis]], to form one half of an historic \"tag-team\" that took Greek and European basketball by storm for the years to come.\n\nHis first season with Aris, the 1984\u201385 season, was a great success. He won both the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] championship, and the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]] title.  In the final of the latter, Giannakis made 8 out of 12 3-pointers, leading his team to victory over [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]]. And this was only the beginning, as 6 more consecutive Greek League championships, and 5 more Greek Cup titles with Aris were to follow.\n\nWith [[Aris B.C.|Aris]], Giannakis took part in 3 consecutive [[EuroLeague Final Four]]s: [[1988 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|Ghent 1988]], [[1989 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|Munich 1989]], and [[1990 FIBA European Champions Cup Final Four|Zaragoza 1990]]. Aris joined the elite of European basketball clubs, but a European title did not come for Giannakis until much later, in 1993, when he won the [[FIBA European Cup]] (later renamed Saporta Cup), in [[1992\u201393 FIBA European Cup|the final in Turin]]. By then, [[Nikos Galis]] had left Aris, and joined [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], and Giannakis had become the de facto leader and franchise player of Aris.\n\n===Panionios===\nAfter 9 years with [[Aris B.C.|Aris Thessaloniki]], Giannakis moved to the Greek club [[Panionios B.C.|Panionios]], for the 1993\u201394 season.\n\n===Panathinaikos Athens===\nAfter spending a season with [[Panionios B.C.|Panionios]], Giannakis then moved to the Greek club, [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], where he played from 1994\u201396, and he finished his career as a player there. With Panathinaikos, he finally won the [[EuroLeague]] title, as he won the [[1996 FIBA European League Final Four|Final in 1996, in Paris]]. He also won the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]] title with Panathinaikos that same year, making it the 7th Greek Cup title he won in his playing career, to go along with his 7 [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] championships. He ended his pro club playing career in 1996, having competed in 5 [[EuroLeague Final Four]]s (3 with [[Aris B.C.|Aris]] and 2 with [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]]).\n\n==National team playing career==\nGiannakis led the [[Greece men's national under-16 and under-17 basketball team|Greek junior national team]] to the silver medal at the [[FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship]] of [[1975 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship|1975]]. A year later, he debuted with the senior men's [[Greece national basketball team|Greek national basketball team]], as a 17-year-old, versus the [[Czechoslovakian national basketball team]].\n\nIn 1979, he won the gold medal at the [[Basketball at the 1979 Mediterranean Games|Mediterranean Games]]. He was also the [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the senior men's Greek national team that won the gold medal at the [[EuroBasket 1987]], and the silver medal at the [[EuroBasket 1989]]. During his playing time with the Greek national team, Greece participated in 27 international competitions. He retired from the national team as a player on August 2, 1996, after taking part in the [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996 Summer Olympics]] at Atlanta.\n\n==Career as a head coach==\n===National teams===\n====Greece====\nUnconventionally, the very next year after he retired from playing with the Greek national team, Giannakis started his [[basketball coach|coaching]] career as the [[head coach]] of the [[Greece national basketball team|Greek National Team]] in 1997. He stayed the head coach of the national team for 2 years, leading the team to a 4th-place finish at the [[EuroBasket 1997]], and a 4th-place finish at the [[1998 FIBA World Championship]].\n\nHe returned to coach the national team in 2004, for the [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2004 Summer Olympics]], where he led the Greek team to a 5th-place finish. The next year, under his coaching, Greece won the [[EuroBasket 2005]], marking the second time that Greece had won the [[EuroBasket]]. After 2006, he no longer simultaneously coached on the professional [[sports club|club]] level and [[national team]] level, as he decided to focus his full attention on the Greek national team only. In 2006, he coached the national team of Greece to a second-place finish at the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]]. In the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup|World Championship]]'s semifinal game, held on September 1, 2006, Giannakis' Greek team beat the heavily favored [[United States men's national basketball team|United States national basketball team]] for the first time, by a score of 101\u201395.\n\nIn December 2008, he ended his tenure as the head coach of Greece's national team, and was succeeded by [[Jonas Kazlauskas]].<ref>[http://www.talkbasket.net/news/giannakis-era-is-over.html Giannakis era is over.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206013456/http://www.talkbasket.net/news/giannakis-era-is-over.html |date=2008-12-06 }}</ref>\n\n====China====\nGiannakis was the head coach of the senior men's [[China men's national basketball team|Chinese national basketball team]], at the [[2013 FIBA Asia Championship]].\n\n===Pro clubs===\nAfter starting work as a [[head coach|head]] [[basketball coach|coach]] with the [[Greek national basketball team]], Giannakis moved to the professional [[sports club|club]] level, and coached [[Panionios B.C.|Panionios]], until 2002, when he was then named the head coach of [[Maroussi B.C.|Maroussi]]. He stayed with Maroussi until 2006, having taken over the team in relative obscurity, and having turned it into the 3rd most prominent team in the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]], along with the help of his star [[point guard]], [[Vassilis Spanoulis]], whose playing style and player attributes were often compared to Giannakis'.\n\nOn the 3rd of February 2008, Giannakis signed on to coach the [[EuroLeague]] power [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], with a 2-and-a-half year contract, at an annual salary of [[euro sign|\u20ac]]1.1 million euros [[net income]]. Giannakis also made an additional annual salary of \u20ac1.2 million euros net income while coaching the [[Greece national basketball team]].\n\nIn June 2010, Olympiacos announced that Giannakis would not coach the team next season. During the two-and-a-half year period that he coached Olympiacos, Giannakis had led the team to the 2010 [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]] title (which was the team's first trophy in eight years), to two consecutive [[EuroLeague Final Four]]s (which included one [[2010 EuroLeague Final Four|EuroLeague Final]], and were the club's first EuroLeague Final Four appearances since [[1999 EuroLeague Final Four|1999]]), and to three consecutive [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] Finals appearances.<ref name=\"Giannakis-Olympiakos\">{{cite web|title= OLYMPIACOS, coach Giannakis part ways.|url=http://www.euroleague.net/euroleaguenews/transactions/2010-11-signings/i/72717/4465/olympiacos-coach-giannakis-part-ways|publisher=euroleague.net|accessdate=18 June 2010|date=2010-06-18}}</ref>\n\nGiannakis was also the head coach of the [[LNB Pro A|French League]] club [[Limoges CSP]], during the 2012\u201313 season. He became the head coach of [[Aris B.C.|Aris]] in 2017.\n\n==Personal life==\nGiannakis is married to Eugenia, and he has two children, Kalliope and Dimitris. In 2010, he lost his brother (all four of his brothers died during a 10-year span) before an [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] [[Derby of the eternal enemies (basketball)|derby]] with [[Panathinaikos

English folklore encompasses the traditional [[Robin Hood]] tales, the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]-inspired [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]], and the more contemporary [[urban legend]]s and monsters such as the [[Beast of Bodmin Moor]]. English folklore takes a heavy influence from [[Pagan]] tradition, with a number of figures, legends, and creatures being adapted from the pre-Christian traditions of the region. This Pagan influence means that English folklore generally differs between regions in the country, however some myths pervade most of the country.\n\n==Folklore found throughout much of England==\n* [[Black dog (ghost)|Black dog]] \u2013 Often said to be associated with the Devil, and its appearance was regarded as a portent of death. It is generally supposed to be larger than a normal dog, and often has large, glowing eyes. It is a common feature of British Isles and Northern European folklore.\n* [[Boggart]] \u2013 A boggart is, depending on local or regional tradition, either a household spirit or a malevolent ''[[genius loci]]'' inhabiting fields, marshes or other topographical features. The household boggart causes things to disappear, milk to sour, and dogs to go lame. Always malevolent, the boggart will follow its family wherever they flee. In Northern England, at least, there was the belief that the boggart should never be named, for when the boggart was given a name, it would not be reasoned with nor persuaded, but would become uncontrollable and destructive.\n* [[Brownie (elf)|Brownie]] \u2013 In folklore, a brownie is a type of hob, similar to a hobgoblin. Brownies are said to inhabit houses and aid in tasks around the house. However, they do not like to be seen and will only work at night, traditionally in exchange for small gifts or food. Among food, they especially enjoy porridge and honey. They usually abandon the house if their gifts are called payments, or if the owners of the house misuse them. Brownies make their homes in an unused part of the house.\n* [[Chime hours]] \u2013 According to English folklore, those born at certain hours could see ghosts.\n* [[Countless stones]] \u2013 Associated with megalithic monuments\n* [[Corn dolly]] \u2013 Corn dollies are a form of straw work made as part of harvest customs of Europe before mechanization. Before Christianization, in traditional pagan European culture it was believed that the spirit of the corn lived amongst the crop, and that the harvest made it effectively homeless.\n* [[Crop circles]]\n* [[Cunning folk]] \u2013 The term \"cunning man\" or \"cunning woman\" was most widely used in southern England and the Midlands, as well as in Wales. Such people were also frequently known across England as \"wizards\", \"wise men\".\n* [[Dragons]]- Giant winged reptiles that breathe fire or poison. There are many dragon legends in England. Somerset and the North East being very rich.\n* [[Drake's Drum]] \u2013 Shortly before he died, Drake ordered the drum to be taken to Buckland Abbey, where it still is today, and vowed that if England was ever in danger someone was to beat the drum and he would return to defend the country. According to legend it can be heard to beat at times when England is at war or significant national events take place.\n* [[dwarf (mythology)|Dwarfs]]- a dwarf is a human-shaped entity that dwells in mountains and in the earth, and is variously associated with wisdom, smithing, mining, and crafting.\n* [[Elves]]\n* [[Bogle|Ettin]]\n* [[English Country Dance]] \u2013 English Country Dance is a form of folk dance. It is a social dance form, which has earliest documented instances in the late 16th century.\n* [[Father Time]]\n* [[Flibbertigibbet]]\n* Four Winds \u2013 Shown on old maps they are usually shown as faces blowing out wind from their mouths. There are generally 4 of them (North Wind, South Wind, East Wind and West Wind) although in some cases only 2 are shown and in others the whole outside of the map has been surrounded by smaller heads with 4 larger ones.\n* [[Green Man]] \u2013 A Green Man is a sculpture, drawing, or other representation of a face surrounded by or made from leaves.\n* [[Hag Stone]] Hag Stone is a type of stone, usually glassy, with a naturally occurring hole through it. Such stones have been discovered by archaeologists in both Britain and Egypt.\n* [[Havelok the Dane]]\n*[[King Arthur]] Legendary king of the Britons, the Once and Future King and True Born King of England.\n* [[Legend of the Mistletoe Bough]] \u2013 The Legend of the Mistletoe Bough is a ghost story which has been associated with many mansions and stately homes in England.\n\n:The tale tells how a new bride, playing a game of hide-and-seek during her wedding breakfast, hid in a chest in an attic and was unable to escape. She was not discovered by her family and friends, and suffocated. The body was allegedly found many years later in the locked chest.\n\n* [[Lubber fiend|Lob]] \u2013 The lubber fiend, Lob, lubberkin, lurdane or Lob Lie-By-The-Fire was a legendary creature of English folklore that was similar in attributes to the \"brownie\". He is typically described as a large, hairy man with a tail, who performs housework in exchange for a saucer of milk and a place in front of the fire. One story claims he is the giant son of a witch and the Devil.\n* [[May Queen]]\n* [[Maypole dance]]\n* [[Maypole]]\n* [[Mother Nature]]\n* [[Oak Apple Day]]\n* [[Ogres|Ogres (or Trolls)]]\n* [[Parish Ale]]\n* [[Petrifying well]]\n* [[Rabbit rabbit rabbit]]\n* [[Redcap]] a groups of trolls, gobins, and even ugly elves with red caps.\n* [[Reynardine]]\n* [[Robin Goodfellow]] is a troublesome elf or [[hobgoblin (fairy)|hobgoblin]]\n* [[Robin Hood]] \u2013 a legendary English outlaw and hero who supposedly lived in Sherwood forest along with his merry men. He was known for his skill with the bow and stealing from the rich in order to give back the poor \n* [[Sin-eater]] - a person who would \"eat\" the sins of a recently deceased person and take them upon themselves so that the deceased could go directly to heaven. This custom existed in many parts of England, but particularly in the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]].\n* [[Swithun|Saint Swithun]] \u2013 English [[weather lore]]\n* [[Standing stone]]s and [[hill figure|chalk figures]] are the focus for folktales and beliefs.\n* [[Tom Thumb]]\n* [[Wandering Jew]]\n* [[Well dressing]] \u2013 An ancient practice of decorating wells in the [[Peak District]] and surrounding areas.\n* [[Wild Hunt]]\n* [[Will-o'-the-wisp]] A folk explanation of strange lights seen around marshes and bogs.\n* [[Wyvern]] \u2013 Smaller relatives of dragons with two legs rather than four.\n\n===Folklore of East Anglia===\n<hr />\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n*[[St. Audrey]]\n*[[Babes in the Wood|Babes in the Wood at Wayland Wood]]\n*[[Black Shuck|The Black Shuck]] \u2013 A [[Black dog (ghost)|Black Dog]]\n*[[Borley Rectory]]\n*[[Caxton Gibbet]]\n*[[Edmund the Martyr|St. Edmund of East Anglia]]\n*[[Green children of Woolpit]]\n*[[Guthlac of Crowland|St. Guthlac of Croyland]]\n*[[Hereward the Wake]]\n*Hyter sprites\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Valentine's Day#Folk traditions|Jack Valentine]]\n*The mermaid of [[Upper Sheringham#All Saint's Church|Upper Sheringham]]\n*[[Molly dance]]\n*[[King Cole]] and [[Helena of Constantinople|St. Helena]]\n*[[Pedlar of Swaffham|The Pedlar of Swaffham]]\n*Religious visions at [[Walsingham]]\n*[[Tom Hickathrift]]\n*[[Turpin's Cave]]\n*[[Witch bottle#Witch bottles in England|Witch Bottles]] Bottles filled with nails buried under the hearth to ward off evil spirits.\n*[[Gnome]] A small fat creature depicted with a white beard and moustache.

English folklore encompasses the traditional [[Robin Hood]] tales, the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]]-inspired [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]], and the more contemporary [[urban legend]]s and monsters such as the [[Beast of Bodmin Moor]]. English folklore takes a heavy influence from [[Pagan]] tradition, with a number of figures, ledgends, and creatures being adapted from the pre-Christian traditions of the region. This Pagan influence means that English folklore generally differs between regions in the country, however some myths pervade most of the country.\n\n==Folklore found throughout much of England==\n* [[Black dog (ghost)|Black dog]] \u2013 Often said to be associated with the Devil, and its appearance was regarded as a portent of death. It is generally supposed to be larger than a normal dog, and often has large, glowing eyes. It is a common feature of British Isles and Northern European folklore.\n* [[Boggart]] \u2013 A boggart is, depending on local or regional tradition, either a household spirit or a malevolent ''[[genius loci]]'' inhabiting fields, marshes or other topographical features. The household boggart causes things to disappear, milk to sour, and dogs to go lame. Always malevolent, the boggart will follow its family wherever they flee. In Northern England, at least, there was the belief that the boggart should never be named, for when the boggart was given a name, it would not be reasoned with nor persuaded, but would become uncontrollable and destructive.\n* [[Brownie (elf)|Brownie]] \u2013 In folklore, a brownie is a type of hob, similar to a hobgoblin. Brownies are said to inhabit houses and aid in tasks around the house. However, they do not like to be seen and will only work at night, traditionally in exchange for small gifts or food. Among food, they especially enjoy porridge and honey. They usually abandon the house if their gifts are called payments, or if the owners of the house misuse them. Brownies make their homes in an unused part of the house.\n* [[Chime hours]] \u2013 According to English folklore, those born at certain hours could see ghosts.\n* [[Countless stones]] \u2013 Associated with megalithic monuments\n* [[Corn dolly]] \u2013 Corn dollies are a form of straw work made as part of harvest customs of Europe before mechanization. Before Christianization, in traditional pagan European culture it was believed that the spirit of the corn lived amongst the crop, and that the harvest made it effectively homeless.\n* [[Crop circles]]\n* [[Cunning folk]] \u2013 The term \"cunning man\" or \"cunning woman\" was most widely used in southern England and the Midlands, as well as in Wales. Such people were also frequently known across England as \"wizards\", \"wise men\".\n* [[Dragons]]- Giant winged reptiles that breathe fire or poison. There are many dragon legends in England. Somerset and the North East being very rich.\n* [[Drake's Drum]] \u2013 Shortly before he died, Drake ordered the drum to be taken to Buckland Abbey, where it still is today, and vowed that if England was ever in danger someone was to beat the drum and he would return to defend the country. According to legend it can be heard to beat at times when England is at war or significant national events take place.\n* [[dwarf (mythology)|Dwarfs]]- a dwarf is a human-shaped entity that dwells in mountains and in the earth, and is variously associated with wisdom, smithing, mining, and crafting.\n* [[Elves]]\n* [[Bogle|Ettin]]\n* [[English Country Dance]] \u2013 English Country Dance is a form of folk dance. It is a social dance form, which has earliest documented instances in the late 16th century.\n* [[Father Time]]\n* [[Flibbertigibbet]]\n* Four Winds \u2013 Shown on old maps they are usually shown as faces blowing out wind from their mouths. There are generally 4 of them (North Wind, South Wind, East Wind and West Wind) although in some cases only 2 are shown and in others the whole outside of the map has been surrounded by smaller heads with 4 larger ones.\n* [[Green Man]] \u2013 A Green Man is a sculpture, drawing, or other representation of a face surrounded by or made from leaves.\n* [[Hag Stone]] Hag Stone is a type of stone, usually glassy, with a naturally occurring hole through it. Such stones have been discovered by archaeologists in both Britain and Egypt.\n* [[Havelok the Dane]]\n*[[King Arthur]] Legendary king of the Britons, the Once and Future King and True Born King of England.\n* [[Legend of the Mistletoe Bough]] \u2013 The Legend of the Mistletoe Bough is a ghost story which has been associated with many mansions and stately homes in England.\n\n:The tale tells how a new bride, playing a game of hide-and-seek during her wedding breakfast, hid in a chest in an attic and was unable to escape. She was not discovered by her family and friends, and suffocated. The body was allegedly found many years later in the locked chest.\n\n* [[Lubber fiend|Lob]] \u2013 The lubber fiend, Lob, lubberkin, lurdane or Lob Lie-By-The-Fire was a legendary creature of English folklore that was similar in attributes to the \"brownie\". He is typically described as a large, hairy man with a tail, who performs housework in exchange for a saucer of milk and a place in front of the fire. One story claims he is the giant son of a witch and the Devil.\n* [[May Queen]]\n* [[Maypole dance]]\n* [[Maypole]]\n* [[Mother Nature]]\n* [[Oak Apple Day]]\n* [[Ogres|Ogres (or Trolls)]]\n* [[Parish Ale]]\n* [[Petrifying well]]\n* [[Rabbit rabbit rabbit]]\n* [[Redcap]] a groups of trolls, gobins, and even ugly elves with red caps.\n* [[Reynardine]]\n* [[Robin Goodfellow]] is a troublesome elf or [[hobgoblin (fairy)|hobgoblin]]\n* [[Robin Hood]] \u2013 a legendary English outlaw and hero who supposedly lived in Sherwood forest along with his merry men.
