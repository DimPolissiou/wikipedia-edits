In this new work, he explored a change towards the figure of his mother, taking [[hormones]] and engaging in prostitution. The process continued in the cities of Madrid and Mexico City. Thie performance emerged, as with the rest of his sex-themed works, as an exercise in empathy with his own [[biological mother]]. It was also a social critique, where the artist explored the limits of his body by repeating patterns of sexual abuse, which occurred in his own childhood and in the life of his mother. In 2016, Azcona activated his last piece in this series, ''La Guerra'' (''The War''), which premiered at the ''Intramurs Festival'' in [[Valencia]], Spain, which was again inspired by prostitution, criticism and sexuality.

In this new work, he explored a change towards the figure of his mother, taking [[hormones]] and engaging in prostitution. The process continued in the cities of Madrid and Mexico City. Thie performance emerged, as with the rest of his sex-themed works, as an exercise in empathy with his own [[biological mother]]. It was also a social critique, where the artist explored the limits of his body by repeating patterns of sexual abuse, which occurred in his own childhood and in the life of his mother. In 2016, Azcona activated his last piece in this series, ''La Guerra'' (''The War''), which premiered at the ''Intramurs Festival'' in [[Valencia]], Spain, which was again inspired by prostitution, criticism and sexuality.

On occasion, these malignant cells have the appearance of [[Reed-Sternberg cell]]s. The lesions should show no or very little extension outside of blood vessels.

In the absence of long- or short-term, controlled [[clinical trial]]s on treating this lymphoma, individuals with IVBCL have been treated with the standard regimen used to treat [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]]s viz., the [[CHOP]] chemotherapy regimen which consists of [[cyclophosphamide]], [[hydroxydaunorubicin]] (also termed doxorubicin or adriamycin), [[oncovin]] (also teremed vincristine), and a [[corticosteroid]] (i.e. either [[prednisone]] or [[prednisolone]]) plus the [[monoclonal antibody]] immunotherapy agent, Rituximab.

Microscopic examination of these tissues typically shows medium-sized to large-sized lymphocytes located within small- to medium-sized blood vessels of the skin, lung, and other tissues or the sinusoids of the [[Liver sinusoid|liver]], [[bone marrow#Stroma|bone marrow]],  and [[spleen]]. On occasion, these malignant cells have the appearance of [[Reed-Sternberg cell]]s. The lesions should show no or very little extension outside of blood vessels. As determined by [[immunohistochemistry]] analyses, the intravascular malignant lymphocytes express typical B-cell proteins, particularly [[CD20]], which is found in almost all cases, [[CD79a]] and [[PAX5|Pax5]], which are  found in most cases,<ref name=\"pmid30111607\"/> and [[MUM1]] and [[Bcl-2]], which are found in 95% and 91% of cases, respectively.<ref name=\"pmid27271843\"/> These B-cells are usually (80% of cases) non-germinal center B-cells (see Pathophysiology section) and may express one or more of the gene, chromosome, and gene expression abnormalities described in the above Pathophysiology section. Since the classical variant can present with a wide range of clinical signs, symptoms, and organ involvements, its presence may not be apparent, particularly in cases that do not exhibit clinically apparent skin lesions.

In the absence of long- or short-term, controlled [[clinical trial]]s on treating this lymphoma, individuals with IVBCL have been treated with the standard regimen used to treat [[diffuse large B-cell lymphoma]]s viz., the [[CHOP]] chemotherapy regimen which consists of [[cyclophosphamide]], [[hydroxydaunorubicin]] (also termed doxorubicin or adriamycin), [[oncovin]] (also teremed vincristine), and a [[corticosteroid]] (i.e. either [[prednisone]] or [[prednisolone]]) plus the [[monoclonal antibody]] immunotherapy agent, Rituximab. This immunochemotherapeutic regimen has achieved an [[Survival rate#Overall survival|overall survival rate]] at 3 years of 81%; this overall survival rate using CHOP before Retuximab was added to the regimen was only 33%. However, highly toxic reactions to Rituximab such as pulmonary failure may occur and require delay or interrupting the use of this drug.
