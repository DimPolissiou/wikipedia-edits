The remaining two sons were taken away and for a time detained as hostages for their brothers' 'good behaviour'.\n\nThe successor of Ikram finally confirmed the title of his family to the Jamidari.

There are two schools of thought as to how these should be ordered within each category: [[A & C Black]]'s ''Titles and Forms of Address'' states that \"As a general rule, letters should be shown in the order of the foundation of the societies, etc.\"<ref name=\"Blacks2014\" /> Contrary to this, Debrett's consider that within learned societies: \"There is no recognised order for placing these letters.

With regard to Royal Academicians, Debrett's says: \"Although Royal Academicians come second in this list, it is not suggested that they yield in precedence to fellows of learned societies. In practice the two lists do not coincide.\"<ref name=\"Debrett's Royal Academies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/hierarchies/letters-after-name/royal-academicians-and-associates|title=Royal Academicians and Associates|publisher=Debrett's|accessdate=8 June 2016}}</ref>\nBlack's note that where a professional body or society has multiple grades of membership, only the highest is used except in professional correspondence, and that fellowships \"election to which is a distinction\" (e.g. FRS, FRSA, RA, FBA) should be used on all correspondence.<ref name=Blacks2014/>\n\nIn this table, all societies, institutions, etc. are listed alphabetically by substantive name,<ref group=N>I.e. by what they are a society or institute of or for, e.g. Aeronautical for the Royal Aeronautical Society. Bodies without a substantive name, such as the Royal Society, are listed at the top, ordered by their full names.</ref> rather than attempting to establish an order of precedence.\n\nSome

There are two schools of thought as to how these should be ordered within each category: [[A & C Black]]'s ''Titles and Forms of Address'' states that \"As a general rule, letters should be shown in the order of the foundation of the societies, etc.\"<ref name=\"Blacks2014\" /> Contrary to this, Debrett's consider that within learned societies: \"There is no recognised order for placing these letters.

With regard to Royal Academicians, Debrett's says: \"Although Royal Academicians come second in this list, it is not suggested that they yield in precedence to fellows of learned societies. In practice the two lists do not coincide.\"<ref name=\"Debrett's Royal Academies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/hierarchies/letters-after-name/royal-academicians-and-associates|title=Royal Academicians and Associates|publisher=Debrett's|accessdate=8 June 2016}}</ref>\nBlack's note that where a professional body or society has multiple grades of membership, only the highest is used except in professional correspondence, and that fellowships \"election to which is a distinction\" (e.g. FRS, FRSA, RA, FBA) should be used on all correspondence.<ref name=Blacks2014/>\n\nIn this table, all societies, institutions, etc. are listed alphabetically by substantive name,<ref group=N>I.e. by what they are a society or institute of or for, e.g. Aeronautical for the Royal Aeronautical Society. Bodies without a substantive name, such as the Royal Society, are listed at the top, ordered by their full names.</ref> rather than attempting to establish an order of precedence.\n\nSome
