As part of a partnership between NJPW and the American [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) promotion, the [[ROH World Championship]] was also defended at the event with [[Adam Cole]] defeating [[Kyle O'Reilly]] to become the new champion. All in all, the event featured eleven matches (one on the [[pre-show]]), eight of which were contested for [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championships]], leading to six title changes.\n\nThe main event was widely praised by both journalists and other wrestlers. [[Dave Meltzer]] of the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'', who normally rates matches on a scale of zero to five stars, gave the match a six-star rating, stating that \"Kenny Omega and Kazuchika Okada may have put on the greatest match in pro wrestling history\".

Hingula or Hingulata is the first in list, with the ''anga-pratyanga'' being ''Brahmarandhra'' (a [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] in the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] of the head). The Devi is known by several names such as Kottari, Kottavi, Kottarisha, and the Bhairava is Bhimalochana.{{Sfn| Sircar |1998|p=35}}  In the ''Shivasharitha'', Hingula is again the first in a list of 55 Pithas. ''Brahmarandhra'' is the ''anga-pratyanga'', the goddess is called Kottari and the Bhairava is Bhimalochana (located in [[Koteshwar, Kutch|Koteshwar]]).{{Sfn| Sircar |1998|p=39}}\n\nIn the non-scripture 16th century Bengali work ''[[Chandimangal]]'', Mukundaram lists nine Pithas in the ''Daksha-yajna-bhanga'' section. Hinglaja is the last Pitha described to be the place where Sati's navel fell.{{Sfn| Sircar| 1998|pp=32-3}}\n\nAnother legend is that [[Devi]] killed Hingol as he tormented the people.She followed Hingol to the cave, which is currently the Hinglaj Mata shrine. Before he was killed, Hingol requested the goddess to name the place after him, which she granted.{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}}\n===Belief of Brahmakshatriyas===\n[[File:Hinglaj.jpg|thumb|Picture of Hinglaj Mata protecting Brahmakshatriyas from [[Parashurama]]]]\nThe [[Brahmakshatriya]] venerate Hinglaj Mata as their [[Kuladevata|family deity]].They believe that when the god [[Parashurama]] was persecuting [[kshatriya]]s (the warrior caste), some [[Brahmin]]s (priest caste) provided protection to 12 kshatriyas and disguised them as Brahmins, and they were protected by Hinglaj Mata.Another variation of the tale is that the sage [[Dadhichi]] provided protection to Ratnasena, a king ruling in [[Sind]], in his [[ashram]] (hermitage). However, Parashurama killed him when he ventured out. His sons remained in the ashram. When Parashurama visited the ashram, they were disguised as Brahmins. One of them, Jayasena, returned to Sind to rule the kingdom, armed with a protective [[mantra]] of Hinglaj Mata, given by Dadhici. Hinglaj Mata protected Jayasena and ordered Parshurama to end his killing spree.{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}}\n\n===Belief as Kuldevi===\nAs per the popular folklore of [[Treta Yuga]], a virtuous [[Haihaya]] king of [[Mahishmati]] of [[Malwa]] region, Sahastrabahu Arjuna or Sahastararjun, more widely known as [[Kartavirya Arjuna]] drunk with power and sense of invincibility ends up killing the great [[Brahman]] sage [[Jamadagni]] over a sacred cow [[Kamadhenu]]. Furious at this heinous crime, son of Jamadagni, Lord [[Parashurama]] vows to vanquish the power-drunk [[Kshatriya]] clan from Earth. Wielding his divine AXE, he eliminates Sahastararjun and later on he rages on earth 21 times, each time decimating unvirtuous and unworthy kings wherever he went.\n\nTerrified with the prospect of death at Lord Parashuram, the progeny of Sahastararjun seek [[Janaka]] Maharaj, one of the most learned king of [[Videha]] who advises them to seek Hinglaji Mata's blessing. The clan devotedly pray to Devi at Higloj who is overcome with compassion and assures shelter in her place. Over time, when Lord Parashuram visits this place, he was pleasantly surprised to see Kshatriya clan involved in many Brahminical activities having shed their arms. Hinglaj Mata intervenes on their behalf, and since then the clan disowned arms. Lord Parashuram not only taught them scriptures and Vedas, but also weaving for a living. The clan with a sense of relief then branches out and spread across [[Sindh]], [[Panjab]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], and later on to South India, such as [[Telangana]], [[Andrapradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]. And where ever they went they continued worshiping Hinglaj Devi. [[Bhavsar|Bhavasars]], [[Barot (caste)]], Shimpis and [[Khatri]]s of Somavaunsha Sahasrarjun Kshatriya trace their origin to this clan. Some of those who remained in Sindh province later on converted to Islam. Of note, even to they are one of the oldest non-Brahmin clans who had knowledge of Vedas.

However, traditional travelogues and of \npilgrims coming to the shrine generally demonstrate that the Goddess\u2019s sacred geography more extended than this, the disappearance of the old pilgrimage \npaths led to the elimination of many stops en route.Due to the divinity of the Goddess\u2019s sacred geography commercial activities including shops and teastalls are not allowed to be set up in the valley.<ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref>\n\n==Lord Ram's pilgrimage to Hinglaj==\n[[File:Nanimandir - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Hinglaj Mata Mandir Cave entrance]]\nAfter killing [[Ravana]],\nexile [[Rama]] returns from exile to ascend to the throne of [[Ayodhya]].A sage  Kumbodhar explains that to cleanse himself of this sin, Rama should make a pilgrimage to Hinglaj Mata, the only place that can purify him. Rama follows the advice and immediately leaves with his army for Hinglaj. [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]], and [[Hanuman]] also accompany him. At the mountain pass, the Goddess\u2019s \narmy, which guards the entry to her empire(Sacred Valley of Hinglaj) stopped them and a war broke out between them in which goddess's army defeated Ram's army and told his army must retreat. When Rama sends a mes-\nsenger to the Goddess to inquire why she fought him, she responds that he \nmust return to his first stop, which is now called '''Ram Bagh''', and make the journey again as a \nsimple pilgrim. So Rama leaves his entourage, his army, and vehicles behind \nand sets out to walk to the shrine, accompanied only by his closest friends. \nRama\u2019s men are devastated at not being allowed to accompany their lord to the \nGoddess\u2019s abode. The Devi thus promises them that their descendants will, at \nsome point in time, all come back to do the pilgrimage. For guidance through \nthe harsh desert, Rama calls on the pious Lalu Jasraj, a hermit who resides \nnearby at some hot springs, to be their charidar for the yatra. Only now does the Goddess allow the group to cross the pass.After only a few kilometers, Sita becomes \nthirsty in the burning desert heat and requests that Hanuman and Lakshmana \nbring her water. Hanuman tries to extract water from the soil by stomping his \nfoot violently on the ground, but this produces only a dry riverbed. With the \nsame aim, Lakshmana shoots an arrow into the mountain range but only suc-\nceeds in detaching one of the hills. In agony, Sita places her palm down on the \nsoil and thereby makes five wells appear, from which the group drinks.These five wells are known as '''Seeta Koowas'''. The river followed by a series of five wells reportedly produced either by the power of Sita or by Hinglaj herself.But any of these \nlandmarks are not seen today.After a physically challenging journey, Rama reaches the shrine of the Goddess, and \nthe Devi grants him purification of his sin.

The \ndam would have flooded the accommodation roads to the temple and endangered the locality and its associated festivals.Following protest from the Hindu community the dam proposal was abandoned by the [[Balochistan Assembly]].\n\nSo the Water and Power Development Authority of Pakistan(WAPDS) initially suggested relocating three holy places to a higher elevation and guaranteed the \nconstruction of a new access road.This proposition was rejected by the '''Hinglaj Sheva Mandali(HSM)''', which argued that these sites were not like common temples and could not simply be relocated. In 2008, the lawmakers in the \nBalochistan Assembly reacted to the concerns and protests of the Hindu community and asked the federal government to stop the project. In 2009, \nafter a year of suspension, the WAPDA chose to continue with the controversial [[Hingol Dam]] construction plans but decided to shift the site of the dam a few kilometers north in order to protect the temple. This resolution was in keeping with a consensus between the WAPDA, the Balochistan Assembly, and the Hindu community. <ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref>\n\n==Kuldevi==\nHinglaj Devi worshiped as [[Kuldevi]] of  Bhawsar (Bhavsar), Gosavi, Goswami (Dashnami), Brhamkshatriya samaj (Hindu Khatri), Barot (caste), Bavaliya (mer) (Samaj of Saurastra Gujarat), in south India Especially Banjaras  or Lambadi's Community Worship Hingalaj Devi as one of the Sathi Bhavani.

While Hinglaj is her main temple, temples dedicated to her exist in neighbouring Indian states [[Gujarat]] and [[Rajasthan]].{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}} The shrine is known as Hingula, Hingalaja, Hinglaja, and Hingulata in Hindu scriptures, particularly in Sanskrit.{{Sfn| Sircar| 1998|p=113}} The goddess is known as Hinglaj Mata (the Mother Hinglaj), Hinglaj Devi (the Goddess Hinglaj), Hingula Devi (the red goddess or the Goddess of Hingula){{Sfn| Kapoor|2002|pp=2988-90}} and Kottari or Kotavi.{{Sfn| Sircar| 1998|p=43}}\n\nThe chief legend of Hinglaj Mata relates to the creation of the Shakti Peethas.[[Sati (goddess)|Sati]],daughter of ''[[Prajapati]]'' [[Daksha]],  was married to the god [[Shiva]] against his wishes. Daksha organized a great [[Daksha yajna|yajna]] but did not invite Sati and Shiva. Uninvited, Sati reached the yajna-site, where Daksha ignored Sati and vilified Shiva. Unable to withstand this insult, Sati immolated herself activating her [[Chakras]], (energy generated through her anger).\n\nSati died, but her corpse did not burn. Shiva (as [[Virabhadra]]) slew Daksha for being responsible for Sati's death and forgave him, resurrecting him. The wild, grief-stricken Shiva wandered the universe with Sati's corpse. Finally, the god [[Vishnu]] dismembered the body of Sati into 108 parts, from which 52 fell on earth and others on other planets in the universe which became [[Shakti Peethas]], temple to a form of the Goddess.\n\nShiva is also worshiped at each Shakti Pitha in the form of [[Bhairava]], the male counterpart or guardian of the presiding goddess of the Pitha.<ref name=\"Jones 2007\">{{cite book|last1= Jones |first1= Constance |last2= Ryan|first2= James D.|title= Encyclopedia of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgMmceadQ3gC&pg=PA545|accessdate=14 November 2012|year=2007|publisher= Infobase Publishing |isbn=9780816075645|pages=401\u2013402}}</ref> The head of Sati is believed to have fallen at Hinglaj.<ref name=Park/><ref name=Pilgrim/>{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}}\n===In Other Scriptures===\nThe ''Kularnava Tantra'' mentions 18 Pithas and mentions Hingula as the third one. In the ''Kubjika Tantra'', Hingula is listed among the 42 Shakta or Siddha Pithas in which Hinglaj is at the fifth place.{{Sfn| Sircar |1998|pp=18-19}} The ''Pithanirnaya'' or ''Mahapithanirupana'' section from the ''Tantrachudamani'' originally listed 43 names, but names were added over time making it 51 Pithas. It details the ''Pitha-devata'' or ''Devi'' (name of goddess at the Pitha), the ''Kshastradishas'' (Bhairava) and the ''anga-pratyanga'' (limbs including ornaments of Sati). Hingula or Hingulata is the first in list, with the ''anga-pratyanga'' being ''Brahmarandhra'' (a [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] in the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] of the head). The Devi is known by several names such as Kottari, Kottavi, Kottarisha, and the Bhairava is Bhimalochana.{{Sfn| Sircar |1998|p=35}}  In the ''Shivasharitha'', Hingula is again the first in a list of 55 Pithas. ''Brahmarandhra'' is the ''anga-pratyanga'', the goddess is called Kottari and the Bhairava is Bhimalochana (located in [[Koteshwar, Kutch|Koteshwar]]).{{Sfn| Sircar |1998|p=39}}\n\nIn the non-scripture 16th century Bengali work ''[[Chandimangal]]'', Mukundaram lists nine Pithas in the ''Daksha-yajna-bhanga'' section. Hinglaja is the last Pitha described to be the place where Sati's navel fell.{{Sfn| Sircar| 1998|pp=32-3}}\n\nAnother legend is that [[Devi]] killed Hingol as he tormented the people.She followed Hingol to the cave, which is currently the Hinglaj Mata shrine. Before he was killed, Hingol requested the goddess to name the place after him, which she granted.{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}}\n===Belief of Brahmakshatriyas===\n[[File:Hinglaj.jpg|thumb|Picture of Hinglaj Mata protecting Brahmakshatriyas from [[Parashurama]]]]\nThe [[Brahmakshatriya]] venerate Hinglaj Mata as their [[Kuladevata|family deity]].They believe that when the god [[Parashurama]] was persecuting [[kshatriya]]s (the warrior caste), some [[Brahmin]]s (priest caste) provided protection to 12 kshatriyas and disguised them as Brahmins, and they were protected by Hinglaj Mata.Another variation of the tale is that the sage [[Dadhichi]] provided protection to Ratnasena, a king ruling in [[Sind]], in his [[ashram]] (hermitage). However, Parashurama killed him when he ventured out. His sons remained in the ashram. When Parashurama visited the ashram, they were disguised as Brahmins. One of them, Jayasena, returned to Sind to rule the kingdom, armed with a protective [[mantra]] of Hinglaj Mata, given by Dadhici. Hinglaj Mata protected Jayasena and ordered Parshurama to end his killing spree.{{Sfn| Dalal |2011|pp=158-9}}\n\n===Belief as Kuldevi===\nAs per the popular folklore of [[Treta Yuga]], a virtuous [[Haihaya]] king of [[Mahishmati]] of [[Malwa]] region, Sahastrabahu Arjuna or Sahastararjun, more widely known as [[Kartavirya Arjuna]] drunk with power and sense of invincibility ends up killing the great [[Brahman]] sage [[Jamadagni]] over a sacred cow [[Kamadhenu]]. Furious at this heinous crime, son of Jamadagni, Lord [[Parashurama]] vows to vanquish the power-drunk [[Kshatriya]] clan from Earth. Wielding his divine AXE, he eliminates Sahastararjun and later on he rages on earth 21 times, each time decimating unvirtuous and unworthy kings wherever he went.\n\nTerrified with the prospect of death at Lord Parashuram, the progeny of Sahastararjun seek [[Janaka]] Maharaj, one of the most learned king of [[Videha]] who advises them to seek Hinglaji Mata's blessing. The clan devotedly pray to Devi at Higloj who is overcome with compassion and assures shelter in her place. Over time, when Lord Parashuram visits this place, he was pleasantly surprised to see Kshatriya clan involved in many Brahminical activities having shed their arms. Hinglaj Mata intervenes on their behalf, and since then the clan disowned arms. Lord Parashuram not only taught them scriptures and Vedas, but also weaving for a living. The clan with a sense of relief then branches out and spread across [[Sindh]], [[Panjab]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], and later on to South India, such as [[Telangana]], [[Andrapradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]. And where ever they went they continued worshiping Hinglaj Devi. [[Bhavsar|Bhavasars]], [[Barot (caste)]], Shimpis and [[Khatri]]s of Somavaunsha Sahasrarjun Kshatriya trace their origin to this clan. Some of those who remained in Sindh province later on converted to Islam. Of note, even to they are one of the oldest non-Brahmin clans who had knowledge of Vedas.

Here the concept of svaya\u1e43bh\u016b not only relates \nto the major shrine but also can be linked to whole areas of the Hinglaj Valley, the area surrounding [[Chandragup|Chandragup volcano]], or even the whole \ndesert is considered the home of the Devi.<ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref> \n\nThe  point at which the Hinglaj Valley begins is clearly marked by a \nwall built by the Hinglaj Sheva Mandali(HSM) in 1996. However, traditional travelogues and of \npilgrims coming to the shrine generally demonstrate that the Goddess\u2019s sacred geography more extended than this, the disappearance of the old pilgrimage \npaths led to the elimination of many stops en route.Due to the divinity of the Goddess\u2019s sacred geography commercial activities including shops and teastalls are not allowed to be set up in the valley.<ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref>\n\n==Lord Ram's pilgrimage to Hinglaj==\n[[File:Nanimandir - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Hinglaj Mata Mandir Cave entrance]]\nAfter killing [[Ravana]],\nexile [[Rama]] returns from exile to ascend to the throne of [[Ayodhya]].A sage  Kumbodhar explains that to cleanse himself of this sin, Rama should make a pilgrimage to Hinglaj Mata, the only place that can purify him. Rama follows the advice and immediately leaves with his army for Hinglaj. [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]], and [[Hanuman]] also accompany him. At the mountain pass, the Goddess\u2019s \narmy, which guards the entry to her empire(Sacred Valley of Hinglaj) stopped them and a war broke out between them in which goddess's army defeated Ram's army and told his army must retreat. When Rama sends a mes-\nsenger to the Goddess to inquire why she fought him, she responds that he \nmust return to his first stop, which is now called '''Ram Bagh''', and make the journey again as a \nsimple pilgrim. So Rama leaves his entourage, his army, and vehicles behind \nand sets out to walk to the shrine, accompanied only by his closest friends. \nRama\u2019s men are devastated at not being allowed to accompany their lord to the \nGoddess\u2019s abode. The Devi thus promises them that their descendants will, at \nsome point in time, all come back to do the pilgrimage. For guidance through \nthe harsh desert, Rama calls on the pious Lalu Jasraj, a hermit who resides \nnearby at some hot springs, to be their charidar for the yatra. Only now does the Goddess allow the group to cross the pass.After only a few kilometers, Sita becomes \nthirsty in the burning desert heat and requests that Hanuman and Lakshmana \nbring her water. Hanuman tries to extract water from the soil by stomping his \nfoot violently on the ground, but this produces only a dry riverbed. With the \nsame aim, Lakshmana shoots an arrow into the mountain range but only suc-\nceeds in detaching one of the hills. In agony, Sita places her palm down on the \nsoil and thereby makes five wells appear, from which the group drinks.These five wells are known as '''Seeta Koowas'''. The river followed by a series of five wells reportedly produced either by the power of Sita or by Hinglaj herself.But any of these \nlandmarks are not seen today.After a physically challenging journey, Rama reaches the shrine of the Goddess, and \nthe Devi grants him purification of his sin. To mark his completed y\u0101tr\u0101, he \ncarves '''the symbols of the sun and moon on the mountain opposite the temple''' which can be seen even today.<ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref>\n\nHinglaj pilgrims before going to Hinglaj goes to Khari Nadi, where people take a bath in the ocean and worship\u00a0Rama.<ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref>\n\n==Hinglaj Sheva Mandali==\nThe '''Hinglaj Sheva Mandali (HSM)''' is the temple committee established to promote an annual pilgrimage to the shrine.It was created on January 5, 1986 and continues to be the main organization serving the Hinglaj Mata temple and its pilgrims.<ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref> \n==Controversy==\n===Kidnapping of temple committee chairman===\nThe chairman of the temple committee was kidnapped two days before the annual Hinglaj Yatra in 2012 by suspected Islamists<ref>https://tribune.com.pk/story/361740/conspiracy-theory-maharaj-kidnapped-two-days-before-hinglaj-pilgrimage/?amp=1</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://hinduexistence.org/2012/04/10/hinglaj-shrine-committee-chairman-abducted-in-pakistan-by-suspected-islamists/ |title = Hinglaj Shrine committee chairman abducted in Pakistan by suspected Islamists|date = 2012-04-09}}</ref>He was kept in captivity for 73 days and later released.The [[Pakistan Hindu Council]] strongly criticised that his kidnapping was to warn the Hindus residing in Pakistan.<ref>https://tribune.com.pk/story/396375/hinglaj-mata-chairperson-recovered-after-two-and-a-half-months/?amp=1</ref>\n\n===Dam Construction===\nIn 2008, Water and Power Development Authority of Pakistan (WAPDA)  proposed a plan to build a dam in the Hingol River close to the shrine. The \ndam would have flooded the accommodation roads to the temple and endangered the locality and its associated festivals.Following protest from the Hindu community the dam proposal was abandoned by the [[Balochistan Assembly]].\n\nSo the Water and Power Development Authority of Pakistan(WAPDS) initially suggested relocating three holy places to a higher elevation and guaranteed the \nconstruction of a new access road.This proposition was rejected by the '''Hinglaj Sheva Mandali(HSM)''', which argued that these sites were not like common temples and could not simply be relocated. In 2008, the lawmakers in the \nBalochistan Assembly reacted to the concerns and protests of the Hindu community and asked the federal government to stop the project. In 2009, \nafter a year of suspension, the WAPDA chose to continue with the controversial [[Hingol Dam]] construction plans but decided to shift the site of the dam a few kilometers north in order to protect the temple. This resolution was in keeping with a consensus between the WAPDA, the Balochistan Assembly, and the Hindu community. <ref>http://40.114.28.106/PDF/5322-pdf-VNV/p2/9780190850531.PDF</ref>\n\n==Kuldevi==\nHinglaj Devi worshiped as [[Kuldevi]] of  Bhawsar (Bhavsar), Gosavi, Goswami (Dashnami), Brhamkshatriya samaj (Hindu Khatri), Barot (caste), Bavaliya (mer) (Samaj of Saurastra Gujarat), in south India Especially Banjaras  or Lambadi's Community Worship Hingalaj Devi as one of the Sathi Bhavani.

The town lies in [[Ulster]], in the midlands, near the border with [[County Fermanagh]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. The town is on the main [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3 road]] that links [[Dublin]] (to the south) with [[Enniskillen]], [[Ballyshannon]] and [[Donegal Town]] (to the north).\n\n==History==\n===Gaelic Cavan 1300-1607===\n\n[[File:Cavan Towne Map 1591.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Cavan town from 1591 showing its market square and the O'Reilly castle on Tullymongan Hill]]\nCavan was founded by the clan leader and Lord of [[East Breifne]], Giolla \u00cdosa Ruadh O\u2019Reilly, between 1300 and his death in 1330. During his lordship, a [[Franciscan]] [[Priory|friary]] was established close to the O\u2019Reilly stronghold at Tullymongan and was at the centre of the settlement close to a crossing over the river and to the town\u2019s marketplace. The friary\u2019s location is marked by an eighteenth-century tower in the graveyard at Abbey Street which appears to incorporate remains of the original medieval friary tower. The imprint of the medieval town can be followed in the area of Abbey Street, Bridge Street and Main Street (townlands of Tullymongan Upper and Lower).\n\nThe O'Reillys later built a new castle in the late fourteenth century on Tullymongan Hill, overlooking the town centre. In the 15th century, the local ruler, Bearded Owen O'Reilly, expanded the town marketplace which attracted merchants from [[Dublin]] and [[Drogheda]]. The phrase \"life of Reilly\" is believed to derive from the great wealth and power of the O'Reilly clans, some of which came from their market. They also allowed counterfeit English and Scottish coins to be minted in their territory at this time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Kieran|title=The Ui Raghallaigh Lordship of East Breifne c.1250-.c. 1450|journal=Brefne|year=1992|volume=2|series=8|page=415}}</ref> \n\n===Early Modern History===\n\n[[James I of England|King James I]] granted the town a charter in 1610. This also entitled Cavan town to send two members to the Irish parliament. In February 1690 it was the site of the [[Battle of Cavan]] between [[Glorious Revolution|Williamite and Jacobite troops]], during which much of the town was burned.

This was lined with comfortable town houses, public buildings (such as [[Cavan Courthouse]] which dates from 1824) and churches. From the mid-19th century, Cavan became an important rail junction for the [[Midland Great Western Railway]] (MGWR) and those of the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR). The Town Hall was built in 1908\u20131909.\n===20th Century===\n\nIn 1938, work began on the [[Cavan Cathedral|Cathedral of Saints Patrick and Felim]], the main church of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Diocese of Kilmore (Roman Catholic)|Diocese of Kilmore]]. Five kilometres (3&nbsp;mi) south-west of Cavan Town, on the [[Regional roads in Ireland|R]]198, is the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Kilmore Cathedral]], which contains a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] doorway dating from the 12th century, reputed originally to have come from Trinity Abbey, located a short distance away upon Trinity Island in [[Lough Oughter]]. Most of the [[Neo-gothic architecture|neo-Gothic]] Kilmore Cathedral was built in the late nineteenth century. A short distance from Kilmore Cathedral is the [[See (religion)|See]] House, a late [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style house constructed in the 1830s. This house, designed by [[William Farrell (architect)|William Farrell]], was formerly the official residence (or \"Bishop's Palace\") of the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh|Bishops of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh]].\n\nOn 23 February 1943, a [[Cavan Orphanage Fire|fire at St Joseph's Orphanage]] in the town claimed the lives of 35 children and an elderly woman. A [[public inquiry]] found no culpability on the part of the nuns who ran the orphanage, but the circumstances surrounding the high death toll in the fire remain controversial to this day.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ciaran|title=Cavan's darkest day|newspaper=Cavan Echo|date=23 February 2007}}</ref> The secretary of the Commission of Enquiry, Brian O'Nolan, is better known to posterity as the writer [[Flann O'Brien]]. He certainly felt that the Commission had not found the truth.\n\nThe former Cavan Town [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] Barracks was demolished in 1968. Its successor stood on the corner of Farnham Street (also known as Casement Street, named after [[Sir Roger Casement]]) and Abbey Street. The current [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] Station is further along Farnham Street, just across from the Courthouse.\n\nAdjacent to the Courthouse is the Cavan Central Library building constructed in 2006. The entrance is dominated by an aquarium, with commissioned [[bog-wood|bog oak]] sculptures by local artist Joey Burns that portray Cavan history. An arts feature based on ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' enriches the interior space, and two large paintings by award-winning author PJ Lynch were commissioned by Cavan Library Service, in a lasting tribute to [[Jonathan Swift]] and to Cavan where ''Gulliver's Travels'' was written.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s Cavan town expanded rapidly with extensive urban regeneration and suburban expansion. It is the main economic hub of the north central part of Ireland and has an extensive range of financial services, legal, medical, industrial and retail enterprises. Liberty Insurance Ireland, Obelisk Group and CG Power Systems Ireland are a number of major national and international companies whose head offices are located within the environs of the town.\n\n==Cavan Town Hall==\n[[File:Town Hall, Cavan Town, County Cavan, Ireland - geograph.org.uk - 336451.jpg|thumb|The Town Hall located in Market Street, Cavan]]\nThe [[Town Hall]] was designed by [[William Alphonsus Scott|William A.

Smith, the Chairman of Cavan Urban District Council at that time. The relatively small and unostentatious Town Hall, located on Townhall Street, is built of [[sandstone]] from a quarry at Latt, on the northern edge of Cavan Town, while the original [[slate]]s came from near [[Carrick-on-Suir]] in [[County Tipperary]].<ref name=\"Parker 2012\"/> The building appears to be designed and built in a version of the [[Arts and Crafts architecture|Arts and Crafts]] style of architecture. It underwent significant redecoration and refurbishment in the 1980s, under the direction of Cavan architect Philip Cullivan. Each March, since 1946, the Town Hall has played host to the Cavan International Drama Festival, a competition which has always drawn the finest in amateur drama. After the abolition of Cavan Town Council left the building empty in 2014, the building reopened in 2015 as the local arts centre, under the name 'Townhall Cavan'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.townhallcavan.ie/about/|title=About Us - Townhall Cavan Arts Space|website=www.townhallcavan.ie|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115002856/http://www.townhallcavan.ie/about/|archivedate=15 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Road===\nThe town is located on the junction of two national routes, the [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3]] to [[Dublin]] and [[N55 road|N55]] to [[Athlone]]. The National Development Plan provides for a major upgrading of the route with an M3 motorway from [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] to [[Dublin]] (completed and officially opened on 4 June 2010) and [[2+2 road|type 2 dual carriageway]] from Whitegate on the Meath border to Cavan, which will eventually bypass Virginia too. The N3 and N55 eastern [[bypass route|bypass]] around Cavan town was fully completed in March 2006, eliminating the need for heavy traffic to pass through an already congested town.\n\n===Railway===\n[[File:Cavan churches.jpg|thumb|View of Cavan [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Cathedral (spire on the right) and the [[Church of Ireland]] Parish Church (spire on the left)]]\n[[File:Cavan centre.jpg|thumb|Cavan town centre]]\n[[File:Cavan courthouse.jpg|thumb|[[Cavan Courthouse]]]]\n\nAlthough Cavan has no railway links today, there were once two railway stations on separate lines, linking the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) and [[Midland Great Western Railway]], then an end junction of the Belfast-Cavan route linking [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]] with a branch line to Crossdoney and [[Killeshandra]]. With the Cavan-Dublin route, via Inny Junction, [[Longford]] and [[Mullingar]] on the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line]]. There is an old railway line running through [[Kingscourt]] on the border of County Meath; this line is now overgrown.\n\nA branch of the [[Cavan and Leitrim Railway]] was also indirectly linked to Cavan town via [[Belturbet]] (the C&L terminus) and [[Ballyhaise]] on the GNR line. When the [[Government of Northern Ireland]] closed the section of the Belfast line from [[Portadown]] to [[Glaslough]] in 1957, it was found to be uneconomical to keep running the rump section from Monaghan to Cavan. All these lines (including the Cavan and Leitrim Railway) were closed by 1960. The (GNR) Virginia Road Station, from 1863 to 1958 serviced the Drogheda and Navan extension route to Kells and Oldcastle. Cooperation between the Cavan and Westmeath county councils is striving to integrate this into the national and regional development plan. [[Cavan railway station]] opened on 8 July 1856, closed for passenger services on 14 October 1957, and finally closed altogether on 1 January 1960.<ref>{{cite web | title=Cavan station | work=Railscot \u2013 Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=16 September 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302022802/http://www.railbrit.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | archivedate=2 March 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Bus===\nCavan's bus station is owned and operated by<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buseireann.ie/|title=Bus \u00c9ireann - View Ireland Bus and Coach Timetables & Buy Tickets|website=www.buseireann.ie|access-date=2016-12-01|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130235044/http://www.buseireann.ie/|archivedate=30 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Bus \u00c9ireann]] and is located on [[Baron Farnham|Farnham]] Street.

The town lies in [[Ulster]], near the border with [[County Fermanagh]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. The town is on the main [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3 road]] that links [[Dublin]] (to the south) with [[Enniskillen]], [[Ballyshannon]] and [[Donegal Town]] (to the north).\n\n==History==\n===Gaelic Cavan 1300-1607===\n\n[[File:Cavan Towne Map 1591.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Cavan town from 1591 showing its market square and the O'Reilly castle on Tullymongan Hill]]\nCavan was founded by the clan leader and Lord of [[East Breifne]], Giolla \u00cdosa Ruadh O\u2019Reilly, between 1300 and his death in 1330. During his lordship, a [[Franciscan]] [[Priory|friary]] was established close to the O\u2019Reilly stronghold at Tullymongan and was at the centre of the settlement close to a crossing over the river and to the town\u2019s marketplace. The friary\u2019s location is marked by an eighteenth-century tower in the graveyard at Abbey Street which appears to incorporate remains of the original medieval friary tower. The imprint of the medieval town can be followed in the area of Abbey Street, Bridge Street and Main Street (townlands of Tullymongan Upper and Lower).\n\nThe O'Reillys later built a new castle in the late fourteenth century on Tullymongan Hill, overlooking the town centre. In the 15th century, the local ruler, Bearded Owen O'Reilly, expanded the town marketplace which attracted merchants from [[Dublin]] and [[Drogheda]]. The phrase \"life of Reilly\" is believed to derive from the great wealth and power of the O'Reilly clans, some of which came from their market. They also allowed counterfeit English and Scottish coins to be minted in their territory at this time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Kieran|title=The Ui Raghallaigh Lordship of East Breifne c.1250-.c. 1450|journal=Brefne|year=1992|volume=2|series=8|page=415}}</ref> \n\n===Early Modern History===\n\n[[James I of England|King James I]] granted the town a charter in 1610. This also entitled Cavan town to send two members to the Irish parliament. In February 1690 it was the site of the [[Battle of Cavan]] between [[Glorious Revolution|Williamite and Jacobite troops]], during which much of the town was burned.

This was lined with comfortable town houses, public buildings (such as [[Cavan Courthouse]] which dates from 1824) and churches. From the mid-19th century, Cavan became an important rail junction for the [[Midland Great Western Railway]] (MGWR) and those of the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR). The Town Hall was built in 1908\u20131909.\n===20th Century===\n\nIn 1938, work began on the [[Cavan Cathedral|Cathedral of Saints Patrick and Felim]], the main church of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Diocese of Kilmore (Roman Catholic)|Diocese of Kilmore]]. Five kilometres (3&nbsp;mi) south-west of Cavan Town, on the [[Regional roads in Ireland|R]]198, is the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Kilmore Cathedral]], which contains a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] doorway dating from the 12th century, reputed originally to have come from Trinity Abbey, located a short distance away upon Trinity Island in [[Lough Oughter]]. Most of the [[Neo-gothic architecture|neo-Gothic]] Kilmore Cathedral was built in the late nineteenth century. A short distance from Kilmore Cathedral is the [[See (religion)|See]] House, a late [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style house constructed in the 1830s. This house, designed by [[William Farrell (architect)|William Farrell]], was formerly the official residence (or \"Bishop's Palace\") of the [[Church of Ireland]] [[Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh|Bishops of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh]].\n\nOn 23 February 1943, a [[Cavan Orphanage Fire|fire at St Joseph's Orphanage]] in the town claimed the lives of 35 children and an elderly woman. A [[public inquiry]] found no culpability on the part of the nuns who ran the orphanage, but the circumstances surrounding the high death toll in the fire remain controversial to this day.<ref>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ciaran|title=Cavan's darkest day|newspaper=Cavan Echo|date=23 February 2007}}</ref> The secretary of the Commission of Enquiry, Brian O'Nolan, is better known to posterity as the writer [[Flann O'Brien]]. He certainly felt that the Commission had not found the truth.\n\nThe former Cavan Town [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] Barracks was demolished in 1968. Its successor stood on the corner of Farnham Street (also known as Casement Street, named after [[Sir Roger Casement]]) and Abbey Street. The current [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] Station is further along Farnham Street, just across from the Courthouse.\n\nAdjacent to the Courthouse is the Cavan Central Library building constructed in 2006. The entrance is dominated by an aquarium, with commissioned [[bog-wood|bog oak]] sculptures by local artist Joey Burns that portray Cavan history. An arts feature based on ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' enriches the interior space, and two large paintings by award-winning author PJ Lynch were commissioned by Cavan Library Service, in a lasting tribute to [[Jonathan Swift]] and to Cavan where ''Gulliver's Travels'' was written.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s Cavan town expanded rapidly with extensive urban regeneration and suburban expansion. It is the main economic hub of the north central part of Ireland and has an extensive range of financial services, legal, medical, industrial and retail enterprises. Liberty Insurance Ireland, Obelisk Group and CG Power Systems Ireland are a number of major national and international companies whose head offices are located within the environs of the town.\n\n==Cavan Town Hall==\n[[File:Town Hall, Cavan Town, County Cavan, Ireland - geograph.org.uk - 336451.jpg|thumb|The Town Hall located in Market Street, Cavan]]\nThe [[Town Hall]] was designed by [[William Alphonsus Scott|William A.

Smith, the Chairman of Cavan Urban District Council at that time. The relatively small and unostentatious Town Hall, located on Townhall Street, is built of [[sandstone]] from a quarry at Latt, on the northern edge of Cavan Town, while the original [[slate]]s came from near [[Carrick-on-Suir]] in [[County Tipperary]].<ref name=\"Parker 2012\"/> The building appears to be designed and built in a version of the [[Arts and Crafts architecture|Arts and Crafts]] style of architecture. It underwent significant redecoration and refurbishment in the 1980s, under the direction of Cavan architect Philip Cullivan. Each March, since 1946, the Town Hall has played host to the Cavan International Drama Festival, a competition which has always drawn the finest in amateur drama. After the abolition of Cavan Town Council left the building empty in 2014, the building reopened in 2015 as the local arts centre, under the name 'Townhall Cavan'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.townhallcavan.ie/about/|title=About Us - Townhall Cavan Arts Space|website=www.townhallcavan.ie|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115002856/http://www.townhallcavan.ie/about/|archivedate=15 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Road===\nThe town is located on the junction of two national routes, the [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3]] to [[Dublin]] and [[N55 road|N55]] to [[Athlone]]. The National Development Plan provides for a major upgrading of the route with an M3 motorway from [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] to [[Dublin]] (completed and officially opened on 4 June 2010) and [[2+2 road|type 2 dual carriageway]] from Whitegate on the Meath border to Cavan, which will eventually bypass Virginia too. The N3 and N55 eastern [[bypass route|bypass]] around Cavan town was fully completed in March 2006, eliminating the need for heavy traffic to pass through an already congested town.\n\n===Railway===\n[[File:Cavan churches.jpg|thumb|View of Cavan [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Cathedral (spire on the right) and the [[Church of Ireland]] Parish Church (spire on the left)]]\n[[File:Cavan centre.jpg|thumb|Cavan town centre]]\n[[File:Cavan courthouse.jpg|thumb|[[Cavan Courthouse]]]]\n\nAlthough Cavan has no railway links today, there were once two railway stations on separate lines, linking the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) and [[Midland Great Western Railway]], then an end junction of the Belfast-Cavan route linking [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]] with a branch line to Crossdoney and [[Killeshandra]]. With the Cavan-Dublin route, via Inny Junction, [[Longford]] and [[Mullingar]] on the [[Dublin-Sligo railway line]]. There is an old railway line running through [[Kingscourt]] on the border of County Meath; this line is now overgrown.\n\nA branch of the [[Cavan and Leitrim Railway]] was also indirectly linked to Cavan town via [[Belturbet]] (the C&L terminus) and [[Ballyhaise]] on the GNR line. When the [[Government of Northern Ireland]] closed the section of the Belfast line from [[Portadown]] to [[Glaslough]] in 1957, it was found to be uneconomical to keep running the rump section from Monaghan to Cavan. All these lines (including the Cavan and Leitrim Railway) were closed by 1960. The (GNR) Virginia Road Station, from 1863 to 1958 serviced the Drogheda and Navan extension route to Kells and Oldcastle. Cooperation between the Cavan and Westmeath county councils is striving to integrate this into the national and regional development plan. [[Cavan railway station]] opened on 8 July 1856, closed for passenger services on 14 October 1957, and finally closed altogether on 1 January 1960.<ref>{{cite web | title=Cavan station | work=Railscot \u2013 Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=16 September 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302022802/http://www.railbrit.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | archivedate=2 March 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Bus===\nCavan's bus station is owned and operated by<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buseireann.ie/|title=Bus \u00c9ireann - View Ireland Bus and Coach Timetables & Buy Tickets|website=www.buseireann.ie|access-date=2016-12-01|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130235044/http://www.buseireann.ie/|archivedate=30 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Bus \u00c9ireann]] and is located on [[Baron Farnham|Farnham]] Street.
