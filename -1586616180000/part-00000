{"title_page": "List of The X Factor (American TV series) finalists", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''The X Factor'' (U.S.) finalists}}\n'''''[[The X Factor (U.S. TV series)|The X Factor]]''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American television]] music competition that first aired in 2011. As of December 2013, there have been three completed seasons. The final round of the competition features a number of solo singers or vocal groups: seventeen in season 1 and sixteen for season 2 and 3. A total of 49 acts have reached the finals of their season.\n\nDuring the first season the finalists were split into four groups: \"boys\", \"girls\", \"over 25s\" and \"groups\". Each set of contestants was mentored by one of the show's judges, [[Simon Cowell]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and [[L.A. Reid]]. In season 2, the \"boys\" and \"girls\" categories were scrapped and the \"teens\" and \"young adults\" categories were introduced. And the \"over 25s\" were still the same as season 1. Also in season 2, Abdul and Scherzinger left the show, leaving Cowell and Reid as the only two judges to return from the previous year. Cowell and Reid were joined on the panel by [[Demi Lovato]] and [[Britney Spears]]. In season 3, Reid and Spears left the show, Cowell and Lovato returned as judges from the previous year. [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Paulina Rubio]] joined the panel as replacements of Reid and Spears. The \"boys\" and \"girls\" categories were reintroduced in season 3, replacing the \"teens\" and \"young adults\" categories from the previous year.\n\nAs of season 3, only three categories have won the show on at least one occasion, while two of the show's eight judges have had the winning act in their category at least once, with Cowell winning twice, and Reid winning on one occasion. The judges not to win were Abdul, Lovato, Rowland, Rubio, Scherzinger and Spears, with Abdul's best performance being ninth place in 2011 (her only season), Scherzinger, Spears and Rowland placing second in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively (their only season), Rubio being third place in 2013 (her only season) and Lovato reaching fifth place in 2013 (the second of her two years on the panel).\n\n==Contestants==\n:{{Color box|gold;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; Winner\n:{{Color box|silver;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; Runner-up\n:{{Color box|#CC6633;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; Third place\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The firm is owned by the [[Van Thillo]] family. \n\n== History ==\nIn 1987 the Van Thillo family, already the publishers of magazines ''Joepie'' (1973) and ''Dag Allemaal'' (1984), obtained 66 percent of shares in the [[Flemish]] publishing company Hoste nv, publisher of newspaper ''Het Laatste Nieuws'', magazine ''Blik'' and other publications. In 1990 the rest of the shares were acquired and the company\u2019s name was changed to '''De Persgroep'''. The company had already bought Flemish newspaper publisher De Nieuwe Morgen in 1989, giving it ownership over a second newspaper, ''De Morgen''.\n\nAlso in 1987, De Persgroep was one of nine publishers involved in the foundation of [[VTM (TV channel)|VTM]] or Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij, the first and still main commercial TV broadcaster in Flanders. The channel was launched on 1 February 1989. Each publisher originally owned 11.1% of the new company's shares. Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij launched a second TV channel, first known as Ka2 but now [[Q2 (TV channel)|Q2]], on 30 January 1995 and in the years to come either launched or bought several more, as well as two radio stations and two [[Mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]]s. Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij changed its name twice, first to Vlaamse Media Maatschappij (VMMa) and later to [[Medialaan]]. The ownership structure also changed, with De Persgroep eventually owning half of Vlaame Televisie Maatschappij's shares and [[Roularta]] holding the other half. This situation held until 2018, when De Persgroep bought Roularta's stake.\n\nIn 2002 De Persgroep entered the [[book publishing]] and DVD distribution sectors.<ref name=hild>{{cite journal|author1=Hilde Van den Bulck|author2=Sil Tambuyzer|author3=Stef Ackx|title=Readers' Responses to Product+ Strategies of Print Media Brands: Increasing Readership or Commoditization of Print Media?|journal=International Journal on Media Management|date=2011|volume=13|issue=1|pages=71\u201385|doi=10.1080/14241277.2010.545362}}</ref>\n\nDe Persgroep joined forces with the Walloon media group [[Rossel (company)|Groupe Rossel]] in 2003 to acquire Editco, the publisher of French-language business paper ''[[L'Echo]]'', mainly distributed in [[Brussels]] and [[Wallonia]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dendooven |first1=Pascal |title=ANALYSE.

The firm is owned by the [[Van Thillo]] family. \n\n== History ==\nIn 1987 the Van Thillo family, already the publishers of magazines ''Joepie'' (1973) and ''Dag Allemaal'' (1984), obtained 66 percent of shares in the [[Flemish]] publishing company Hoste nv, publisher of newspaper ''Het Laatste Nieuws'', magazine ''Blik'' and other publications. In 1990 the rest of the shares were acquired and the company\u2019s name was changed to '''De Persgroep'''. The company had already bought Flemish newspaper publisher De Nieuwe Morgen in 1989, giving it ownership over a second newspaper, ''De Morgen''.\n\nAlso in 1987, De Persgroep was one of nine publishers involved in the foundation of [[VTM (TV channel)|VTM]] or Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij, the first and still main commercial TV broadcaster in Flanders. The channel was launched on 1 February 1989. Each publisher originally owned 11.1% of the new company's shares. Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij launched a second TV channel, first known as Ka2 but now [[Q2 (TV channel)|Q2]], on 30 January 1995 and in the years to come either launched or bought several more, as well as two radio stations and two [[Mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]]s. Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij changed its name twice, first to Vlaamse Media Maatschappij (VMMa) and later to [[Medialaan]]. The ownership structure also changed, with De Persgroep eventually owning half of Vlaame Televisie Maatschappij's shares and [[Roularta]] holding the other half. This situation held until 2018, when De Persgroep bought Roularta's stake.\n\nIn 2002 De Persgroep entered the [[book publishing]] and DVD distribution sectors.<ref name=hild>{{cite journal|author1=Hilde Van den Bulck|author2=Sil Tambuyzer|author3=Stef Ackx|title=Readers' Responses to Product+ Strategies of Print Media Brands: Increasing Readership or Commoditization of Print Media?|journal=International Journal on Media Management|date=2011|volume=13|issue=1|pages=71\u201385|doi=10.1080/14241277.2010.545362}}</ref>\n\nDe Persgroep joined forces with the Walloon media group [[Rossel (company)|Groupe Rossel]] in 2003 to acquire Editco, the publisher of French-language business paper ''[[L'Echo]]'', mainly distributed in [[Brussels]] and [[Wallonia]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dendooven |first1=Pascal |title=ANALYSE.
