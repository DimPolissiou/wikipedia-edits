In 1882, [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] had made a \"radical\" move by citing Briquet's estimate of hysteria having a 1:20 ratio of incidence in males compared to females,{{r|micale}}{{rp|183}} and added a section for male sufferers of hysteria to his Paris hospital, the [[Salpetri\u00e8re]].{{r|lerner}}{{rp|25}}\nA subsequent German study came up with a 1:10 ratio, [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette]] then published a 1:2 or 1:3 estimate, and finally Charcot and his student [[Pierre Marie]] did a study of 704 cases of patients displaying symptoms of hysteria, finding that 525 of them were males.{{r|micale}}{{rp|183}} Before long, the French army became interested in the diagnosis and the nervous condition of its soldiers.

Nonne was originally skeptical, but ultimately became a proponent of the male hysteria diagnosis when dealing with the [[neurosis|neurotics]] produced by the [[First World War]]. Oppenheim, on the other hand, was critical of Charcot's theories and sought to distinguish \"traumatic hysteria\" from \"traumatic neurosis\";{{r|lerner}}{{rp|29}} he and his colleague Thomsen found that the symptoms in their cases of railway spine were different enough from what was regarded as the symptoms of hysteria, at least in severity.{{r|ellenberger}}{{rp|438}}\n\nFreud, in 1886, gave a paper about the topic of male hysteria to the [[Imperial Society of Physicians]] in Vienna.{{r|ellenberger}}{{rp|437}} By this point, the incidence of \"classical\" hysteria in males was accepted by Freud's audience, but Charcot's traumatic variant was still controversial and evoked discussion among the present medical doctors.{{r|ellenberger}}{{rp|438\u2013440}} In later works, Freud would reject Charcot's distinction between the two types of hysteria, arguing that trauma is the cause of hysteria in both men and women, though he broadened the definition of trauma to include [[Repressed memory|repressed memories]] of sexual experiences, and believed that recalling traumatic memories could cure hysteria.{{r|showalter}}{{rp|315}} Freud even diagnosed himself and his brother with hysteria, but eventually dropped his own efforts and reverted to a theory of hysteria as a condition of the female body.{{r|eng}}{{rp|173}} His followers similarly would exhibit a gendered view of hysteria, associating it with [[latent homosexuality]] and the [[Oedipus complex]].{{r|showalter}}{{rp|324}}\n\nIn Britain, Charcot's theories took on a different guise when it was suggested that hysteria in men was a disease of the \"Latin races\", to which Anglo-Saxon men were virtually immune. In Germany, too, a majority of the medical profession rejected Charcot's ideas, and medical journals circulated papers that labeled French men as more prone to hysteria than Teutons \u2014 \"which, in the context of the time, meant that they were weaker, less virile, and more susceptible to degeneration\".{{r|micale}}{{rp|201}} An 1889 case study of hysteria in a German soldier gave the French doctors the ammunition they needed for a counterattack.{{r|micale}}{{rp|203}} Aside from French and Germans, [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] inhabitants of various remote regions, colonial populations, Jews and (retroactively) pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Slavery in the United States|American slaves]] were charged with high incidence rates of hysteria by European and white American doctors and [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].{{r|micale}}{{rp|205\u2013207}}\n\n[[File:Shellshock2.jpg|thumb|Ypres, 1917. In the lower left, a shell-shock sufferer.]]\nToward the end of the century, female hysteria became increasingly an anti-[[Women's suffrage|suffragist]] label in the popular press and came under attack from rising [[feminism]], while the wars of the early twentieth century brought new attention to the male variant. The [[Boer War]] and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] produced hysterical symptoms in veterans in large enough numbers that in 1907 the label \"war neurosis\" was introduced to describe their specific condition. For the disorders seen in World War I veterans, additional terms such as [[shell-shock]] (coined by [[Charles Samuel Myers]]), and (in France) ''pthiatiques'' and ''simulateurs'' were invented to prevent labeling soldiers with the \"feminizing\" label of hysteria.{{r|showalter}}{{rp|320\u20132}} Charcot's earlier work, meanwhile, was ignored, and shell-shock sufferers were regarded by their physicians as displaying the symptoms of \"womanish, [[homosexuality as a disease|homosexual]] or childish impulses\".{{r|showalter}}{{rp|324}}\n\n== Shell Shock and War Neurosis ==\n[[Shell shock|Shell Shock]] or war neurosis are forms of hysteria that manifested in soldiers during war time, especially World War I.  Symptoms that were previously considered somatic were reconsidered in a new light; trembling, paralysis, nightmares, mutism and apathy were grouped together in a broad spectrum psychological disorder known as \u201cwar neurosis\u201d.\n\nBy 1916 40% of casualties were in fighting areas were diagnosed with shell shock. As a consequence twenty more military hospitals were established specifically to treat these sufferers. The physical and emotional symptoms of war neurosis varies based on the military rank of the sufferer. However, sexual impotence stemming from a sense of powerlessness was common to all. Some of the physical symptoms displayed by low ranking officers were:\n*paralyses and limps\n*blindness<li>deafness</li><li>mutism (most common)</li><li>limb contractures\n</li><li>vomiting\n</li>\nThe symptoms displaying by ranking officers were more emotional/psychological in comparison to their soldiers:\n* nightmares\n* insomnia\n* fatigue\n* dizziness and disorientation\n* anxiety attacks\n\nWorld War I was the first instance in which a war neurosis and mental trauma was rampant and affected soldiers considerably. This could be attributed to the particular form of fighting \u2013 trench warfare \u2013 which was impersonal and constantly kept the soldier on edge for the next attack. Eric Leed writes that war neurosis was a result of the breakdown of the previously personal relationship of the soldier and his means of fighting. Rivers considered the idea that the traumatized men resorted to neurotic behavior because of a loss of their usual defense mechanism \u2013 physical hand-to-hand combat.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Behind the lines: gender and the two world wars|last=Higonnet|first=Margaret|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=63}}</ref>\n\nIt was especially difficult for officers to maintain British ideals of masculinity. They were expected to be perfectly dressed, always motivated,  and have a hunger for enemy blood, even though they were just as afraid and disillusioned as their soldiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Siegfried Sassoon's Long Journey|last=Fussel|first=Paul|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1983|isbn=|location=New York|pages=30}}</ref> It does not come as surprise that war neurosis occurred four times more in officers than ordinary soldiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The care and treatment of mental diseases and war neuroses: (\"shell shock\") in the British army|last=Salmon|first=Thomas|publisher=War Work Committee of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, Inc.|year=1917|isbn=|location=New York|pages=13, 29}}</ref> Showalter argues that mental breakdowns of soldiers during the war  was a form of protest against pre-conceived notions of Edwardian manliness that demand unifying patriotism and stoic lack of emotion.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Female Malady: women, madness, and English culture, 1830-1980|last=Showalter|first=Elaine|publisher=Penguin|year=1987|isbn=|location=New York|pages=176}}</ref>\n\nTreatment also depended on rank. Soldiers had to undergo disciplinary, quick treatments while officers had the luxury of psychotherapy.\n\n== Important Physicians ==\n\n=== [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] ===\nCharcot was born in 1825 and received his M.D. from University of Paris in 1853. He was appointed as associate professor of medicine in 1860, followed by a position of Head of Hospital Service at Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re in 1862.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hysterical Men|last=Micale|first=Mark|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780674031661|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=117}}</ref>  Charcot published over sixty case reposts of hysteria in boys and young men between 1878 and 1893.  He was dedicated to breaking the stereotype that Hysteria manifested wealth or homosexual men, and insisted that it occurred in manual laborers as well. He was of the belief that the physical signs and symptoms of hysteria were identical in both sexes but claimed that the condition presented itself differently in the minds of men and women. Most noticeable was that he did not attribute sexual factors to the conditions of his male patients. He was thus able to diagnose men with hysteria because he kept away from theoretically controversial issues such as sexuality.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== [[W. H. R. Rivers|W.H.R. Rivers]] ===\nCaptain Rivers was a Royal Army Military Corps physician who was the first Englishman to support Freud's work in psychoanalytic theory, and went on to pioneer the British Psychoanalytic Society after the war. He was a supporter of the \"talking cure\".  Rivers\u2019 treatment drew heavily from Freud's \u2018talking cure\u2019, because he focused primarily on discussing hidden memories of trauma and dissecting war nightmares.  Sassoon records that he would record his dreams to be dissected by Rivers. Both Freud and Rivers were united in their conviction that addressing traumatic memories was the only way to give full recovery.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Harmony of Illusions: Inventing Post-traumatic Stress Disorder|last=Young|first=Allan|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== Relationship with [[Siegfried Sassoon]] ====\nLt. Sassoon was diagnosed with war neurosis by the military review board following a dramatic anti-war declaration in May 1917. He was ordered to receive treatment at Craiglockheart War Hospital headed by Dr. Rivers.<ref name=\":1\" /> It is difficult to tell of Sassoon was truly suffering from war neurosis. Rivers diagnosed him as having a \"strong anti-war complex\", and thus Rivers set about trying to convince Sassoon to rejoin battle by hinting that pacifism was unpatriotic. Sassoon's interactions with Rivers along with his poetry hinted at a possible homoerotic element in the physician-patient relationship.\n\n==== [[Craiglockhart Hydropathic|Craiglockheart War Hospital]]<nowiki/> ====\nCraiglockheart was the birthplace of innovation in psychoanalytic therapy as evidenced by Rivers' work. Unlike other shell shock hospitals of the time, Craiglockheart allowed officers to engage in therapeutic hobbies such as writing, sports and photography. The hospital magazine, Hydra was a wonderful insight into the minds of lower-ranked officers, physicians and nurses alike -\"Within its pages are a series of fascinating and revealing cartoons depicting, among other things, the traumatic nightmares most of those at the hydro suffered, Rivers' mystical reputation, and the often mixed feelings of soldiers on leaving the place\". The most famous anti-war poem, ''Dulce et decorum est'' was written at the hospital in 1917 by a renowned poet and war neurosis sufferer, Wilfed Owen.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Webb|first=Thomas E F|date=2017-03-03|title='Dottyville'\u2014Craiglockhart War Hospital and shell-shock treatment in the First World War|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=99|issue=7|pages=342\u2013346|doi=10.1258/jrsm.99.7.342|issn=0141-0768|pmc=1484566|pmid=16816263}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Lewis Yealland|Dr. Lewis Yealland]] ===\nA Canadian-born medic, Yealland was the most exterminate supporter of disciplinary treatment for war neurosis.

Oppenheim, on the other hand, was critical of Charcot's theories and sought to distinguish \"traumatic hysteria\" from \"traumatic neurosis\";{{r|lerner}}{{rp|29}} he and his colleague Thomsen found that the symptoms in their cases of railway spine were different enough from what was regarded as the symptoms of hysteria, at least in severity.{{r|ellenberger}}{{rp|438}}\n\nFreud, in 1886, gave a paper about the topic of male hysteria to the [[Imperial Society of Physicians]] in Vienna.{{r|ellenberger}}{{rp|437}} By this point, the incidence of \"classical\" hysteria in males was accepted by Freud's audience, but Charcot's traumatic variant was still controversial and evoked discussion among the present medical doctors.{{r|ellenberger}}{{rp|438\u2013440}} In later works, Freud would reject Charcot's distinction between the two types of hysteria, arguing that trauma is the cause of hysteria in both men and women, though he broadened the definition of trauma to include [[Repressed memory|repressed memories]] of sexual experiences, and believed that recalling traumatic memories could cure hysteria.{{r|showalter}}{{rp|315}} Freud even diagnosed himself and his brother with hysteria, but eventually dropped his own efforts and reverted to a theory of hysteria as a condition of the female body.{{r|eng}}{{rp|173}} His followers similarly would exhibit a gendered view of hysteria, associating it with [[latent homosexuality]] and the [[Oedipus complex]].{{r|showalter}}{{rp|324}}\n\nIn Britain, Charcot's theories took on a different guise when it was suggested that hysteria in men was a disease of the \"Latin races\", to which Anglo-Saxon men were virtually immune. In Germany, too, a majority of the medical profession rejected Charcot's ideas, and medical journals circulated papers that labeled French men as more prone to hysteria than Teutons \u2014 \"which, in the context of the time, meant that they were weaker, less virile, and more susceptible to degeneration\".{{r|micale}}{{rp|201}} An 1889 case study of hysteria in a German soldier gave the French doctors the ammunition they needed for a counterattack.{{r|micale}}{{rp|203}} Aside from French and Germans, [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] inhabitants of various remote regions, colonial populations, Jews and (retroactively) pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Slavery in the United States|American slaves]] were charged with high incidence rates of hysteria by European and white American doctors and [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].{{r|micale}}{{rp|205\u2013207}}\n\n[[File:Shellshock2.jpg|thumb|Ypres, 1917. In the lower left, a shell-shock sufferer.]]\nToward the end of the century, female hysteria became increasingly an anti-[[Women's suffrage|suffragist]] label in the popular press and came under attack from rising [[feminism]], while the wars of the early twentieth century brought new attention to the male variant. The [[Boer War]] and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] produced hysterical symptoms in veterans in large enough numbers that in 1907 the label \"war neurosis\" was introduced to describe their specific condition. For the disorders seen in World War I veterans, additional terms such as [[shell-shock]] (coined by [[Charles Samuel Myers]]), and (in France) ''pthiatiques'' and ''simulateurs'' were invented to prevent labeling soldiers with the \"feminizing\" label of hysteria.{{r|showalter}}{{rp|320\u20132}} Charcot's earlier work, meanwhile, was ignored, and shell-shock sufferers were regarded by their physicians as displaying the symptoms of \"womanish, [[homosexuality as a disease|homosexual]] or childish impulses\".{{r|showalter}}{{rp|324}}\n\n== Shell Shock and War Neurosis ==\n[[Shell shock|Shell Shock]] or war neurosis are forms of hysteria that manifested in soldiers during war time, especially World War I.  Symptoms that were previously considered somatic were reconsidered in a new light; trembling, paralysis, nightmares, mutism and apathy were grouped together in a broad spectrum psychological disorder known as \u201cwar neurosis\u201d.\n\nBy 1916 40% of casualties were in fighting areas were diagnosed with shell shock. As a consequence twenty more military hospitals were established specifically to treat these sufferers. The physical and emotional symptoms of war neurosis varies based on the military rank of the sufferer. However, sexual impotence stemming from a sense of powerlessness was common to all. Some of the physical symptoms displayed by low ranking officers were:\n*paralyses and limps\n*blindness<li>deafness</li><li>mutism (most common)</li><li>limb contractures\n</li><li>vomiting\n</li>\nThe symptoms displaying by ranking officers were more emotional/psychological in comparison to their soldiers:\n* nightmares\n* insomnia\n* fatigue\n* dizziness and disorientation\n* anxiety attacks\n\nWorld War I was the first instance in which a war neurosis and mental trauma was rampant and affected soldiers considerably. This could be attributed to the particular form of fighting \u2013 trench warfare \u2013 which was impersonal and constantly kept the soldier on edge for the next attack. Eric Leed writes that war neurosis was a result of the breakdown of the previously personal relationship of the soldier and his means of fighting. Rivers considered the idea that the traumatized men resorted to neurotic behavior because of a loss of their usual defense mechanism \u2013 physical hand-to-hand combat.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Behind the lines: gender and the two world wars|last=Higonnet|first=Margaret|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=63}}</ref>\n\nIt was especially difficult for officers to maintain British ideals of masculinity. They were expected to be perfectly dressed, always motivated,  and have a hunger for enemy blood, even though they were just as afraid and disillusioned as their soldiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Siegfried Sassoon's Long Journey|last=Fussel|first=Paul|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1983|isbn=|location=New York|pages=30}}</ref> It does not come as surprise that war neurosis occurred four times more in officers than ordinary soldiers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The care and treatment of mental diseases and war neuroses: (\"shell shock\") in the British army|last=Salmon|first=Thomas|publisher=War Work Committee of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, Inc.|year=1917|isbn=|location=New York|pages=13, 29}}</ref> Showalter argues that mental breakdowns of soldiers during the war  was a form of protest against pre-conceived notions of Edwardian manliness that demand unifying patriotism and stoic lack of emotion.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Female Malady: women, madness, and English culture, 1830-1980|last=Showalter|first=Elaine|publisher=Penguin|year=1987|isbn=|location=New York|pages=176}}</ref>\n\nTreatment also depended on rank. Soldiers had to undergo disciplinary, quick treatments while officers had the luxury of psychotherapy.\n\n== Important Physicians ==\n\n=== [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] ===\nCharcot was born in 1825 and received his M.D. from University of Paris in 1853. He was appointed as associate professor of medicine in 1860, followed by a position of Head of Hospital Service at Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re in 1862.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hysterical Men|last=Micale|first=Mark|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780674031661|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=117}}</ref>  Charcot published over sixty case reposts of hysteria in boys and young men between 1878 and 1893.  He was dedicated to breaking the stereotype that Hysteria manifested wealth or homosexual men, and insisted that it occurred in manual laborers as well. He was of the belief that the physical signs and symptoms of hysteria were identical in both sexes but claimed that the condition presented itself differently in the minds of men and women. Most noticeable was that he did not attribute sexual factors to the conditions of his male patients. He was thus able to diagnose men with hysteria because he kept away from theoretically controversial issues such as sexuality.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== [[W. H. R. Rivers|W.H.R. Rivers]] ===\nCaptain Rivers was a Royal Army Military Corps physician who was the first Englishman to support Freud's work in psychoanalytic theory, and went on to pioneer the British Psychoanalytic Society after the war. He was a supporter of the \"talking cure\".  Rivers\u2019 treatment drew heavily from Freud's \u2018talking cure\u2019, because he focused primarily on discussing hidden memories of trauma and dissecting war nightmares.  Sassoon records that he would record his dreams to be dissected by Rivers. Both Freud and Rivers were united in their conviction that addressing traumatic memories was the only way to give full recovery.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Harmony of Illusions: Inventing Post-traumatic Stress Disorder|last=Young|first=Allan|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== Relationship with [[Siegfried Sassoon]] ====\nLt. Sassoon was diagnosed with war neurosis by the military review board following a dramatic anti-war declaration in May 1917. He was ordered to receive treatment at Craiglockheart War Hospital headed by Dr. Rivers.<ref name=\":1\" /> It is difficult to tell of Sassoon was truly suffering from war neurosis. Rivers diagnosed him as having a \"strong anti-war complex\", and thus Rivers set about trying to convince Sassoon to rejoin battle by hinting that pacifism was unpatriotic. Sassoon's interactions with Rivers along with his poetry hinted at a possible homoerotic element in the physician-patient relationship.\n\n==== [[Craiglockhart Hydropathic|Craiglockheart War Hospital]]<nowiki/> ====\nCraiglockheart was the birthplace of innovation in psychoanalytic therapy as evidenced by Rivers' work. Unlike other shell shock hospitals of the time, Craiglockheart allowed officers to engage in therapeutic hobbies such as writing, sports and photography. The hospital magazine, Hydra was a wonderful insight into the minds of lower-ranked officers, physicians and nurses alike -\"Within its pages are a series of fascinating and revealing cartoons depicting, among other things, the traumatic nightmares most of those at the hydro suffered, Rivers' mystical reputation, and the often mixed feelings of soldiers on leaving the place\". The most famous anti-war poem, ''Dulce et decorum est'' was written at the hospital in 1917 by a renowned poet and war neurosis sufferer, Wilfed Owen.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Webb|first=Thomas E F|date=2017-03-03|title='Dottyville'\u2014Craiglockhart War Hospital and shell-shock treatment in the First World War|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=99|issue=7|pages=342\u2013346|doi=10.1258/jrsm.99.7.342|issn=0141-0768|pmc=1484566|pmid=16816263}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Lewis Yealland|Dr. Lewis Yealland]] ===\nA Canadian-born medic, Yealland was the most exterminate supporter of disciplinary treatment for war neurosis.

The ammunition is also referred to as '''7.9mm ''Kurz''''' (''{{lang-de|Kurz}}'' meaning \"short\"), '''7.9 ''Kurz''''',  '''7.9mmK''', or '''8\u00d733 Polte'''. It was specifically intended for development of the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] ([[assault rifle]]). The round was developed as a compromise between the longer [[7.92\u00d757mm]] rifle and the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] pistol rounds, and is known as an [[Intermediate cartridges|intermediate cartridge]] ({{lang-de|Mittelpatrone}}).\n\n==Cartridge dimensions==\nThe 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz has a 2.22 ml (34.3 grain H<sub>2</sub>O) cartridge case capacity.\nThe exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in [[assault rifles]] under extreme conditions.\n\n[[File:7.92\u00d733mm Kurz.jpg|400px]]\n\n'''7.92\u00d733mm Kurz maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions'''. All sizes in millimeters (mm).\n\nAmericans define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 \u2248 17.5 degrees.\nThe common [[rifling]] [[twist rate]] for this cartridge is 240&nbsp;mm (1 in 9.45 in), four grooves, \u00d8 lands = {{convert|7.89|mm|in|3}}, \u00d8 grooves = {{convert|8.20|mm|in|3}}, land width = {{convert|4.40|mm|in|3}} and the [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|primer type]] is Berdan or boxer (in large rifle size).\n\nAccording to the official Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes \u00e0 Feu Portatives (C.I.P.)  rulings, the 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz can handle up to {{convert|340.00|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} P<sub>max</sub> piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle-cartridge combination has to be [[Proof (firearms)|proofed]] at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis means that 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz chambered arms in C.I.P. regulated countries were, as of 2014, proof tested at {{convert|425.00|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} PE piezo pressure.\n\n== Military designation ==\nIn German military instructions, the [[caliber]] was often deemed unimportant; the name was emphasized. The 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated294\"/><ref name=\"Kopp\"/> was referred to as the {{lang|de|Pistolenpatrone M43}} (pistol cartridge model 1943) or {{lang|de|Pistolen-Munition M43}} (pistol ammunition model 1943). This was part of the same duplicity under which the StG44 was originally designated as a \"machine pistol\" to disguise the true nature of the weapon from Hitler. After the eventual approval and acceptance of the [[Sturmgewehr 44]], it was redesignated as the \"short cartridge model 1943\" ({{lang-de|Kurzpatrone 43}}).\n\n==Background==\nThe cartridge was the same caliber, and had the same base diameter, as the 7.92\u00d757mm,<ref name=\"MSA20th\"/> which was employed by the standard German Army [[infantry]] rifle, the [[Karabiner 98k]], as well as its [[machine gun]]s. The German armed forces had issued a 7.92\u00d757mm automatic ([[select fire]]) rifle, the [[FG 42]], in limited numbers, but the heavy recoil of the round made it difficult to use effectively in this role.\n\nWhat was needed was a cartridge that could be used in a lighter, more maneuverable rifle to bridge the gap between [[submachine gun]]s and rifles. The standard issue 7.92\u00d757mm cartridge case was shortened by {{convert|24|mm|in}}. With a case length of {{convert|33|mm|in}}, the Kurz round was substantially shorter and delivered less recoil than full-length 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser ammunition, but was still almost as effective when engaging targets at typical combat ranges of {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on|0}}. This meant it could be fired effectively from a weapon that weighed less than a machine gun, yet still had much greater range, velocity, and stopping power than the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum which was standard in German submachine guns. The weight of the 7.92mm Kurz S.m.E. round was {{convert|17.05|g|gr}}, with the bullet taking up {{convert|8.1|g|gr}} and the cartridge and propellant the remaining {{convert|8.95|g|gr}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://home.scarlet.be/p.colmant/polte-k.htg/draw02.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107113420/http://home.scarlet.be/p.colmant/polte-k.htg/draw02.jpg |archive-date=2015-11-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The 34% weight reduction compared to full-length 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser s.S. ball ammunition meant that a soldier could carry more rounds of ammunition, for sustained [[suppressive fire]].\n\nThe shortage of brass in the later stages of World War II led to the use of steel cases for this new cartridge. The Kurz cartridge incorporated more taper than the parent case because steel is less elastic than brass and more difficult to extract (and because the cartridge retained the same base diameter and caliber as the longer, full size round, requiring a more abrupt taper). This led to the distinctive curved [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] for weapons that used this cartridge, which became popularly known as \"banana clips\", due to their curved shape, and which can be seen on other weapons using distinctly tapered cartridges, like the [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] rifles. The steel cases were typically [[lacquer]]-coated to prevent corrosion.\n\n==Firearms==\nPrior to the development of the Kurz round and its associated weapons, two basic small arms existed to equip the regular infantryman, the [[bolt-action rifle]] and the submachine gun. The bolt-action rifle was the standard small arm for most of the world's armies, usually incorporating good accuracy and stopping power, but with a very limited [[rate of fire]]. The submachine gun was a newer piece of equipment, which offered a very high rate of fire, and a compact size, but was of very limited range and stopping power due to the pistol round (usually 9&nbsp;mm) it fired. While the Kurz round did not match the range and accuracy of a full power round fired by a traditional bolt-action rifle, it could still engage individual targets out to {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on|0}}. As an effective, intermediate-sized cartridge, the Kurz round was a key evolution in the development of the assault rifle by providing a combination of controllable automatic fire and acceptable accuracy at ranges most likely to see infantry combat.<ref name=\"janesrecog\">Jane's Guns Recognition Guide, Ian Hogg & Terry Gander, HarperCollins Publisher, 2005, p.287</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt07/stg44-assault-rifle.html |title=Machine Carbine Promoted: MP43 Is Now Assault Rifle StG44, WWII Tactical and Technical Trends, No. 57, April 1945 |publisher=Lone Sentry |date=2007-05-10 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}</ref><ref>Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, 2000 by Ian V.

The first [[FN FAL]] prototype was designed to fire the cartridge when NATO was organized. After the war it was manufactured by [[East Germany]] (the German Democratic Republic), the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], and Egypt.\n\nSpain continued development after the war, creating a few variants of the cartridge, such as tracer rounds, boat-tailed rounds and slightly shorter bullets that have a lead core. These developments were encouraged by Calzada Bayo, a Spanish lieutenant colonel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://claus.espeholt.dk/spa_kurz.html |title=The Spanish kurz |publisher=Claus.espeholt.dk |date=1952-12-18 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref> However, they were cancelled in favour of a more radical cartridge, [[7.92\u00d740mm]] CETME.

It is used in locally made AK-pattern weapons in semi-automatic only (produced or converted in Peshawer, Kohat and Derra Adam Khel, etc.) that chamber this cartridge, since [[7.62\u00d739mm]] is a restricted caliber (known as \"prohibited bore\" or \"PB\" in Pakistan).

All sizes in millimeters (mm).\n\nAmericans define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 \u2248 17.5 degrees.\nThe common [[rifling]] [[twist rate]] for this cartridge is 240&nbsp;mm (1 in 9.45 in), four grooves, \u00d8 lands = {{convert|7.89|mm|in|3}}, \u00d8 grooves = {{convert|8.20|mm|in|3}}, land width = {{convert|4.40|mm|in|3}} and the [[Centerfire ammunition#Centerfire primers|primer type]] is Berdan or boxer (in large rifle size).\n\nAccording to the official Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes \u00e0 Feu Portatives (C.I.P.)  rulings, the 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz can handle up to {{convert|340.00|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} P<sub>max</sub> piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle-cartridge combination has to be [[Proof (firearms)|proofed]] at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis means that 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz chambered arms in C.I.P. regulated countries were, as of 2014, proof tested at {{convert|425.00|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} PE piezo pressure.\n\n== Military designation ==\nIn German military instructions, the [[caliber]] was often deemed unimportant; the name was emphasized. The 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated294\"/><ref name=\"Kopp\"/> was referred to as the {{lang|de|Pistolenpatrone M43}} (pistol cartridge model 1943) or {{lang|de|Pistolen-Munition M43}} (pistol ammunition model 1943). This was part of the same duplicity under which the StG44 was originally designated as a \"machine pistol\" to disguise the true nature of the weapon from Hitler. After the eventual approval and acceptance of the [[Sturmgewehr 44]], it was redesignated as the \"short cartridge model 1943\" ({{lang-de|Kurzpatrone 43}}).\n\n==Background==\nThe cartridge was the same caliber, and had the same base diameter, as the 7.92\u00d757mm,<ref name=\"MSA20th\"/> which was employed by the standard German Army [[infantry]] rifle, the [[Karabiner 98k]], as well as its [[machine gun]]s. The German armed forces had issued a 7.92\u00d757mm automatic ([[select fire]]) rifle, the [[FG 42]], in limited numbers, but the heavy recoil of the round made it difficult to use effectively in this role.\n\nWhat was needed was a cartridge that could be used in a lighter, more maneuverable rifle to bridge the gap between [[submachine gun]]s and rifles. The standard issue 7.92\u00d757mm cartridge case was shortened by {{convert|24|mm|in}}. With a case length of {{convert|33|mm|in}}, the Kurz round was substantially shorter and delivered less recoil than full-length 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser ammunition, but was still almost as effective when engaging targets at typical combat ranges of {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on|0}}. This meant it could be fired effectively from a weapon that weighed less than a machine gun, yet still had much greater range, velocity, and stopping power than the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum which was standard in German submachine guns. The weight of the 7.92mm Kurz S.m.E. round was {{convert|17.05|g|gr}}, with the bullet taking up {{convert|8.1|g|gr}} and the cartridge and propellant the remaining {{convert|8.95|g|gr}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://home.scarlet.be/p.colmant/polte-k.htg/draw02.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107113420/http://home.scarlet.be/p.colmant/polte-k.htg/draw02.jpg |archive-date=2015-11-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The 34% weight reduction compared to full-length 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser s.S. ball ammunition meant that a soldier could carry more rounds of ammunition, for sustained [[suppressive fire]].\n\nThe shortage of brass in the later stages of World War II led to the use of steel cases for this new cartridge. The Kurz cartridge incorporated more taper than the parent case because steel is less elastic than brass and more difficult to extract (and because the cartridge retained the same base diameter and caliber as the longer, full size round, requiring a more abrupt taper). This led to the distinctive curved [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] for weapons that used this cartridge, which became popularly known as \"banana clips\", due to their curved shape, and which can be seen on other weapons using distinctly tapered cartridges, like the [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] rifles. The steel cases were typically [[lacquer]]-coated to prevent corrosion.\n\n==Firearms==\nPrior to the development of the Kurz round and its associated weapons, two basic small arms existed to equip the regular infantryman, the [[bolt-action rifle]] and the submachine gun. The bolt-action rifle was the standard small arm for most of the world's armies, usually incorporating good accuracy and stopping power, but with a very limited [[rate of fire]]. The submachine gun was a newer piece of equipment, which offered a very high rate of fire, and a compact size, but was of very limited range and stopping power due to the pistol round (usually 9&nbsp;mm) it fired. While the Kurz round did not match the range and accuracy of a full power round fired by a traditional bolt-action rifle, it could still engage individual targets out to {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on|0}}. As an effective, intermediate-sized cartridge, the Kurz round was a key evolution in the development of the assault rifle by providing a combination of controllable automatic fire and acceptable accuracy at ranges most likely to see infantry combat.<ref name=\"janesrecog\">Jane's Guns Recognition Guide, Ian Hogg & Terry Gander, HarperCollins Publisher, 2005, p.287</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt07/stg44-assault-rifle.html |title=Machine Carbine Promoted: MP43 Is Now Assault Rifle StG44, WWII Tactical and Technical Trends, No. 57, April 1945 |publisher=Lone Sentry |date=2007-05-10 |accessdate=2012-08-23}}</ref><ref>Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, 2000 by Ian V.

After the war it was manufactured by [[East Germany]] (the German Democratic Republic), the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], and Egypt.\n\nSpain continued development after the war, creating a few variants of the cartridge, such as tracer rounds, boat-tailed rounds and slightly shorter bullets that have a lead core. These developments were encouraged by Calzada Bayo, a Spanish lieutenant colonel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://claus.espeholt.dk/spa_kurz.html |title=The Spanish kurz |publisher=Claus.espeholt.dk |date=1952-12-18 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref> However, they were cancelled in favour of a more radical cartridge, [[7.92x40 CETME]].
