Its decisions are the ultimate application of [[Canadian law]] and binding upon all lower courts of Canada, except to the extent that they are overridden or otherwise made ineffective by federal or provincial legislation. \n\nThe effects of any judicial decision on the [[common law]], on the interpretation of statutes, or on any other application of law, can, in effect, be nullified by legislation, unless the particular decision of the Court in question involves application of the Canadian Constitution, in which case, the decision (in most cases) is completely binding on the legislative branch. This is especially true of decisions which touch upon the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as decisions under the Charter cannot be altered by the legislative branch unless the decision is overridden pursuant to section 33 of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' (the \"[[notwithstanding clause]]\").\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Supreme Court of Canada}}\nThe creation of the Supreme Court of Canada was provided for by the ''[[British North America Act, 1867]]'', renamed in 1982 the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''. The first bills for the creation of a federal supreme court, introduced in the [[Parliament of Canada]] in 1869 and in 1870, were withdrawn. It was not until 8 April 1875 that a bill was finally passed providing for the creation of a Supreme Court of Canada.\n\n[[File:Interior of the old Supreme Court of Canada.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.85|Courtroom in the [[Second Supreme Court of Canada building|Old Supreme Court building]]]]\n[[File:The Nine.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.85|Courtroom in the current Supreme Court building]]\nHowever, prior to 1949, the Supreme Court did not constitute the [[court of last resort]]: litigants could appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London. As well, some cases could bypass the court and go directly to the Judicial Committee from the provincial courts of appeal. The Supreme Court formally became the court of last resort for criminal appeals in 1933 and for all other appeals in 1949. The last decisions of the Judicial Committee on cases from Canada were made in the mid-1950s, as a result of their being heard in a court of first instance prior to 1949.\n\nThe increase in the importance of the Court was mirrored by the numbers of its members. The Court was established first with six judges, and these were augmented by an additional member in 1927. In 1949, the bench reached its current composition of nine justices.\n\nPrior to 1949, most of the appointees to the Court owed their position to political [[patronage]]. Each judge had strong ties to the party in power at the time of their appointment. In 1973, the appointment of a constitutional law professor [[Bora Laskin]] as chief justice represented a major turning point for the Court. Increasingly in this period, appointees either came from academic backgrounds or were well-respected practitioners with several years experience in appellate courts. Laskin's federalist and liberal views were shared by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]], who recommended Laskin's appointment to the Court.\n\nThe ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'', greatly expanded the role of the Court in Canadian society by the addition of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', which greatly broadened the scope of judicial review. The evolution from the Dickson court (1984\u201390) through to the Lamer court (1990\u20132000) witnessed a continuing vigour in the protection of civil liberties. Lamer's criminal law background proved an influence on the number of criminal cases heard by the Court during his time as chief justice. Nonetheless, the Lamer court was more conservative with ''Charter'' rights, with only about a 1% success rate for ''Charter'' claimants.\n\nLamer was succeeded as chief justice by  [[Beverly McLachlin]] in January 2000. She is the first woman to hold that position.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Right Honourable Beverley McLachlin, P.C., C.C.| url=https://www.scc-csc.ca/judges-juges/bio-eng.aspx?id=beverley-mclachlin| publisher=Supreme Court of Canada| location=Ottawa, Ontario| accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref> McLachlin's appointment resulted in a more centrist and unified Court. Dissenting and concurring opinions were fewer than during the Dickson and Lamer Courts. With the 2005 appointments of Justices [[Louise Charron]] and [[Rosalie Abella]], the court became the world's most gender-balanced national high court, four of its nine members being female.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"New judges fill gaps in spectrum\"|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/new-judges-fill-gaps-in-spectrum/article25680054/|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=5 October 2004|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=\"Two women named to Canada's supreme court\"|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2004/10/04/Two-women-named-to-Canadas-supreme-court/30531096911205/\"|work=UPI|date=4 October 2004|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref> Justice [[Marie Deschamps]]' retirement on 7 August 2012 caused the number to fall to three,<ref name=deschamps>{{cite news| title=Supreme Court loses third veteran judge in a year with Justice Marie Deschamps\u2019 departure| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/05/18/supreme_court_loses_third_veteran_judge_in_a_year_with_justice_marie_deschamps_departure.html| work=[[Toronto Star]]| date=18 May 2012| accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref> however the appointment of [[Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9]] on 1 December 2014 restored the number to four.\n\nAfter serving on the Court for {{ayd|1989|3|30|2017|12|14}} ({{ayd|2000|1|7|2017|12|14}} as chief justice), McLachlin retired in December 2017. Her successor as chief justice is [[Richard Wagner (judge)|Richard Wagner]].\n\n==Canadian judiciary==\n{{Politics of Canada}}\nThe structure of the [[Canadian court system]] is pyramidal, a broad base being formed by the various provincial and territorial courts whose judges are appointed by the provincial or territorial governments. At the next level are the provinces' and territories' superior courts, where judges are appointed by the federal government. Judgments from the superior courts may be appealed to a still higher level, the provincial or territorial courts of appeal.\n\nSeveral federal courts also exist: the [[Tax Court of Canada]], the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]], the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]], and the [[Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada]]. Unlike the provincial superior courts, which exercise inherent or general [[jurisdiction]], the jurisdiction of federal courts and provincially appointed provincial courts are limited by statute. In all, there are over 1,000 federally appointed judges at various levels across Canada.\n\n===Appellate process===\nThe Supreme Court of Canada rests at the apex of the judicial pyramid. This institution hears appeals from the provincial courts of last resort, usually the provincial or territorial courts of appeal, and the Federal Court of Appeal, although in some matters appeals come straight from the trial courts, as in the case of [[publication ban]]s and other orders that are otherwise not appealable.\n\nIn most cases, permission to appeal must first be obtained from the court. Motions for [[discretionary review|leave to appeal]] to the Court are generally heard by a panel of three judges of the Court and a simple majority is determinative. By convention, this panel never explains why it grants or refuses leave in any particular case, but the Court typically hears cases of national importance or where the case allows the Court to settle an important issue of law. Leave is rarely granted, meaning that for most litigants, provincial courts of appeal are courts of last resort. But leave to appeal is not required for some cases, primarily criminal cases in which at least one appellate judge (on the relevant provincial court of appeal) dissented on a point of law, and appeals from provincial [[Reference question|references]].\n\nA final source of cases is the referral power of the federal government. In such cases, the Supreme Court is required to give an opinion on questions referred to it by the Governor-in-Council (the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]]). However, in many cases, including the most recent [[Re Same-Sex Marriage|same-sex marriage reference]], the Court has declined to answer a question from the Cabinet. In that case, the Court said it would not decide if [[same-sex marriage]]s were required by the charter of rights, because the government had announced it would change the law regardless of its opinion, and subsequently did.\n\n===Constitutional interpretation===\nThe Supreme Court thus performs a unique function. It can be asked by the Governor-in-Council to hear references considering important questions of law. Such referrals may concern the constitutionality or interpretation of federal or provincial legislation, or the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|division of powers]] between federal and provincial spheres of government. Any point of law may be referred in this manner. However, the Court is not often called upon to hear references. References have been used to re-examine criminal convictions that have concerned the country as in the cases of [[David Milgaard]] and [[Steven Truscott]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has the ultimate power of [[judicial review]] over Canadian federal and provincial laws' constitutional validity. If a federal or provincial law has been held contrary to the division of power provisions of one of the various constitution acts, the legislature or parliament must either live with the result, amend the law so that it complies, or obtain an amendment to the constitution. If a law is declared contrary to certain sections of the ''Charter of Rights and Freedoms'', Parliament or the provincial legislatures may make that particular law temporarily valid again against by using the \"override power\" of the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]. In one case, the [[Quebec National Assembly]] invoked this power to override a Supreme Court decision (''[[Ford v Quebec (AG)]]'') that held that one of Quebec's language laws banning the display of English commercial signs was inconsistent with the ''Charter''. Saskatchewan has also used it to uphold its labour laws. This override power can be exercised for five years, after which time the override must be renewed or the decision comes into force.\n\nIn some cases, the Court may stay the effect of its judgments so that unconstitutional laws continue in force for a period of time. Usually, this is done to give Parliament or the legislature sufficient time to enact a new replacement scheme of legislation. For example, in ''[[Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights]]'', the Court struck down Manitoba's laws because they were not enacted in the French language, as required by the Constitution. However, the Court stayed its judgment for five years to give Manitoba time to re-enact all its legislation in French. It turned out five years was insufficient so the Court was asked, and agreed, to give more time.\n\nConstitutional questions may, of course, also be raised in the normal case of appeals involving individual litigants, governments, government agencies or [[crown corporation]]s. In such cases the federal and provincial governments must be notified of any constitutional questions and may [[intervention (law)|intervene]] to submit a [[brief (law)|brief]] and attend [[oral argument]] at the Court. Usually the other governments are given the right to argue their case in the Court, although on rare occasions this has been curtailed and prevented by order of one of the Court's judges.\n\n==Sessions==\n{{Main|Procedures of the Supreme Court of Canada}}\n[[File:Supreme Court of Canada - 2014 - Night.jpeg|thumb|left|View from the [[Ottawa River]] at night]]\nThe Court sits for 18 weeks of the year beginning the first Monday of October and usually runs until the end of June and sometimes into July. Hearings only take place in [[Ottawa]], although litigants can present oral arguments from remote locations by means of a video-conference system. The Court's hearings are open to the public. Most hearings are taped for delayed telecast in both of Canada's official languages. When in session, the Court sits Monday to Friday, hearing two appeals a day. A quorum consists of five members for appeals, but a panel of nine justices hears most cases.\n\nOn the bench, the [[chief justice of Canada]] or, in his or her absence, the senior [[puisne]] justice, presides from the centre chair with the other justices seated to his or her right and left by order of seniority of appointment. At sittings of the Court, the justices usually appear in black silk robes but they wear their ceremonial robes of bright scarlet trimmed with Canadian white mink in court on special occasions and in the Senate at the opening of each new session of Parliament.\n\nCounsel appearing before the Court may use either English or French. The judges can also use either English or French. There is simultaneous translation available to the judges, counsel and to members of the public who are in the audience.\n\nThe decision of the Court is sometimes \u2013 but rarely \u2013 rendered orally at the conclusion of the hearing. In these cases, the Court may simply refer to the decision of the court below to explain its own reasons. In other cases, the Court may announce its decision at the conclusion of the hearing, with reasons to follow.<ref>[http://scc.lexum.org/en/1988/1988scr2-387/1988scr2-387.html R. v. Beare; R. v.

At one time, judges were addressed as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lady\" during sessions of the Court, but the Court discourages this style of address and has directed lawyers to use the simpler \"Justice\", \u201cMr Justice\u201d or \u201cMadam Justice\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scc-csc.ca/contact/faq/qa-qr-eng.aspx|title=Supreme Court of Canada - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|first=Supreme Court of|last=Canada|date=1 January 2001|website=www.scc-csc.ca}}</ref> The designation \"My Lord/My Lady\" continues in many provincial superior courts and in the Federal Court of Canada and Federal Court of Appeal, where it is optional.\n\nEvery four years, the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]] makes recommendations to the federal government about the salaries for federally appointed judges, including the judges of the Supreme Court. That recommendation is not legally binding on the federal government, but the federal government is generally required to comply with the recommendation unless there is a very good reason to not do so.<ref>[http://scc.lexum.org/en/2005/2005scc44/2005scc44.html Provincial Court Judges\u2019 Assn. of New Brunswick v.

By tradition and convention, only the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], a standing committee in the larger council, advises the governor general and this advice is usually expressed exclusively through a consultation with the prime minister. Thus, the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] and [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] have no formal role in such appointments, sometimes a point of contention.\n\nThe ''[[Supreme Court Act]]'' limits eligibility for appointment to persons who have been judges of a superior court, or members of the [[Bar association|bar]] for ten or more years. Members of the bar or superior judiciary of Quebec, by law, must hold three of the nine positions on the Supreme Court of Canada.<ref>''[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/S-26/ Supreme Court Act]'', s. 6.</ref> This is justified on the basis that Quebec uses [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], rather than [[common law]], as in the rest of the country. As explained in the Court's reasons in ''[[Reference Re Supreme Court Act, ss 5 and 6]]'', sitting judges of the Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal cannot be appointed to any of Quebec's three seats. By convention, the remaining six positions are divided in the following manner: three from Ontario; two from the western provinces, typically one from British Columbia and one from the prairie provinces, which rotate among themselves (although Alberta is known to cause skips in the rotation); and one from the Atlantic provinces, almost always{{clarify|date=January 2019}} from Nova Scotia or New Brunswick{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}.\n\nIn 2006, an interview phase by an ''ad hoc'' committee of members of Parliament was added. Justice [[Marshall Rothstein]] became the first justice to undergo the new process. The prime minister still has the final say on who becomes the candidate that is recommended to the governor general for appointment to the Court. The government proposed an interview phase again in 2008, but a general election and minority parliament intervened with delays such that the Prime Minister recommended [[Thomas Cromwell (Canadian jurist)|Justice Cromwell]] after consulting the Leader of Her Majesty's Official Opposition.\n\nAs of August 2016, Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] opened the process of application to change from the above noted appointment process.

Its decisions are the ultimate application of [[Canadian law]] and binding upon all lower courts of Canada, except to the extent that they are overridden or otherwise made ineffective by federal or provincial legislation. The effects of any judicial decision on the Common Law, on the interpretation of statutes, or on any other application of law, can, in effect, be nullified by legislation, unless the particular decision of the Court in question involved application of the Canadian Constitution, in which case, the decision (in most cases) is completely binding on the legislative branch. This is especially true of decisions which touch upon the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as decisions under the Charter cannot be altered by the legislative branch unless the decision is overridden pursuant to section 33 of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' (the \"[[notwithstanding clause]]\").\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Supreme Court of Canada}}\nThe creation of the Supreme Court of Canada was provided for by the ''[[British North America Act, 1867]]'', renamed in 1982 the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''. The first bills for the creation of a federal supreme court, introduced in the [[Parliament of Canada]] in 1869 and in 1870, were withdrawn. It was not until 8 April 1875 that a bill was finally passed providing for the creation of a Supreme Court of Canada.\n\n[[File:Interior of the old Supreme Court of Canada.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.85|Courtroom in the [[Second Supreme Court of Canada building|Old Supreme Court building]]]]\n[[File:The Nine.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.85|Courtroom in the current Supreme Court building]]\nHowever, prior to 1949, the Supreme Court did not constitute the [[court of last resort]]: litigants could appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in London. As well, some cases could bypass the court and go directly to the Judicial Committee from the provincial courts of appeal. The Supreme Court formally became the court of last resort for criminal appeals in 1933 and for all other appeals in 1949. The last decisions of the Judicial Committee on cases from Canada were made in the mid-1950s, as a result of their being heard in a court of first instance prior to 1949.\n\nThe increase in the importance of the Court was mirrored by the numbers of its members. The Court was established first with six judges, and these were augmented by an additional member in 1927. In 1949, the bench reached its current composition of nine justices.\n\nPrior to 1949, most of the appointees to the Court owed their position to political [[patronage]]. Each judge had strong ties to the party in power at the time of their appointment. In 1973, the appointment of a constitutional law professor [[Bora Laskin]] as chief justice represented a major turning point for the Court. Increasingly in this period, appointees either came from academic backgrounds or were well-respected practitioners with several years experience in appellate courts. Laskin's federalist and liberal views were shared by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]], who recommended Laskin's appointment to the Court.\n\nThe ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'', greatly expanded the role of the Court in Canadian society by the addition of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', which greatly broadened the scope of judicial review. The evolution from the Dickson court (1984\u201390) through to the Lamer court (1990\u20132000) witnessed a continuing vigour in the protection of civil liberties. Lamer's criminal law background proved an influence on the number of criminal cases heard by the Court during his time as chief justice. Nonetheless, the Lamer court was more conservative with ''Charter'' rights, with only about a 1% success rate for ''Charter'' claimants.\n\nLamer was succeeded as chief justice by  [[Beverly McLachlin]] in January 2000.

Her successor as chief justice is [[Richard Wagner (judge)|Richard Wagner]].\n\n==Canadian judiciary==\n{{Politics of Canada}}\nThe structure of the [[Canadian court system]] is pyramidal, a broad base being formed by the various provincial and territorial courts whose judges are appointed by the provincial or territorial governments. At the next level are the provinces' and territories' superior courts, where judges are appointed by the federal government. Judgments from the superior courts may be appealed to a still higher level, the provincial or territorial courts of appeal.\n\nSeveral federal courts also exist: the [[Tax Court of Canada]], the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]], the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]], and the [[Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada]]. Unlike the provincial superior courts, which exercise inherent or general [[jurisdiction]], the jurisdiction of federal courts and provincially appointed provincial courts are limited by statute. In all, there are over 1,000 federally appointed judges at various levels across Canada.\n\n===Appellate process===\nThe Supreme Court of Canada rests at the apex of the judicial pyramid. This institution hears appeals from the provincial courts of last resort, usually the provincial or territorial courts of appeal, and the Federal Court of Appeal, although in some matters appeals come straight from the trial courts, as in the case of [[publication ban]]s and other orders that are otherwise not appealable.\n\nIn most cases, permission to appeal must first be obtained from the court. Motions for [[discretionary review|leave to appeal]] to the Court are generally heard by a panel of three judges of the Court and a simple majority is determinative. By convention, this panel never explains why it grants or refuses leave in any particular case, but the Court typically hears cases of national importance or where the case allows the Court to settle an important issue of law. Leave is rarely granted, meaning that for most litigants, provincial courts of appeal are courts of last resort. But leave to appeal is not required for some cases, primarily criminal cases in which at least one appellate judge (on the relevant provincial court of appeal) dissented on a point of law, and appeals from provincial [[Reference question|references]].\n\nA final source of cases is the referral power of the federal government. In such cases, the Supreme Court is required to give an opinion on questions referred to it by the Governor-in-Council (the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]]). However, in many cases, including the most recent [[Re Same-Sex Marriage|same-sex marriage reference]], the Court has declined to answer a question from the Cabinet. In that case, the Court said it would not decide if [[same-sex marriage]]s were required by the charter of rights, because the government had announced it would change the law regardless of its opinion, and subsequently did.\n\n===Constitutional interpretation===\nThe Supreme Court thus performs a unique function. It can be asked by the Governor-in-Council to hear references considering important questions of law. Such referrals may concern the constitutionality or interpretation of federal or provincial legislation, or the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|division of powers]] between federal and provincial spheres of government. Any point of law may be referred in this manner. However, the Court is not often called upon to hear references. References have been used to re-examine criminal convictions that have concerned the country as in the cases of [[David Milgaard]] and [[Steven Truscott]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has the ultimate power of [[judicial review]] over Canadian federal and provincial laws' constitutional validity. If a federal or provincial law has been held contrary to the division of power provisions of one of the various constitution acts, the legislature or parliament must either live with the result, amend the law so that it complies, or obtain an amendment to the constitution. If a law is declared contrary to certain sections of the ''Charter of Rights and Freedoms'', Parliament or the provincial legislatures may make that particular law temporarily valid again against by using the \"override power\" of the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]. In one case, the [[Quebec National Assembly]] invoked this power to override a Supreme Court decision (''[[Ford v Quebec (AG)]]'') that held that one of Quebec's language laws banning the display of English commercial signs was inconsistent with the ''Charter''. Saskatchewan has also used it to uphold its labour laws. This override power can be exercised for five years, after which time the override must be renewed or the decision comes into force.\n\nIn some cases, the Court may stay the effect of its judgments so that unconstitutional laws continue in force for a period of time. Usually, this is done to give Parliament or the legislature sufficient time to enact a new replacement scheme of legislation. For example, in ''[[Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights]]'', the Court struck down Manitoba's laws because they were not enacted in the French language, as required by the Constitution. However, the Court stayed its judgment for five years to give Manitoba time to re-enact all its legislation in French. It turned out five years was insufficient so the Court was asked, and agreed, to give more time.\n\nConstitutional questions may, of course, also be raised in the normal case of appeals involving individual litigants, governments, government agencies or [[crown corporation]]s. In such cases the federal and provincial governments must be notified of any constitutional questions and may [[intervention (law)|intervene]] to submit a [[brief (law)|brief]] and attend [[oral argument]] at the Court. Usually the other governments are given the right to argue their case in the Court, although on rare occasions this has been curtailed and prevented by order of one of the Court's judges.\n\n==Sessions==\n{{Main|Procedures of the Supreme Court of Canada}}\n[[File:Supreme Court of Canada - 2014 - Night.jpeg|thumb|left|View from the [[Ottawa River]] at night]]\nThe Court sits for 18 weeks of the year beginning the first Monday of October and usually runs until the end of June and sometimes into July. Hearings only take place in [[Ottawa]], although litigants can present oral arguments from remote locations by means of a video-conference system. The Court's hearings are open to the public. Most hearings are taped for delayed telecast in both of Canada's official languages. When in session, the Court sits Monday to Friday, hearing two appeals a day. A quorum consists of five members for appeals, but a panel of nine justices hears most cases.\n\nOn the bench, the [[chief justice of Canada]] or, in his or her absence, the senior [[puisne]] justice, presides from the centre chair with the other justices seated to his or her right and left by order of seniority of appointment. At sittings of the Court, the justices usually appear in black silk robes but they wear their ceremonial robes of bright scarlet trimmed with Canadian white mink in court on special occasions and in the Senate at the opening of each new session of Parliament.\n\nCounsel appearing before the Court may use either English or French. The judges can also use either English or French. There is simultaneous translation available to the judges, counsel and to members of the public who are in the audience.\n\nThe decision of the Court is sometimes \u2013 but rarely \u2013 rendered orally at the conclusion of the hearing. In these cases, the Court may simply refer to the decision of the court below to explain its own reasons. In other cases, the Court may announce its decision at the conclusion of the hearing, with reasons to follow.<ref>[http://scc.lexum.org/en/1988/1988scr2-387/1988scr2-387.html R. v. Beare; R. v.

At one time, judges were addressed as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lady\" during sessions of the Court, but the Court discourages this style of address and has directed lawyers to use the simpler \"Justice\", \u201cMr Justice\u201d or \u201cMadam Justice\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scc-csc.ca/contact/faq/qa-qr-eng.aspx|title=Supreme Court of Canada - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|first=Supreme Court of|last=Canada|date=1 January 2001|website=www.scc-csc.ca}}</ref> The designation \"My Lord/My Lady\" continues in many provincial superior courts and in the Federal Court of Canada and Federal Court of Appeal, where it is optional.\n\nEvery four years, the [[Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission]] makes recommendations to the federal government about the salaries for federally appointed judges, including the judges of the Supreme Court.

By tradition and convention, only the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], a standing committee in the larger council, advises the governor general and this advice is usually expressed exclusively through a consultation with the prime minister. Thus, the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] and [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] have no formal role in such appointments, sometimes a point of contention.\n\nThe ''[[Supreme Court Act]]'' limits eligibility for appointment to persons who have been judges of a superior court, or members of the [[Bar association|bar]] for ten or more years. Members of the bar or superior judiciary of Quebec, by law, must hold three of the nine positions on the Supreme Court of Canada.<ref>''[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/S-26/ Supreme Court Act]'', s. 6.</ref> This is justified on the basis that Quebec uses [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], rather than [[common law]], as in the rest of the country. As explained in the Court's reasons in ''[[Reference Re Supreme Court Act, ss 5 and 6]]'', sitting judges of the Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal cannot be appointed to any of Quebec's three seats. By convention, the remaining six positions are divided in the following manner: three from Ontario; two from the western provinces, typically one from British Columbia and one from the prairie provinces, which rotate among themselves (although Alberta is known to cause skips in the rotation); and one from the Atlantic provinces, almost always{{clarify|date=January 2019}} from Nova Scotia or New Brunswick{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}.\n\nIn 2006, an interview phase by an ''ad hoc'' committee of members of Parliament was added. Justice [[Marshall Rothstein]] became the first justice to undergo the new process. The prime minister still has the final say on who becomes the candidate that is recommended to the governor general for appointment to the Court. The government proposed an interview phase again in 2008, but a general election and minority parliament intervened with delays such that the Prime Minister recommended [[Thomas Cromwell (Canadian jurist)|Justice Cromwell]] after consulting the Leader of Her Majesty's Official Opposition.\n\nAs of August 2016, Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] opened the process of application to change from the above noted appointment process. Under the revised process, \"[A]ny Canadian lawyer or judge who fits a specified criteria can apply for a seat on the Supreme Court, through the Office of the Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-canada-has-a-new-way-to-choose-supreme-court-judges/article31220275/| title=Why Canada has a new way to choose Supreme Court judges| date=2 August 2016| accessdate=24 April 2017| author=[[Justin Trudeau]]| website=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release| url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2016/08/02/new-process-judicial-appointments-supreme-court-canada| title=New process for judicial appointments to the Supreme Court of Canada| date=2 August 2016| publisher=[[Government of Canada]]}}</ref> Functional bilingualism is now a requirement<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2019/05/14/prime-minister-announces-advisory-board-select-next-supreme-court|title=Prime Minister announces advisory board to select the next Supreme Court justice|date=15 May 2019|website=Prime Minister of Canada}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawtimesnews.com/archive/the-hill-the-wrangle-over-bilingualism/262237|title=The Hill: The wrangle over bilingualism|website=www.lawtimesnews.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/news/general/applicants-for-scc-vacancy-must-be-bilingual-westerners-or-northerners/274397|title=Applicants for SCC vacancy must be bilingual Westerners or Northerners|website=www.canadianlawyermag.com}}</ref>.\n\nJustices hold office during good behaviour (which formerly meant [[life tenure]]), but are removable by the Governor General on address of the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] and [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]].

The [[United States Senate|Senate]] passed the bill on August 2, and the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] followed suit on December 17. Two similar House bills, H.R.15138<ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/93rd-congress/house-bill/15138 H.R.15138]</ref> sponsored by [[William J.

Truman Scholarship Foundation]]\nThe Truman Scholarship is administered by the Harry S Truman Scholarship Foundation, an independent federal executive branch agency. It is governed by a 13-member Board of Trustees headed by President [[Madeleine Albright]], who says the foundation \"serves as a gateway for America's public service leaders\" and \"does a remarkable job of identifying future change agents.\" <ref>[http://www.truman.gov/about/about_list.htm?cat_id=467 Truman Scholarship Foundation members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710182014/http://www.truman.gov/about/about_list.htm?cat_id=467 |date=2006-07-10 }}</ref> The Foundation's operations<ref>https://www.truman.gov/officers-board-trustees</ref> are overseen by full-time Executive Secretary [[Terry Babcock-Lumish]].  Its endowment, which takes the form of a federal trust fund held in the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury]], is $55 million. Current Board members include Senator [[Roy Blunt]], Senator [[Brian Schatz]], Secretary of Education [[Betsy DeVos]], Congressman [[Kay Granger]], and Congressman [[Ted Deutch]].\n\n== Qualifications ==\nThe scholarship is awarded to between 50 and 60 U.S. college juniors each year on the basis of four criteria:<ref>[http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=249095 Primary selection criteria for scholarship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924030815/http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=249095 |date=2006-09-24 }}</ref> service on campus and in the community, commitment to a career in public service (government, uniformed services, research, education, or public interest/advocacy organizations), communication ability and aptitude to be a \"change agent,\" and academic talent that would assure acceptance to a first-rate graduate school.

Each undergraduate institution in the United States is allowed to nominate up to four students who have attended since freshman year. After nomination, annually the Foundation receives 900 applications, of whom between 50 and 60 will be selected each year.<ref name=\"truman.gov\" /> Each nominated application is then examined by a regional review panel, which selects finalists to interview. The interviews are conducted by panels of former Truman scholars, trustees of the board, and notable national public servants. These panelists then make final selections of scholarship winners, generally attempting to choose one from each of the 50 states and American territories. No particular career, service interest, or policy field is preferred during the process.  Each year, the Truman Scholarship is awarded to one or two students from institutions that have never had a Truman Scholar.<ref>[http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=249198 There has never been a Truman Scholar from my school.

Truman Presidential Library and Museum|Truman Library]] in [[Independence, Missouri]], during which new scholars collaborate on policy projects. Scholars accept a 10-week Summer Institute internship in [[Washington, D.C.]], which features additional professional development training. Of this group, a small number continue federal agency jobs for a full year as part of the Truman Albright Fellows program.\n\nCertain graduate and professional schools, including the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, give some degree of priority and funding to applicants who are Truman Scholars. Truman Scholars are exempt from taking the written section of the [[United States Foreign Service|U.S. Foreign Service Exam]].

The [[United States Senate|Senate]] passed the bill on August 2, and the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] followed suit on December 17. Two similar House bills, H.R.15138<ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/93rd-congress/house-bill/15138 H.R.15138]</ref> sponsored by [[William J.

Truman Scholarship Foundation]]\nThe Truman Scholarship is administered by the Harry S Truman Scholarship Foundation, an independent federal executive branch agency. It is governed by a 13-member Board of Trustees headed by President [[Madeleine Albright]], who says the foundation \"serves as a gateway for America's public service leaders\" and \"does a remarkable job of identifying future change agents.\" <ref>[http://www.truman.gov/about/about_list.htm?cat_id=467 Truman Scholarship Foundation members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710182014/http://www.truman.gov/about/about_list.htm?cat_id=467 |date=2006-07-10 }}</ref> The Foundation's operations<ref>https://www.truman.gov/officers-board-trustees</ref> are overseen by full-time Executive Secretary [[Terry Babcock-Lumish]].  Its endowment, which takes the form of a federal trust fund held in the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury]], is $55 million. Current Board members include Senator [[Roy Blunt]], Senator [[Brian Schatz]], Secretary of Education [[Betsy DeVos]], Congressman [[Kay Granger]], and Congressman [[Ted Deutch]].\n\n== Qualifications ==\nThe scholarship is awarded to between 50 and 60 U.S. college juniors each year on the basis of four criteria:<ref>[http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=249095 Primary selection criteria for scholarship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924030815/http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=249095 |date=2006-09-24 }}</ref> service on campus and in the community, commitment to a career in public service (government, uniformed services, research, education, or public interest/advocacy organizations), communication ability and aptitude to be a \"change agent,\" and academic talent that would assure acceptance to a first-rate graduate school.

Each undergraduate institution in the United States is allowed to nominate up to four students who have attended since freshman year. After nomination, annually the Foundation receives 900 applications, of whom between 50 and 60 will be selected each year.<ref name=\"truman.gov\" /> Each nominated application is then examined by a regional review panel, which selects finalists to interview. The interviews are conducted by panels of former Truman scholars, trustees of the board, and notable national public servants. These panelists then make final selections of scholarship winners, generally attempting to choose one from each of the 50 states and American territories. No particular career, service interest, or policy field is preferred during the process.  Each year, the Truman Scholarship is awarded to one or two students from institutions that have never had a Truman Scholar.<ref>[http://www.truman.gov/faq/faq_show.htm?doc_id=249198 There has never been a Truman Scholar from my school.

Truman Presidential Library and Museum|Truman Library]] in [[Independence, Missouri]], during which new scholars collaborate on policy projects. Scholars accept a 10-week Summer Institute internship in [[Washington, D.C.]], which features additional professional development training. Of this group, a small number continue federal agency jobs for a full year as part of the Truman Albright Fellows program.\n\nCertain graduate and professional schools, including the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, give some degree of priority and funding to applicants who are Truman Scholars. Truman Scholars are exempt from taking the written section of the [[United States Foreign Service|U.S. Foreign Service Exam]]. Scholars also automatically become part of the [[Truman Scholars Association]], independent  non-profit that works to foster additional opportunities and networking for Scholars.\n\n== Notable Truman Scholars ==\n{{see also|Category:Truman Scholars}}\n\n=== 1970s ===\n* Ernest Calder\u00f3n (1977), Member of the [[Arizona Board of Regents]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www4.nau.edu/insidenau/bumps/4_20_05/calderon.htm|title=Welcome to NAU \u2013 NAU News  : NAU News|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[Janet Napolitano]] (1977), [[Governor of Arizona]], 2003\u20132009, Secretary of [[Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] under President [[Barack Obama]] (2009\u20132013), President of the [[University of California]] (2013\u2013present)\n* Frederick G.

Originally marketed as a [[temperance bar|temperance drink]] and intended as a [[patent medicine]], it was invented in the late 19th century by [[John Stith Pemberton]] and was bought out by businessman [[Asa Griggs Candler]], whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century.<ref name=\"Eschner2017\">{{cite web |last1=Eschner |first1=Kat |title=Coca-Cola's Creator Said the Drink Would Make You Smarter |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/coca-colas-creator-said-drink-would-make-you-smarter-180962665/ |publisher=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |accessdate=October 7, 2019 |language=English |date=March 29, 2017 |quote=So Pemberton concocted a recipe using coca leaves, kola nuts and sugar syrup. \"His new product debuted in 1886: 'Coca-Cola: The temperance drink,'\" writes Hamblin.}}</ref> The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients: [[coca]] leaves, and [[kola nut]]s (a source of [[caffeine]]). The current [[Coca-Cola formula|formula of Coca-Cola]] remains a [[trade secret]], although a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company produces [[concentrate]], which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. A typical {{convert|12|USfloz|adj=on}} can contains {{convert|38|g}} of sugar (usually in the form of [[high fructose corn syrup]]). The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and [[vending machine]]s throughout the world. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for [[soda fountain]]s of major restaurants and [[foodservice]] distributors.\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name.

After the April 14 deal, on April 17, 1888, one-half of the Walker/Dozier interest shares were acquired by Candler for an additional $750.<ref name=ForGodCountryandCocaColapg44-45>{{cite book| last = Pendergrast| first = Mark| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 44\u201345 }}</ref>\n\n===Company===\nIn 1892, Candler set out to incorporate a second company; \"The Coca-Cola Company\" (the current corporation). When Candler had the earliest records of the \"Coca-Cola Company\" destroyed in 1910, the action was claimed to have been made during a move to new corporation offices around this time.<ref>{{cite book| last = Pendergrast| first = Mark| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date =2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 49 }}</ref>\n\nAfter Candler had gained a better foothold on Coca-Cola in April 1888, he nevertheless was forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names \"Yum Yum\" and \"Koke\". This was while Charley Pemberton was selling the elixir, although a cruder mixture, under the name \"Coca-Cola\", all with his father's blessing. After both names failed to catch on for Candler, by the middle of 1888, the Atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to Coca-Cola, and hoped he could force his two competitors, Walker and Dozier, completely out of the business, as well.<ref name=\"ForGodCountryandCocaColapg44-45\" />\n\nJohn Pemberton died suddenly on August 16, 1888. Asa Candler then decided to move swiftly forward to attain full control of the entire Coca-Cola operation.\n\nCharley Pemberton, an alcoholic and opium addict unnerved Asa Candler more than anyone else. Candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name \"Coca-Cola\" from Pemberton's son Charley immediately after he learned of Dr. Pemberton's death. One of several stories states that Candler approached Charley's mother at John Pemberton's funeral and offered her $300 in cash for the title to the name. Charley Pemberton was found on June 23, 1894, unconscious, with a stick of opium by his side. Ten days later, Charley died at Atlanta's Grady Hospital at the age of 40.<ref>{{cite book| last = Pendergrast| first = Mark| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 48\u201349}}</ref>\n\nIn Charles Howard Candler's 1950 book about his father, he stated: \"On August 30 [1888], he [[Asa Candler]] became sole proprietor of Coca-Cola, a fact which was stated on letterheads, invoice blanks and advertising copy.\"<ref>{{cite book | author = Candler, Charles Howard | title = Asa Griggs Candler | year = 1950 | publisher = Emory University | page = 81 | location = Georgia}}</ref>\n\nWith this action on August 30, 1888, Candler's sole control became technically all true. Candler had negotiated with Margaret Dozier and her brother Woolfolk Walker a full payment amounting to $1,000, which all agreed Candler could pay off with a series of notes over a specified time span. By May 1, 1889, Candler was now claiming full ownership of the Coca-Cola beverage, with a total investment outlay by Candler for the drink enterprise over the years amounting to $2,300.<ref>{{cite book| last = Pendergrast| first = Mark| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 46 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1914, Margaret Dozier, as co-owner of the original Coca-Cola Company in 1888, came forward to claim that her signature on the 1888 Coca-Cola Company bill of sale had been forged. Subsequent analysis of other similar transfer documents had also indicated John Pemberton's signature had most likely been forged as well, which some accounts claim was precipitated by his son Charley.<ref name=\"Pendergrast1\" />\n\nOn September 12, 1919, Coca-Cola Co. was purchased by a group of investors for $25 million and reincorporated.

Root, president of [[the Root Glass Company]] of [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff, including company auditor T. Clyde Edwards, plant superintendent Alexander Samuelsson, and [[Earl R. Dean]], bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room. Root and his subordinates decided to base the bottle's design on one of the soda's two ingredients, the [[coca leaf]] or the [[kola nut]], but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like. Dean and Edwards went to the [[Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library]] and were unable to find any information about coca or kola. Instead, Dean was inspired by a picture of the gourd-shaped [[cocoa pod]] in the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]. Dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show Root. He explained to Root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle. Root gave Dean his approval.<ref name=\"vigo.lib.in.us\" />\n\nFaced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the mold-making machinery, over the next 24 hours Dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by Root the next morning.

The prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base, making it unstable on [[conveyor belt]]s. Dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottle's middle diameter. During the 1916 bottler's convention, Dean's contour bottle was chosen over other entries and was on the market the same year. By 1920, the contour bottle became the standard for The Coca-Cola Company. A revised version was also patented in 1923. Because the Patent Office releases the ''Patent Gazette'' on Tuesday, the bottle was patented on December 25, 1923, and was nicknamed the \"Christmas bottle.\" Today, the contour Coca-Cola bottle is one of the most recognized packages on the planet...\"even in the dark!\".<ref name=\"history-of-bottling\" />\n\nAs a reward for his efforts, Dean was offered a choice between a $500 bonus or a lifetime job at [[the Root Glass Company]].

Many of these early television commercials for Coca-Cola featured movie stars, sports heroes, and popular singers.\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[Pepsi-Cola]] ran a series of television advertisements showing people participating in taste tests demonstrating that, according to the commercials, \"fifty percent of the participants who said they preferred Coke ''actually'' chose the Pepsi.\" Statisticians pointed out the problematic nature of a 50/50 result: most likely, the taste tests showed that in blind tests, most people cannot tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke. Coca-Cola ran ads to combat Pepsi's ads in an incident sometimes referred to as the ''[[cola wars]]''; one of Coke's ads compared the so-called [[Pepsi challenge]] to two [[common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]] deciding which [[tennis ball]] was furrier.

This allowed fans to place one vote per day for their favorite club, with one entry being chosen at random earning \u00a3250,000 for the club; this was repeated in 2006. The \"Win A Player\" competition was very controversial, as at the end of the 2 competitions, [[Leeds United A.F.C.]] had the most votes by more than double, yet they did not win any money to spend on a new player for the club. In 2007, the competition changed to \"Buy a Player\". This competition allowed fans to buy a bottle of Coca-Cola or Coca-Cola Zero and submit the code on the wrapper on the Coca-Cola website. This code could then earn anything from 50p to \u00a3100,000 for a club of their choice. This competition was favored over the old \"Win a Player\" competition, as it allowed all clubs to win some money. Between 1992 and 1998, Coca-Cola was the title sponsor of the [[Football League Cup]] (Coca-Cola Cup), the secondary cup tournament of England.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1997, Coca-Cola was also the title sponsor of the [[Scottish League Cup]], renaming it the Coca-Cola Cup like its English counterpart.

This was while Charley Pemberton was selling the elixir, although a cruder mixture, under the name \"Coca-Cola\", all with his father's blessing.

Asa Candler then decided to move swiftly forward to attain full control of the entire Coca-Cola operation.\n\nCharley Pemberton, an alcoholic and opium addict unnerved Asa Candler more than anyone else. Candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name \"Coca-Cola\" from Pemberton's son Charley immediately after he learned of Dr. Pemberton's death. One of several stories states that Candler approached Charley's mother at John Pemberton's funeral and offered her $300 in cash for the title to the name. Charley Pemberton was found on June 23, 1894, unconscious, with a stick of opium by his side. Ten days later, Charley died at Atlanta's Grady Hospital at the age of 40.<ref>{{cite book| last = Pendergrast| first = Mark| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 48\u201349}}</ref>\n\nIn Charles Howard Candler's 1950 book about his father, he stated: \"On August 30 [1888], he [[Asa Candler]] became sole proprietor of Coca-Cola, a fact which was stated on letterheads, invoice blanks and advertising copy.\"<ref>{{cite book | author = Candler, Charles Howard | title = Asa Griggs Candler | year = 1950 | publisher = Emory University | page = 81 | location = Georgia}}</ref>\n\nWith this action on August 30, 1888, Candler's sole control became technically all true. Candler had negotiated with Margaret Dozier and her brother Woolfolk Walker a full payment amounting to $1,000, which all agreed Candler could pay off with a series of notes over a specified time span. By May 1, 1889, Candler was now claiming full ownership of the Coca-Cola beverage, with a total investment outlay by Candler for the drink enterprise over the years amounting to $2,300.<ref>{{cite book| last = Pendergrast| first = Mark| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 46 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1914, Margaret Dozier, as co-owner of the original Coca-Cola Company in 1888, came forward to claim that her signature on the 1888 Coca-Cola Company bill of sale had been forged.

Root, president of [[the Root Glass Company]] of [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff, including company auditor T. Clyde Edwards, plant superintendent Alexander Samuelsson, and [[Earl R. Dean]], bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room. Root and his subordinates decided to base the bottle's design on one of the soda's two ingredients, the [[coca leaf]] or the [[kola nut]], but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like. Dean and Edwards went to the [[Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library]] and were unable to find any information about coca or kola. Instead, Dean was inspired by a picture of the gourd-shaped [[cocoa pod]] in the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]. Dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show Root. He explained to Root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle. Root gave Dean his approval.<ref name=\"vigo.lib.in.us\" />\n\nFaced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the mold-making machinery, over the next 24 hours Dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by Root the next morning. Dean then proceeded to create a bottle mold and produced a small number of bottles before the glass-molding machinery was turned off.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Bottle |journal=American Heritage |last=Lundy |first=Betty |year=1986 |publisher=American Heritage Inc. |issn=0002-8738 |pages=98\u2013101 |url=http://contourbottle.angelfire.com/The_Bottle.pdf }}</ref>\n\nChapman Root approved the prototype bottle and a [[design patent]] was issued on the bottle in November 1915. The prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base, making it unstable on [[conveyor belt]]s. Dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottle's middle diameter. During the 1916 bottler's convention, Dean's contour bottle was chosen over other entries and was on the market the same year. By 1920, the contour bottle became the standard for The Coca-Cola Company. A revised version was also patented in 1923. Because the Patent Office releases the ''Patent Gazette'' on Tuesday, the bottle was patented on December 25, 1923, and was nicknamed the \"Christmas bottle.\" Today, the contour Coca-Cola bottle is one of the most recognized packages on the planet...\"even in the dark!\".<ref name=\"history-of-bottling\" />\n\nAs a reward for his efforts, Dean was offered a choice between a $500 bonus or a lifetime job at [[the Root Glass Company]].

Coca-Cola has had a longtime relationship with the NFL's [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], due in part to the now-famous [[Hey Kid, Catch!|1979 television commercial]] featuring [[Joe Greene (American football)|\"Mean Joe\" Greene]], leading to the two opening the Coca-Cola Great Hall at [[Heinz Field]] in 2001 and a more recent [[Coca-Cola Zero]] commercial featuring [[Troy Polamalu]].\n\nCoca-Cola is the official soft drink of many [[College football|collegiate football]] teams throughout the nation, partly due to Coca-Cola providing those schools with upgraded athletic facilities in exchange for Coca-Cola's sponsorship. This is especially prevalent at the high school level, which is more dependent on such contracts due to tighter budgets.\n\nCoca-Cola was one of the official sponsors of the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] held on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Coca-Cola is also one of the associate sponsors of [[Delhi Daredevils]] in the [[Indian Premier League]].\n\nIn England, Coca-Cola was the main sponsor of [[The Football League]] between 2004 and 2010, a name given to the three professional divisions below the [[Premier League]] in [[association football|soccer]] (football). In 2005, Coca-Cola launched a competition for the 72 clubs of The Football League&nbsp;\u2013 it was called \"Win a Player\". This allowed fans to place one vote per day for their favorite club, with one entry being chosen at random earning \u00a3250,000 for the club; this was repeated in 2006. The \"Win A Player\" competition was very controversial, as at the end of the 2 competitions, [[Leeds United A.F.C.]] had the most votes by more than double, yet they did not win any money to spend on a new player for the club. In 2007, the competition changed to \"Buy a Player\". This competition allowed fans to buy a bottle of Coca-Cola or Coca-Cola Zero and submit the code on the wrapper on the Coca-Cola website. This code could then earn anything from 50p to \u00a3100,000 for a club of their choice. This competition was favored over the old \"Win a Player\" competition, as it allowed all clubs to win some money. Between 1992 and 1998, Coca-Cola was the title sponsor of the [[Football League Cup]] (Coca-Cola Cup), the secondary cup tournament of England.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1997, Coca-Cola was also the title sponsor of the [[Scottish League Cup]], renaming it the Coca-Cola Cup like its English counterpart.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The third male character is the rich, powerful yet villainous Juan Mardo. He leers at Courtenay and makes rude comments of a sexual nature, in Japanese nonetheless. Mardo provokes Duncan and Steele, and each feels he must defend Courtenay's honor. Ultimately Courtenay defends her own honor rather than submit to shame.\n\nMitchell's half-breed<ref name=\"lost\"/>{{rp|92}}\nantagonist, Juan Mardo, lurks in the shadows of the story and has no dialogue.
