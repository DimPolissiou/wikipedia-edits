The second option is to use an EBS volume as a root device. Instance-store volumes are temporary storage, which survive rebooting an EC2 instance, but when the instance is stopped or terminated (e.g., by an API call, or due to a failure), this store is lost.\n\nThe [[Amazon Elastic Block Store]] (EBS) provides raw [[block devices]] that can be attached to Amazon EC2 instances. These block devices can then be used like any raw block device. In a typical use case, this would include formatting the device with a [[filesystem]] and [[mounting (computing)|mounting]] it. In addition, EBS supports a number of advanced storage features, including snapshotting and cloning. EBS volumes can be up to 16TB in size. EBS volumes are built on replicated storage, so that the failure of a single component will not cause data loss.\nEBS was introduced to the general public by Amazon in August 2008.<ref name=\"ebs\" />\n\n[[File:AWS Simple Icons Storage Amazon EBS.svg|right|70px|Amazon EBS]]\nEBS volumes provide persistent storage independent of the lifetime of the EC2 instance, and act much like hard drives on a real server. More accurately, they appear as block devices to the operating system that are backed by Amazon's disk arrays. The OS is free to use the device however it wants. In the most common case, a file system is loaded and the volume acts as a hard drive. Another possible use is the creation of RAID arrays by combining two or more EBS volumes. RAID allows increases of speed and/or reliability of EBS. Users can set up and manage storage volumes of sizes from 1GB to 16TB. The volumes support snapshots, which can be taken from a GUI tool or the API. EBS volumes can be attached or detached from instances while they are running, and moved from one instance to another.<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://1201restart.com/Articles/Introduction_to_EBS_Volumes\n |title        = Introduction to EBS Volumes\n |publisher    = 1201 Restart.com\n |date         = December 2010\n |accessdate   = December 18, 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110513114653/http://1201restart.com/Articles/Introduction_to_EBS_Volumes\n |archive-date = 2011-05-13\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Amazon S3|Simple Storage Service (S3)]] is a storage system in which data is accessible to EC2 instances, or directly over the network to suitably authenticated callers (all communication is over HTTP). Amazon does not charge for the bandwidth for communications between EC2 instances and S3 storage \"in the same region.\" Accessing S3 data stored in a different region (for example, data stored in Europe from a US East Coast EC2 instance) will be billed at Amazon's normal rates.\n\nS3-based storage is priced per gigabyte per month. Applications access S3 through an API. For example, [[Hadoop|Apache Hadoop]] supports a special s3: filesystem to support reading from and writing to S3 storage during a [[MapReduce]] job. There are also S3 filesystems for Linux, which mount a remote S3 filestore on an EC2 image, as if it were local storage. As S3 is not a full [[POSIX]] filesystem, things may not behave the same as on a local disk (e.g., no locking support).\n\n===Elastic IP addresses===\n[[File:AWS Simple Icons Compute Amazon EC2 Elastic IP.svg|70px|right|Amazon Elastic IP]]\nAmazon's elastic IP address feature is similar to static IP address in traditional data centers, with one key difference. A user can programmatically map an elastic IP address to any virtual machine instance without a network administrator's help and without having to wait for DNS to propagate the binding. In this sense an Elastic IP Address belongs to the account and not to a virtual machine instance. It exists until it is explicitly removed, and remains associated with the account even while it is associated with no instance.\n\n===Amazon CloudWatch===\n[[File:AWS Simple Icons Monitoring Amazon CloudWatch Alarm.svg|70px|right|Amazon CloudWatch]]\nAmazon CloudWatch is a web service that provides real-time monitoring to Amazon's EC2 customers on their resource utilization such as CPU, disk, network and replica lag for RDS Database replicas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html|title=Working with Read Replicas of MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL DB Instances - Amazon Relational Database Service|website=docs.aws.amazon.com}}</ref> CloudWatch does not provide any memory, disk space, or load average metrics without running additional software on the instance.

The second option is to use an EBS volume as a root device. Instance-store volumes are temporary storage, which survive rebooting an EC2 instance, but when the instance is stopped or terminated (e.g., by an API call, or due to a failure), this store is lost.\n\nThe [[Amazon Elastic Block Store]] (EBS) provides raw [[block devices]] that can be attached to Amazon EC2 instances. These block devices can then be used like any raw block device. In a typical use case, this would include formatting the device with a [[filesystem]] and [[mounting (computing)|mounting]] it. In addition, EBS supports a number of advanced storage features, including snapshotting and cloning. EBS volumes can be up to 16TB in size. EBS volumes are built on replicated storage, so that the failure of a single component will not cause data loss.\nEBS was introduced to the general public by Amazon in August 2008.<ref name=\"ebs\" />\n\n[[File:AWS Simple Icons Storage Amazon EBS.svg|right|70px|Amazon EBS]]\nEBS volumes provide persistent storage independent of the lifetime of the EC2 instance, and act much like hard drives on a real server. More accurately, they appear as block devices to the operating system that are backed by Amazon's disk arrays. The OS is free to use the device however it wants. In the most common case, a file system is loaded and the volume acts as a hard drive. Another possible use is the creation of RAID arrays by combining two or more EBS volumes. RAID allows increases of speed and/or reliability of EBS. Users can set up and manage storage volumes of sizes from 1GB to 16TB. The volumes support snapshots, which can be taken from a GUI tool or the API. EBS volumes can be attached or detached from instances while they are running, and moved from one instance to another.<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://1201restart.com/Articles/Introduction_to_EBS_Volumes\n |title        = Introduction to EBS Volumes\n |publisher    = 1201 Restart.com\n |date         = December 2010\n |accessdate   = December 18, 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110513114653/http://1201restart.com/Articles/Introduction_to_EBS_Volumes\n |archive-date = 2011-05-13\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Amazon S3|Simple Storage Service (S3)]] is a storage system in which data is accessible to EC2 instances, or directly over the network to suitably authenticated callers (all communication is over HTTP). Amazon does not charge for the bandwidth for communications between EC2 instances and S3 storage \"in the same region.\" Accessing S3 data stored in a different region (for example, data stored in Europe from a US East Coast EC2 instance) will be billed at Amazon's normal rates.\n\nS3-based storage is priced per gigabyte per month. Applications access S3 through an API. For example, [[Hadoop|Apache Hadoop]] supports a special s3: filesystem to support reading from and writing to S3 storage during a [[MapReduce]] job. There are also S3 filesystems for Linux, which mount a remote S3 filestore on an EC2 image, as if it were local storage. As S3 is not a full [[POSIX]] filesystem, things may not behave the same as on a local disk (e.g., no locking support).\n\n===Elastic IP addresses===\n[[File:AWS Simple Icons Compute Amazon EC2 Elastic IP.svg|70px|right|Amazon Elastic IP]]\nAmazon's elastic IP address feature is similar to static IP address in traditional data centers, with one key difference. A user can programmatically map an elastic IP address to any virtual machine instance without a network administrator's help and without having to wait for DNS to propagate the binding. In this sense an Elastic IP Address belongs to the account and not to a virtual machine instance. It exists until it is explicitly removed, and remains associated with the account even while it is associated with no instance.\n\n===Amazon CloudWatch===\n[[File:AWS Simple Icons Monitoring Amazon CloudWatch Alarm.svg|70px|right|Amazon CloudWatch]]\nAmazon CloudWatch is a web service that provides real-time monitoring to Amazon's EC2 customers on their resource utilization such as CPU, disk, network and replica lag for RDS Database replicas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html|title=Working with Read Replicas of MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL DB Instances - Amazon Relational Database Service|website=docs.aws.amazon.com}}</ref> CloudWatch does not provide any memory, disk space, or load average metrics without running additional software on the instance.

Instances are priced depending on their \"size\", namely how much CPU and RAM included.\n\nAmazon EC2 price varies from $2.5 per month for \"nano\" instance with 1 vCPU and 0.5 GB RAM on board to \"xlarge\" type of instances with 32 vCPU and 488 GB RAM billed up to $3997.19 per month.\n\nThe charts above show how Amazon EC2 pricing is compared to similar Cloud Computing services: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Kamatera, and Vultr.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://5best.cloud/aws-vs-azure-vs-google-cloud/|title=Amazon AWS vs Microsoft Azure vs Google Cloud vs Kamatera vs Vultr - 5 Best Cloud Services|date=2017-12-02|work=5 Best Cloud Services|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|+Amazon EC2 compared to similar cloud computing services \n|\n|Amazon EC2\n|Microsoft Azure\n|Google Cloud Platform\n|Kamatera\n|Vultr\n|-\n|1vCPU 0.5GB RAM\n|$3.29\n|\n|\n|\n| $2.5\n|-\n|1vCPU 0.75GB RAM\n|\n|$14.88\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|1vCPU 1GB RAM\n| $6.83\n|\n|\n| $11\n| $5\n|-\n|1vCPU 1.75GB RAM\n|\n| $44.64\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|1vCPU 2GB RAM\n| $13.14\n|\n|\n| $17\n| $10\n|-\n|1vCPU 3.75GB RAM\n|\n|\n| $24.27\n|\n|\n|-\n|2vCPU 3.5GB RAM\n|\n| $89.88\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2vCPU 4GB RAM\n|\n|\n|\n| $41\n| $20\n|-\n|2vCPU 7.5GB RAM \n|\n|\n| $48.55\n|\n|\n|-\n|2vCPU 8GB RAM\n| $52.56\n|\n|\n| $61\n|\n|-\n|4vCPU 7GB RAM\n|\n|$178.56\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|4vCPU 8GB RAM\n|\n|\n|\n|$86\n|$40\n|-\n|4vCPU 15GB RAM\n|\n|\n|$97.09\n|\n|\n|-\n|4vCPU 15GB RAM\n|$134\n|\n|\n|$134\n|\n|-\n|6vCPU 16GB RAM\n|\n|\n|\n|$159\n|$80\n|-\n|8vCPU 14GB RAM\n|\n|$357.12\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|8vCPU 16GB RAM\n|\n|\n|\n|$184\n|\n|-\n|8vCPU 30GB RAM\n|\n|\n|$194.18\n|\n|\n|-\n|8vCPU 32GB RAM\n|$219.64\n|\n|\n|$280\n|$160\n|-\n|8vCPU 49GB RAM\n|\n|\n|\n|$328\n|\n|-\n|8vCPU 56GB RAM\n|\n|$744\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|16vCPU 32GB RAM\n|$412.53\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|8vCPU 65GB RAM\n|\n|\n|\n|$408\n|\n|-\n|12vCPU 65GB RAM\n|\n|\n|\n|$626\n|\n|-\n|16vCPU 32GB RAM\n|\n|\n|$388.36\n|$746\n|\n|-\n|16vCPU 65GB RAM\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|$320\n|-\n|20vCPU 65GB RAM\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|$826\n|-\n|12vCPU 112GB RAM\n|\n|$1339.20\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|16vCPU 112GB RAM\n|\n|$1450.80\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|20vCPU 98GB RAM\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|$986\n|-\n|36vCPU 60GB RAM\n|$825.06\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|20vCPU 131GB RAM\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|$1146\n|-\n|32vCPU 120GB RAM\n|\n|\n|$776.72\n|\n|\n|-\n|16vCPU 224GB RAM\n|\n|$1935.1\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|20vCPU 196GB RAM\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|$1466\n|-\n|20vCPU 262GB RAM\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|$1786\n|-\n|24vCPU 224GB RAM\n|\n|$2678.40\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|64vCPU 240GB RAM\n|\n|\n|$1553.44\n|\n|\n|-\n|32vCPU 488GB RAM\n|$3997.19\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n\n==Reliability==\nTo make EC2 more [[Fault-tolerant system|fault-tolerant]], Amazon engineered ''Availability Zones'' that are designed to be insulated from failures in other availability zones. Availability zones do not share the same infrastructure. Applications running in more than one availability zone can achieve higher availability.<ref name=\"AWS in Action, Availability Zones\" />\n\nEC2 provides users with control over the geographical location of instances that allows for latency optimization and high levels of redundancy. For example, to minimize downtime, a user can set up server instances in multiple zones that are insulated from each other for most causes of failure such that one backs up the other.\n\nHigher-availability database services, like [[Amazon Relational Database Service]] run separately from EC2 instances.\n\n==Issues==\nIn early July 2008, the anti-spam organizations [[Outblaze]] and [[Spamhaus.org]] began blocking Amazon's EC2 address pool due to problems with the distribution of [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] and [[malware]].<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/07/amazon_hey_spammers_get_off_my.html\n |title=Amazon: Hey Spammers, Get Off My Cloud!\n |first=Brian\n |last=Krebs\n |authorlink=Brian Krebs\n |work=Security Fix\n |publisher=[[The Washington Post]]\n |date=July 1, 2008\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203081807/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/07/amazon_hey_spammers_get_off_my.html\n |archivedate=December 3, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nOn December 1, 2010, Amazon pulled its service to [[WikiLeaks]] after coming under political pressure in the US.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-website-cables-servers-amazon | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ewen | last=MacAskill | title=WikiLeaks website pulled by Amazon after US political pressure | date=December 2, 2010}}</ref> The Internet group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] attempted to attack EC2 in revenge; however, Amazon was not affected by the attack.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Matthew |last1=Weaver |first2=Mark |last2=Tran |title=WikiLeaks cables: Shell, Operation Payback and Assange for the Nobel prize{{snd}}as it happened |url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-us-embassy-cables-live-updates |work=[[The Guardian]] |date= December 9, 2010 |accessdate= May 31, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nAmazon's websites were temporarily offline on December 12, 2010, although it was initially unclear if this was due to attacks or a hardware failure.
