The game was originally released for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] in Japan in October 2009, and in North America and Europe in January 2010. The game was later released on the [[Wii U]] alongside its sequel, ''[[Bayonetta 2]]'', releasing in September 2014 in Japan and worldwide the following month - the two games were later released worldwide on the [[Nintendo Switch]] in February 2018. An enhanced port for [[Microsoft Windows]] was released in April 2017 with [[4K resolution|4K]] support. A remastered version of ''Bayonetta'' as well as another PlatinumGames title, [[Vanquish (video game)|''Vanquish'']], was released for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on February 18, 2020, as part of a ''Bayonetta & Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle'' compilation.<ref name=\"IGN cites 10th anniversary release\" />\n\n''Bayonetta'' takes place in Vigrid, a fictional city in Europe. The game stars [[Bayonetta (character)|the eponymous character]], a witch who is capable of shapeshifting and using various firearms. She possesses magical attacks, and she can use her hair to summon demons to dispatch her foes. The game features a rating system, which gives players a grade based on their performance, and a combat system that is similar to the ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' series, also created by ''Bayonetta'' creator [[Hideki Kamiya]].\n\nDevelopment of the game was started in January 2007, with Hideki Kamiya being the game's director. According to Kamiya, the game was completely original, though he drew some inspirations from [[Scandinavian mythology]], and played ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]'' for reference. The game's theme is \"sexiness\" and \"partial nudity\", and that the characters were designed to be \"fashionable\". Kamiya and artist Mari Shimazaki spent more than a year to create Bayonetta's design. Several demos were released for the game prior to its launch. ''Bayonetta'' was the third project released by [[PlatinumGames]], which was founded by former [[Clover Studio]] employees. Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews. The game was praised for its combat, presentation and soundtrack, but drew criticism for its story and quick time events. The game was nominated for and won several end-of-the-year accolades, and had sold over a million units worldwide by 2010. An [[anime]] film adaptation of the game by [[Gonzo (company)|Gonzo]], titled ''[[Bayonetta: Bloody Fate]]'', was released in Japan in November 2013. A third game, ''Bayonetta 3'', is in development for the Switch.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Bayonetta kick.jpg|thumb|left|''Bayonetta'' gameplay screenshot, demonstrating one of the available \"Wicked Weave\" attacks.|alt=Screenshot of a woman with revealing attire in an outdoor setting.

Depending on how well the player performs, they are given one of the following medals at the end of the verse; Stone, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Pure Platinum, similar to the rating system of ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]''. There are some medals that are earned off the beaten path, such as special areas with set challenges. At the end of the chapter, a final score and an award are given depending on the type of medals achieved, with the score being deducted for any items used and deaths occurred. In between chapters there is a minigame called ''Angel Attack'', in which players use Arcade Bullets found in the main levels to shoot at angels and earn points. These points can be traded in for items, with any leftover points exchanged for halos.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Setting and characters===\n''Bayonetta'' takes place in Vigrid, a fictional city in Europe.<ref name=\"ign-progress\"/> The [[Bayonetta (character)|title character]] (voiced by Hellena Taylor)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hellenataylor.com/reel_voice.html |title=Hellena Taylor |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119162428/http://hellenataylor.com/reel_voice.html |archivedate=2010-01-19 }}</ref> is a witch who [[shapeshifting|shapeshifts]] and uses various firearms, along with magical attacks she performs with her hair by summoning demons to dispatch her foes.

Over time, she begins to remember what caused her current predicament. 500 years before the incident that caused Bayonetta's memory loss, there were two factions preserving the balance between darkness and light in the world: the Umbra Witches, who are followers of darkness, and their counterparts, the Lumen Sages, who are followers of light. The factions shared two distinct treasures, the 'Eyes of the World' (separately named the 'Left Eye' and the 'Right Eye') which they used to oversee the just passage of time. Both factions mysteriously disappeared from Vigrid under unknown circumstances.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqgtpTkCQ3Q |title=TGS 09: Bayonetta Trailer |publisher=IGN |via=[[YouTube]] |format=Adobe Flash |date=September 24, 2009 |accessdate=December 23, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129123221/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqgtpTkCQ3Q |archive-date=January 29, 2014 |url-status = live }}</ref> Bayonetta has an ornate piece of jewelry which contains a small red gem, and believes this gem is the Left Eye of the World.

The diaries written by Luka's father mention that the Witches actually drew most of their power from both the demons in Inferno, and The Human World, otherwise known as Chaos, the realm regular humans live in.\n\n===Story===\nIn the present day, an informant named Enzo has joined up with Bayonetta, a witch who was revived twenty years ago from the bottom of a lake and has no memories of her past. Owning one-half of the \"Eyes of the World,\" Bayonetta leaves for Vigrid when Enzo informs her of rumors the other half is there.\n\nAfterward, Bayonetta confronts another Umbra Witch named Jeanne, as well as a young man named Luka; the former seemingly has ties to Bayonetta's past, while the latter blames Bayonetta for his father's death. Bayonetta then battles through Vigrid before encountering Fortitudo, one of the four [[Cardinal Virtues]], and defeats him.\n\nMaking her way through the Crescent and Sunrise Valleys, Bayonetta finds Jeanne conversing with [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperantia]], the second of the Cardinal Virtues; after defeating Jeanne, she then meets a lost child named Cereza. Much to Bayonetta's frustration, the child believes she's her mother and follows her; after eventually returning to the human world, Bayonetta leaves Cereza with Luka and confronts Temperantia, whom she defeats. Continuing her search for the Right Eye, Bayonetta follows Luka and Cereza down Prominence Bridge in an attempt to reach the island known as Isla del Sol; she is attacked by [[Justice (virtue)|Iustitia]], the third Cardinal Virtue, and defeats him.\n\nThe trio board a [[Valkyrie]] jet headed for Isla del Sol, only for Cereza to become lost. After finding her and fighting Jeanne again, [[Prudence|Sapientia]], the final Cardinal Virtue, attacks and downs the jet, and Bayonetta defeats him. The three then head for Isla del Sol by helicopter and then by a missile. When they reach the island, Bayonetta is confronted again by Jeanne, who explains Bayonetta was a child born from an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage, which was forbidden and resulted in Bayonetta being ostracized. Bayonetta defeats Jeanne, who reveals the reason Bayonetta possesses the Left Eye is because she has accepted her fate. Bayonetta hands Jeanne the gem she had been carrying, making her remember she is Cereza, and that Jeanne was once her friend; it was Jeanne who sealed her away, giving Bayonetta the gem to protect her and the Left Eye. After Jeanne then sacrifices herself to save Bayonetta, she continues through the tower with Luka and Cereza.\n\nUpon reaching the top, Bayonetta finally meets Father Balder, the last of the Lumen Sages. Balder reveals he is Bayonetta's father, and that he plans to reunite the three universes by resurrecting Jubileus, the Creator; however, since Bayonetta could not remember her past, Cereza was sent back to her to help her remember, allowing Balder to use her as the Left Eye. After revealing he was responsible for the death of Luka's father, Balder throws Luka to his death, before fighting Bayonetta among rubble falling from the tower. Bayonetta ultimately manages to defeat Balder before saving a falling Luka and Cereza.\n\nAfter making a time portal to return her younger self home, Bayonetta returns to the present, only to collapse after regaining her memory; seemingly unharmed, Balder transports himself and the unconscious Bayonetta towards the statue on top of the tower, beginning the resurrection of Jubileus. As the statue launches into space, Jeanne reappears after earlier escaping both death and Balder's control narrowly. She ascends the launching statue on her motorcycle by riding along the surface; after reaching Bayonetta, she saves her, only for Jubileus to come alive and consume Balder. Jeanne floats away from the statue, leaving Bayonetta alone to fight the deity. Bayonetta eventually defeats Jubileus by summoning [[Queen of Sheba|Queen Sheba]], who punches the deity's soul into the sun.

praised the developing game in March 2009 as \"absolutely stunning-looking\" and \"a balls-out action game set amongst glorious European architecture\", and called its titular witch their \"new favourite videogame character ever\" - they compared her to ''Devil May Cry''{{'s}} protagonist Dante, commenting that she had his \"playfulness and versatility\", but with \"some of the most visually inventive combat\" they've seen.<ref name=\"ign-progress\" />  Similarly, ''[[GameSpy]]'''s Gerald Villoria praised the game in July that year as highly original to the point that it could end up like the poor-selling ''[[\u014ckami]]'' (another Kamiya-directed game) because \"the premise, the characters, the action sequences\" were different from anything he'd ever played, and called its lead a \"constantly moving\", \"remarkably multi-faceted\" character \"presented in an ultra-stylish way\".<ref name=\"gamespy-e32009\">{{cite web |last=Villoria |first=Gerald

The game was originally released for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] in Japan in October 2009, and in North America and Europe in January 2010. The game was later released on the [[Wii U]] alongside its sequel, ''[[Bayonetta 2]]'', releasing in September 2014 in Japan and worldwide the following month - the two games were later released worldwide on the [[Nintendo Switch]] in February 2018. An enhanced port for [[Microsoft Windows]] was released in April 2017 with [[4K resolution|4K]] support. A remastered version of ''Bayonetta'' as well as another PlatinumGames title, [[Vanquish (video game)|''Vanquish'']], was released for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on February 18, 2020, as part of a ''Bayonetta & Vanquish 10th Anniversary Bundle'' compilation.<ref name=\"IGN cites 10th anniversary release\" />\n\n''Bayonetta'' takes place in Vigrid, a fictional city in Europe. The game stars [[Bayonetta (character)|the eponymous character]], a witch who is capable of shapeshifting and using various firearms. She possesses magical attacks, and she can use her hair to summon demons to dispatch her foes. The game features a rating system, which gives players a grade based on their performance, and a combat system that is similar to the ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' series, also created by ''Bayonetta'' creator [[Hideki Kamiya]].\n\nDevelopment of the game was started in January 2007, with Hideki Kamiya being the game's director. According to Kamiya, the game was completely original, though he drew some inspirations from [[Scandinavian mythology]], and played ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]'' for reference. The game's theme is \"sexiness\" and \"partial nudity\", and that the characters were designed to be \"fashionable\". Kamiya and artist Mari Shimazaki spent more than a year to create Bayonetta's design. Several demos were released for the game prior to its launch. ''Bayonetta'' was the third project released by [[PlatinumGames]], which was founded by former [[Clover Studio]] employees. Upon release, the game received generally positive reviews. The game was praised for its combat, presentation and soundtrack, but drew criticism for its story and quick time events. The game was nominated for and won several end-of-the-year accolades, and had sold over a million units worldwide by 2010. An [[anime]] film adaptation of the game by [[Gonzo (company)|Gonzo]], titled ''[[Bayonetta: Bloody Fate]]'', was released in Japan in November 2013. A third game, ''Bayonetta 3'', is in development for the Switch.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Bayonetta kick.jpg|thumb|left|''Bayonetta'' gameplay screenshot, demonstrating one of the available \"Wicked Weave\" attacks.|alt=Screenshot of a woman with revealing attire in an outdoor setting.

The factions shared two distinct treasures, the 'Eyes of the World' (separately named the 'Left Eye' and the 'Right Eye') which they used to oversee the just passage of time. Both factions mysteriously disappeared from Vigrid under unknown circumstances.<ref>{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqgtpTkCQ3Q |title=TGS 09: Bayonetta Trailer |publisher=IGN |via=[[YouTube]] |format=Adobe Flash |date=September 24, 2009 |accessdate=December 23, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129123221/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqgtpTkCQ3Q |archive-date=January 29, 2014 |url-status = live }}</ref> Bayonetta has an ornate piece of jewelry which contains a small red gem, and believes this gem is the Left Eye of the World.

The diaries written by Luka's father mention that the Witches actually drew most of their power from both the demons in Inferno, and The Human World, otherwise known as Chaos, the realm regular humans live in.\n\n===Story===\nIn the present day, an informant named Enzo has joined up with Bayonetta, a witch who was revived twenty years ago from the bottom of a lake and has no memories of her past. Owning one-half of the \"Eyes of the World,\" Bayonetta leaves for Vigrid when Enzo informs her of rumors the other half is there.\n\nAfterward, Bayonetta confronts another Umbra Witch named Jeanne, as well as a young man named Luka; the former seemingly has ties to Bayonetta's past, while the latter blames Bayonetta for his father's death. Bayonetta then battles through Vigrid before encountering Fortitudo, one of the four [[Cardinal Virtues]], and defeats him.\n\nMaking her way through the Crescent and Sunrise Valleys, Bayonetta finds Jeanne conversing with [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperantia]], the second of the Cardinal Virtues; after defeating Jeanne, she then meets a lost child named Cereza. Much to Bayonetta's frustration, the child believes she's her mother and follows her; after eventually returning to the human world, Bayonetta leaves Cereza with Luka and confronts Temperantia, whom she defeats. Continuing her search for the Right Eye, Bayonetta follows Luka and Cereza down Prominence Bridge in an attempt to reach the island known as Isla del Sol; she is attacked by [[Justice (virtue)|Iustitia]], the third Cardinal Virtue, and defeats him.\n\nThe trio board a [[Valkyrie]] jet headed for Isla del Sol, only for Cereza to become lost. After finding her and fighting Jeanne again, [[Prudence|Sapientia]], the final Cardinal Virtue, attacks and downs the jet, and Bayonetta defeats him. The three then head for Isla del Sol by helicopter and then by a missile. When they reach the island, Bayonetta is confronted again by Jeanne, who explains Bayonetta was a child born from an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage, which was forbidden and resulted in Bayonetta being ostracized. Bayonetta defeats Jeanne, who reveals the reason Bayonetta possesses the Left Eye is because she has accepted her fate. Bayonetta hands Jeanne the gem she had been carrying, making her remember she is Cereza, and that Jeanne was once her friend; it was Jeanne who sealed her away, giving Bayonetta the gem to protect her and the Left Eye. After Jeanne then sacrifices herself to save Bayonetta, she continues through the tower with Luka and Cereza.\n\nUpon reaching the top, Bayonetta finally meets Father Balder, the last of the Lumen Sages. Balder reveals he is Bayonetta's father, and that he plans to reunite the three universes by resurrecting Jubileus, the Creator; however, since Bayonetta could not remember her past, Cereza was sent back to her to help her remember, allowing Balder to use her as the Left Eye. After revealing he was responsible for the death of Luka's father, Balder throws Luka to his death, before fighting Bayonetta among rubble falling from the tower. Bayonetta ultimately manages to defeat Balder before saving a falling Luka and Cereza.\n\nAfter making a time portal to return her younger self home, Bayonetta returns to the present, only to collapse after regaining her memory; seemingly unharmed, Balder transports himself and the unconscious Bayonetta towards the statue on top of the tower, beginning the resurrection of Jubileus. As the statue launches into space, Jeanne reappears after earlier escaping both death and Balder's control narrowly. She ascends the launching statue on her motorcycle by riding along the surface; after reaching Bayonetta, she saves her, only for Jubileus to come alive and consume Balder. Jeanne floats away from the statue, leaving Bayonetta alone to fight the deity. Bayonetta eventually defeats Jubileus by summoning [[Queen of Sheba|Queen Sheba]], who punches the deity's soul into the sun. As the statue left behind by Jubileus plummets towards Earth, Jeanne is revealed to be alive, and after destroying the last of the Jubileus statue, Bayonetta and Jeanne end up in a free-fall towards Earth; after surviving the descent, the epilogue shows them continuing to battle against the angels.\n\n==Development==\n{{quotebox|...&nbsp;it's been eight years since [the first ''[[Devil May Cry (video game)|DMC]]''], so of course I wouldn't create a game that hadn't progressed from those days!

praised the developing game in March 2009 as \"absolutely stunning-looking\" and \"a balls-out action game set amongst glorious European architecture\", and called its titular witch their \"new favourite videogame character ever\" - they compared her to ''Devil May Cry''{{'s}} protagonist Dante, commenting that she had his \"playfulness and versatility\", but with \"some of the most visually inventive combat\" they've seen.<ref name=\"ign-progress\" />  Similarly, ''[[GameSpy]]'''s Gerald Villoria praised the game in July that year as highly original to the point that it could end up like the poor-selling ''[[\u014ckami]]'' (another Kamiya-directed game) because \"the premise, the characters, the action sequences\" were different from anything he'd ever played, and called its lead a \"constantly moving\", \"remarkably multi-faceted\" character \"presented in an ultra-stylish way\".<ref name=\"gamespy-e32009\">{{cite web |last=Villoria |first=Gerald

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.
