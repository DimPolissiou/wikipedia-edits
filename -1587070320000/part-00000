It stars [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Cybill Shepherd]], [[Madeline Kahn]], and [[Duilio Del Prete]] as two couples who each switch partners during a party and attempt to make each other jealous. Featuring 18 songs with music and lyrics by [[Cole Porter]], Bogdanovich was inspired to make a musical with the composer's songs after Shepherd gave him a book of his songs. All of the musical sequences were performed live by the cast, since ''At Long Last Love'' was meant by Bogdanovich to be a tribute to 1930s musical films like ''[[One Hour With You]]'', ''[[The Love Parade]]'', ''[[The Merry Widow (1934 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' and ''[[The Smiling Lieutenant]]'' that also filmed the songs in the same manner.\n\n[[20th Century Fox]] rushed the film's release, only allowing for two test screenings before the final version premiered at [[Radio City Music Hall]]. Despite a few decent published opinions from [[film critic|critic]]s like [[Roger Ebert]], ''At Long Last Love'' faced mostly horrendous initial reviews that mainly targeted the lead actors' performances of the musical numbers; and very low box office returns, only making less than half of its $5.14 million budget. The critical reception was so negative that Bogdanovich printed newspaper ads apologizing for the film. Apart from a 1981 [[videocassette]] release, ''At Long Last Love'' didn't have an official home media release for many years, so the only available versions of the film were through bootleg TV, VHS recordings, and 16mm prints. This was until the early 2010s; Bogdanovich's 121-minute 1979 default version of the film was issued to [[Netflix]] in 2012, and the \"Definitive Director's Version,\" which was 90 seconds longer, was released on Blu-ray in 2013.\n==Plot==\nFour socialites unexpectedly clash: heiress Brooke Carter runs into the Italian gambler Johnny Spanish at the race track while playboy Michael O. Pritchard nearly runs into stage star Kitty O'Kelly with his car. Backstage at Kitty's show, it turns out she and Brooke are old friends who attended public school together. The foursome do the town, accompanied by Brooke's companion Elizabeth, who throws herself at Michael's butler and chauffeur Rodney James.\n\nThe four friends change partners at a party, where Brooke and Michael step outside behind Kitty and Johnny. In an effort to make the others jealous, Kitty, Johnny, Brooke, Michael, Elizabeth and Rodney begin their romance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Michael Oliver Pritchard III\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Brooke Carter\n* [[Madeline Kahn]] as Kitty O'Kelly\n* [[Duilio Del Prete]] as Johnny Spanish\n* [[Eileen Brennan]] as Elizabeth\n* [[John Hillerman]] as Rodney James\n* [[Mildred Natwick]] as Mabel Pritchard\n* [[M.

What was reviewed was Cybill and Peter's relationship. You see, Peter Bogdanovich has done something that all critics will never forgive him for doing. That is, stop being a critic, go make a film and have that film be enormously successful. What he did then was to go on talk shows, and be rather arrogant and talk about how bad critics are.

He made some refinements, including 90 seconds of restored footage, bringing the final running time to 123 minutes.

Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General George S Patton christened it as a Patton. It was designed as a replacement for the [[M26 Pershing]], [[M4 Sherman]] variants and [[M46 Patton]]s used in the [[Korean War]], and as the successor to the [[M47 Patton]].{{r|1991_Terry|page=5}} Nearly 12,000 M48s were built, mainly by [[Chrysler]] and [[American Locomotive Company]], from 1952 to 1961. The M48 underwent many design modifications and improvements during its production life. This led to a wide variety of suspension systems, [[Gun turret#Cupola|cupola styles]], power packs, fenders and other details among individual tanks. The early designs, up to the M48A2C, were powered by a gasoline engine. The M48A3 and A5 versions used a diesel engine, however gasoline engine versions were still in use in the US Army National Guard through 1968 and through 1975 by many West German Army units. Numerous examples of the M48 saw combat use in [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|various Arab\u2013Israeli conflicts]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Beginning in 1959, most American M48A1s and A2s were upgraded to the M48A3 model.\n\nThe M48 Patton-series saw widespread service with the United States and NATO until it was superseded by the M60 tank as well as being widely exported. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles and bridge layers. Some M48A5 models served into the mid-1980s with US Army National Guard units, and were used as targets for weapons and radar testing into the mid-1990s. Many M48s remain in service in other countries though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield. The [[Turkish Army]] has the largest number of modernized M48 MBTs, with more than 1,400 in its inventory. Of these, around 1,000 have been phased out, placed in storage, or modified as [[armoured recovery vehicle]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vietnam. Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M-48 tank. - NARA - 532441.tif|thumb|Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M48A3 tank, Vietnam, 1966]]\nAfter the conclusion of [[World War II]], the United States [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|Ordance Tank-Automotive Command]] (OTAC) drastically slowed or canceled many tank development and design programs. On {{date|1950-11-07}}, the Ordnance Technical Committee mandated a change in the nomenclature for tanks in the US Military.{{r|1991_Terry|page=2}} It was decided that weight designations (Light, Medium, Heavy) were no longer applicable due to changes in the way tanks were developed and employed on the battlefield, and the varying calibers of main guns now available. Thus the caliber of the gun replaced its weight designation. For example, the M103 Heavy Tank was redesignated as the [[M103 (heavy tank)|120mm Gun Tank M103]] and the Light Tank M41 Walker Bulldog as the [[M41 Walker Bulldog|76mm Gun Tank M41 Walker Bulldog]].{{r|2014_DavidB}} The M47 Patton entered production in 1951 and was used by the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the [[Korean War]]. This forced the US to field older tank models, such as the [[M26 Pershing]] and [[M46 Patton]]. In response, the Army launched several design projects for a replacement of the M46 and M26. The United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the Korean War, when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to its quantity production.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=31|q=Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure the speedy fielding of new tanks. Such rapid production guaranteed teething troubles, but the importance attached to rapidly equipping combat unirs with the new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.}} Notable among these were the [[T42 medium tank|T42]], [[T69 (tank)|T69]] and T48 projects as well as continuing to pursue further improvements to the M47. General [[Bruce C. Clarke]] stated \"We know exactly what we want. We want a fast, highly mobile, fully armored, lightweight vehicle. It must be able to swim, cross any terrain, and climb 30 degree hills. It must be air-transportable. It must have a simple but powerful engine, requiring little or no maintenance. The operating range should be several hundred miles. We would also like it to be invisible\".{{r|1960_Clarke|page=11}}\n\n===T48 Project===\nThe T48 was to focus on improving the turret design and a more powerful engine. 1/4 and 1/8 scale [[mockup]]s of the turret were constructed during May 1950. The design study was accepted by the Army in December the same year and a contract for the design and manufacture of a 90mm armed tank, the T48 was given to the Chrysler Corporation. Six prototypes were built, the first by December 1951.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=11}} The hull was redesigned, moving the driver's station to the front center and the bow-mounted machine gun and its associated crew station were removed and converted to safe container storage for additional main gun ammunition.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}  The front glacis was redesigned into a slope and offered much better ballistic protection than former welded and rather flat designs.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} The driver steered the vehicle using an aircraft styled steering wheel. Initially the power pack consisted of the Continental AV-1790-5B gasoline engine producing 704 brake horsepower coupled to an Allison CD-850-4A cross-drive transmission with 2 forward and 1 reverse ranges. The hull armor was increased to {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the front glacis of rolled homogeneous steel. It had six roadwheel pairs per side and five return rollers, a torsion bar suspension system, using the T97E2 steel track assembly.\n\nA new hemispherically shaped turret was implemented for the T48. This was to eliminate the noted shot traps in the M47's turret design and also lowered the vehicle's height in comparison to the M46 and M47. It was armed with the T139 90&nbsp;mm main gun with a cylindrical blast deflector on the barrel.{{r|2020_Alex}} The full image stereoscopic T46E1/M12 rangefinder was placed in the central section of the turret.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nOn {{date|1951-02-27}}, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes (OTCM) #33791 initiated the simultaneous production and design refinement of the new tank, designating it the 90mm Gun Tank M48.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=85,152}} The Army planned to produce some 9,000 M48s within three years of development. Such rapid, mass production would close the imbalance between Soviet and American tank forces. Meeting this goal, however, required production simultaneous with operational testing and development. Chrysler Corporation became the principal producer of the tank. Expected production and teething troubles led to the creation of integrating committees to coordinate tank and component development. These Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committees included military and industrial representatives who provided early warning of defects and recommended remedies.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}22}} Testing trials of the T48 tanks began in February 1952 and continued until the end of 1955. However the perceived immediate threat of Soviet aggression in Western Europe and the ongoing Korean War impelled Army senior leadership to rush the T48 tank into series production before the inevitable bugs could be worked out of the new tank design. Instead, it was decided that any needed design changes uncovered by the continued testing and evaluation of the T48 tanks at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal Test Center would be incorporated into the M48 series production vehicles as quickly as possible.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}27}}\n\n===Components===\n\n====Armor====\nIn conjunction with the development of the T48 project there was some discussion regarding armor. The weight of conventional armored steel needed to provide protection against the emerging large-calibered high-velocity main guns and improved APDS kinetic energy penetrators was making its continued use impractical. Composite [[applique armour|applique armor panels]] made with fused silica glass was envisioned to be fitted to the hull. It was also desired that a turret be constructed using this special armor.{{r|1958_Salter}} The [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|OTAC]] and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] began development of the armor in November 1952 at [[Fort Belvoir]] VA as Project TT2-782/51.{{r|1958_Salter}} This composite armor provides protection against HEAT, HEP, and HE rounds. Its overall slow development kept it from being used on the T48 and was dropped from consideration in the M48 by 1953, however its development was continued with the [[T95 Medium Tank]] until 1958.\n\nThere were two different hulls used for the M48 series. The M48 hull had a wedge-shaped front glacis compared to the M46's rather flat design. Early Mod A hulls had smaller diameter turret and driver's hatches. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. The engine exhaust vents were located on the top of the rear deck. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly. The drive sprocket was located at the rear of the hull. Shock absorbers were mounted at the first two and last roadwheel arms. This hull design was manufactured for the original M48 and M48A1 versions of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe M48A2 hull design saw several modifications including a reduction from five to three return rollers per side. The suspension system was simplified, a more compact [[Powerpack (drivetrain)|powerpack]] and additional fuel cells, with large louvered grill access doors replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This hull was used on newly constructed M48A2 and M48A3 tanks of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe turret used for the M48 series was hemispherical in shape and was made from cast homogeneous steel. It had a flat gun shield and a standard pop-up styled hatch for the commander and an additional hatch for the loader's station. Early production models of the turret had somewhat smaller diameter hatches. The gunner was provided with an M37 .30 cal machine gun with 5,900 rounds of ammunition.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\n====Rangefinders and Fire Control Systems====\nDuring WWII and the Korean War, most tanks used a direct sighting system where the gun sights and rangefinders were slaved directly to the gun's barrel but its long range accuracy depended upon the focusing abilities of the individual gunner. There are two basic types of optical [[rangefinders]], stereoscopic and coincidence. With a [[stereoscopic rangefinder|stereoscopic model]] range determination occurred by measuring the distance from the observer to a target using the observer's capability of [[binocular vision]]. The [[coincidence rangefinder]] uses a single eyepiece. Light from the target enters the rangefinder through two windows located at either end of the instrument. The ARCOVE emphasis upon increased long range accuracy led to the incorporation of a fire control system (FCS) in the M48. The fire control system included a rangefinder, mechanical ballistic computer, ballistic drive, and gunner's sight. Collectively, these mechanical devices resembled in miniature the fire control systems used in [[naval gunnery]]. Only after the Second World War did such systems become small enough for use in combat vehicles. These mechanical fire control systems permitted tanks to engage effectively at much longer ranges than in [[World War II]], a critical consideration for the Army, expecting to enter the European battlefield outnumbered. Instead of a gunner's sight being slaved to the gun tube, the ballistic computer and drive computed the range and elevated the gun. The gunner's primary responsibility lay in keeping the sight on the target. The mechanical ballistic computer made a more accurate computation of range possible by mathematically accounting for such factors as vehicle cant and ammunition type.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=1{{ndash}}2}} Many developmental range finders based on pulses of IR light, such as the Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) rangefinder of the [[T95 Medium Tank|T95]] continued into 1957.{{r|1991_Ogorkiewicz|page=174|q=The first major attempt to use an electro-optical rangefinder was represented by the T53 Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) system, which was tested on the US T95 tank between 1955 and 1957}}\n\n====Autoloader systems====\nAnother requirement of the T48 project was to explore the use of [[autoloader]]s for the main gun as they became available. Preliminary experiments with a loading system using the T48 turret were unsuccessful due to the limited space and the need to line up the breach with the loading system after each firing. It also was dropped from consideration for use on the M48 but was further developed on the T69 tank as the 90&nbsp;mm T178 gun. It was fitted with an eight-round auto-loader system mounted in an oscillating turret.\n\n====90 mm Main Gun====\nARCOVE also involved the Ordnance Department with the goal of improving the 90&nbsp;mm gun and its ammunition. The Army expected difficulties in engagements with the Soviet [[IS tank family#Object 703 IS-3|IS-3 heavy tank]], since the M47's M36 90&nbsp;mm rifled main gun could not consistently penetrate its frontal armor, even with special armor-piercing capped (APC) or HEAT ammunition.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} Work was performed to address this by developing the improved T300E53 HEAT ammunition and the T137 series of Hypervelocity Armor-Piercing Discarding-Sabot (HVAP-DS or simply APDS) ammunition. The T139 allowed for easier barrel changing and weighed less than the preceding M36/T119 gun. The new APDS round could penetrate {{convert|11.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of homogeneous steel armor, angled at 30 degrees, at a distance of {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, but was not accepted for service.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} The T139 was later standardized as the 90mm Gun M41.\n\n====Turret Cupolas====\nThe T48 tank featured a remote controllable machine gun mount as the tank commander's weapon on a pedestal, which allowed him to fire the .50 caliber (12.7mm) M2HB machine gun from within the vehicle's turret. It used a 100-round ammunition box and could also be employed manually by the commander. However, servicing and reloading of the weapon required the tank commander to open his roof hatch and expose his head and upper torso. This remote controllable mount was designated as the .50 Caliber Machine Gun Mount, M1 and designed by Chrysler Defense Engineering.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} By October 1954, the Army decided to amend the design of the tank by installing a cupola. During the production of M48s it was modified several times resulting in a wide mix of cupola styles among individual tanks. Afterwards it was renamed as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun, M1.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=23}} The new tank commander cupola would allow the tank commander to aim and fire his weapon while remaining under armor protection via a remote controlled M2HB machine gun, however the commander had to open the cupola hatch and expose his head to reload or service the machine gun due to the limited headroom.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} These cupolas had a small rearward opening hatch and a single, non-removable vision block. They were designed by [[AAI Corporation|Aircraft Armaments Incorporated]]. Because of its smaller turret roof hatch opening those M1 cupolas retro-fitted to early production M48 tanks used an adaptor ring.\n\nThe M1E1 cupola design used a G305 cupola riser with 9 non-removable vision blocks installed (some versions had 7 with the 2 rear blocks deleted) between the turret roof and the cupola. It also came with a new bulged hatch cover to provide the tank commander with more headroom and allowed him to reload the weapon while remaining under armor protection. A major drawback of both these cupolas was their inability to mount either daylight or infrared vision devices in the already cramped cupola's interior. Also due to restraints in the cupola, smaller 50 round ammunition boxes were used. Development of its eventual replacement, the [[M60 Patton#M19 Commander's Cupola|T9/M19 cupola]] of the XM60 tank was continued into {{year|1958}} and some M19 cupolas were retro-fitted to M48A5s to allow for the use of IR and daylight periscopes by the commander.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|pages=109{{ndash}}111}}\n\n===M48===\nChrysler began building the new [[Newark Assembly|Newark Tank Plant]] in Newark, Delaware in 1951 to produce the M48 while Chrysler Defense Engineering and ARCOVE continued advanced production engineering (APE) to evolve the design using the T48 prototypes at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. In May 1952 Chrysler came to an agreement to take control on a Government Owned and Contractor Operated (GOCO) basis of the Newark Tank plant production facility with the US Government and to continue production design refinement of the T48 at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. The first Chrysler production tank was unveiled on {{date|1952-07-01}} as the 90mm Gun Tank M48 and christened the M48 Patton by Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General [[George S Patton]].{{r|Christened}}\n \nTo meet the urgent need for tanks, production contracts were also awarded to [[General Motors]] [[Fisher Body]] Division and [[Ford Motor Company]] to produce the tank in Michigan starting in 1952. Also in July 1952 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company]] a $200 million contract to start producing the tank in 1953 at the Schenectady Tank Plant in New York.{{r|TankOrder}} All four companies were given initial production contracts in that same year for around 400 tanks each.\n\nThe M48 featured a gasoline-powered engine, different models were used depending on availability and manufacturer. Originally the M48(Mod A) was built at the Chrysler Defense using the Continental AV-1790-5B coupled to a General Motors CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission as used for the M47.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=317}} The M48(Mod B) used a Continental AV-1790-5C gasoline engine and either an Allison CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission. Most of these were built by the American Locomotive Company. Additionally a two-cylinder, gasoline, air-cooled engine (sometimes referred to as the \"Little Joe\" by tank crews) was provided to power a 28 volt, 300 ampere generator when the main engine was not needed. Fuel capacity was {{convert|200|gal|l|abbr=on}}  providing a cruising range of about {{convert|70|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly as were the previous M46 and M47 tanks.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} It had hydraulic shock absorbers mounted on the first, second and sixth roadwheel pairs (opposite of the M46 and M47). The bow mounted machine gun and its related crew station was eliminated thus providing more ammunition storage for the main gun. The driver's station was moved to the front center of the hull. The steering controls were redesigned. A large aircraft-styled steering wheel (replacing the wobble stick control of the M46 and M47) and placing the transmission range selector on the floor to the driver's right. Mod A hulls had a small oval overhead hatch for the driver. It incorporated a mechanism that dropped his three periscope heads to provide clearance for the hatch door as it swung to the right, and the driver then had to reposition the periscopes by hand once the hatch was closed again. The vehicle did not have an [[NBC protection]] system for the crew and a fording depth of approximately {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe M48's turret consisted of a redesigned flat gun shield and standard pop-up hatch for the commander's station. The M48 Mod A turret design had a smaller roof hatches for both the commander and loader. A .50 cal M2HB using a M1 remote control mount on a pedestal was available for the commander. When not in use, the machine gun mount could be stowed on a bracket welded to the turret roof in front of the loader. The M48's direct fire control system consisted of an M12/T41 stereoscopic rangefinder with a field of view of 5 degrees and magnification of x7.5, an azimuth indicator, an M20 gunner's periscope and a T13 superelevation actuator. Two main bearings are bolted to the mounting plate on the roof of the tank turret to support the range finder on steel radial ball bearings. A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.{{r|TM9718A|page=60|q=A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.}} A .30 caliber M1919E4 machine gun was coaxially mounted to the main gun's right and was operated by the gunner. An M12 full field optical range finder was used, the same as the M47. The tank was not fitted with any night fighting or computerized fire control systems.{{r|M47_PattonMania}} It used a Y-shaped muzzle brake on the barrel and carried 53 rounds. Eight ready rounds were stored in the left side of the turret bustle for the loader, the rest were stored inside safe containers in the hull. Tank crews complained that the Y-shaped fume extractor was found to be prone to snagging brush. It was replaced with a T-shaped model early in production.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nThese early M48 tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems. The M12 rangefinder was too fragile and often broke. Army Field Forces (AFF) found these tanks to be unsuitable for combat use in Europe and was regulated to limited use by US Army CONUS units until numerous shortcomings were corrected. Furthermore, some 120 hulls were found to have insufficient hull armor. These were denoted as the M48C and relegated to the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) for non-ballistic training use by the Armor School at [[Fort Knox]] to train crewmembers and maintenance personnel.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A1===\n[[File:Tensions_ran_high_at_Checkpoint_Charlie_in_1961_as_Easterners_fled_to_West,_Berlin_Wall_went_up.jpg|thumb|right|Two M48A1 face off against T-54's during one of several standoffs at Checkpoint Charlie in 1961]]\nThe Army concluded in January 1952 that the T42{{r|1952_Baldwin}} had failed as a tank capable of combat in Europe against Soviet tanks and reached the same conclusion in November 1953 for the M48 Mod A/B versions.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=32|q=The M48s width proved too wide for many European tunnels, complicating rail transport.}} The M48A1 focused on improving the engine and the vehicle's operational range and fixing numerous mechanical problems. To cope with the lack of range, an add-on modification allowed the use of 4 external jettisonable fuel drums {{convert|55|USgal|l|abbr=on}} of [[Avgas|MOGAS]] (motor gasoline) that was mounted to the rear deck, extending the range to {{convert|135|mi|km|abbr=on}}. This proved very unpopular with tank crews and operational range remained unsatisfactory.{{r|2016_Pike}} Further ARCOVE changes included a desire for the commander to observe and operate his weapons station while remaining under armor protection.{{r|2016_Pike}} At this same time the US Army Field Forces (USAAFF) declared the T42 medium tank unfit for production in November 1952, mainly due to serious shortcomings of its hull design. Ford's production of the M48 ended in August 1953 after a fire destroyed most of the Livonia Tank Plant.{{r|2020_Jackson}}\n\nTesting and feedback from ARCOVE had uncovered the fact that the original driver's hatch design of the M48(Mod A)/T48 pilots #1 and 2 tanks proved to be too small and made for an uncomfortable seating position for the driver when operating the tank with his hatch in the open position. To rectify this problem a new larger driver hatch was devised that was introduced into series production vehicle as early as possible.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Also the front vision block was removable and could be replaced with an infrared IR vision block. A redesigned power pack featured an AV-1790-7B gasoline engine and CD-850-4B transmission.{{r|2019_Conners}} The turret was fitted with the M1 cupola that enclosed the M2HB machine gun.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} In April 1953, the Army standardized this configuration as the 90mm Gun Tank M48A1 Patton.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBetween April 1952 and December 1954, nearly 7,000 M48s and M48A1s were produced, with production contracts for an additional 2,500 M48A1s to be built through 1956. Combat units immediately received 2,120 of these early tanks, but correction of defects discovered after production delayed the fielding of the remaining tanks.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=62{{ndash}}64}} The first production vehicles suffered from excessive oil consumption and engine failures after only {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The gasoline engine managed only {{convert|0.33|mpgus|km/L|abbr=on}}, limiting range to {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} miles. The M48's width proved too wide for many European tunnels, complicating rail transport.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=70{{ndash}}72}} Operational readiness rates of M48-equipped units tended to be low. The tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems, and the M12 stereoscopic rangefinder was uncomfortable to operate.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} However, the M48A1 was considered an even match for its Soviet counterpart, the T-54. {{As of|alt=On October 25, 1954|1954|10|25|post=,}} the Army decided to amend its designation of the M48 tank. Thereafter, the tanks with the original small driver's hatch and the Chrysler-designed M1 remote-control machine gun mount attached to the tank commander's cupola would remain the 90mm gun tank M48. However, all those tanks with the larger driver hatch and fitted with a new small turreted M1 cupola armed with a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun would be designated as the 90mm gun tank M48A1.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=41}} Many of these tanks were later upgraded to the A2 and A3 standards.\n\n===M48A2===\nThe concurrent testing of the T48 and production of the M48 was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2 as well as better quality control. Under the ARCOVE's \"single, efficient producer\" model, Defense Secretary [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] directed the Army to reduce the number of contractors producing each model of tank. In a new round of production bids for the M48A2, [[General Motors]] underbid Chrysler, and in September 1953 Army Secretary [[Robert T. Stevens]] awarded GM's [[Fisher Body]] division a $200 million contract to become the sole producer of the M48A2 and started production at its [[Grand Blanc Metal Center|Grand Blanc Tank Plant]] in Michigan in April 1953.{{r|underbid|q=WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 -- Robert T. Stevens, Secretary of the Army, announced today his decision to award to the Fisher body division of General Motors a contract of approximately $200,000,000 for the building of M-48 medium tanks.}} The decision raised skepticism among lawmakers. Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] noted the move would effectively leave GM as the only producer of light and medium tanks when the Chrysler production contract for M48 production was set to expire in April 1956.\n\nDuring the ARCOVE Questionmark III conference in June 1954 it was predicted that the Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and a compression ignition engine. In response to these findings an eventual replacement for the M48 was proposed, resulting in the T95 Tank Program. Months later Chrysler underbid GM in the new round of proposals. In September 1954 the Army awarded Chrysler an exclusive $160.6 million contract to restart production.{{r|Chrysler_underbids}} In November 1955 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company|Alco Products]] a $73 million contract to begin producing 600 M48A2s the next year at the Schenectady Tank Plant, New York.{{r|Alco}} However Alco opted to wrap up its tank business when its contract ended in July 1956. In May the Army awarded Chrysler, the only bidder, a $119 million contract to continue production of the M48A2 at the Delaware Tank Plant.{{r|1957_NYT}} In December 1953 Chrysler took on orders initially intended for the American Locomotive after the AlCo opted production cutbacks to its tank program and ceased further tank production by 1956.{{r|American Locomotive canceled}}\n\nThe engine deck was redesigned with two large louvered doors that replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This new rear hull arrangement on the M48A2 tank helped in cooling the engine and minimizing the infrared (heat) signature of the vehicle.{{r|1992_Crismon|page=73}} The suspension system was simplified. The track tensioner arm was eliminated, modifications to the idler arm, the addition of bumper springs and friction snubbers, and a relocation of the air cleaner assembly. The number of return rollers was reduced to 3 per side. With the more compact AVI-1790-8 engine, additional fuel tanks were installed in the engine compartment, increasing fuel capacity to 335 gallons.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Many older model M48s and M48A1s were rebuilt to this production configurations but retained their original 5 return rollers per side.{{r|1999_Decker|page=144}}\n\nThe M48A2C saw improvements for the turret. The M12 rangefinder was replaced with a full-field coincidence model. The M13 Fire Control included an improved turret control system M13 Fire Control System (FCS). The M13 FCS consists of the M5A2 ballistic drive and mechanical M13A3 gun data computer which integrated barrel temperature data{{r|1980_M60}} with an M17 coincidence range finder.{{r|2019_Conners}} The rangefinder is a [[Coincidence rangefinder|double image coincidence image instrument]] used as the ranging device of the gunner's primary direct sighting and fire control system. The gunner is provided with an M20 day periscope with a magnification of x8 and an M105D day telescopic sight with a magnification of x8 and a field of view of 7.5 degrees.{{r|1980_M60}} Range information from the rangefinder is fed into the ballistic computer through a shaft. The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A3===\n\nThe continued use of gasoline engines was undesirable due mainly to its high fuel consumption, poor low-end torque and fuel flammability. ARCOVE industrial representatives had expressed desires for a diesel engine for the tank since 1953.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} Continental Motors and OTAC began to develop an experimental X-shaped [[compression ignition]] engine in 1954 with [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 tank]] but it remained unreliable. In June 1955, OTAC adopted the recommendations and allowed a diesel engine to be used if it significantly contributed to better fuel economy.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=31}} By August 1956 the diesel powered AVDS-1790 was recommended for the M48 and the Army requested the initial retrofitting of approximately 1020 older M48A1s and A2s with the new engine in December.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nDuring the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a Soviet [[T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.{{r|2018_Beast}} After a brief examination of this tank's armor and [[D-10 tank gun|100&nbsp;mm gun]] by a British military attach\u00e9, the UK decided that their [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20 pounder]] (84mm L/66.7) was apparently incapable of defeating it. There were also rumors of an even larger [[U-5TS|115&nbsp;mm gun]] in the works.{{r|2010_Nordeen|page=137}} In response to this the US Army started [[M60 Patton#XM60 Development|development of the XM60]] to replace the M48 tank series and the development of a new main gun, the [[Royal Ordnance L7|105mm T254]].\n\nIn addition to the conversion of older model M48s, Chrysler continued to build new vehicles. New vehicles built to this standard used the M48A2 hull design (with 3 return rollers) and had redesigned fenders and mudguards, armored boxes around the taillights among other minor details. They were fitted with another re-designed commander's cupola, a modified M1E1. It had a modified hatch to allow more room in comparison to the previous M1 cupola and the two rear vision blocks were eliminated.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=87}} The driver's steering wheel was replaced with a T-bar control and received a padded seat.{{r|2019_Conners}} M48A3 hull production ended in May 1961. The Newark Tank plant was closed in October.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=103}}\n\nInstead of immediately getting a 105mm main gun, the M48A3 tanks were to retain their existing M41 90mm main guns for several reasons. First, funding shortfalls made it impossible to supply enough 105mm main gun rounds for all the planned converted tanks. Second, there were still large stockpiles of 90&nbsp;mm main gun rounds on hand. Third was its planned replacement, the [[M60 Patton]] was set to start production in 1959. This newest version of the M48 series received the designation Tank, Combat, Full-Tracked; 90mm Gun, M48A3 on 19 March 1958.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=29}}\n\nBy February 1960, the US Army had around 600 converted M48A3 Patton tanks and by 1964 the US Marine Corps had received 419.{{r|2015_Tencza}} The A3 model introduced the diesel engine, countering the earlier versions' characteristic of catching fire.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Because many M48A3 tanks were conversions from earlier models, many characteristics varied among individual examples of this type. M48A3 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier cupola styles.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\n===M48A5===\n[[File:US_M48A5_Patton.jpg|thumb|right|M48A5 Patton on display at [[National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey|Lawrenceville National Guard Museum]]]]\nThe last major US upgrade of the M48 tank series was the M48A5. This upgrade was applied to M48A2s and A3s still in service with Army National Guard units in order to maintain the training levels of Guard units as well as using a commonality in ammunition amongst tanks. The upgrade featured the mounting of the [[Royal Ordnance L7|M68 105mm gun]] carried in the M116 mount and the all-metric measurement M16 fire control system. The hull was upgraded with components from the [[M60 Tank|M60A1 RISE]] Hull PIP Update Kit and incorporated as many of the components as possible. Some of these included the retrofit of the AVDS-1790-2C RISE diesel engine incorporating TLAC engine panels coupled to with a CD-850-6 cross-drive transmission, a 300 gallon fuel capacity and the T142 track assembly, M13A1 NBC protection system for the crew and the replacement of the .30 caliber M37 coaxial machine gun with the .50 caliber [[M73 machine gun|M73E1]]/T175 machine gun.<ref>Rolf Hilmes, Main Battle Tanks: Developments in Design since 1945 (McLean, Va.: Pergamon-Brassey\u2019s International Defense Publishers, 1987), p. 11-18; Zaloga and Loop, Modern American Armor</ref> Because all M48A5 tanks were conversions from earlier models, many characteristics varied among individual examples of this type. M48A5 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier cupola styles. The conversion program ran from October 1975 to December 1979 with a total of 2,069 M48A3s converted to the A5 standard.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBased on Israeli experience in upgrading M48 series tanks, further changes were included starting in August 1976. These included replacing the M1 cupola with a low-profile \"Urdan\" type cupola that mounted an [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun for use by the tank commander. A second [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun was mounted on the turret roof for use by the loader. Internal ammunition stowage for the 105mm main gun was also increased to 54 rounds. These tanks were initially given the designation M48A5API; but, after early conversions were brought up to the later standard, the API was removed and these tanks were known simply as M48A5.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nIn addition to the conversion of M48A3 tanks, an additional conversion process for bringing M48A1 tanks to M48A5 standard was also developed. By March 1978, 708 M48A5 tanks had been converted from the M48A1 model.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nWork continued until December 1979, at which time 2069 M48A5's had been converted.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nThe vast majority of M48A5 tanks in service with US Army units were assigned to National Guard and Army Reserve Units. A notable exception was the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], who replaced their M60A1 tanks with M48A5's, which arrived in June and July 1978. On [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] M48A5 tanks the commander's [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] was replaced with a [[M2 Browning|.50 caliber M2 machine gun]].{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the M48s were phased out of U.S. service.

Each battalion consisted of approximately 57 tanks. M48s were also used by Armored Cavalry Squadrons in Vietnam until replaced by [[M551 Sheridan]] Armored Reconnaissance Airborne Assault Vehicles (ARAAV) in the Divisional Cavalry Squadrons. M48A3 tanks remained in service with the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] until the unit was withdrawn from the conflict. The M67A1 [[flame tank]] (nicknamed the [[Zippo]]) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} From 1965 to 1968, 120 US M48A3 tanks were written off.{{r|armor.kiev.ua}}\n\n[[File:Men of Troop B, Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Men of Troop B, 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, and their M48 Patton tank move through the dense jungle in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in June 1969.]]\nThe M48 Patton has the distinction of playing a unique role in an event that was destined to radically alter the conduct of armored warfare.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} When US forces commenced redeployment operations, many of the M48A3 Pattons were turned over to the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) forces, in particular creating the battalion-sized ARVN 20th Tank Regiment; which supplemented their [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] units. During the [[North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) [[Easter Offensive]] in 1972, tank clashes between NVA [[T-54]]/[[PT-76]] and ARVN M48/M41 units became commonplace. But, on {{date|1972-04-23}}, tankers of the 20th Tank Regiment were attacked by an NVA infantry-tank team, which was equipped with the new ''[[9M14 Malyutka|9M14M Malyutka]]'' (NATO designation: Sagger) wire-guided [[anti-tank missile]]. During this battle, one M48A3 Patton tank and one [[M113 armored personnel carrier#M113 armored cavalry assault vehicle (ACAV) variant|M113]] Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicle (ACAV) were destroyed, becoming the first losses to the Sagger missile; losses that would echo on an even larger scale a year later during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in the Middle East in 1973.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} By 2 May, 20th Tank Regiment had lost all of their tanks to enemy fire.{{r|1979_Starry|page=212}} During the first month of the [[First Battle of Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb]] all ARVN M48 Pattons were lost.{{efn|1=1st Armor Brigade lost 43 M48s and 66 M41s, 20th Tank Regiment lost 57 M48s}}{{r|1979_Ngo|page=52}}\n[[File:NARA 111-CCV-372-CC33992 25th Infantry Division M48A3 Patton moving through Viet Cong territory Operation Lincoln 1966.jpg|thumb|A 1st Battalion, 69th Armor Patton during [[Operation Lincoln (Vietnam)|Operation Lincoln]]]]\nThe M48s performed admirably{{r|1987_Nolan}} in Vietnam in the infantry-support role.

However, due to shortages of fuel and munitions faced by the South Vietnamese military because of the US Congress-placed ban on the further funding and supply of military equipment and logistics to the country, the American-made tanks soon ran out of ammunition and fuel and were quickly abandoned to the NVA, which then put them in their service after the war ended in May 1975. In total, 250 of the ARVN's M48A3s were destroyed and captured{{r|1976_NM|page=10}} and those captured (at least 30) were only used briefly before being phased out and turned into war-memorial displays all over Vietnam.[[File:M48A3 Detonates Mine Vietnam.jpg|thumb|A destroyed M48A3 during Vietnam war]]{{anchor|M48-land-mines}} M48s, along with Australian [[20 pounder|20 pounder (84mm)]]-gunned{{r|1979_Starry|page=113}} [[Centurion tank|Centurions]] of the [[1st Armoured Regiment (Australia)|1st Armoured Regiment]],{{r|1982_Dunstan}} were the only vehicles in use by the anti-communist side in the Vietnam War that could reasonably protect their crews from [[land mine]]s. They were often used for minesweeping operations along Highway 19 in the Central Highlands, a two-lane paved road between [[An Khe]] and [[Pleiku]]. Daily convoys moved both ways along Highway 19. These convoys were held up each morning while the road was swept for mines. At that time, minesweeping was done by soldiers walking slowly over the dirt shoulders of the highway with hand-held mine detectors. During this slow process, convoys would build up into a dangerously-inviting target for the enemy, especially their guerillas and partisans. As a result, a faster method was improvised, the ''\"Thunder Run\"'', in which one M48 lined up on each side of the road, with one track on the dirt shoulder and the other track on the asphalt, and then with all guns firing,{{r|1979_Starry|page=80}} they raced to a designated position miles away. If the M48s made it without striking a mine, the road was clear and the convoys could proceed. In most cases, an M48 that struck a land mine in these operations only lost a road wheel or two in the explosion; seldom was there any hull damage that would be considered a [[catastrophic kill]].{{r|1979_Starry}}\n\nSupply of M48A3 tanks to South Vietnam:\n\n* 1971: 54.{{r|2015_Hatcher}}\n* May 1972: 120.{{r|2005_Mo\u00efse|page=135}}\n* October 1972: 72.{{r|2005_Mo\u00efse|page=135}}\n* November 1972: 59.{{r|1979_Starry|page=218}}\n* January 1973 - July 1974: 16.<ref>Better Management of Secondary Items by the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces Would Reduce U.S. Investment; Department of Defense: Report to the Congress by the Comptroller General of the United States.

During [[Operation Grand Slam]], Pakistani tank forces, composed mainly of M47 and M48 Patton tanks, thrust through the Indian defence-lines very quickly and swiftly defeated back Indian Army armoured counter-attacks. The Pakistanis used approximately a division's worth of tanks in the operation, although not all were Pattons, with upgraded Shermans included as well. In contrast, Pakistan's Patton tank failed to live up to its high expectations in the [[Battle of Asal Uttar]] in September 1965, where about 97 Pakistani tanks were lost, the majority of them being Pattons (M47s and M48s). Later, the Patton tank was the main Pakistani tank at the [[Battle of Chawinda]] and its performance at that battle was deemed satisfactory against Indian armour.\n\nThe Patton was later used by Pakistan again, this time, in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. A counter-attack led by the 13th Lancers and the 31st Cavalry army units was defeated by the Indian 54th Division around [[Battle of Barapind]] in December 1971. The Pakistan Army Patton tanks could not stop an assault by Indian T-55 Soviet-supplied tanks of the 2th Armored Brigade.{{r|strategic_affairs}} At least 9 of the Pattons were destroyed by T-55 tanks during the battle of Nainakot.{{r|1995_Chakravorty|page=342}} It total, more than 80 Pakistani Pattons were knocked out during battle, mainly by Centurion and T-55 fire.{{r|strategic_affairs}}\n\nIndia later set up a temporary war-memorial so named \"''Patton Nagar''\" (or \"Patton City\") in [[Khemkaran]] District in Punjab, where the captured Pakistani Patton tanks were displayed for a short period of time before being scrapped or sent all across India for use as war monuments and military memorials.\n\nAnalysing their overall performance in their wars with India, the Pakistani military held that the Patton was held in reasonably-high esteem by both sides and that combat-tactics were to blame for their utter defeat and the following debacle at Asal Uttar.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} However, a post-war US study of the tank battles in South Asia concluded that the Patton's armor could, in fact, be penetrated by the [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20-pounder tank gun]] (84&nbsp;mm) of the Centurion (later replaced by the even-more successful L7 105mm gun on the Mk. 7 version which India also possessed) as well as the 75&nbsp;mm tank gun of the [[AMX-13]] light tank.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Middle East===\n[[File:Israeli M48 tank captured by Egypt.jpg|thumb|An ex-Israeli M48 Patton tank captured by Egypt during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973.]]\nM48s were also used with mixed results during the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967.

However, on the [[West Bank]] war-front, [[Jordan]]ian M48s (Jordan was also a user of the M48 Patton as was Israel at the same time-period) were often defeated by Israeli 105mm-armed Centurions and WWII-era upgraded M4 Shermans ([[Super Sherman|M-51s]] upgunned with French-built 105&nbsp;mm tank guns (not to be confused with the British L7 105mm tank gun)). In purely-technical terms, the Pattons were far superior to the much-older Shermans, with shots at more than 1,000 meters simply glancing off the M48's armor. However, the 105&nbsp;mm main gun of the Israeli Shermans fired a [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|HEAT]] round designed to defeat the Soviet [[T-62|T-62 tank]], which was the USSR's response to the M48's successor in US service, the [[M60 Patton]]. The Jordanian Pattons' general failure on the West Bank could also be attributed to excellent Israeli [[air superiority]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The Israeli Army captured about 100 Jordanian M48 and M48A1 tanks and pressed them into service in their own units after the war, as the same as were the Jordanian M113 APCs they seized during the war.\n\nIsrael used 445 M48 tanks in 1973 during the [[Yom Kippur War]].{{r|2010_Nordeen|page=20}} From 15 to 18 October, M48 tanks participated in the largest{{r|2011_Zaloga|page=34}} tank battle of the war - [[Battle of the Chinese Farm]].

Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General George S Patton christened it as a Patton. It was designed as a replacement for the [[M26 Pershing]], [[M4 Sherman]] variants and [[M46 Patton]]s used in the [[Korean War]], and as the successor to the [[M47 Patton]].{{r|1991_Terry|page=5}} Nearly 12,000 M48s were built, mainly by [[Chrysler]] and [[American Locomotive Company]], from 1952 to 1961. The M48 underwent many design modifications and improvements during its production life. This led to a wide variety of suspension systems, [[Gun turret#Cupola|cupola styles]], power packs, fenders and other details among individual tanks. The early designs, up to the M48A2C, were powered by a gasoline engine. The M48A3 and A5 versions used a diesel engine, however gasoline engine versions were still in use in the US Army National Guard through 1968 and through 1975 by many West German Army units. Numerous examples of the M48 saw combat use in [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|various Arab\u2013Israeli conflicts]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Beginning in 1959, most American M48A1s and A2s were upgraded to the M48A3 model.\n\nThe M48 Patton-series saw widespread service with the United States and NATO until it was superseded by the M60 tank as well as being widely exported. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles and bridge layers. Some M48A5 models served into the mid-1980s with US Army National Guard units, and were used as targets for weapons and radar testing into the mid-1990s. Many M48s remain in service in other countries though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield. The [[Turkish Army]] has the largest number of modernized M48 MBTs, with more than 1,400 in its inventory. Of these, around 1,000 have been phased out, placed in storage, or modified as [[armoured recovery vehicle]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vietnam. Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M-48 tank. - NARA - 532441.tif|thumb|Marines of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, riding on an M48A3 tank, Vietnam, 1966]]\nAfter the conclusion of [[World War II]], the United States [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|Ordance Tank-Automotive Command]] (OTAC) drastically slowed or canceled many tank development and design programs. On {{date|1950-11-07}}, the Ordnance Technical Committee mandated a change in the nomenclature for tanks in the US Military.{{r|1991_Terry|page=2}} It was decided that weight designations (Light, Medium, Heavy) were no longer applicable due to changes in the way tanks were developed and employed on the battlefield, and the varying calibers of main guns now available. Thus the caliber of the gun replaced its weight designation. For example, the M103 Heavy Tank was redesignated as the [[M103 (heavy tank)|120mm Gun Tank M103]] and the Light Tank M41 Walker Bulldog as the [[M41 Walker Bulldog|76mm Gun Tank M41 Walker Bulldog]].{{r|2014_DavidB}} The M47 Patton entered production in 1951 and was used by the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the [[Korean War]]. This forced the US to field older tank models, such as the [[M26 Pershing]] and [[M46 Patton]]. In response, the Army launched several design projects for a replacement of the M46 and M26. The United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the Korean War, when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to its quantity production.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=31|q=Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure the speedy fielding of new tanks. Such rapid production guaranteed teething troubles, but the importance attached to rapidly equipping combat unirs with the new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.}} Notable among these were the [[T42 medium tank|T42]], [[T69 (tank)|T69]] and T48 projects as well as continuing to pursue further improvements to the M47. General [[Bruce C. Clarke]] stated \"We know exactly what we want. We want a fast, highly mobile, fully armored, lightweight vehicle. It must be able to swim, cross any terrain, and climb 30 degree hills. It must be air-transportable. It must have a simple but powerful engine, requiring little or no maintenance. The operating range should be several hundred miles. We would also like it to be invisible\".{{r|1960_Clarke|page=11}}\n\n===T48 Project===\nThe T48 was to focus on improving the turret design and a more powerful engine. 1/4 and 1/8 scale [[mockup]]s of the turret were constructed during May 1950. The design study was accepted by the Army in December the same year and a contract for the design and manufacture of a 90mm armed tank, the T48 was given to the Chrysler Corporation. Six prototypes were built, the first by December 1951.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=11}} The hull was redesigned, moving the driver's station to the front center and the bow-mounted machine gun and its associated crew station were removed and converted to safe container storage for additional main gun ammunition.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}  The front glacis was redesigned into a slope and offered much better ballistic protection than former welded and rather flat designs.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} The driver steered the vehicle using an aircraft styled steering wheel. Initially the power pack consisted of the Continental AV-1790-5B gasoline engine producing 704 brake horsepower coupled to an Allison CD-850-4A cross-drive transmission with 2 forward and 1 reverse ranges. The hull armor was increased to {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} on the front glacis of rolled homogeneous steel. It had six roadwheel pairs per side and five return rollers, a torsion bar suspension system, using the T97E2 steel track assembly.\n\nA new hemispherically shaped turret was implemented for the T48. This was to eliminate the noted shot traps in the M47's turret design and also lowered the vehicle's height in comparison to the M46 and M47. It was armed with the T139 90&nbsp;mm main gun with a cylindrical blast deflector on the barrel.{{r|2020_Alex}} The full image stereoscopic T46E1/M12 rangefinder was placed in the central section of the turret.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nOn {{date|1951-02-27}}, shortly after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], the Ordnance Technical Committee Minutes (OTCM) #33791 initiated the simultaneous production and design refinement of the new tank, designating it the 90mm Gun Tank M48.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=85,152}} The Army planned to produce some 9,000 M48s within three years of development. Such rapid, mass production would close the imbalance between Soviet and American tank forces. Meeting this goal, however, required production simultaneous with operational testing and development. Chrysler Corporation became the principal producer of the tank. Expected production and teething troubles led to the creation of integrating committees to coordinate tank and component development. These Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committees included military and industrial representatives who provided early warning of defects and recommended remedies.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}22}} Testing trials of the T48 tanks began in February 1952 and continued until the end of 1955. However the perceived immediate threat of Soviet aggression in Western Europe and the ongoing Korean War impelled Army senior leadership to rush the T48 tank into series production before the inevitable bugs could be worked out of the new tank design. Instead, it was decided that any needed design changes uncovered by the continued testing and evaluation of the T48 tanks at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal Test Center would be incorporated into the M48 series production vehicles as quickly as possible.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=21{{ndash}}27}}\n\n===Components===\n\n====Armor====\nIn conjunction with the development of the T48 project there was some discussion regarding armor. The weight of conventional armored steel needed to provide protection against the emerging large-calibered high-velocity main guns and improved APDS kinetic energy penetrators was making its continued use impractical. Composite [[applique armour|applique armor panels]] made with fused silica glass was envisioned to be fitted to the hull. It was also desired that a turret be constructed using this special armor.{{r|1958_Salter}} The [[United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command|OTAC]] and [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]] began development of the armor in November 1952 at [[Fort Belvoir]] VA as Project TT2-782/51.{{r|1958_Salter}} This composite armor provides protection against HEAT, HEP, and HE rounds. Its overall slow development kept it from being used on the T48 and was dropped from consideration in the M48 by 1953, however its development was continued with the [[T95 Medium Tank]] until 1958.\n\nThere were two different hulls used for the M48 series. The M48 hull had a wedge-shaped front glacis compared to the M46's rather flat design. Early Mod A hulls had smaller diameter turret and driver's hatches. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. The engine exhaust vents were located on the top of the rear deck. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly. The drive sprocket was located at the rear of the hull. Shock absorbers were mounted at the first two and last roadwheel arms. This hull design was manufactured for the original M48 and M48A1 versions of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe M48A2 hull design saw several modifications including a reduction from five to three return rollers per side. The suspension system was simplified, a more compact [[Powerpack (drivetrain)|powerpack]] and additional fuel cells, with large louvered grill access doors replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This hull was used on newly constructed M48A2 and M48A3 tanks of the M48 series.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nThe turret used for the M48 series was hemispherical in shape and was made from cast homogeneous steel. It had a flat gun shield and a standard pop-up styled hatch for the commander and an additional hatch for the loader's station. Early production models of the turret had somewhat smaller diameter hatches. The gunner was provided with an M37 .30 cal machine gun with 5,900 rounds of ammunition.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\n====Rangefinders and Fire Control Systems====\nDuring WWII and the Korean War, most tanks used a direct sighting system where the gun sights and rangefinders were slaved directly to the gun's barrel but its long range accuracy depended upon the focusing abilities of the individual gunner. There are two basic types of optical [[rangefinders]], stereoscopic and coincidence. With a [[stereoscopic rangefinder|stereoscopic model]] range determination occurred by measuring the distance from the observer to a target using the observer's capability of [[binocular vision]]. The [[coincidence rangefinder]] uses a single eyepiece. Light from the target enters the rangefinder through two windows located at either end of the instrument. The ARCOVE emphasis upon increased long range accuracy led to the incorporation of a fire control system (FCS) in the M48. The fire control system included a rangefinder, mechanical ballistic computer, ballistic drive, and gunner's sight. Collectively, these mechanical devices resembled in miniature the fire control systems used in [[naval gunnery]]. Only after the Second World War did such systems become small enough for use in combat vehicles. These mechanical fire control systems permitted tanks to engage effectively at much longer ranges than in [[World War II]], a critical consideration for the Army, expecting to enter the European battlefield outnumbered. Instead of a gunner's sight being slaved to the gun tube, the ballistic computer and drive computed the range and elevated the gun. The gunner's primary responsibility lay in keeping the sight on the target. The mechanical ballistic computer made a more accurate computation of range possible by mathematically accounting for such factors as vehicle cant and ammunition type.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=1{{ndash}}2}} Many developmental range finders based on pulses of IR light, such as the Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) rangefinder of the [[T95 Medium Tank|T95]] continued into 1957.{{r|1991_Ogorkiewicz|page=174|q=The first major attempt to use an electro-optical rangefinder was represented by the T53 Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) system, which was tested on the US T95 tank between 1955 and 1957}}\n\n====Autoloader systems====\nAnother requirement of the T48 project was to explore the use of [[autoloader]]s for the main gun as they became available. Preliminary experiments with a loading system using the T48 turret were unsuccessful due to the limited space and the need to line up the breach with the loading system after each firing. It also was dropped from consideration for use on the M48 but was further developed on the T69 tank as the 90&nbsp;mm T178 gun. It was fitted with an eight-round auto-loader system mounted in an oscillating turret.\n\n====90 mm Main Gun====\nARCOVE also involved the Ordnance Department with the goal of improving the 90&nbsp;mm gun and its ammunition. The Army expected difficulties in engagements with the Soviet [[IS tank family#Object 703 IS-3|IS-3 heavy tank]], since the M47's M39 90&nbsp;mm rifled main gun could not consistently penetrate its frontal armor, even with special armor-piercing capped (APC) or HEAT ammunition.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} Work was performed to address this by developing the improved T300E53 HEAT ammunition and the T137 series of Hypervelocity Armor-Piercing Discarding-Sabot (HVAP-DS or simply APDS) ammunition. The T139 allowed for easier barrel changing and weighed less than the preceding M36/T119 gun. The new APDS round could penetrate {{convert|11.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of homogeneous steel armor, angled at 30 degrees, at a distance of {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, but was not accepted for service.{{r|1954_Conference|page=12}} The T139 was later standardized as the 90mm Gun M41.\n\n====Turret Cupolas====\nThe T48 tank featured a remote controllable machine gun mount as the tank commander's weapon on a pedestal, which allowed him to fire the .50 caliber (12.7mm) M2HB machine gun from within the vehicle's turret. It used a 100-round ammunition box and could also be employed manually by the commander. However, servicing and reloading of the weapon required the tank commander to open his roof hatch and expose his head and upper torso. This remote controllable mount was designated as the .50 Caliber Machine Gun Mount, M1 and designed by Chrysler Defense Engineering.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} By October 1954, the Army decided to amend the design of the tank by installing a cupola. During the production of M48s it was modified several times resulting in a wide mix of cupola styles among individual tanks. Afterwards it was renamed as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun, M1.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=23}} The new tank commander cupola would allow the tank commander to aim and fire his weapon while remaining under armor protection via a remote controlled M2HB machine gun, however the commander had to open the cupola hatch and expose his head to reload or service the machine gun due to the limited headroom.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} These cupolas had a small rearward opening hatch and a single, non-removable vision block. They were designed by [[AAI Corporation|Aircraft Armaments Incorporated]]. Because of its smaller turret roof hatch opening those M1 cupolas retro-fitted to early production M48 tanks used an adaptor ring.\n\nThe M1E1 cupola design used a G305 cupola riser with 9 non-removable vision blocks installed (some versions had 7 with the 2 rear blocks deleted) between the turret roof and the cupola. It also came with a new bulged hatch cover to provide the tank commander with more headroom and allowed him to reload the weapon while remaining under armor protection. A major drawback of both these cupolas was their inability to mount either daylight or infrared vision devices in the already cramped cupola's interior. Also due to restraints in the cupola, smaller 50 round ammunition boxes were used. Development of its eventual replacement, the [[M60 Patton#M19 Commander's Cupola|T9/M19 cupola]] of the XM60 tank was continued into {{year|1958}} and some M19 cupolas were retro-fitted to M48A5s to allow for the use of IR and daylight periscopes by the commander.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|pages=109{{ndash}}111}}\n\n===M48===\nChrysler began building the new [[Newark Assembly|Newark Tank Plant]] in Newark, Delaware in 1951 to produce the M48 while Chrysler Defense Engineering and ARCOVE continued advanced production engineering (APE) to evolve the design using the T48 prototypes at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. In May 1952 Chrysler came to an agreement to take control on a Government Owned and Contractor Operated (GOCO) basis of the Newark Tank plant production facility with the US Government and to continue production design refinement of the T48 at the OTAC Detroit Arsenal. The first Chrysler production tank was unveiled on {{date|1952-07-01}} as the 90mm Gun Tank M48 and christened the M48 Patton by Mrs. Beatrice Ayer Patton, wife of the late General [[George S Patton]].{{r|Christened}}\n \nTo meet the urgent need for tanks, production contracts were also awarded to [[General Motors]] [[Fisher Body]] Division and [[Ford Motor Company]] to produce the tank in Michigan starting in 1952. Also in July 1952 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company]] a $200 million contract to start producing the tank in 1953 at the Schenectady Tank Plant in New York.{{r|TankOrder}} All four companies were given initial production contracts in that same year for around 400 tanks each.\n\nThe M48 featured a gasoline-powered engine, different models were used depending on availability and manufacturer. Originally the M48(Mod A) was built at the Chrysler Defense using the Continental AV-1790-5B coupled to a General Motors CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission as used for the M47.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=317}} The M48(Mod B) used a Continental AV-1790-5C gasoline engine and either an Allison CD-850-4A or 4B cross-drive transmission. Most of these were built by the American Locomotive Company. Additionally a two-cylinder, gasoline, air-cooled engine (sometimes referred to as the \"Little Joe\" by tank crews) was provided to power a 28 volt, 300 ampere generator when the main engine was not needed. Fuel capacity was {{convert|200|gal|l|abbr=on}}  providing a cruising range of about {{convert|70|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The suspension consisted of six roadwheel pairs with a torsion bar suspension system and five return rollers. There was a dual compensating idler arm at the front, and dual auxiliary track tension wheels behind the last road wheels, using the T97E2 track assembly as were the previous M46 and M47 tanks.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} It had hydraulic shock absorbers mounted on the first, second and sixth roadwheel pairs (opposite of the M46 and M47). The bow mounted machine gun and its related crew station was eliminated thus providing more ammunition storage for the main gun. The driver's station was moved to the front center of the hull. The steering controls were redesigned. A large aircraft-styled steering wheel (replacing the wobble stick control of the M46 and M47) and placing the transmission range selector on the floor to the driver's right. Mod A hulls had a small oval overhead hatch for the driver. It incorporated a mechanism that dropped his three periscope heads to provide clearance for the hatch door as it swung to the right, and the driver then had to reposition the periscopes by hand once the hatch was closed again. The vehicle did not have an [[NBC protection]] system for the crew and a fording depth of approximately {{convert|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe M48's turret consisted of a redesigned flat gun shield and standard pop-up hatch for the commander's station. The M48 Mod A turret design had a smaller roof hatches for both the commander and loader. A .50 cal M2HB using a M1 remote control mount on a pedestal was available for the commander. When not in use, the machine gun mount could be stowed on a bracket welded to the turret roof in front of the loader. The M48's direct fire control system consisted of an M12/T41 stereoscopic rangefinder with a field of view of 5 degrees and magnification of x7.5, an azimuth indicator, an M20 gunner's periscope and a T13 superelevation actuator. Two main bearings are bolted to the mounting plate on the roof of the tank turret to support the range finder on steel radial ball bearings. A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.{{r|TM9718A|page=60|q=A parallel gun linkage between the gun trunnion and the range finder assures that the line of sight of the range finder reproduces the exact motion of the gun in elevation.}} A .30 caliber M1919E4 machine gun was coaxially mounted to the main gun's right and was operated by the gunner. An M12 full field optical range finder was used, the same as the M47. The tank was not fitted with any night fighting or computerized fire control systems.{{r|M47_PattonMania}} It used a Y-shaped muzzle brake on the barrel and carried 53 rounds. Eight ready rounds were stored in the left side of the turret bustle for the loader, the rest were stored inside safe containers in the hull. Tank crews complained that the Y-shaped fume extractor was found to be prone to snagging brush. It was replaced with a T-shaped model early in production.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}}\n\nThese early M48 tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems. The M12 rangefinder was too fragile and often broke. Army Field Forces (AFF) found these tanks to be unsuitable for combat use in Europe and was regulated to limited use by US Army CONUS units until numerous shortcomings were corrected. Furthermore, some 120 hulls were found to have insufficient hull armor. These were denoted as the M48C and relegated to the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) for non-ballistic training use by the Armor School at [[Fort Knox]] to train crewmembers and maintenance personnel.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A1===\n[[File:Tensions_ran_high_at_Checkpoint_Charlie_in_1961_as_Easterners_fled_to_West,_Berlin_Wall_went_up.jpg|thumb|right|Two M48A1 face off against T-54's during one of several standoffs at Checkpoint Charlie in 1961]]\nThe Army concluded in January 1952 that the T42{{r|1952_Baldwin}} had failed as a tank capable of combat in Europe against Soviet tanks and reached the same conclusion in November 1953 for the M48 Mod A/B versions.{{r|1998_Cameron|page=32|q=The M48s width proved too wide for many European tunnels, complicating rail transport.}} The M48A1 focused on improving the engine and the vehicle's operational range and fixing numerous mechanical problems. To cope with the lack of range, an add-on modification allowed the use of 4 external jettisonable fuel drums {{convert|55|USgal|l|abbr=on}} of [[Avgas|MOGAS]] (motor gasoline) that was mounted to the rear deck, extending the range to {{convert|135|mi|km|abbr=on}}. This proved very unpopular with tank crews and operational range remained unsatisfactory.{{r|2016_Pike}} Further ARCOVE changes included a desire for the commander to observe and operate his weapons station while remaining under armor protection.{{r|2016_Pike}} At this same time the US Army Field Forces (USAAFF) declared the T42 medium tank unfit for production in November 1952, mainly due to serious shortcomings of its hull design. Ford's production of the M48 ended in August 1953 after a fire destroyed most of the Livonia Tank Plant.{{r|2020_Jackson}}\n\nTesting and feedback from ARCOVE had uncovered the fact that the original driver's hatch design of the M48(Mod A)/T48 pilots #1 and 2 tanks proved to be too small and made for an uncomfortable seating position for the driver when operating the tank with his hatch in the open position. To rectify this problem a new larger driver hatch was devised that was introduced into series production vehicle as early as possible.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Also the front vision block was removable and could be replaced with an infrared IR vision block. A redesigned power pack featured an AV-1790-7B gasoline engine and CD-850-4B transmission.{{r|2019_Conners}} The turret was fitted with the M1 cupola that enclosed the M2HB machine gun.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} In April 1953, the Army standardized this configuration as the 90mm Gun Tank M48A1 Patton.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBetween April 1952 and December 1954, nearly 7,000 M48s and M48A1s were produced, with production contracts for an additional 2,500 M48A1s to be built through 1956. Combat units immediately received 2,120 of these early tanks, but correction of defects discovered after production delayed the fielding of the remaining tanks.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=62{{ndash}}64}} The first production vehicles suffered from excessive oil consumption and engine failures after only {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The gasoline engine managed only {{convert|0.33|mpgus|km/L|abbr=on}}, limiting range to {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}} miles. The M48's width proved too wide for many European tunnels, complicating rail transport.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=70{{ndash}}72}} Operational readiness rates of M48-equipped units tended to be low. The tanks suffered from engine, transmission, track, and suspension problems, and the M12 stereoscopic rangefinder was uncomfortable to operate.{{r|1971_Icks|pages=22{{ndash}}23}} However, the M48A1 was considered an even match for its Soviet counterpart, the T-54. {{As of|alt=On October 25, 1954|1954|10|25|post=,}} the Army decided to amend its designation of the M48 tank. Thereafter, the tanks with the original small driver's hatch and the Chrysler-designed M1 remote-control machine gun mount attached to the tank commander's cupola would remain the 90mm gun tank M48. However, all those tanks with the larger driver hatch and fitted with a new small turreted M1 cupola armed with a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun would be designated as the 90mm gun tank M48A1.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=41}} Many of these tanks were later upgraded to the A2 and A3 standards.\n\n===M48A2===\nThe concurrent testing of the T48 and production of the M48 was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2 as well as better quality control. Under the ARCOVE's \"single, efficient producer\" model, Defense Secretary [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] directed the Army to reduce the number of contractors producing each model of tank. In a new round of production bids for the M48A2, [[General Motors]] underbid Chrysler, and in September 1953 Army Secretary [[Robert T. Stevens]] awarded GM's [[Fisher Body]] division a $200 million contract to become the sole producer of the M48A2 and started production at its [[Grand Blanc Metal Center|Grand Blanc Tank Plant]] in Michigan in April 1953.{{r|underbid|q=WASHINGTON, Sept. 11 -- Robert T. Stevens, Secretary of the Army, announced today his decision to award to the Fisher body division of General Motors a contract of approximately $200,000,000 for the building of M-48 medium tanks.}} The decision raised skepticism among lawmakers. Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] noted the move would effectively leave GM as the only producer of light and medium tanks when the Chrysler production contract for M48 production was set to expire in April 1956.\n\nDuring the ARCOVE Questionmark III conference in June 1954 it was predicted that the Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and a compression ignition engine. In response to these findings an eventual replacement for the M48 was proposed, resulting in the T95 Tank Program. Months later Chrysler underbid GM in the new round of proposals. In September 1954 the Army awarded Chrysler an exclusive $160.6 million contract to restart production.{{r|Chrysler_underbids}} In November 1955 the Army awarded [[American Locomotive Company|Alco Products]] a $73 million contract to begin producing 600 M48A2s the next year at the Schenectady Tank Plant, New York.{{r|Alco}} However Alco opted to wrap up its tank business when its contract ended in July 1956. In May the Army awarded Chrysler, the only bidder, a $119 million contract to continue production of the M48A2 at the Delaware Tank Plant.{{r|1957_NYT}} In December 1953 Chrysler took on orders initially intended for the American Locomotive after the AlCo opted production cutbacks to its tank program and ceased further tank production by 1956.{{r|American Locomotive canceled}}\n\nThe engine deck was redesigned with two large louvered doors that replaced the complicated grill work of the rear engine decks of the M48/M48A1 hull designs. This new rear hull arrangement on the M48A2 tank helped in cooling the engine and minimizing the infrared (heat) signature of the vehicle.{{r|1992_Crismon|page=73}} The suspension system was simplified. The track tensioner arm was eliminated, modifications to the idler arm, the addition of bumper springs and friction snubbers, and a relocation of the air cleaner assembly. The number of return rollers was reduced to 3 per side. With the more compact AVI-1790-8 engine, additional fuel tanks were installed in the engine compartment, increasing fuel capacity to 335 gallons.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Many older model M48s and M48A1s were rebuilt to this production configurations but retained their original 5 return rollers per side.{{r|1999_Decker|page=144}}\n\nThe M48A2C saw improvements for the turret. The M12 rangefinder was replaced with a full-field coincidence model. The M13 Fire Control included an improved turret control system M13 Fire Control System (FCS). The M13 FCS consists of the M5A2 ballistic drive and mechanical M13A3 gun data computer which integrated barrel temperature data{{r|1980_M60}} with an M17 coincidence range finder.{{r|2019_Conners}} The rangefinder is a [[Coincidence rangefinder|double image coincidence image instrument]] used as the ranging device of the gunner's primary direct sighting and fire control system. The gunner is provided with an M20 day periscope with a magnification of x8 and an M105D day telescopic sight with a magnification of x8 and a field of view of 7.5 degrees.{{r|1980_M60}} Range information from the rangefinder is fed into the ballistic computer through a shaft. The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.{{r|1971_Icks|page=25}}\n\n===M48A3===\n\nThe continued use of gasoline engines was undesirable due mainly to its high fuel consumption, poor low-end torque and fuel flammability. ARCOVE industrial representatives had expressed desires for a diesel engine for the tank since 1953.{{r|2014_DavidB_02}} Continental Motors and OTAC began to develop an experimental X-shaped [[compression ignition]] engine in 1954 with [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 tank]] but it remained unreliable. In June 1955, OTAC adopted the recommendations and allowed a diesel engine to be used if it significantly contributed to better fuel economy.{{r|1987_Hilmes|page=31}} By August 1956 the diesel powered AVDS-1790 was recommended for the M48 and the Army requested the initial retrofitting of approximately 1020 older M48A1s and A2s with the new engine in December.{{r|2019_Conners}}\n\nDuring the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a Soviet [[T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.{{r|2018_Beast}} After a brief examination of this tank's armor and [[D-10 tank gun|100&nbsp;mm gun]] by a British military attach\u00e9, the UK decided that their [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20 pounder]] (84mm L/66.7) was apparently incapable of defeating it. There were also rumors of an even larger [[U-5TS|115&nbsp;mm gun]] in the works.{{r|2010_Nordeen|page=137}} In response to this the US Army started [[M60 Patton#XM60 Development|development of the XM60]] to replace the M48 tank series and the development of a new main gun, the [[Royal Ordnance L7|105mm T254]].\n\nIn addition to the conversion of older model M48s, Chrysler continued to build new vehicles. New vehicles built to this standard used the M48A2 hull design (with 3 return rollers) and had redesigned fenders and mudguards, armored boxes around the taillights among other minor details. They were fitted with another re-designed commander's cupola, a modified M1E1. It had a modified hatch to allow more room in comparison to the previous M1 cupola and the two rear vision blocks were eliminated.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=87}} The driver's steering wheel was replaced with a T-bar control and received a padded seat.{{r|2019_Conners}} M48A3 hull production ended in May 1961. The Newark Tank plant was closed in October.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt|page=103}}\n\nInstead of immediately getting a 105mm main gun, the M48A3 tanks were to retain their existing M41 90mm main guns for several reasons. First, funding shortfalls made it impossible to supply enough 105mm main gun rounds for all the planned converted tanks. Second, there were still large stockpiles of 90&nbsp;mm main gun rounds on hand. Third was its planned replacement, the [[M60 Patton]] was set to start production in 1959. This newest version of the M48 series received the designation Tank, Combat, Full-Tracked; 90mm Gun, M48A3 on 19 March 1958.{{r|1991_Terry|pages=29}}\n\nBy February 1960, the US Army had around 600 converted M48A3 Patton tanks and by 1964 the US Marine Corps had received 419.{{r|2015_Tencza}} The A3 model introduced the diesel engine, countering the earlier versions' characteristic of catching fire.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}} Because many M48A3 tanks were conversions from earlier models, many characteristics varied among individual examples of this type. M48A3 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier cupola styles.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\n===M48A5===\n[[File:US_M48A5_Patton.jpg|thumb|right|M48A5 Patton on display at [[National Guard Militia Museum of New Jersey|Lawrenceville National Guard Museum]]]]\nThe last major US upgrade of the M48 tank series was the M48A5. This upgrade was applied to M48A2s and A3s still in service with Army National Guard units in order to maintain the training levels of Guard units as well as using a commonality in ammunition amongst tanks. The upgrade featured the mounting of the [[Royal Ordnance L7|M68 105mm gun]] carried in the M116 mount and the all-metric measurement M16 fire control system. The hull was upgraded with components from the [[M60 Tank|M60A1 RISE]] Hull PIP Update Kit and incorporated as many of the components as possible. Some of these included the retrofit of the AVDS-1790-2C RISE diesel engine incorporating TLAC engine panels coupled to with a CD-850-6 cross-drive transmission, a 300 gallon fuel capacity and the T142 track assembly, M13A1 NBC protection system for the crew and the replacement of the .30 caliber M37 coaxial machine gun with the .50 caliber [[M73 machine gun|M73E1]]/T175 machine gun.<ref>Rolf Hilmes, Main Battle Tanks: Developments in Design since 1945 (McLean, Va.: Pergamon-Brassey\u2019s International Defense Publishers, 1987), p. 11-18; Zaloga and Loop, Modern American Armor</ref> Because all M48A5 tanks were conversions from earlier models, many characteristics varied among individual examples of this type. M48A5 tanks could have either three or five support rollers on each side and might have either the early or later type headlight assemblies, some retained their earlier cupola styles. The conversion program ran from October 1975 to December 1979 with a total of 2,069 M48A3s converted to the A5 standard.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBased on Israeli experience in upgrading M48 series tanks, further changes were included starting in August 1976. These included replacing the M1 cupola with a low-profile \"Urdan\" type cupola that mounted an [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun for use by the tank commander. A second [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] machine gun was mounted on the turret roof for use by the loader. Internal ammunition stowage for the 105mm main gun was also increased to 54 rounds. These tanks were initially given the designation M48A5API; but, after early conversions were brought up to the later standard, the API was removed and these tanks were known simply as M48A5.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nIn addition to the conversion of M48A3 tanks, an additional conversion process for bringing M48A1 tanks to M48A5 standard was also developed. By March 1978, 708 M48A5 tanks had been converted from the M48A1 model.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nWork continued until December 1979, at which time 2069 M48A5's had been converted.{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nThe vast majority of M48A5 tanks in service with US Army units were assigned to National Guard and Army Reserve Units. A notable exception was the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], who replaced their M60A1 tanks with M48A5's, which arrived in June and July 1978. On [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] M48A5 tanks the commander's [[M60 machine gun|M60D]] was replaced with a [[M2 Browning|.50 caliber M2 machine gun]].{{r|2015_Hunnicutt}}\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the M48s were phased out of U.S. service.

Each battalion consisted of approximately 57 tanks. M48s were also used by Armored Cavalry Squadrons in Vietnam until replaced by [[M551 Sheridan]] Armored Reconnaissance Airborne Assault Vehicles (ARAAV) in the Divisional Cavalry Squadrons. M48A3 tanks remained in service with the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] until the unit was withdrawn from the conflict. The M67A1 [[flame tank]] (nicknamed the [[Zippo]]) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} From 1965 to 1968, 120 US M48A3 tanks were written off.{{r|armor.kiev.ua}}\n\n[[File:Men of Troop B, Vietnam.jpg|thumb|Men of Troop B, 1st Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, and their M48 Patton tank move through the dense jungle in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in June 1969.]]\nThe M48 Patton has the distinction of playing a unique role in an event that was destined to radically alter the conduct of armored warfare.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} When US forces commenced redeployment operations, many of the M48A3 Pattons were turned over to the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) forces, in particular creating the battalion-sized ARVN 20th Tank Regiment; which supplemented their [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] units. During the [[North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA) [[Easter Offensive]] in 1972, tank clashes between NVA [[T-54]]/[[PT-76]] and ARVN M48/M41 units became commonplace. But, on {{date|1972-04-23}}, tankers of the 20th Tank Regiment were attacked by an NVA infantry-tank team, which was equipped with the new ''[[9M14 Malyutka|9M14M Malyutka]]'' (NATO designation: Sagger) wire-guided [[anti-tank missile]].

One was between the US 1-69th Armor and PT-76 light amphibious tanks of the NVA 202nd Armored Regiment at [[Ben Het Camp]] in March 1969.{{r|1982_Dunstan}} The M48s provided adequate protection for its crew from small arms, mines, and [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s. South Vietnamese M48s and M41s fought in the [[1975 Spring Offensive]]. In several incidents, the ARVN successfully defeated NVA [[T-34]] and [[T-55]] tanks and even slowed the North's offensive. However, due to shortages of fuel and munitions faced by the South Vietnamese military because of the US Congress-placed ban on the further funding and supply of military equipment and logistics to the country, the American-made tanks soon ran out of ammunition and fuel and were quickly abandoned to the NVA, which then put them in their service after the war ended in May 1975. In total, 250 of the ARVN's M48A3s were destroyed and captured{{r|1976_NM|page=10}} and those captured (at least 30) were only used briefly before being phased out and turned into war-memorial displays all over Vietnam.[[File:M48A3 Detonates Mine Vietnam.jpg|thumb|A destroyed M48A3 during Vietnam war]]{{anchor|M48-land-mines}} M48s, along with Australian [[20 pounder|20 pounder (84mm)]]-gunned{{r|1979_Starry|page=113}} [[Centurion tank|Centurions]] of the [[1st Armoured Regiment (Australia)|1st Armoured Regiment]],{{r|1982_Dunstan}} were the only vehicles in use by the anti-communist side in the Vietnam War that could reasonably protect their crews from [[land mine]]s. They were often used for minesweeping operations along Highway 19 in the Central Highlands, a two-lane paved road between [[An Khe]] and [[Pleiku]]. Daily convoys moved both ways along Highway 19. These convoys were held up each morning while the road was swept for mines. At that time, minesweeping was done by soldiers walking slowly over the dirt shoulders of the highway with hand-held mine detectors. During this slow process, convoys would build up into a dangerously-inviting target for the enemy, especially their guerillas and partisans. As a result, a faster method was improvised, the ''\"Thunder Run\"'', in which one M48 lined up on each side of the road, with one track on the dirt shoulder and the other track on the asphalt, and then with all guns firing,{{r|1979_Starry|page=80}} they raced to a designated position miles away. If the M48s made it without striking a mine, the road was clear and the convoys could proceed. In most cases, an M48 that struck a land mine in these operations only lost a road wheel or two in the explosion; seldom was there any hull damage that would be considered a [[catastrophic kill]].{{r|1979_Starry}}\n\nSupply of M48A3 tanks to South Vietnam:\n\n* 1971: 54.{{r|2015_Hatcher}}\n* May 1972: 120.{{r|2005_Mo\u00efse|page=135}}\n* October 1972: 72.{{r|2005_Mo\u00efse|page=135}}\n* November 1972: 59.{{r|1979_Starry|page=218}}\n* January 1973 - July 1974: 16.<ref>Better Management of Secondary Items by the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces Would Reduce U.S. Investment; Department of Defense: Report to the Congress by the Comptroller General of the United States.

During [[Operation Grand Slam]], Pakistani tank forces, composed mainly of M47 and M48 Patton tanks, thrust through the Indian defence-lines very quickly and swiftly defeated back Indian Army armoured counter-attacks. The Pakistanis used approximately a division's worth of tanks in the operation, although not all were Pattons, with upgraded Shermans included as well. In contrast, Pakistan's Patton tank failed to live up to its high expectations in the [[Battle of Asal Uttar]] in September 1965, where about 97 Pakistani tanks were lost, the majority of them being Pattons (M47s and M48s). Later, the Patton tank was the main Pakistani tank at the [[Battle of Chawinda]] and its performance at that battle was deemed satisfactory against Indian armour.\n\nThe Patton was later used by Pakistan again, this time, in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. A counter-attack led by the 13th Lancers and the 31st Cavalry army units was defeated by the Indian 54th Division around [[Battle of Barapind]] in December 1971. The Pakistan Army Patton tanks could not stop an assault by Indian T-55 Soviet-supplied tanks of the 2th Armored Brigade.{{r|strategic_affairs}} At least 9 of the Pattons were destroyed by T-55 tanks during the battle of Nainakot.{{r|1995_Chakravorty|page=342}} It total, more than 80 Pakistani Pattons were knocked out during battle, mainly by Centurion and T-55 fire.{{r|strategic_affairs}}\n\nIndia later set up a temporary war-memorial so named \"''Patton Nagar''\" (or \"Patton City\") in [[Khemkaran]] District in Punjab, where the captured Pakistani Patton tanks were displayed for a short period of time before being scrapped or sent all across India for use as war monuments and military memorials.\n\nAnalysing their overall performance in their wars with India, the Pakistani military held that the Patton was held in reasonably-high esteem by both sides and that combat-tactics were to blame for their utter defeat and the following debacle at Asal Uttar.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} However, a post-war US study of the tank battles in South Asia concluded that the Patton's armor could, in fact, be penetrated by the [[Ordnance QF 20 pounder|20-pounder tank gun]] (84&nbsp;mm) of the Centurion (later replaced by the even-more successful L7 105mm gun on the Mk. 7 version which India also possessed) as well as the 75&nbsp;mm tank gun of the [[AMX-13]] light tank.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Middle East===\n[[File:Israeli M48 tank captured by Egypt.jpg|thumb|An ex-Israeli M48 Patton tank captured by Egypt during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973.]]\nM48s were also used with mixed results during the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967. On the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] battlefront, [[Israel]]i M48s upgunned with the then-advanced 105&nbsp;mm L7 rifled tank gun were used with considerable success against [[Egypt]]ian [[IS-3 (tank)|IS-3]]s, T-54s/T-55s, T-34/85s and [[SU-100]]s supplied by the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1950s and the 1960s (such as during the [[Battle of Abu-Ageila (1967)|Second Battle of Abu-Ageila]]. However, on the [[West Bank]] war-front, [[Jordan]]ian M48s (Jordan was also a user of the M48 Patton as was Israel at the same time-period) were often defeated by Israeli 105mm-armed Centurions and WWII-era upgraded M4 Shermans ([[Super Sherman|M-51s]] upgunned with French-built 105&nbsp;mm tank guns (not to be confused with the British L7 105mm tank gun)). In purely-technical terms, the Pattons were far superior to the much-older Shermans, with shots at more than 1,000 meters simply glancing off the M48's armor. However, the 105&nbsp;mm main gun of the Israeli Shermans fired a [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|HEAT]] round designed to defeat the Soviet [[T-62|T-62 tank]], which was the USSR's response to the M48's successor in US service, the [[M60 Patton]]. The Jordanian Pattons' general failure on the West Bank could also be attributed to excellent Israeli [[air superiority]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The Israeli Army captured about 100 Jordanian M48 and M48A1 tanks and pressed them into service in their own units after the war, as the same as were the Jordanian M113 APCs they seized during the war.\n\nIsrael used 445 M48 tanks in 1973 during the [[Yom Kippur War]].{{r|2010_Nordeen|page=20}} From 15 to 18 October, M48 tanks participated in the largest{{r|2011_Zaloga|page=34}} tank battle of the war - [[Battle of the Chinese Farm]].

On 1 August 1973, the successor to the CARIFTA, the [[Caribbean Community]], better known by its acronym, [[CARICOM]], came into being.\n\nThe founding document of the CARICOM, the [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]], was signed by the so-called \"Big Four\" states: [[Barbados]], [[Jamaica]], [[Guyana]] and [[Trinidad & Tobago]], all of which had gained their political independence from the UK during the 1960s. This signing was the starter's signal for a more mature, though at times slow and halting, process of regional integration among the states of the Commonwealth Caribbean.\n\n=== Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas and Agreement establishing the CCJ ===\n\nIn 2001, the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community, at their 22nd meeting in Nassau, the Bahamas, signed the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas (RTC), rebranding the Caribbean Community and Common Market to include the proposed [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME). The single market replacing the original [[Common Market]] aspect of the group.\n\nOriginally an Anglophone club, the admission of Dutch-speaking [[Suriname]] in 1995, and Cr\u00e9ole-speaking [[Haiti]] (where French is the official language) in 2002 has somewhat modified the cultural and jurisprudential mix of the community.\n\nUnder the revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, and typical of similar international integrationist movements, the CARICOM has restructured itself to include such elements as are characteristic of the modern democratic state, viz., [[CARICOM Heads of Government|executive]] (CARICOM Heads of Government and the Community Council), [[Caribbean Community#Institutions|legislative]] (Assembly of Caribbean Community Parliamentarians - established before the revised treaty and now moribund) and judicial (CCJ) arms.\n\nThe Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) is the Caribbean regional judicial tribunal established on 14 February 2001, by the Agreement Establishing the Caribbean Court of Justice. The agreement was signed on that date by the CARICOM states of: Antigua & Barbuda; Barbados; Belize; Grenada; Guyana; Jamaica; Saint Kitts & Nevis; Saint Lucia; Suriname; and Trinidad & Tobago. Two further states, Dominica and Saint Vincent & the Grenadines, signed the agreement on 15 February 2003, bringing the total number of signatories to 12. The Bahamas and Haiti, though full members of the CARICOM, are not yet signatories, and because of [[Montserrat]]'s status as a [[British Overseas Territory|British territory]], they must await Instruments of Entrustment from the UK in order to ratify. The Agreement Establishing the Caribbean Court of Justice came into force on 23 July 2003, and the CCJ was inaugurated on 16 April 2005 in Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago, the seat of the Court.\n\n=== Appellate jurisdiction ===\n\nThe birth of the CCJ came after a long and arduous period of planning. In March 1970, the Organisation of Commonwealth Caribbean Bar Associations (OCCBA) first raised the issue of the need to replace the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as the court of last resort for the Commonwealth Caribbean by a regional court of appeal. Again in Jamaica, in April 1970, at the Sixth Commonwealth Caribbean Heads of Government,<ref name=\"CCJ Inauguration Speech\">[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/speeches/ccj_inauguration_delabastide.jsp Speech by justice Michael de la Bastide, president of the CCJ, at the inauguration of the Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825050120/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/speeches/ccj_inauguration_delabastide.jsp |date=25 August 2014 }}</ref> the Jamaican delegation tabled a proposal on setting up a regional Court of Appeal<ref name=\"CCJ from concept to reality\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/about-the-ccj/ccj-concept-to-reality|title=The Caribbean Court of Justice  \u00bb The CCJ: from concept to reality|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> and the heads further agreed to take action on relinquishing the Privy Council as the Anglophone Caribbean's final appeal court and mandated a committee of CARICOM attorneys-general to further explore the question of the establishment of what was then being called a \"Caribbean Court of Appeal\".<ref name=\"CCJ Inauguration Speech\"/>\n\nFurther to the perceived need for an indigenous, regional court as a tribunal of last resort in civil and criminal cases, other factors eventually led to the strong support for the creation of a judicial arm of the CARICOM. In 1972 consideration was being given by the OCCBA for the proposed Caribbean Court of Appeal to serve as both a municipal court of last resort and an international tribunal to adjudicate disputes between CARICOM member states. In 1989 the West Indian Commission established by the CARICOM heads of government endorsed this proposed hybrid jurisdiction without qualification.<ref name=\"CCJ: Who Stands to Gain?\">[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/91941938/The-Caribbean-Court-of-Justice-_?the-CCJ?_-Who-Stands-to-Gain The Caribbean Court of Justice: Who Stands to Gain? by Justice Duke Pollard, 2008]</ref> As Duke Pollard, then director of the Caricom Legislative Drafting Facility, wrote in 2000: \"the old Treaty of Chaguaramas provided for arbitration in the event of disputes concerning the interpretation and application of the Treaty. Unfortunately, however, the arbitral procedure was never used and serious disputes were never settled, thereby causing the integration movement to be hampered.  Moreover, the rights and obligations created by the CSME are so important and extensive, relating to the establishment of economic enterprises, the provision of professional services, the movement of capital, the acquisition of land for the operation of businesses, that there is a clear need to have a permanent, central, regional institution to authoritatively and definitively pronounce on those rights and corresponding obligations. The Caribbean Court of Justice is intended to be such an authoritative institution.\"<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\">[http://www.ncsc.org/~/media/Files/PDF/Education%20and%20Careers/CEDP%20Papers/2008/Lilla_CaribJustAsFinalCtAppeal.ashx Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal for states of the Caribbean Community by Michael Anthony Lilla]</ref>\n\nThe official inauguration was held in Queen's Hall, [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], on Saturday 16 April 2005.

Barbados and Guyana acceded to the CCJ's appellate jurisdiction in 2005, with Belize joining them in June 2010, and Dominica in March 2015.\n\n=== Jurisdictional competition with the Privy Council ===\n\nThe reasons given for the establishment of a supreme appellate court are many and varied, including a perceived regional disenfranchisement from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gdmE1EaGg8gBWUzmudijT0T5eC7wD94D0UA82 Mike Melia, \"Spurning Europe, Caribbean pushes death penalty\"], 11 Nov 2008{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref><ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gdmE1EaGg8gBWUzmudijT0T5eC7wD94D0UA82 Mike Melia (Associated Press), \"Spurning Europe, Caribbean pushes death penalty\"], 11 November 2008{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4185745.stm Letter: Colonial power over death penalty].

Until the ruling, radio station licences had only been issued to members of the prime minister's family.<ref>Observer Publications Limited -v- Campbell 'Mickey' Matthew, The Commissioner of Police and The Attorney General [2001] UKPC 11</ref>\n\nThe British-based court has been perceived as having too much power in the Caribbean region.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Several politicians{{who|date=March 2017}} also lamented that the Caribbean nations are the only remaining region of the former British Empire still to rely on the British court system for appeals.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== Support from the British legal establishment for the CCJ over the JCPC for the Caribbean ===\n\nParadoxally, even as some within the Caribbean oppose switching from the Privy Council to the CCJ over fears of lessened impartiality by CCJ judges not as far removed from the region as the Privy Council judges, senior British legal figures (often members of the JCPC itself) have expressed support for a regional court for the Caribbean. As far back as 1828, the man responsible for remodelling the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Lord Brougham]], had raised the issue of removing colonies from the Privy Council's jurisdiction. He opined that due to the distance of the colonies from the UK and the immense variety of matters arising from them which would be foreign to British habits, that any court in the UK would be extremely inadequate for the colonies.<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/>\n\nLord Brougham's sentiments were echoed nearly 200 years later in 2003 by [[Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann|Lord Hoffman]], a [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lord]] from 1995 to 2009, when he noted that although the Privy Council had done its best to serve the Caribbean and had effected improvements in the administration of justice, the remoteness of the court from the community served as a handicap. In his own view a local final court would be necessary and beneficial to transform society in partnership with the other two branches of government.<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/>\n\nIn 1990, [[Richard Wilberforce, Baron Wilberforce|Lord Wilberforce]] (Senior Law Lord  from 1975\u20131982) and later in 1992 leading barrister [[Anthony Gifford, 6th Baron Gifford|Lord Gifford]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], both called on the Commonwealth Caribbean to establish its own regional and final court of appeal. In 1999, then Senior Law Lord, [[Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, Baron Browne-Wilkinson|Lord Browne-Wilkinson]] described as burdensome the number of appeals in capital matters coming from the Caribbean to the Privy Council. He noted that such appeals occupied 25% of the Privy Council's time and he felt it was time for the Privy Council to be relieved of the Caribbean cases in order for the region to accede to full legal independence. Lord Browne-Wilkinson also advocated for the establishment of a regional Caribbean court of last resort.<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/>\n\nIn September 2009, [[Nicholas Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers|Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers]] expressed sentiments close to those of Lord Browne-Wilkinson a decade earlier. Lord Phillips, the last Senior Law Lord and first [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], said he would search for ways to curb the \u201cdisproportionate\u201d time that he and his fellow senior justices spent on hearing legal appeals from independent Commonwealth countries to the Privy Council. He expressed concern that the new Supreme Court's judges would end up spending as much as 40% of their working time on Privy Council business and was intending to take some pressure off of the Supreme Court judges by drafting in lower tier judges from the Court of Appeal to sit on cases from Commonwealth countries. He also added that in an ideal world former Commonwealth countries would stop utilizing the Privy Council and instead set up their own final courts of appeal.<ref name=\"Privy Council hampers Supreme Court\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3c5b14a6-a61d-11de-8c92-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz3ZcJUnQqw|title=Privy Council hampers Supreme Court|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Privy Council's complaint\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2009/09/090922_privyccjphillips.shtml|title=BBCCaribbean.com - Privy Council's complaint|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, Lord Gifford at a reception in Kingston, Jamaica again expressed support for the replacement of the Privy Council by the CCJ. Lord Gifford noted that the CCJ would be more accessible, affordable and provide a better quality of justice for Jamaicans and other former British colonies in the Caribbean than the Privy Council. Lord Gifford expressed support for Lord Phillips' earlier comments, and hoped that they would serve to stir Jamaica and other Caribbean states to leave the Privy Council and join the CCJ. Lord Gifford also said that his arguments in support of the CCJ were strictly practical and not based on the Privy Council's composition or being a \"colonial relic\".<ref name=\"Lord Gifford urges quick referendum on CCJ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/161654_Lord-Gifford-urges-quick-referendum-on-CCJ|title=Lord Gifford urges quick referendum on CCJ - News|first=Jamaica Observer|last=Limited|accessdate=28 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104506/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/161654_Lord-Gifford-urges-quick-referendum-on-CCJ|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThus it would seems that for at least some of members of the JCPC, geographical and psychological distance (often raised as necessary for greater objectivity and impartiality) does not seem to be an issue and what is more important is the need for the Caribbean (and other Commonwealth countries) to take care of its own affairs. In fact, the Privy Council has often been willing to accept findings by Caribbean courts on local matters because they recognize that such courts are more familiar with Caribbean matters.<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/>\n\n==Overview==\nThe CCJ is intended to be a hybrid institution: a municipal court of last resort and an [[international court]] vested with original, compulsory and exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the interpretation and application of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas. In the exercise of this original jurisdiction, the CCJ discharges the functions of an international tribunal, applying rules of international law in respect of the interpretation and application of the treaty. The CCJ thus performs similarly to the [[European Court of Justice]], [[EFTA Court]], [[East African Court of Justice]], the [[ECOWAS]] Community Court of Justice, the [[Andean Court of Justice]] and the [[International Court of Justice]].<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/> In contrast to many general international tribunals or courts, the original jurisdiction of the CCJ is compulsory, requiring no pre-existing agreement.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nAs a municipal court of last resort, it exercises an appellate jurisdiction, as a final court of appeal for CARICOM member states, replacing the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] (JCPC) for Anglophone member states. In the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, the CCJ hears appeals from common law courts within the jurisdictions of parties to the Agreement Establishing the CCJ, and is the highest municipal court in the region.<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/>\n\nWhile the CCJ has jurisdiction in all member states of the Agreement Establishing The Caribbean Court of Justice, the Agreement itself provides for the CCJ's jurisdiction to also be available to any other state within the Caribbean that CARICOM should choose invite to become a party to the Agreement.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\">[http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/ILJ/upload/Maharaijh-final.pdf The Caribbean Court of Justice: A Horizontally and Vertically Comparative Study of the Caribbean\u2019s First Independent and Interdependent Court by Andrew N.

At least one member of the panel is required to be an expert in international law and one judge is also required to be from the civil law tradition, reflecting the presence of civil law jurisdictions such as Suriname and Haiti.<ref name=\"CCJ: a model?\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/sep/10/caribbean-court-judges-selection|title=Caribbean court of justice: a model for international courts?|date=10 September 2010|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016|via=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n===Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission===\nThe Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission (the RJLSC or the Commission) was established pursuant to Article V(1) of the Agreement Establishing the Caribbean Court of Justice.<ref name=\"CCJ: Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/about-the-ccj/rjlsc-2|title=The Caribbean Court of Justice  \u00bb The Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>  The Commission is composed of the following persons: the President of the Court who is also the Chairman of the Commission; two persons nominated jointly by the Organisation of the Commonwealth Caribbean Bar Association (OCCBA) and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Bar Association; one chairman of the Judicial Services Commission of a contracting state selected in rotation in the English alphabetical order for a period of three years; the Chairman of a Public Service Commission of a contracting state selected in rotation in the reverse English alphabetical order for a period of three years; two persons from civil society nominated jointly by the Secretary-General of the Caribbean Community and the Director General of the [[OECS]] for a period of three years following consultations with regional non-governmental organisations; two distinguished jurists nominated jointly by the Dean of the Faculty of Law of the University of the West Indies, the Deans of the Faculties of Law of any of the contracting states and the Chairman of the Council of Legal Education; and two persons nominated jointly by the Bar or Law Associations of the Contracting Parties.<ref name=\"CCJ: Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission\"/>\n\nThe Commission itself has a number of responsibilities that help to ensure the independence and proper functioning of the CCJ. It is responsible for recommending the candidate to be the next President of the Court; for considering and appointing potential judges for the Court; for appointing the registrar, deputy registrars and other officials and employees as necessary and determining their terms of service and terminating their appointments; for exercising disciplinary control over the judges and starting the process for removing judges based on inability to perform or misbehaviour.<ref name=\"CCJ: Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission\"/>\n\n=== CCJ Trust Fund ===\nUniquely among integrative courts, the CCJ is funded through an independent Caribbean Court of Justice Trust Fund. The Trust Fund was developed to ensure the financial independence of the Court from political interference. It was established with US$100 million from initial contributions of the member states by way of loans from the [[Caribbean Development Bank]]. The income from the Fund is expected to finance the expenditures of the Court (remuneration of judges and other employees, operation of the court) in perpetuity. This keeps the CCJ from depending on the largesse of governments and keeps it free from their administrative control. The CCJ Trust Fund is administered by a Board of Trustees drawn from various regional bodies including the following persons or their nominees: the secretary-general of the Caribbean Community; the vice-chancellor of the University of the West Indies; the president of the Insurance Association of the Caribbean; the chairman of the Association of Indigenous Banks of the Caribbean; the president of the Caribbean Institute of Chartered Accountants; the president of the Organisation of Commonwealth Caribbean Bar Associations; the chairman of the Conference of Heads of the Judiciary of Member States of the Caribbean Community; the president of the Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce; and the president of the Caribbean Congress of Labour.<ref name=\"CCJ: Trust Fund\"/>\n\n=== Protection from political pressure and influence ===\n\nThe framework of the CCJ provides many layers of protection from political pressure and influence in both the appellate and original jurisdictions:<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\n* Original jurisdiction judgments and advisory opinions are delivered as a single judgment with no dissenting or separate concurring opinions or judgments allowed and record of the way judges voted in a majority ruling.<ref name=\"The Oxford Handbook of International Adjudication\"/><ref name=\"CCJ Original Jurisdiction Rules, 2006\"/> This ensures that the judges themselves are insulated from excessive political pressure (especially in cases involving multiple member states) by having their individual decisions remain unknown as the judicial decisions are written as though the court is speaking with a single and collective voice.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* Political pressure is not permitted to reach the judges through member state appointment as occurred in the defunct [[SADC Tribunal]] and as occurs in the ECJ<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> and East African Court of Justice. Instead, judges are appointed by the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission (RJLSC), an independent 11 person body created expressly for the purpose to decide judicial admission.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* While member states do vote in the selection of the president of the Court, political distance is maintained since it is the RJLSC alone which is responsible for selecting the nominees to the post of president for the member states to vote upon. Member states cannot substitute any nominee and must await a fresh selection by the RJLSC in the event that they fail to approve an appointment for president.<ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/>\n* Even appointment to the RJLSC itself is done by relatively independent jurists, including the deans of the law school at the [[University of the West Indies]] and other law schools in the contracting states (jointly responsible for two nominations), as well as the [[Organization of the Commonwealth Caribbean Bar Association]] and the [[Organization of Eastern Caribbean States Bar Association]] (also jointly responsible for two nominations).<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* The RJLSC does not consider potential judges by recommendations from contracting member states, but by a prospective judge's individual application.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* Only the RJLSC is responsible for initiating proceedings for the removal of a judge (due to inability to perform or misbehaviour) and for recommending an increase in the number of judicial positions in the court.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* Judges of the Court (including the president) may only be removed (by the RJLSC in the case of other judges or heads of government in the case of the president) by an affirmation of a tribunal specifically established for this purpose.<ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/>\n* While normal judges of the CCJ have life tenure until the age of 72, the president of the Court may only serve for one, non-renewable 7-year term. As a result, all judges of the CCJ (unlike judges in the ECJ or the defunct SADC Tribunal) are free to make decisions without having to consider judicial term renewal.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> This put a check on the potential for political influence on the CCJ through the president of the Court (who also serves as chairman of the RJLSC), who is appointed by the super majority vote of three-quarters of the contracting states upon the recommendation of the RJLSC as once voted in the president of the Court would not potentially be beholden to the governments of the contracting states to render favourable decisions in order to gain a new term.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* As a unique feature of international and integration courts,<ref name=\"CCJ: Trust Fund\"/> the Court is funded through a CCJ Trust Fund which increases the independence of the Court, by preventing direct financial connections between the Court (salaries of the judges, operations of the court, etc.) and the member states and ensures economic stability and certainty for the Court.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> Pre-empting the possibility of informal political pressure to delivery judgements favourable to any particular government, the Trust Fund is intended to finance the expenditures of the Court through the income from the Fund in perpetuity.<ref name=\"CCJ: Trust Fund\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/about-the-ccj/ccj-trust-fund|title=The Caribbean Court of Justice  \u00bb CCJ Trust Fund|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>\n* The CCJ Trust Fund is itself administered by a Board of Trustees drawn from regional entities, many of which are independent of the influence of the governments of member states and represent both private and public interests.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/><ref name=\"CCJ: Trust Fund\"/>\n* The CCJ's initial funding was not derived directly from a single member state (and thus risking the possibility of the CCJ being beholden to that member state) but was provided by all contracting states, who were required to submit payment without any influence on how the CCJ Trust Fund utilizes the funds.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* The CCJ Trust Fund cannot solicit or accept any extra donations unless all the member states agree to do so.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* Any decision regarding the Fund requires consensus or, failing that, a two-thirds majority.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nIn January 2020, the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit]] (GIZ) of Germany, announced the results of a Judicial Integrity Scan that they had conducted on the CCJ. Utilizing the [[Judicial independence#International_standards|Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct]] and the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] as a basis for the review, the GIZ endorsed many aspects of the CCJ's structure including the transparency and accessibility of its hearings and judgments; its use of a Code of Judicial Conduct and the high levels of adherence to this Code; the overall design of the Court itself and the RJLSC; and the recruitment and selection process for judges as handled by the RJLSC. It noted however that there was currently a gender imbalance among the judges that should be addressed in future recruitments and that RJLSC could institute a competition complaint filing procedure for unsuccessful applicants hoping to fill any vacancies as judges.<ref name=\"German judicial scan applauds CCJ\">[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/German_judicial_scan_applauds_CCJ German judicial scan applauds CCJ]</ref><ref name=\"study finds high confidence in CCJ\">[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/study-finds-high-level-of-confidence-in-integrity-of-ccj_184765?profile=1373 Study finds high level of confidence in integrity of CCJ]</ref>\n\n=== Comparison with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ===\n\nInitially being created as a replacement for the Privy Council or JCPC, and later being tasked with the original jurisdiction over the interpretation of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, the CCJ replicates certain aspects of the British justice system while being divergent in other ways.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nBoth the CCJ and JCPC have a president of the Court and have a smaller panel of judges being called up for any one particular case from a larger pool of eligible judges. For the JCPC, five judges normally sit on appeals from Commonwealth countries, while three to five judges normally sit on the CCJ for cases, although at times all the eligible judges have sat for a case.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nA major difference though is in the pool of eligible justices from which the deciding panel is called. For the JCPC has no explicit limit on the number of eligible jurists, while for the CCJ the initial limit is nine judges other than the president (though this limit may be increased by the agreement of all the member states). The actual number of judges eligible for JCPC at any given time is actually difficult to determine with one 2009 estimate having ninety-five jurists, of which only three were Caribbean judges. The primary decision makers in the JCPC's pool are the privy councillors who also serve as judges on the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] and tend to be the only ones listed on the JCPC's website.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> No Caribbean judges, however, have sat on the JCPC since 2009 when the JCPC was co-located with the new UK Supreme Court.<ref name=\"FDI Scare?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/Leaving-the-Privy-Council-could-hit-foreign-direct-investment_18418081|title=Leaving the Privy Council could hit foreign direct investment - Business|first=Jamaica Observer|last=Limited|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the JCPC's employment of a large pool of jurists but usage of only a fraction of them, the JCPC has been criticized for the fact that decisions for any one case often depends on the judges called. The possible combinations of judges available means that different decisions can be rendered for very similar fact patterns in cases.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> This issue becomes particularly relevant when an appeal comes from a Caribbean country as it may be difficult for judgments to be handed down based on the nuances of Caribbean society when it is unlikely that a majority of judges on the panel for a case would come from the Caribbean.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> As one Caribbean lawyer lobbyist<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> (initially an opponent of the CCJ) noted: \"What is the \u201creasonable man\u201d test in the Caribbean?

These are the types of questions that need to be discussed by an indigenous tribunal...\"<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/><ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\n==== Cost comparisons for litigants and states ====\n\nAs comparable appellate courts, the CCJ and JCPC as outlined above have similar procedures, but there are major differences in both the time and money that would need to be spent by individual litigants and states in pursuing cases to either court.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nIndividual litigants are expected to almost always face reductions in the costs associated with pursuing their cases whenever a switch to the CCJ is made. For instance the cost of filing an appeal with the JCPC is more than five times greater than filing an appeal with the CCJ. For the JCPC, the filing of an application for permission to appeal along with the actual notice of appeal would have cost \u00a3220, or roughly US$350 in 2013, while the CCJ requires no payment for filing an application for permission to appeal and the cost for filing a notice of appeal was US$60.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> In 2015, the new filing fees for the JCPC were noted as ranging from between \u00a3400 to a \u00a35,000 or roughly US$600 to US$7,500 while the comparable fees for the CCJ remained at US$60<ref name=\"Jamaicans to get legal aid to access CCJ\">{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20151017/jamaicans-get-legal-aid-ccj|title=Jamaicans to get legal aid to CCJ|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> thus making the cost of filing an appeal with the JCPC at least ten times greater than filing an appeal with the CCJ.\n\nAlthough both courts do allow appeals ''[[in forma pauperis]]'', waiving filing fees when they are deemed too burdensome on the individual litigant,<ref name=\"CCJ: Who Stands to Gain?\"/> the JCPC does so on a more limited basis.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nSome of the highest costs for litigants however arise when litigation of the case actually begins. In most cases, litigants will have to travel to the United Kingdom (UK) to pursue their cases before the JCPC. This may involve purchasing plane tickets and/or finding and hiring lawyers licensed in the UK.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> Additionally, [[Visa policy of the United Kingdom|Jamaican and Guyanese citizens are required to obtain visas before travelling to the UK]], and for these citizens the cost of a UK visa would range from \u00a385 to \u00a3737 (or US$131 to US$1,138) depending on the type of visitor visa applied for.<ref name=\"UK visa costs\">[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/419449/fees_table_for_website_2015_03_30.pdf Home Office: Immigration and Nationality Fees, 6 April 2015]</ref> Regardless of whether or not a visa is required, all litigants would also have to pay for accommodation and any other necessary expenses in the UK for the duration of the litigation.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/><ref name=\"Privy Council does cost something\">{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120109/cleisure/cleisure3.html|title=Privy Council does cost something|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> All of this adds up as a very expensive appeals process; one estimate placed the average total cost between US$57,000<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/><ref name=\"Privy Council should sit in Mauritius in September\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/article/privy-council-should-hold-sittings-mauritius-next-september|title=The Privy Council should hold sittings in Mauritius as from next September|date=13 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> and US$87,500.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/><ref name=\"Cannot Wait\">{{cite web|url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/19991214/f4.html|title='We cannot wait until everything is state of the art...' - Dec 14, 1999 - Jamaica Gleaner|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> Given the generally low number of appeals coming from the smaller CARICOM states<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/> and sometimes from larger CARICOM states such as Jamaica,<ref name=\"Too little from London Law Lords\">{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20140518/lead/lead3.html|title=Too little from London law lords|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> in effect the local courts of appeal are the courts of last resort for the majority of CARICOM litigants who cannot afford to take their appeals to the JCPC and must therefore be satisfied with the judgments of the local courts of appeal.<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/>\n\nAs a result, the JCPC has only really been accessible to either the very wealthy from the Caribbean or to certain inmates on death row who are able to secure ''pro bono'' legal service from British barristers.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> In the case of those nationals, such as Jamaicans, who also require visas in order to travel to the UK to pursue cases before the JCPC, there is the risk that the denial of the visa could negatively impact on the ability for their cases to be heard, thus further reducing potential accessibility (especially if the work load is not sufficient to justify the JCPC travelling to their jurisdiction instead).<ref name=\"How many could really go?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/How-many-of-us-could-really-go-to-the-Privy-Council--Holness-_18974604|title=How many of us could really go to the Privy Council, Holness?

D\u00e1vila]</ref> Under the common law, the right of appeal does not exist for all cases and instead must be specially conferred. This is done consequently as appeals \"as of right\" and \"as of leave\" (where leave is required by the local Court of Appeal or the JCPC itself).<ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/>\n\nFirstly, appeals to the JCPC in civil proceedings lie at the discretion of the local court where the case at hand is one of 'great general public importance or otherwise ought to be submitted to Her Majesty in Council for decision'<ref name=\"Replacing the Privy Council in the OECS\"/> and where an amount or in dispute or claim (including property) is of, or exceeds, the prescribed statutory value.<ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/> In criminal matters, the JCPC will not intervene unless it can be demonstrated that some serious miscarriage of justice has occurred through violation of the principles of natural justice; violation the due process of law or other serious injustice.<ref name=\"Replacing the Privy Council in the OECS\"/> This is as a result of the JCPC not being designed to function as a second tier Court of Appeal to review the evidence of a given case.<ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/>\n\nThe structural and practical limitations of JCPC appeals has meant that the range of precedent generated by the highest court for many Caribbean jurisdictions is confined to narrow categories, particularly capital punishment and high finance. The wide body of law between these categories, has often been left mainly to small domestic courts in the Caribbean. Thus different decisions have been more likely to be rendered for similar fact patterns, creating inconsistencies in how laws are interpreted across the region.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nThe CCJ's structure and appellate jurisdiction, however, address this issue by providing a forum for the creation of jurisprudence in the gap in Caribbean law where the JCPC was never able to rule upon while also ruling on the area of law the JCPC specializes in. In the three years following the CCJ's inauguration, civil appeals petitioned to the court outnumbered criminal appeals by nearly seven to one, with half of the civil appeals coming from appellants the CCJ deemed too poor to pay for the filing costs. By contrast, under the JCPC, civil appeals have never outnumbered criminal appeals.<ref name=\"CCJ: Who Stands to Gain?\"/><ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/><ref name=\"Privy Council does cost something\"/> This combination of lower litigant cost for the CCJ, the Court's willingness to grant ''in forma pauperis'' and having a wider field of law to hear appeals on has enabled the CCJ to hear types of cases from the region that the JCPC has never known.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nAlthough limited to only four states in its appellate jurisdiction at the moment, so far citizens of those states have been accessing the Court more than they did the JCPC. For Barbados there were eight appeals heard by the JCPC in the five years immediately prior to Barbados' accession to the appellate jurisdiction of the CCJ. In the five years that followed immediate after the switch to the CCJ, twelve appeals were heard from Barbados. Belize saw appeals roughly twice per year to the JCPC before switching to the CCJ in 2010<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> and subsequently saw 12 appeals in the four years since the first appeal to the CCJ from Belize in mid 2011.<ref name=\"CCJ: Appellate Judgments\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/judgments-proceedings/appellate-jurisdiction-judgments|title=The Caribbean Court of Justice  \u00bb Appellate Jurisdiction Judgments|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> While Guyana originally abolished appeals to the JCPC in 1970, since adopting the CCJ, appeals to that Court have been exponentially increasing.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\n==Jurisdiction by country and institution==\n\n===Bahamas===\nIn 2011, Bahamian Chief Justice Sir Michael Barnett said The Bahamas should eventually abandon the Privy Council as the final court of appeal and move toward the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ). While that decision would be up to the government of The Bahamas, Sir Michael said there is a \u201cpowerful argument to moving eventually toward the CCJ\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhether we do that now is a matter for political debate and a matter that [the government] will have to discuss and consider,\u201d Sir Michael told the Nassau Guardian following the opening ceremony of the Caribbean Association of Judicial Officers Conference.\n\n\u201cI have my own views and I think it\u2019s almost a natural progression of our constitutional development that we move away from the Privy Council and I think the Caribbean Court of Justice is likely to be the alternative to the Privy Council. I think that as a part of our constitutional development it\u2019s almost inevitable that we move away from the Privy Council like lots of other countries, including Australia and New Zealand.\u201d\n\nSir Michael said while the Privy Council has been useful, the CCJ would better serve the country's needs. \"It's a regional court but it's also part of our development as a nation that we look to our own court for the resolution of disputes.\"\n\nSome proponents in The Bahamas wishing to sever links with the Privy Council are in favour of joining the CCJ, perhaps by having a dual final court of appeal system in the country with the Privy Council for civil and commercial matters and the CCJ for criminal matters.\n\n===Barbados===\nBarbados recognizes the court for original and final jurisdictions. In 2003 the Parliament of Barbados passed the ''Caribbean Court of Justice Act'' and the ''Constitution (Amendment) Act'', and they were brought into force by Proclamation on 8 April 2005.\n\n===Belize===\nBelizean legislation to recognize the CCJ was tied up for some years in partisan politics. In 2007, the [[People's United Party]] (PUP)-led government introduced the Caribbean Court of Justice Bill, but due to the opposition of [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) members, it did not achieve the required three-fourths majority.

In the event that the President is unable to perform the duties of office (or if there is a vacancy in the office of President), the most senior Judge shall perform the role of President and shall be appointed to perform that role by the Chairman of the Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM until the President can resume those functions or, in the case of a vacancy in the Presidency, until someone has been appointed to and assumes the functions of the office. Where there is no difference in seniority among the Judges, one of the Judges will simply be selected by the Heads of Government to perform the role of President in the event of a vacancy in Presidency or the inability of the President to perform the functions of office.<ref name=\"CCJ Agreement\"/>\n\nThe President may only serve for one, non-renewable 7-year term or until the age of 72 (whichever is earlier)<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/><ref name=\"CCJ Agreement\"/> but is allowed to continue in office, if necessary for a further three months in order to deliver a judgment or to do any other thing in proceedings that he or she has heard.<ref name=\"CCJ Agreement\"/> As with the other Judges, during the evolutionary phase of the Court (that is until the full complement of 9 Judges plus the President have been appointed), the RJLSC may extend the tenure of the President until the age of 75 or until seven years in office have been reached, whichever comes first.<ref name=\"CCJ Agreement Protocol\"/>\n\n==Seat and itinerancy==\nArticle III of the Agreement establishing the CCJ provides that The Seat of the Court shall be in the territory of a Contracting Party as determined by a qualified majority of the Contracting Parties.<ref name=\"CCJ Agreement\"/><ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/>\n\nIn 1999, Trinidad and Tobago signed an Agreement with the Caribbean Community establishing the seat of the CCJ and the offices of the RJLSC in that country.<ref name=\"1999 Seat Agreement\">[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/secretariat/legal_instruments/ccj_seat.jsp?menu=secretariat Agreement establishing the Seat of the Caribbean Court of Justice and the Offices of the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission between the Government of Trinidad & Tobago and the Caribbean Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111012617/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/secretariat/legal_instruments/ccj_seat.jsp?menu=secretariat |date=11 January 2016 }}</ref> This followed from the decision of the Contracting Parties for Trinidad and Tobago to serve as the headquarters<ref name=\"1999 Seat Agreement\"/> of the court in the 1990s and the promotion by Basdeo Panday (then Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago) of the CCJ and his desire to seek agreement with the Opposition to give effect to the Agreement establishing the CCJ and for Trinidad and Tobago to effectively act as the base for the Court.<ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/>\n\nIn 2005, a broadly identical Agreement was signed between Trinidad and Tobago and the newly established CCJ and RJLSC establishing the seat of the CCJ and Offices of the RJLSC in Trinidad and Tobago<ref name=\"2005 Seat Agreement\">[http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ccj_seat.pdf Agreement establishing the Seat of the Caribbean Court of Justice and the Offices of the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission between the Government of Trinidad & Tobago and the Caribbean Court of Justice and the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission]</ref> as was required under Article III of the Agreement establishing the CCJ itself.<ref name=\"CCJ Agreement\"/>\n\nWhile having a seat in Trinidad, the Court is also given the authority (under the same Article III of the Agreement establishing the CCJ) to sit, as circumstances warrant, in the territory of any other Contracting Party.<ref name=\"CCJ Agreement\"/><ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/> This itinerant ability, coupled with the Court's use of electronic and teleconferencing facilities, makes travel to the seat of the Court unnecessary in some cases.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> This is especially true for cases where litigants may be unable to afford the cost of appearing before the seat of the Court and electronic and teleconferencing facilities are inadequate for the task.

The Court noted the clear intentions in the transitional provisions that the substitution of a right of appeal to the CCJ in place of the previous right of appeal to the JCPC, should apply to pending proceedings except in the circumstances spelt out in the provisions themselves. Similar to the JCPC, and based on the provisions which allow for special leave to appeal to the CCJ directly as of right in certain limited instances, the Court established that it will grant special leave to appeal if there is an egregious error of law, a substantial miscarriage of justice or real risk that a serious miscarriage of justice will result if the appeal is not fully and finally ventilated before the Court. Sir Henry de B. Forde Q.C., Mr. Hal Gollop and Mr. C. Anthony Audain for the Applicant. Mr. Clement E. Lashley Q.C., Mr. David J.H. Thompson, Ms. Onika E. Stewart and Ms. Shaunita Jordan for the Respondents.\n\n===Right of registered or incorporated companies to approach the Court directly===\n\n* ''Trinidad Cement Limited and TCL Guyana Incorporated v Republic of Guyana'' [2009] CCJ 1 (OJ): The Court held that for a company to fall within the meaning of the phrase \u201cpersons, natural or juridical, of a Contracting Party\u201d of Article 222 of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas (RTC) and thus have ''[[locus standi]]'', it is sufficient for such a company to be incorporated or registered in a Contracting Party to the Agreement establishing the CCJ. This judgement was made following the decision of the Court to adjourn the application for special leave made by Trinidad Cement Limited and TCL Guyana Incorporated in ''Trinidad Cement Limited and TCL Guyana Incorporated v Republic of Guyana'' [2008] CCJ 1 (OJ) to allow the Community and the Member States parties to the RTC the opportunity to make written legal submissions on the issues before making a determination on the application for special leave. This was the first matter to appear before the CCJ in its original jurisdiction. Dr C Denbow SC for the Applicants. Mr D Singh SC for the Respondent.\n\n===State liability===\n\n* ''Trinidad Cement Limited and TCL Guyana Incorporated v Republic of Guyana'' [2009] CCJ 5 (OJ); 75 WIR 327: The Court accepted the principle that a State may incur non-contractual liability for damages for breach of the Revised Treaty. The Court held that the new single Market based on the rule of law implies the remedy of compensation where rights which enure to individuals and private entities under the treaty are infringed by a Member State. It held however that State liability in damages is not automatic and that it requires demonstration that the treaty provision allegedly breached was intending to benefit the party, that the breach is serious, that there is substantial loss, and that there is a causal link between the breach by the State and the damage or loss to the party. Dr C Denbow SC for the Claimants. Professor K Massiah SC and Mr Kamal Ramkarran for the Defendant.\n\n===The power to correct any injustice caused by the Court itself===\n\n* ''Brown v Moore-Griffith and others'' (No 2)[2013] CCJ 12 (AJ); 84 WIR 76: The Court accepted the argument by the Applicant that it had an unfettered power to correct any injustice caused by an earlier order it had made. It was an underlying common law principle that courts of final appeal had an inherent power to correct any breach of Natural Justice caused by an earlier hearing of the same final court of appeal, where a party through no fault of their own, had been subject to an unfair procedure. The exercise of that jurisdiction was necessary to ensure justice between litigants and public confidence in the administration of justice. Lalu Hanuman for the Applicant. Clement Lashley QC and Honor Chase for the Respondents.\n\n===Right of entry by CARICOM Nationals===\n\n* ''Myrie v State of Barbados'' [2013] CCJ 3 (OJ): The Court held that CARICOM nationals had a right to free movement within the Caribbean Community, specifically a right of entry without any form of harassment or impediment, based on the combined effect of Article 45 of the Revised Treaty and a Decision of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community taken at their Twenty-Eighth Meeting in 2007 (\u201cthe 2007 Conference Decision\u201d). The Court noted that the 2007 Conference Decision was another step in furthering the fundamental goal of granting Community nationals the right to unrestricted access to, and movement within, the jurisdiction of Member States, subject to public interest considerations. The 2007 Conference Decision entitled every Community national to a \u201cdefinite entry\u201d of six months upon arrival in another Member State. The Court further noted that both the rights of establishment and of the provision of services, including services in the tourism sector, presume of necessity the right of movement of Community nationals without being obstructed by unreasonable restrictions. The Court further held that where a Community national is refused entry into a Member State on a legitimate ground, that national should be given the opportunity to consult an attorney or a consular official of his or her country or to contact a family member; and that Member States are required to give, promptly and in writing, the reasons for refusing entry to the Community national and to inform the refused national of his or her right to challenge the decision. Ms Michelle Brown and Ms Nancy Anderson for the Claimant. Mr Roger Forde, QC appearing together with Mr Patterson Cheltenham QC, Ms Donna Brathwaite, QC, Dr David Berry and Ms Nargis Hardyal for the Defendant.\n* ''Tomlinson v State of Belize and State of Trinidad & Tobago'' [2016] CCJ 1 (OJ): The Court fully endorsed its decision in the earlier Shanique Myrie case that the 2007 Conference Decision created a binding obligation on the Member States to allow all CARICOM nationals hassle free entry and stay of six months upon arrival into their respective territories, subject to two exceptions: the right of Member States to refuse entry to \u201cundesirable persons\u201d and their right to prevent persons from becoming a charge on public funds. The Court agreed with the States that homosexuals, as such, cannot be categorised as \u2018undesirable persons\u2019 and concluded that homosexual CARICOM nationals have a right to freedom of movement on the same terms as any other CARICOM national. The Court held however, that Mr. Tomlinson was not in danger of being prejudiced (and the States' obligations were not breached) by the mere existence of statutory provisions in the Immigration Acts of Belize and Trinidad and Tobago for a number of reasons relating to the proper interpretation of those Acts themselves and in conjunction with other relevant legislation including: (1) section 64(1) of Belize's Interpretation Act; (2) section 3(2) of the Caribbean Community Act, 2004 of Belize; (3) the Preamble of the 1976 Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago; (4)  section 4 the 1976 Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago; (5) relevant state practice,  particularly the 2004 amendment to the Extradition (Commonwealth and Foreign Territories) Act, 1985; (6) the Data Protection Act 2011 of Trinidad and Tobago; (7) section 3 of the Immigration(Caribbean Community Skilled Nationals) Act 1996 of Trinidad and Tobago which requires an immigration officer to permit entry into Trinidad and Tobago of skilled CARICOM nationals who present a skills certificate, \u201cnotwithstanding any other written law\u201d (as, for example, section 8 of the Immigration Act); and (7) Article 9 of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas as transformed into the domestic law of Trinidad and Tobago through the Caribbean Community Act, 2005. The Court also accepted the argument posited by Trinidad and Tobago, that despite the formal prohibition in section 8 of its Immigration Act, the prohibition does not apply to CARICOM nationals who are homosexual as part of an official policy. The Court however cautioned that member states should strive to ensure that national laws, subsidiary legislation and administrative practices are consistent with, and transparent in their support of, the right of all CARCICOM nationals to move freely. The Court ultimately dismissed Mr Tomlinson's claims against Belize and Trinidad and Tobago and refused the requested remedies. Noting the importance of having novel issues of Community law ventilated before the CCJ, the Court ordered that each party pay its own costs. Mr Douglas Mendes SC, appearing with Mr. Westmin R.A. James and Mr. Imran Ali, Attorneys-at-Law, for the Claimant. Ms Anika Jackson, Solicitor General of Belize, appearing with Mr Nigel Hawke, Deputy Solicitor General and Ms Samantha Matute, Attorneys-at-Law for the first Defendant (the State of Belize) and Mr Seenath Jairam SC, appearing with Mr Wayne D Sturge, Mr Gerald Ramdeen, Mr Kashka Hemans, Ms Deowattee Dilraj-Batoosingh and Ms Lesley Almarales, Attorneys-at-Law for the second Defendant (the State of Trinidad and Tobago).\n* ''Bain v State of Trinidad & Tobago'' [2019] CCJ 3 (OJ): The Court held that for CARICOM nationals to exercise their important rights to free movement within the Caribbean Community including a right of entry without any form of harassment or impediment, clear documentary evidence of their nationality is required. The Court further held that the onus of proof is on the intended entrant to show forthwith the clear documentary evidence that he or she is entitled to seek entry to another Member State as a CARICOM national with rights under the Revised Treaty. The Court also noted that a person holding dual nationality has two citizenships existing side by side and as such, the exercise of rights attached to one nationality does not eliminate the right to exercise rights attached to the other nationality. Thus the Court did not consider that the Claimant had waived his Treaty rights as a national of a CARICOM State when he presented himself to the Defendant's immigration officials on arrival as a United States national, producing his American passport to support his completed immigration form. The Court found that the presentation of a Driver's Licence or a Voter's Identification Card was not sufficient to provide conclusive evidence of nationality for the purpose of exercising Treaty rights. The Court reasoned that the function of a driver's licence and voter's identification card were to permit driving or voting, respectively, in the issuing territory, not to establish or provide evidence of citizenship. The Court also reasoned that these documents were not machine-readable nor designed to be stamped with dates of entry and exit by immigration officials and further reasoned that a notation in a non-CARICOM passport of birth by the holder in a CARICOM Member State was insufficient as evidence because birth in a country does not automatically evidence citizenship and because such citizenship, even if held at birth, could have been renounced or been stripped away by the government. Mr Ruggles Ferguson, Mr. Ferron Lowe and Mr. Patrick Superville, Attorneys-at-Law, for the Claimant. Mr Rishi P. A. Dass, Ms Sasha Sukhram and Mr Sean Julien, Attorneys-at-Law, for the Defendant.\n\n===Indigenous people's land rights===\n\n* ''The Maya Leaders Alliance & others v. The Attorney General of Belize'' [2015] CCJ 15 (AJ): In a much-awaited decision, on 22 April 2015, the Court affirmed the rights of the Mayan indigenous communities over their traditional lands in Belize. The case concerned the rights to land of the Mayan communities of the Toledo District in southern Belize who have been fighting to their rights over traditional lands recognized and protected before international courts and Belizean courts for the past two decades. The appeal was brought by 25 appellants who are members of the Maya community of the Toledo District. Their appeal before the CCJ arose out of litigation precipitated by an incursion onto farm lands in the Golden Stream village by Mr Francis Johnson, now deceased. While this appeal was being heard by the CCJ in Belize, the Appellants and the Government entered into a Consent Order on April 22, 2015 which recognized that the Maya system of customary land tenure gives rise to property rights within the meaning of the Constitution of Belize. The Consent Order also requires the Government to develop of a mechanism to recognise and protect Maya land rights in consultation with the Maya people. Under the Consent Order, the CCJ was asked to decide whether the Appellants should be granted damages for breach of constitutional rights. The Court found that the Government of Belize breached the Appellants\u2019 right to protection of the law by failing to ensure that the existing property regime, inherited from the pre-independence colonial system, recognized and protected Maya land rights. The Court could not find sufficient evidence to support the Appellants' claim for special damages arising out of the Golden Stream incursion, but felt that innovative use should be made of the remedial reparatory action under the Consent Order to grant redress under the Constitution based on the centuries of oppression and marginalisation of the Maya people. Therefore, the Court ordered the Government of Belize to establish a fund of BZ$300,000.00 as a first step towards compliance with its obligations under the Consent Order. Ms Monica Coc Magnusson for the Appellants. Mr Denys Barrow SC, Mr Nigel Hawke and Ms Naima Barrow for the Respondent.\n\n===Voting rights, procedures and required majorities in Ministerial Councils of CARICOM<ref name='Cement Case CCJ Importance'>[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20190927/cement-case-affirms-ccj-importance-caricom-part-2 Cement Case affirms CCJ importance to CARICOM]</ref>===\n\n* ''Trinidad Cement Limited and others v State of Trinidad & Tobago and others'' [2019] CCJ 4 (OJ): In a consolidation of four separate cases of a long-running spat involving regional cement manufacturers and cement importers, the Court's decision clarified a number of procedural issues related to the CARICOM's ministerial councils as well Member State obligation to give the [[Caribbean_Community#Community_Council|Council for Trade and Economic Development (COTED)]] adequate notice of any decision to revert to the Common External Tariff (CET) from any agreed upon prior derogation from the same. It was held that a Member State did not need approval from COTED for a decision to revert to the CET. It was further held by the Court that as there are 13 Member States who are parties to the Revised Treaty and to the Single Market and Economy established by that treaty, but an additional 2 Member States (The Bahamas and Montserrat) who are members according to the terms of their bilateral agreements with CARICOM which provided for them to remain members of the Community in accordance with the terms and conditions existing immediately prior to the entry into force of the Revised Treaty then the Article 27 right for Members to cast a vote on the decisions of COTED must be read in light of these facts. As such The Bahamas does not have the right to vote on matters such as that which concerned the COTED classification decision as under the arrangements prior to the entry into force of the Revised Treaty it did not participate in or have votes on decisions of the Common Market which preceded the current Single Market. Thus for decisions in COTED the 14 other Member States were entitled to a vote, and for such to decisions to be valid according to Article 29 of the Revised Treaty, at least three-quarters of the votes (that is 11 Members) are needed for the required qualified majority. Mr Reginald T. A. Armour, SC, Mr Gilbert Peterson SC, Mr Gregory Pantin, Mr Miguel Vasquez and Mr Raphael Ajodhia for the first Claimants (Trinidad Cement Limited and Arawak Cement Company Limited) and  Mr Allan Wood QC and Ms Symone Mayhew for the second Claimaints (Rock Hard Cement Limited and Rock Hard Distribution Limited). Mrs Deborah Peake, SC, Ms Tamara Toolsie, Mr Brent James and Ms. Radha Sookdeo for the first Respondent (State of Trinidad & Tobago) and Ms Donna Brathwaite, QC, and Ms Gayl Scott for the second Respondent (State of Barbados) and  Dr Corlita Babb-Schaefer and Mr O\u2019Neil Francis for the third Respondent (The Caribbean Community).\n\n===Lawfulness of opt-outs and non-reciprocity in regards to the benefits of Community decisions===\n\n* ''Lawfulness of opt-outs and the principle of non-reciprocity concerning a decision of the Conference to enlarge the classes of persons entitled to move and work freely in the Community (Request for an Advisory Opinion)'' [2020] CCJ 1 (OJ) (AO): In a historic judgement, the Court delivered its first ever advisory opinion pursuant to Article 212 of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas and the Court's own Rules. Following the request for such an opinion by the Secretary-General of the Community in March 2019 and oral hearings for the case in October 2019, the Court presented its opinion on 18 March 2020. The case centred on two questions that the Conference of Heads of Governments had agreed to ask of the Court at their 30th Inter-Sessional Meeting in February 2019, wherein it was agreed to allow two Member States to opt-out (for a period of five year) of a recent decision by the Conference to enlarge the categories of skilled CARICOM nationals entitled free movement in Community to include security guards and agricultural workers. The questions were: (1) whether a Member State can, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Revised Treaty, lawfully opt out of a decision of the Conference to increase the classes of persons entitled to move and work freely in the Community; and (2) whether the principle of non-reciprocity would enable nationals of the opting out Member States to derive the benefits arising from the decision notwithstanding the opt outs. whether the principle of non-reciprocity would enable nationals of the opting out Member States to still derive the benefits accruing under the enlargement decision In regards to the first question, the Court opined that for the specific opt out referred to it was lawful for the two Member States to request it and for the Conference to grant it as the opt outs did not prejudice the fundamental objective of the Community of freedom of movement for skilled nationals. More generally, the Court noted that opt outs can be granted in relation to any decision of any competent Organ of the Community, but that five conditions have to be accounted for in the effective implementation of any opt out. These five conditions were (i) one or more Member States must first request to opt out of a decision, (ii) the decision must be made by a competent Community Organ, (iii) it is the Conference that must agree to the opt out request for relevant decision, even if that decision was taken by another competent Organ, (iv) the Member State opting out can only opt out of the obligations arising from the decision, and (v) the opt out does not prejudice the fundamental objectives of the Community. In regards to the second question, the Court opined that as the general legal order created by the Revised Treaty requires the universal application of the rights and obligations arising out it; and as the relevant Article of the Treaty (Article 27(4)) derogates from the principle of reciprocity by only specifying that a Member State may opt out of the obligations arising from a decision by a competent Community Organ; and that Article 8 of the Revised Treaty requires each Member State to accord to another Member State treatment no less favourable than that accorded to any other third Member State then generally opt outs are to be treated as a non-reciprocal in nature. As a result, more specifically, the Court advised that this principle of nonreciprocity applies so that nationals of the two Member States opting out of the decision to enlarge the categories for freedom of movement who are security guards and agricultural workers are entitled to enjoy the benefits of that decision.

On 1 August 1973, the successor to the CARIFTA, the [[Caribbean Community]], better known by its acronym, [[CARICOM]], came into being.\n\nThe founding document of the CARICOM, the [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]], was signed by the so-called \"Big Four\" states: [[Barbados]], [[Jamaica]], [[Guyana]] and [[Trinidad & Tobago]], all of which had gained their political independence from the UK during the 1960s. This signing was the starter's signal for a more mature, though at times slow and halting, process of regional integration among the states of the Commonwealth Caribbean.\n\n=== Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas and Agreement establishing the CCJ ===\n\nIn 2001, the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community, at their 22nd meeting in Nassau, the Bahamas, signed the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas (RTC), rebranding the Caribbean Community and Common Market to include the proposed [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME). The single market replacing the original [[Common Market]] aspect of the group.\n\nOriginally an Anglophone club, the admission of Dutch-speaking [[Suriname]] in 1995, and Cr\u00e9ole-speaking [[Haiti]] (where French is the official language) in 2002 has somewhat modified the cultural and jurisprudential mix of the community.\n\nUnder the revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, and typical of similar international integrationist movements, the CARICOM has restructured itself to include such elements as are characteristic of the modern democratic state, viz., [[CARICOM Heads of Government|executive]] (CARICOM Heads of Government and the Community Council), [[Caribbean Community#Institutions|legislative]] (Assembly of Caribbean Community Parliamentarians - established before the revised treaty and now moribund) and judicial (CCJ) arms.\n\nThe Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) is the Caribbean regional judicial tribunal established on 14 February 2001, by the Agreement Establishing the Caribbean Court of Justice. The agreement was signed on that date by the CARICOM states of: Antigua & Barbuda; Barbados; Belize; Grenada; Guyana; Jamaica; Saint Kitts & Nevis; Saint Lucia; Suriname; and Trinidad & Tobago. Two further states, Dominica and Saint Vincent & the Grenadines, signed the agreement on 15 February 2003, bringing the total number of signatories to 12. The Bahamas and Haiti, though full members of the CARICOM, are not yet signatories, and because of [[Montserrat]]'s status as a [[British Overseas Territory|British territory]], they must await Instruments of Entrustment from the UK in order to ratify. The Agreement Establishing the Caribbean Court of Justice came into force on 23 July 2003, and the CCJ was inaugurated on 16 April 2005 in Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago, the seat of the Court.\n\n=== Appellate jurisdiction ===\n\nThe birth of the CCJ came after a long and arduous period of planning. In March 1970, the Organisation of Commonwealth Caribbean Bar Associations (OCCBA) first raised the issue of the need to replace the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as the court of last resort for the Commonwealth Caribbean by a regional court of appeal. Again in Jamaica, in April 1970, at the Sixth Commonwealth Caribbean Heads of Government,<ref name=\"CCJ Inauguration Speech\">[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/speeches/ccj_inauguration_delabastide.jsp Speech by justice Michael de la Bastide, president of the CCJ, at the inauguration of the Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825050120/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/speeches/ccj_inauguration_delabastide.jsp |date=25 August 2014 }}</ref> the Jamaican delegation tabled a proposal on setting up a regional Court of Appeal<ref name=\"CCJ from concept to reality\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/about-the-ccj/ccj-concept-to-reality|title=The Caribbean Court of Justice  \u00bb The CCJ: from concept to reality|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> and the heads further agreed to take action on relinquishing the Privy Council as the Anglophone Caribbean's final appeal court and mandated a committee of CARICOM attorneys-general to further explore the question of the establishment of what was then being called a \"Caribbean Court of Appeal\".<ref name=\"CCJ Inauguration Speech\"/>\n\nFurther to the perceived need for an indigenous, regional court as a tribunal of last resort in civil and criminal cases, other factors eventually led to the strong support for the creation of a judicial arm of the CARICOM. In 1972 consideration was being given by the OCCBA for the proposed Caribbean Court of Appeal to serve as both a municipal court of last resort and an international tribunal to adjudicate disputes between CARICOM member states. In 1989 the West Indian Commission established by the CARICOM heads of government endorsed this proposed hybrid jurisdiction without qualification.<ref name=\"CCJ: Who Stands to Gain?\">[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/91941938/The-Caribbean-Court-of-Justice-_?the-CCJ?_-Who-Stands-to-Gain The Caribbean Court of Justice: Who Stands to Gain? by Justice Duke Pollard, 2008]</ref> As Duke Pollard, then director of the Caricom Legislative Drafting Facility, wrote in 2000: \"the old Treaty of Chaguaramas provided for arbitration in the event of disputes concerning the interpretation and application of the Treaty. Unfortunately, however, the arbitral procedure was never used and serious disputes were never settled, thereby causing the integration movement to be hampered.  Moreover, the rights and obligations created by the CSME are so important and extensive, relating to the establishment of economic enterprises, the provision of professional services, the movement of capital, the acquisition of land for the operation of businesses, that there is a clear need to have a permanent, central, regional institution to authoritatively and definitively pronounce on those rights and corresponding obligations. The Caribbean Court of Justice is intended to be such an authoritative institution.\"<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\">[http://www.ncsc.org/~/media/Files/PDF/Education%20and%20Careers/CEDP%20Papers/2008/Lilla_CaribJustAsFinalCtAppeal.ashx Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal for states of the Caribbean Community by Michael Anthony Lilla]</ref>\n\nThe official inauguration was held in Queen's Hall, [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], on Saturday 16 April 2005.

Barbados and Guyana acceded to the CCJ's appellate jurisdiction in 2005, with Belize joining them in June 2010, and Dominica in March 2015.\n\n=== Jurisdictional competition with the Privy Council ===\n\nThe reasons given for the establishment of a supreme appellate court are many and varied, including a perceived regional disenfranchisement from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gdmE1EaGg8gBWUzmudijT0T5eC7wD94D0UA82 Mike Melia, \"Spurning Europe, Caribbean pushes death penalty\"], 11 Nov 2008{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref><ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gdmE1EaGg8gBWUzmudijT0T5eC7wD94D0UA82 Mike Melia (Associated Press), \"Spurning Europe, Caribbean pushes death penalty\"], 11 November 2008{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4185745.stm Letter: Colonial power over death penalty].

As far back as 1828, the man responsible for remodelling the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Lord Brougham]], had raised the issue of removing colonies from the Privy Council's jurisdiction. He opined that due to the distance of the colonies from the UK and the immense variety of matters arising from them which would be foreign to British habits, that any court in the UK would be extremely inadequate for the colonies.<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/>\n\nLord Brougham's sentiments were echoed nearly 200 years later in 2003 by [[Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann|Lord Hoffman]], a [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lord]] from 1995 to 2009, when he noted that although the Privy Council had done its best to serve the Caribbean and had effected improvements in the administration of justice, the remoteness of the court from the community served as a handicap. In his own view a local final court would be necessary and beneficial to transform society in partnership with the other two branches of government.<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/>\n\nIn 1990, [[Richard Wilberforce, Baron Wilberforce|Lord Wilberforce]] (Senior Law Lord  from 1975\u20131982) and later in 1992 leading barrister [[Anthony Gifford, 6th Baron Gifford|Lord Gifford]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], both called on the Commonwealth Caribbean to establish its own regional and final court of appeal. In 1999, then Senior Law Lord, [[Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, Baron Browne-Wilkinson|Lord Browne-Wilkinson]] described as burdensome the number of appeals in capital matters coming from the Caribbean to the Privy Council. He noted that such appeals occupied 25% of the Privy Council's time and he felt it was time for the Privy Council to be relieved of the Caribbean cases in order for the region to accede to full legal independence. Lord Browne-Wilkinson also advocated for the establishment of a regional Caribbean court of last resort.<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/>\n\nIn September 2009, [[Nicholas Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers|Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers]] expressed sentiments close to those of Lord Browne-Wilkinson a decade earlier. Lord Phillips, the last Senior Law Lord and first [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], said he would search for ways to curb the \u201cdisproportionate\u201d time that he and his fellow senior justices spent on hearing legal appeals from independent Commonwealth countries to the Privy Council. He expressed concern that the new Supreme Court's judges would end up spending as much as 40% of their working time on Privy Council business and was intending to take some pressure off of the Supreme Court judges by drafting in lower tier judges from the Court of Appeal to sit on cases from Commonwealth countries. He also added that in an ideal world former Commonwealth countries would stop utilizing the Privy Council and instead set up their own final courts of appeal.<ref name=\"Privy Council hampers Supreme Court\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3c5b14a6-a61d-11de-8c92-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz3ZcJUnQqw|title=Privy Council hampers Supreme Court|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Privy Council's complaint\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2009/09/090922_privyccjphillips.shtml|title=BBCCaribbean.com - Privy Council's complaint|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, Lord Gifford at a reception in Kingston, Jamaica again expressed support for the replacement of the Privy Council by the CCJ. Lord Gifford noted that the CCJ would be more accessible, affordable and provide a better quality of justice for Jamaicans and other former British colonies in the Caribbean than the Privy Council. Lord Gifford expressed support for Lord Phillips' earlier comments, and hoped that they would serve to stir Jamaica and other Caribbean states to leave the Privy Council and join the CCJ. Lord Gifford also said that his arguments in support of the CCJ were strictly practical and not based on the Privy Council's composition or being a \"colonial relic\".<ref name=\"Lord Gifford urges quick referendum on CCJ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/161654_Lord-Gifford-urges-quick-referendum-on-CCJ|title=Lord Gifford urges quick referendum on CCJ - News|first=Jamaica Observer|last=Limited|accessdate=28 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104506/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/161654_Lord-Gifford-urges-quick-referendum-on-CCJ|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThus it would seems that for at least some of members of the JCPC, geographical and psychological distance (often raised as necessary for greater objectivity and impartiality) does not seem to be an issue and what is more important is the need for the Caribbean (and other Commonwealth countries) to take care of its own affairs. In fact, the Privy Council has often been willing to accept findings by Caribbean courts on local matters because they recognize that such courts are more familiar with Caribbean matters.<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/>\n\n==Overview==\nThe CCJ is intended to be a hybrid institution: a municipal court of last resort and an [[international court]] vested with original, compulsory and exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the interpretation and application of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas. In the exercise of this original jurisdiction, the CCJ discharges the functions of an international tribunal, applying rules of international law in respect of the interpretation and application of the treaty. The CCJ thus performs similarly to the [[European Court of Justice]], [[EFTA Court]], [[East African Court of Justice]], the [[ECOWAS]] Community Court of Justice, the [[Andean Court of Justice]] and the [[International Court of Justice]].<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/> In contrast to many general international tribunals or courts, the original jurisdiction of the CCJ is compulsory, requiring no pre-existing agreement.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nAs a municipal court of last resort, it exercises an appellate jurisdiction, as a final court of appeal for CARICOM member states, replacing the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] (JCPC) for Anglophone member states. In the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, the CCJ hears appeals from common law courts within the jurisdictions of parties to the Agreement Establishing the CCJ, and is the highest municipal court in the region.<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/>\n\nWhile the CCJ has jurisdiction in all member states of the Agreement Establishing The Caribbean Court of Justice, the Agreement itself provides for the CCJ's jurisdiction to also be available to any other state within the Caribbean that CARICOM should choose invite to become a party to the Agreement.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\">[http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/research/ILJ/upload/Maharaijh-final.pdf The Caribbean Court of Justice: A Horizontally and Vertically Comparative Study of the Caribbean\u2019s First Independent and Interdependent Court by Andrew N.

At least one member of the panel is required to be an expert in international law and one judge is also required to be from the civil law tradition, reflecting the presence of civil law jurisdictions such as Suriname and Haiti.<ref name=\"CCJ: a model?\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/sep/10/caribbean-court-judges-selection|title=Caribbean court of justice: a model for international courts?|date=10 September 2010|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016|via=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n===Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission===\nThe Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission (the RJLSC or the Commission) was established pursuant to Article V(1) of the Agreement Establishing the Caribbean Court of Justice.<ref name=\"CCJ: Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/about-the-ccj/rjlsc-2|title=The Caribbean Court of Justice  \u00bb The Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>  The Commission is composed of the following persons: the President of the Court who is also the Chairman of the Commission; two persons nominated jointly by the Organisation of the Commonwealth Caribbean Bar Association (OCCBA) and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Bar Association; one chairman of the Judicial Services Commission of a contracting state selected in rotation in the English alphabetical order for a period of three years; the Chairman of a Public Service Commission of a contracting state selected in rotation in the reverse English alphabetical order for a period of three years; two persons from civil society nominated jointly by the Secretary-General of the Caribbean Community and the Director General of the [[OECS]] for a period of three years following consultations with regional non-governmental organisations; two distinguished jurists nominated jointly by the Dean of the Faculty of Law of the University of the West Indies, the Deans of the Faculties of Law of any of the contracting states and the Chairman of the Council of Legal Education; and two persons nominated jointly by the Bar or Law Associations of the Contracting Parties.<ref name=\"CCJ: Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission\"/>\n\nThe Commission itself has a number of responsibilities that help to ensure the independence and proper functioning of the CCJ. It is responsible for recommending the candidate to be the next President of the Court; for considering and appointing potential judges for the Court; for appointing the registrar, deputy registrars and other officials and employees as necessary and determining their terms of service and terminating their appointments; for exercising disciplinary control over the judges and starting the process for removing judges based on inability to perform or misbehaviour.<ref name=\"CCJ: Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission\"/>\n\n=== CCJ Trust Fund ===\nUniquely among integrative courts, the CCJ is funded through an independent Caribbean Court of Justice Trust Fund. The Trust Fund was developed to ensure the financial independence of the Court from political interference. It was established with US$100 million from initial contributions of the member states by way of loans from the [[Caribbean Development Bank]]. The income from the Fund is expected to finance the expenditures of the Court (remuneration of judges and other employees, operation of the court) in perpetuity. This keeps the CCJ from depending on the largesse of governments and keeps it free from their administrative control. The CCJ Trust Fund is administered by a Board of Trustees drawn from various regional bodies including the following persons or their nominees: the secretary-general of the Caribbean Community; the vice-chancellor of the University of the West Indies; the president of the Insurance Association of the Caribbean; the chairman of the Association of Indigenous Banks of the Caribbean; the president of the Caribbean Institute of Chartered Accountants; the president of the Organisation of Commonwealth Caribbean Bar Associations; the chairman of the Conference of Heads of the Judiciary of Member States of the Caribbean Community; the president of the Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce; and the president of the Caribbean Congress of Labour.<ref name=\"CCJ: Trust Fund\"/>\n\n=== Protection from political pressure and influence ===\n\nThe framework of the CCJ provides many layers of protection from political pressure and influence in both the appellate and original jurisdictions:<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\n* Original jurisdiction judgments and advisory opinions are delivered as a single judgment with no dissenting or separate concurring opinions or judgments allowed and record of the way judges voted in a majority ruling.<ref name=\"The Oxford Handbook of International Adjudication\"/><ref name=\"CCJ Original Jurisdiction Rules, 2006\"/> This ensures that the judges themselves are insulated from excessive political pressure (especially in cases involving multiple member states) by having their individual decisions remain unknown as the judicial decisions are written as though the court is speaking with a single and collective voice.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* Political pressure is not permitted to reach the judges through member state appointment as occurred in the defunct [[SADC Tribunal]] and as occurs in the ECJ<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> and East African Court of Justice. Instead, judges are appointed by the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission (RJLSC), an independent 11 person body created expressly for the purpose to decide judicial admission.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* While member states do vote in the selection of the president of the Court, political distance is maintained since it is the RJLSC alone which is responsible for selecting the nominees to the post of president for the member states to vote upon. Member states cannot substitute any nominee and must await a fresh selection by the RJLSC in the event that they fail to approve an appointment for president.<ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/>\n* Even appointment to the RJLSC itself is done by relatively independent jurists, including the deans of the law school at the [[University of the West Indies]] and other law schools in the contracting states (jointly responsible for two nominations), as well as the [[Organization of the Commonwealth Caribbean Bar Association]] and the [[Organization of Eastern Caribbean States Bar Association]] (also jointly responsible for two nominations).<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* The RJLSC does not consider potential judges by recommendations from contracting member states, but by a prospective judge's individual application.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* Only the RJLSC is responsible for initiating proceedings for the removal of a judge (due to inability to perform or misbehaviour) and for recommending an increase in the number of judicial positions in the court.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* Judges of the Court (including the president) may only be removed (by the RJLSC in the case of other judges or heads of government in the case of the president) by an affirmation of a tribunal specifically established for this purpose.<ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/>\n* While normal judges of the CCJ have life tenure until the age of 72, the president of the Court may only serve for one, non-renewable 7-year term. As a result, all judges of the CCJ (unlike judges in the ECJ or the defunct SADC Tribunal) are free to make decisions without having to consider judicial term renewal.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> This put a check on the potential for political influence on the CCJ through the president of the Court (who also serves as chairman of the RJLSC), who is appointed by the super majority vote of three-quarters of the contracting states upon the recommendation of the RJLSC as once voted in the president of the Court would not potentially be beholden to the governments of the contracting states to render favourable decisions in order to gain a new term.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* As a unique feature of international and integration courts,<ref name=\"CCJ: Trust Fund\"/> the Court is funded through a CCJ Trust Fund which increases the independence of the Court, by preventing direct financial connections between the Court (salaries of the judges, operations of the court, etc.) and the member states and ensures economic stability and certainty for the Court.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> Pre-empting the possibility of informal political pressure to delivery judgements favourable to any particular government, the Trust Fund is intended to finance the expenditures of the Court through the income from the Fund in perpetuity.<ref name=\"CCJ: Trust Fund\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/about-the-ccj/ccj-trust-fund|title=The Caribbean Court of Justice  \u00bb CCJ Trust Fund|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>\n* The CCJ Trust Fund is itself administered by a Board of Trustees drawn from regional entities, many of which are independent of the influence of the governments of member states and represent both private and public interests.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/><ref name=\"CCJ: Trust Fund\"/>\n* The CCJ's initial funding was not derived directly from a single member state (and thus risking the possibility of the CCJ being beholden to that member state) but was provided by all contracting states, who were required to submit payment without any influence on how the CCJ Trust Fund utilizes the funds.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* The CCJ Trust Fund cannot solicit or accept any extra donations unless all the member states agree to do so.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n* Any decision regarding the Fund requires consensus or, failing that, a two-thirds majority.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nIn January 2020, the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit]] (GIZ) of Germany, announced the results of a Judicial Integrity Scan that they had conducted on the CCJ. Utilizing the [[Judicial independence#International_standards|Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct]] and the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] as a basis for the review, the GIZ endorsed many aspects of the CCJ's structure including the transparency and accessibility of its hearings and judgments; its use of a Code of Judicial Conduct and the high levels of adherence to this Code; the overall design of the Court itself and the RJLSC; and the recruitment and selection process for judges as handled by the RJLSC. It noted however that there was currently a gender imbalance among the judges that should be addressed in future recruitments and that RJLSC could institute a competition complaint filing procedure for unsuccessful applicants hoping to fill any vacancies as judges.<ref name=\"German judicial scan applauds CCJ\">[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/German_judicial_scan_applauds_CCJ German judicial scan applauds CCJ]</ref><ref name=\"study finds high confidence in CCJ\">[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/study-finds-high-level-of-confidence-in-integrity-of-ccj_184765?profile=1373 Study finds high level of confidence in integrity of CCJ]</ref>\n\n=== Comparison with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ===\n\nInitially being created as a replacement for the Privy Council or JCPC, and later being tasked with the original jurisdiction over the interpretation of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, the CCJ replicates certain aspects of the British justice system while being divergent in other ways.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nBoth the CCJ and JCPC have a president of the Court and have a smaller panel of judges being called up for any one particular case from a larger pool of eligible judges. For the JCPC, five judges normally sit on appeals from Commonwealth countries, while three to five judges normally sit on the CCJ for cases, although at times all the eligible judges have sat for a case.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nA major difference though is in the pool of eligible justices from which the deciding panel is called. For the JCPC has no explicit limit on the number of eligible jurists, while for the CCJ the initial limit is nine judges other than the president (though this limit may be increased by the agreement of all the member states). The actual number of judges eligible for JCPC at any given time is actually difficult to determine with one 2009 estimate having ninety-five jurists, of which only three were Caribbean judges. The primary decision makers in the JCPC's pool are the privy councillors who also serve as judges on the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] and tend to be the only ones listed on the JCPC's website.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> No Caribbean judges, however, have sat on the JCPC since 2009 when the JCPC was co-located with the new UK Supreme Court.<ref name=\"FDI Scare?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/business/Leaving-the-Privy-Council-could-hit-foreign-direct-investment_18418081|title=Leaving the Privy Council could hit foreign direct investment - Business|first=Jamaica Observer|last=Limited|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the JCPC's employment of a large pool of jurists but usage of only a fraction of them, the JCPC has been criticized for the fact that decisions for any one case often depends on the judges called. The possible combinations of judges available means that different decisions can be rendered for very similar fact patterns in cases.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> This issue becomes particularly relevant when an appeal comes from a Caribbean country as it may be difficult for judgments to be handed down based on the nuances of Caribbean society when it is unlikely that a majority of judges on the panel for a case would come from the Caribbean.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> As one Caribbean lawyer lobbyist<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> (initially an opponent of the CCJ) noted: \"What is the \u201creasonable man\u201d test in the Caribbean? Acts of provocation in England and the Caribbean may not be the same....... In the Caribbean, even express words may have different connotations. These are the types of questions that need to be discussed by an indigenous tribunal...\"<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/><ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\n==== Cost comparisons for litigants and states ====\n\nAs comparable appellate courts, the CCJ and JCPC as outlined above have similar procedures, but there are major differences in both the time and money that would need to be spent by individual litigants and states in pursuing cases to either court.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nIndividual litigants are expected to almost always face reductions in the costs associated with pursuing their cases whenever a switch to the CCJ is made. For instance the cost of filing an appeal with the JCPC is more than five times greater than filing an appeal with the CCJ. For the JCPC, the filing of an application for permission to appeal along with the actual notice of appeal would have cost \u00a3220, or roughly US$350 in 2013, while the CCJ requires no payment for filing an application for permission to appeal and the cost for filing a notice of appeal was US$60.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> In 2015, the new filing fees for the JCPC were noted as ranging from between \u00a3400 to a \u00a35,000 or roughly US$600 to US$7,500 while the comparable fees for the CCJ remained at US$60<ref name=\"Jamaicans to get legal aid to access CCJ\">{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20151017/jamaicans-get-legal-aid-ccj|title=Jamaicans to get legal aid to CCJ|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> thus making the cost of filing an appeal with the JCPC at least ten times greater than filing an appeal with the CCJ.\n\nAlthough both courts do allow appeals ''[[in forma pauperis]]'', waiving filing fees when they are deemed too burdensome on the individual litigant,<ref name=\"CCJ: Who Stands to Gain?\"/> the JCPC does so on a more limited basis.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nSome of the highest costs for litigants however arise when litigation of the case actually begins. In most cases, litigants will have to travel to the United Kingdom (UK) to pursue their cases before the JCPC. This may involve purchasing plane tickets and/or finding and hiring lawyers licensed in the UK.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> Additionally, [[Visa policy of the United Kingdom|Jamaican and Guyanese citizens are required to obtain visas before travelling to the UK]], and for these citizens the cost of a UK visa would range from \u00a385 to \u00a3737 (or US$131 to US$1,138) depending on the type of visitor visa applied for.<ref name=\"UK visa costs\">[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/419449/fees_table_for_website_2015_03_30.pdf Home Office: Immigration and Nationality Fees, 6 April 2015]</ref> Regardless of whether or not a visa is required, all litigants would also have to pay for accommodation and any other necessary expenses in the UK for the duration of the litigation.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/><ref name=\"Privy Council does cost something\">{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20120109/cleisure/cleisure3.html|title=Privy Council does cost something|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> All of this adds up as a very expensive appeals process; one estimate placed the average total cost between US$57,000<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/><ref name=\"Privy Council should sit in Mauritius in September\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/article/privy-council-should-hold-sittings-mauritius-next-september|title=The Privy Council should hold sittings in Mauritius as from next September|date=13 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> and US$87,500.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/><ref name=\"Cannot Wait\">{{cite web|url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/19991214/f4.html|title='We cannot wait until everything is state of the art...' - Dec 14, 1999 - Jamaica Gleaner|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> Given the generally low number of appeals coming from the smaller CARICOM states<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/> and sometimes from larger CARICOM states such as Jamaica,<ref name=\"Too little from London Law Lords\">{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20140518/lead/lead3.html|title=Too little from London law lords|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> in effect the local courts of appeal are the courts of last resort for the majority of CARICOM litigants who cannot afford to take their appeals to the JCPC and must therefore be satisfied with the judgments of the local courts of appeal.<ref name=\"Promoting the CCJ as the final court of appeal\"/>\n\nAs a result, the JCPC has only really been accessible to either the very wealthy from the Caribbean or to certain inmates on death row who are able to secure ''pro bono'' legal service from British barristers.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> In the case of those nationals, such as Jamaicans, who also require visas in order to travel to the UK to pursue cases before the JCPC, there is the risk that the denial of the visa could negatively impact on the ability for their cases to be heard, thus further reducing potential accessibility (especially if the work load is not sufficient to justify the JCPC travelling to their jurisdiction instead).<ref name=\"How many could really go?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/How-many-of-us-could-really-go-to-the-Privy-Council--Holness-_18974604|title=How many of us could really go to the Privy Council, Holness?

D\u00e1vila]</ref> Under the common law, the right of appeal does not exist for all cases and instead must be specially conferred. This is done consequently as appeals \"as of right\" and \"as of leave\" (where leave is required by the local Court of Appeal or the JCPC itself).<ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/>\n\nFirstly, appeals to the JCPC in civil proceedings lie at the discretion of the local court where the case at hand is one of 'great general public importance or otherwise ought to be submitted to Her Majesty in Council for decision'<ref name=\"Replacing the Privy Council in the OECS\"/> and where an amount or in dispute or claim (including property) is of, or exceeds, the prescribed statutory value.<ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/> In criminal matters, the JCPC will not intervene unless it can be demonstrated that some serious miscarriage of justice has occurred through violation of the principles of natural justice; violation the due process of law or other serious injustice.<ref name=\"Replacing the Privy Council in the OECS\"/> This is as a result of the JCPC not being designed to function as a second tier Court of Appeal to review the evidence of a given case.<ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/>\n\nThe structural and practical limitations of JCPC appeals has meant that the range of precedent generated by the highest court for many Caribbean jurisdictions is confined to narrow categories, particularly capital punishment and high finance. The wide body of law between these categories, has often been left mainly to small domestic courts in the Caribbean. Thus different decisions have been more likely to be rendered for similar fact patterns, creating inconsistencies in how laws are interpreted across the region.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nThe CCJ's structure and appellate jurisdiction, however, address this issue by providing a forum for the creation of jurisprudence in the gap in Caribbean law where the JCPC was never able to rule upon while also ruling on the area of law the JCPC specializes in. In the three years following the CCJ's inauguration, civil appeals petitioned to the court outnumbered criminal appeals by nearly seven to one, with half of the civil appeals coming from appellants the CCJ deemed too poor to pay for the filing costs. By contrast, under the JCPC, civil appeals have never outnumbered criminal appeals.<ref name=\"CCJ: Who Stands to Gain?\"/><ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/><ref name=\"Privy Council does cost something\"/> This combination of lower litigant cost for the CCJ, the Court's willingness to grant ''in forma pauperis'' and having a wider field of law to hear appeals on has enabled the CCJ to hear types of cases from the region that the JCPC has never known.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\nAlthough limited to only four states in its appellate jurisdiction at the moment, so far citizens of those states have been accessing the Court more than they did the JCPC. For Barbados there were eight appeals heard by the JCPC in the five years immediately prior to Barbados' accession to the appellate jurisdiction of the CCJ. In the five years that followed immediate after the switch to the CCJ, twelve appeals were heard from Barbados. Belize saw appeals roughly twice per year to the JCPC before switching to the CCJ in 2010<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> and subsequently saw 12 appeals in the four years since the first appeal to the CCJ from Belize in mid 2011.<ref name=\"CCJ: Appellate Judgments\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/judgments-proceedings/appellate-jurisdiction-judgments|title=The Caribbean Court of Justice  \u00bb Appellate Jurisdiction Judgments|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> While Guyana originally abolished appeals to the JCPC in 1970, since adopting the CCJ, appeals to that Court have been exponentially increasing.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/>\n\n==Jurisdiction by country and institution==\n\n===Bahamas===\nIn 2011, Bahamian Chief Justice Sir Michael Barnett said The Bahamas should eventually abandon the Privy Council as the final court of appeal and move toward the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ). While that decision would be up to the government of The Bahamas, Sir Michael said there is a \u201cpowerful argument to moving eventually toward the CCJ\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhether we do that now is a matter for political debate and a matter that [the government] will have to discuss and consider,\u201d Sir Michael told the Nassau Guardian following the opening ceremony of the Caribbean Association of Judicial Officers Conference.\n\n\u201cI have my own views and I think it\u2019s almost a natural progression of our constitutional development that we move away from the Privy Council and I think the Caribbean Court of Justice is likely to be the alternative to the Privy Council. I think that as a part of our constitutional development it\u2019s almost inevitable that we move away from the Privy Council like lots of other countries, including Australia and New Zealand.\u201d\n\nSir Michael said while the Privy Council has been useful, the CCJ would better serve the country's needs. \"It's a regional court but it's also part of our development as a nation that we look to our own court for the resolution of disputes.\"\n\nSome proponents in The Bahamas wishing to sever links with the Privy Council are in favour of joining the CCJ, perhaps by having a dual final court of appeal system in the country with the Privy Council for civil and commercial matters and the CCJ for criminal matters.\n\n===Barbados===\nBarbados recognizes the court for original and final jurisdictions. In 2003 the Parliament of Barbados passed the ''Caribbean Court of Justice Act'' and the ''Constitution (Amendment) Act'', and they were brought into force by Proclamation on 8 April 2005.\n\n===Belize===\nBelizean legislation to recognize the CCJ was tied up for some years in partisan politics. In 2007, the [[People's United Party]] (PUP)-led government introduced the Caribbean Court of Justice Bill, but due to the opposition of [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) members, it did not achieve the required three-fourths majority. This led to mutual recriminations, with PM [[Said Musa]] accusing the UDP of being anti-Caribbean, while the UDP complained of the PUP's attempts to tie the CCJ Bill to the Coast Guard Bill, which the UDP supported.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=6427|title=UDP says nay to CCJ|periodical=[[Amandala]]|date=21 December 2007|accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref> The [[Belizean general election, 2008]] resulted in the UDP taking power; new PM [[Dean Barrow]] then tabled the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160111012617/http://www.belize.org/bcci/resourcesmodule/download_resource/id/11/src/@random4a8449b6e4dc7/ Belize Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Bill], which aside from replacing the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with the CCJ, would also have removed the prohibition against [[multiple citizenship|dual citizens]] being elected to the [[National Assembly of Belize|National Assembly]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=14280|title=Belize Constitution Seventh Amendment Bill Tabled|work=7 News Belize|date=19 June 2009|accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref> This time the PUP blocked passage of the constitutional amendment until the dual citizenship provision was removed; after this was done, the bill passed in February 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=9589|first=Adele|last=Ramos|title=Belize Senate approves Caribbean Court of Justice|work=[[Amandala]]|date=26 February 2010|accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref> After the passage of the bill, PM Barrow signed the order in May 2010 to abolish appeals to the Privy Council beginning on 1 June that year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/news/crime-court-law/good-bye-belize-abolishes-all-appeals-to-privy-council/|title=Good Bye: Belize abolishes all appeals to Privy Council|work=Dominica News Online|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Jamaica ===\n\nThe [[Jamaica Labour Party]] opposed granting CCJ full powers on the basis that it was a [[Hanging judge|hanging court]].<ref name=\"CCJ Wall\">{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20150204/cleisure/cleisure3.html|title=Tear down that CCJ wall|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"the JLP and the CCJ\">{{cite web|url=https://constructedthoughts.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/the-jlp-and-the-ccj/|title=The JLP and The CCJ|first=Mr|last=Editor|date=25 June 2012|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> In February, 2005, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] declared that the CCJ-related companion bills passed by the [[Parliament of Jamaica|Jamaican Parliament]] in 2004 were unconstitutional and therefore void.

Where there is no difference in seniority among the Judges, one of the Judges will simply be selected by the Heads of Government to perform the role of President in the event of a vacancy in Presidency or the inability of the President to perform the functions of office.<ref name=\"CCJ Agreement\"/>\n\nThe President may only serve for one, non-renewable 7-year term or until the age of 72 (whichever is earlier)<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/><ref name=\"CCJ Agreement\"/> but is allowed to continue in office, if necessary for a further three months in order to deliver a judgment or to do any other thing in proceedings that he or she has heard.<ref name=\"CCJ Agreement\"/> As with the other Judges, during the evolutionary phase of the Court (that is until the full complement of 9 Judges plus the President have been appointed), the RJLSC may extend the tenure of the President until the age of 75 or until seven years in office have been reached, whichever comes first.<ref name=\"CCJ Agreement Protocol\"/>\n\n==Seat and itinerancy==\nArticle III of the Agreement establishing the CCJ provides that The Seat of the Court shall be in the territory of a Contracting Party as determined by a qualified majority of the Contracting Parties.<ref name=\"CCJ Agreement\"/><ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/>\n\nIn 1999, Trinidad and Tobago signed an Agreement with the Caribbean Community establishing the seat of the CCJ and the offices of the RJLSC in that country.<ref name=\"1999 Seat Agreement\">[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/secretariat/legal_instruments/ccj_seat.jsp?menu=secretariat Agreement establishing the Seat of the Caribbean Court of Justice and the Offices of the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission between the Government of Trinidad & Tobago and the Caribbean Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111012617/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/secretariat/legal_instruments/ccj_seat.jsp?menu=secretariat |date=11 January 2016 }}</ref> This followed from the decision of the Contracting Parties for Trinidad and Tobago to serve as the headquarters<ref name=\"1999 Seat Agreement\"/> of the court in the 1990s and the promotion by Basdeo Panday (then Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago) of the CCJ and his desire to seek agreement with the Opposition to give effect to the Agreement establishing the CCJ and for Trinidad and Tobago to effectively act as the base for the Court.<ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/>\n\nIn 2005, a broadly identical Agreement was signed between Trinidad and Tobago and the newly established CCJ and RJLSC establishing the seat of the CCJ and Offices of the RJLSC in Trinidad and Tobago<ref name=\"2005 Seat Agreement\">[http://www.caribbeancourtofjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ccj_seat.pdf Agreement establishing the Seat of the Caribbean Court of Justice and the Offices of the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission between the Government of Trinidad & Tobago and the Caribbean Court of Justice and the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission]</ref> as was required under Article III of the Agreement establishing the CCJ itself.<ref name=\"CCJ Agreement\"/>\n\nWhile having a seat in Trinidad, the Court is also given the authority (under the same Article III of the Agreement establishing the CCJ) to sit, as circumstances warrant, in the territory of any other Contracting Party.<ref name=\"CCJ Agreement\"/><ref name=\"Commonwealth Caribbean Law\"/> This itinerant ability, coupled with the Court's use of electronic and teleconferencing facilities, makes travel to the seat of the Court unnecessary in some cases.<ref name=\"CCJ Comparative Study\"/> This is especially true for cases where litigants may be unable to afford the cost of appearing before the seat of the Court and electronic and teleconferencing facilities are inadequate for the task.

The Court noted the clear intentions in the transitional provisions that the substitution of a right of appeal to the CCJ in place of the previous right of appeal to the JCPC, should apply to pending proceedings except in the circumstances spelt out in the provisions themselves. Similar to the JCPC, and based on the provisions which allow for special leave to appeal to the CCJ directly as of right in certain limited instances, the Court established that it will grant special leave to appeal if there is an egregious error of law, a substantial miscarriage of justice or real risk that a serious miscarriage of justice will result if the appeal is not fully and finally ventilated before the Court. Sir Henry de B. Forde Q.C., Mr. Hal Gollop and Mr. C. Anthony Audain for the Applicant. Mr. Clement E. Lashley Q.C., Mr. David J.H. Thompson, Ms. Onika E. Stewart and Ms. Shaunita Jordan for the Respondents.\n\n===Right of registered or incorporated companies to approach the Court directly===\n\n* ''Trinidad Cement Limited and TCL Guyana Incorporated v Republic of Guyana'' [2009] CCJ 1 (OJ): The Court held that for a company to fall within the meaning of the phrase \u201cpersons, natural or juridical, of a Contracting Party\u201d of Article 222 of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas (RTC) and thus have ''[[locus standi]]'', it is sufficient for such a company to be incorporated or registered in a Contracting Party to the Agreement establishing the CCJ. This judgement was made following the decision of the Court to adjourn the application for special leave made by Trinidad Cement Limited and TCL Guyana Incorporated in ''Trinidad Cement Limited and TCL Guyana Incorporated v Republic of Guyana'' [2008] CCJ 1 (OJ) to allow the Community and the Member States parties to the RTC the opportunity to make written legal submissions on the issues before making a determination on the application for special leave. This was the first matter to appear before the CCJ in its original jurisdiction. Dr C Denbow SC for the Applicants. Mr D Singh SC for the Respondent.\n\n===State liability===\n\n* ''Trinidad Cement Limited and TCL Guyana Incorporated v Republic of Guyana'' [2009] CCJ 5 (OJ); 75 WIR 327: The Court accepted the principle that a State may incur non-contractual liability for damages for breach of the Revised Treaty. The Court held that the new single Market based on the rule of law implies the remedy of compensation where rights which enure to individuals and private entities under the treaty are infringed by a Member State. It held however that State liability in damages is not automatic and that it requires demonstration that the treaty provision allegedly breached was intending to benefit the party, that the breach is serious, that there is substantial loss, and that there is a causal link between the breach by the State and the damage or loss to the party. Dr C Denbow SC for the Claimants. Professor K Massiah SC and Mr Kamal Ramkarran for the Defendant.\n\n===The power to correct any injustice caused by the Court itself===\n\n* ''Brown v Moore-Griffith and others'' (No 2)[2013] CCJ 12 (AJ); 84 WIR 76: The Court accepted the argument by the Applicant that it had an unfettered power to correct any injustice caused by an earlier order it had made. It was an underlying common law principle that courts of final appeal had an inherent power to correct any breach of Natural Justice caused by an earlier hearing of the same final court of appeal, where a party through no fault of their own, had been subject to an unfair procedure. The exercise of that jurisdiction was necessary to ensure justice between litigants and public confidence in the administration of justice. Lalu Hanuman for the Applicant. Clement Lashley QC and Honor Chase for the Respondents.\n\n===Right of entry by CARICOM Nationals===\n\n* ''Myrie v State of Barbados'' [2013] CCJ 3 (OJ): The Court held that CARICOM nationals had a right to free movement within the Caribbean Community, specifically a right of entry without any form of harassment or impediment, based on the combined effect of Article 45 of the Revised Treaty and a Decision of the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community taken at their Twenty-Eighth Meeting in 2007 (\u201cthe 2007 Conference Decision\u201d). The Court noted that the 2007 Conference Decision was another step in furthering the fundamental goal of granting Community nationals the right to unrestricted access to, and movement within, the jurisdiction of Member States, subject to public interest considerations. The 2007 Conference Decision entitled every Community national to a \u201cdefinite entry\u201d of six months upon arrival in another Member State. The Court further noted that both the rights of establishment and of the provision of services, including services in the tourism sector, presume of necessity the right of movement of Community nationals without being obstructed by unreasonable restrictions. The Court further held that where a Community national is refused entry into a Member State on a legitimate ground, that national should be given the opportunity to consult an attorney or a consular official of his or her country or to contact a family member; and that Member States are required to give, promptly and in writing, the reasons for refusing entry to the Community national and to inform the refused national of his or her right to challenge the decision. Ms Michelle Brown and Ms Nancy Anderson for the Claimant. Mr Roger Forde, QC appearing together with Mr Patterson Cheltenham QC, Ms Donna Brathwaite, QC, Dr David Berry and Ms Nargis Hardyal for the Defendant.\n* ''Tomlinson v State of Belize and State of Trinidad & Tobago'' [2016] CCJ 1 (OJ): The Court fully endorsed its decision in the earlier Shanique Myrie case that the 2007 Conference Decision created a binding obligation on the Member States to allow all CARICOM nationals hassle free entry and stay of six months upon arrival into their respective territories, subject to two exceptions: the right of Member States to refuse entry to \u201cundesirable persons\u201d and their right to prevent persons from becoming a charge on public funds. The Court agreed with the States that homosexuals, as such, cannot be categorised as \u2018undesirable persons\u2019 and concluded that homosexual CARICOM nationals have a right to freedom of movement on the same terms as any other CARICOM national. The Court held however, that Mr. Tomlinson was not in danger of being prejudiced (and the States' obligations were not breached) by the mere existence of statutory provisions in the Immigration Acts of Belize and Trinidad and Tobago for a number of reasons relating to the proper interpretation of those Acts themselves and in conjunction with other relevant legislation including: (1) section 64(1) of Belize's Interpretation Act; (2) section 3(2) of the Caribbean Community Act, 2004 of Belize; (3) the Preamble of the 1976 Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago; (4)  section 4 the 1976 Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago; (5) relevant state practice,  particularly the 2004 amendment to the Extradition (Commonwealth and Foreign Territories) Act, 1985; (6) the Data Protection Act 2011 of Trinidad and Tobago; (7) section 3 of the Immigration(Caribbean Community Skilled Nationals) Act 1996 of Trinidad and Tobago which requires an immigration officer to permit entry into Trinidad and Tobago of skilled CARICOM nationals who present a skills certificate, \u201cnotwithstanding any other written law\u201d (as, for example, section 8 of the Immigration Act); and (7) Article 9 of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas as transformed into the domestic law of Trinidad and Tobago through the Caribbean Community Act, 2005. The Court also accepted the argument posited by Trinidad and Tobago, that despite the formal prohibition in section 8 of its Immigration Act, the prohibition does not apply to CARICOM nationals who are homosexual as part of an official policy. The Court however cautioned that member states should strive to ensure that national laws, subsidiary legislation and administrative practices are consistent with, and transparent in their support of, the right of all CARCICOM nationals to move freely. The Court ultimately dismissed Mr Tomlinson's claims against Belize and Trinidad and Tobago and refused the requested remedies. Noting the importance of having novel issues of Community law ventilated before the CCJ, the Court ordered that each party pay its own costs. Mr Douglas Mendes SC, appearing with Mr. Westmin R.A. James and Mr. Imran Ali, Attorneys-at-Law, for the Claimant. Ms Anika Jackson, Solicitor General of Belize, appearing with Mr Nigel Hawke, Deputy Solicitor General and Ms Samantha Matute, Attorneys-at-Law for the first Defendant (the State of Belize) and Mr Seenath Jairam SC, appearing with Mr Wayne D Sturge, Mr Gerald Ramdeen, Mr Kashka Hemans, Ms Deowattee Dilraj-Batoosingh and Ms Lesley Almarales, Attorneys-at-Law for the second Defendant (the State of Trinidad and Tobago).\n* ''Bain v State of Trinidad & Tobago'' [2019] CCJ 3 (OJ): The Court held that for CARICOM nationals to exercise their important rights to free movement within the Caribbean Community including a right of entry without any form of harassment or impediment, clear documentary evidence of their nationality is required. The Court further held that the onus of proof is on the intended entrant to show forthwith the clear documentary evidence that he or she is entitled to seek entry to another Member State as a CARICOM national with rights under the Revised Treaty. The Court also noted that a person holding dual nationality has two citizenships existing side by side and as such, the exercise of rights attached to one nationality does not eliminate the right to exercise rights attached to the other nationality. Thus the Court did not consider that the Claimant had waived his Treaty rights as a national of a CARICOM State when he presented himself to the Defendant's immigration officials on arrival as a United States national, producing his American passport to support his completed immigration form. The Court found that the presentation of a Driver's Licence or a Voter's Identification Card was not sufficient to provide conclusive evidence of nationality for the purpose of exercising Treaty rights. The Court reasoned that the function of a driver's licence and voter's identification card were to permit driving or voting, respectively, in the issuing territory, not to establish or provide evidence of citizenship. The Court also reasoned that these documents were not machine-readable nor designed to be stamped with dates of entry and exit by immigration officials and further reasoned that a notation in a non-CARICOM passport of birth by the holder in a CARICOM Member State was insufficient as evidence because birth in a country does not automatically evidence citizenship and because such citizenship, even if held at birth, could have been renounced or been stripped away by the government. Mr Ruggles Ferguson, Mr. Ferron Lowe and Mr. Patrick Superville, Attorneys-at-Law, for the Claimant. Mr Rishi P. A. Dass, Ms Sasha Sukhram and Mr Sean Julien, Attorneys-at-Law, for the Defendant.\n\n===Indigenous people's land rights===\n\n* ''The Maya Leaders Alliance & others v. The Attorney General of Belize'' [2015] CCJ 15 (AJ): In a much-awaited decision, on 22 April 2015, the Court affirmed the rights of the Mayan indigenous communities over their traditional lands in Belize. The case concerned the rights to land of the Mayan communities of the Toledo District in southern Belize who have been fighting to their rights over traditional lands recognized and protected before international courts and Belizean courts for the past two decades. The appeal was brought by 25 appellants who are members of the Maya community of the Toledo District. Their appeal before the CCJ arose out of litigation precipitated by an incursion onto farm lands in the Golden Stream village by Mr Francis Johnson, now deceased. While this appeal was being heard by the CCJ in Belize, the Appellants and the Government entered into a Consent Order on April 22, 2015 which recognized that the Maya system of customary land tenure gives rise to property rights within the meaning of the Constitution of Belize. The Consent Order also requires the Government to develop of a mechanism to recognise and protect Maya land rights in consultation with the Maya people. Under the Consent Order, the CCJ was asked to decide whether the Appellants should be granted damages for breach of constitutional rights. The Court found that the Government of Belize breached the Appellants\u2019 right to protection of the law by failing to ensure that the existing property regime, inherited from the pre-independence colonial system, recognized and protected Maya land rights. The Court could not find sufficient evidence to support the Appellants' claim for special damages arising out of the Golden Stream incursion, but felt that innovative use should be made of the remedial reparatory action under the Consent Order to grant redress under the Constitution based on the centuries of oppression and marginalisation of the Maya people. Therefore, the Court ordered the Government of Belize to establish a fund of BZ$300,000.00 as a first step towards compliance with its obligations under the Consent Order. Ms Monica Coc Magnusson for the Appellants. Mr Denys Barrow SC, Mr Nigel Hawke and Ms Naima Barrow for the Respondent.\n\n===Voting rights, procedures and required majorities in Ministerial Councils of CARICOM<ref name='Cement Case CCJ Importance'>[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20190927/cement-case-affirms-ccj-importance-caricom-part-2 Cement Case affirms CCJ importance to CARICOM]</ref>===\n\n* ''Trinidad Cement Limited and others v State of Trinidad & Tobago and others'' [2019] CCJ 4 (OJ): In a consolidation of four separate cases of a long-running spat involving regional cement manufacturers and cement importers, the Court's decision clarified a number of procedural issues related to the CARICOM's ministerial councils as well Member State obligation to give the [[Caribbean_Community#Community_Council|Council for Trade and Economic Development (COTED)]] adequate notice of any decision to revert to the Common External Tariff (CET) from any agreed upon prior derogation from the same. It was held that a Member State did not need approval from COTED for a decision to revert to the CET. It was further held by the Court that as there are 13 Member States who are parties to the Revised Treaty and to the Single Market and Economy established by that treaty, but an additional 2 Member States (The Bahamas and Montserrat) who are members according to the terms of their bilateral agreements with CARICOM which provided for them to remain members of the Community in accordance with the terms and conditions existing immediately prior to the entry into force of the Revised Treaty then the Article 27 right for Members to cast a vote on the decisions of COTED must be read in light of these facts. As such The Bahamas does not have the right to vote on matters such as that which concerned the COTED classification decision as under the arrangements prior to the entry into force of the Revised Treaty it did not participate in or have votes on decisions of the Common Market which preceded the current Single Market. Thus for decisions in COTED the 14 other Member States were entitled to a vote, and for such to decisions to be valid according to Article 29 of the Revised Treaty, at least three-quarters of the votes (that is 11 Members) are needed for the required qualified majority. Mr Reginald T. A. Armour, SC, Mr Gilbert Peterson SC, Mr Gregory Pantin, Mr Miguel Vasquez and Mr Raphael Ajodhia for the first Claimants (Trinidad Cement Limited and Arawak Cement Company Limited) and  Mr Allan Wood QC and Ms Symone Mayhew for the second Claimaints (Rock Hard Cement Limited and Rock Hard Distribution Limited). Mrs Deborah Peake, SC, Ms Tamara Toolsie, Mr Brent James and Ms. Radha Sookdeo for the first Respondent (State of Trinidad & Tobago) and Ms Donna Brathwaite, QC, and Ms Gayl Scott for the second Respondent (State of Barbados) and  Dr Corlita Babb-Schaefer and Mr O\u2019Neil Francis for the third Respondent (The Caribbean Community).\n\n===Lawfulness of opt-outs and non-reciprocity in regards to the benefits of Community decisions===\n\n* ''Lawfulness of opt-outs and the principle of non-reciprocity concerning a decision of the Conference to enlarge the classes of persons entitled to move and work freely in the Community (Request for an Advisory Opinion)'' [2020] CCJ 1 (OJ) (AO): In a historic judgement, the Court delivered its first ever advisory opinion pursuant to Article 212 of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas and the Court's own Rules. Following the request for such an opinion by the Secretary-General of the Community in March 2019 and oral hearings for the case in October 2019, the Court presented its opinion on 18 March 2020. The case centred on two questions that the Conference of Heads of Governments had agreed to ask of the Court at their 30th Inter-Sessional Meeting in February 2019, wherein it was agreed to allow two Member States to opt-out (for a period of five year) of a recent decision by the Conference to enlarge the categories of skilled CARICOM nationals entitled free movement in Community to include security guards and agricultural workers. The questions were: (1) whether a Member State can, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Revised Treaty, lawfully opt out of a decision of the Conference to increase the classes of persons entitled to move and work freely in the Community; and (2) whether the principle of non-reciprocity would enable nationals of the opting out Member States to derive the benefits arising from the decision notwithstanding the opt outs. whether the principle of non-reciprocity would enable nationals of the opting out Member States to still derive the benefits accruing under the enlargement decision In regards to the first question, the Court opined that for the specific opt out referred to it was lawful for the two Member States to request it and for the Conference to grant it as the opt outs did not prejudice the fundamental objective of the Community of freedom of movement for skilled nationals. More generally, the Court noted that opt outs can be granted in relation to any decision of any competent Organ of the Community, but that five conditions have to be accounted for in the effective implementation of any opt out. These five conditions were (i) one or more Member States must first request to opt out of a decision, (ii) the decision must be made by a competent Community Organ, (iii) it is the Conference that must agree to the opt out request for relevant decision, even if that decision was taken by another competent Organ, (iv) the Member State opting out can only opt out of the obligations arising from the decision, and (v) the opt out does not prejudice the fundamental objectives of the Community. In regards to the second question, the Court opined that as the general legal order created by the Revised Treaty requires the universal application of the rights and obligations arising out it; and as the relevant Article of the Treaty (Article 27(4)) derogates from the principle of reciprocity by only specifying that a Member State may opt out of the obligations arising from a decision by a competent Community Organ; and that Article 8 of the Revised Treaty requires each Member State to accord to another Member State treatment no less favourable than that accorded to any other third Member State then generally opt outs are to be treated as a non-reciprocal in nature. As a result, more specifically, the Court advised that this principle of nonreciprocity applies so that nationals of the two Member States opting out of the decision to enlarge the categories for freedom of movement who are security guards and agricultural workers are entitled to enjoy the benefits of that decision.

{"title_page": "Particle tracking velocimetry", "text_new": "'''Particle tracking velocimetry''' ('''PTV''') is a [[velocimetry]] method i.e. a technique to measure velocities and trajectories of moving objects. In fluid mechanics research these objects are neutrally buoyant [[particle]]s that are suspended in fluid flow. As the name suggests, individual particles are tracked, so this technique is a Lagrangian approach, in contrast to [[particle image velocimetry]] (PIV), which is an Eulerian method that measures the velocity the fluid as it passes the observation point, that is fixed in space. There are two experimental PTV methods: \n* the two-dimensional (2-D) PTV. Measurements are made in a 2-D slice, illuminated by a thin [[laser]] sheet (a thin plane); a low density of seeded particles allows for tracking each of them individually for several frames.\n* the three-dimensional ''particle tracking velocimetry'' (3-D PTV) is a distinctive experimental technique originally developed to study fully turbulent flows. It is now being used widely in various disciplines, ranging from structural mechanics research to medicine and industrial environments. It is based on a multiple camera-system in a stereoscopic arrangement, three-dimensional illumination of an observation volume, recording of the time sequence of stereoscopic images of optical targets (flow tracers illuminated particles), determining their instantaneous 3-D position in space by use of photogrammetric techniques and tracking their movement in time,  thus obtaining a set of 3-D trajectories of the optical targets.\n\n==Description==\n\n\n\nThe 3-D particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) belongs to the class of whole-field velocimetry techniques used in the study of turbulent flows, allowing the determination of instantaneous velocity and vorticity distributions over two or three spatial dimensions. 3-D PTV yields a time series of instantaneous 3-component velocity vectors in the form of fluid element trajectories. At any instant, the data density can easily exceed 10 velocity vectors per cubic centimeter. The method is based on stereoscopic imaging (using 2 to 4 cameras) and synchronous recording of the motion of flow tracers, i.e. small particles suspended in the flow, illuminated by a strobed light source. The 3-D particle coordinates as a function of time are then derived by use of image & photogrammetric analysis of each stereoscopic set of frames.  The 3-D particle positions are tracked in the time domain to derive the particle trajectories. The ability to follow (track) a spatially dense set of individual particles for a sufficiently long period of time, and to perform statistical analysis of their properties, permits a Lagrangian description of the turbulent flow process. This is a unique advantage of the 3-D PTV method.\n\nA typical implementation of the 3D-PTV consists of two, three or four digital cameras, installed in an angular configuration and synchronously recording the [[diffracted]] or [[fluorescent]] light from the flow tracers seeded in the flow. The flow is illuminated by a collimated laser beam, or by another source of light that is often strobed, synchronously with the camera frame rate, to reduce the effective exposure time of the moving optical targets and \"freeze\" their position on each frame. There is no restriction on the light to be [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] or [[monochromatic]];  only its [[illuminance]] has to be sufficient for imaging the tracer particles in the observational volume. Particles or tracers could be [[fluorescent]], [[diffractive]], tracked through as many consecutive frames as possible, and on as many cameras as possible to maximize positioning accuracy. In principle, two cameras in a stereoscopic configuration are sufficient in order to determine the three coordinates of a particle in space, but in most practical situations three or four cameras are used to reach a satisfactory 3-D positioning accuracy, as well as increase the trajectory yield when studying fully turbulent flows.\n\n==3D-PTV schemes==\n\nSeveral versions of 3D-PTV schemes exist.
