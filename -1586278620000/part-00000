Maryam Amid was born in Semnan and studied primary education with her father. Later, she learned French and photography. At the age of 16, she married Hosseinfli Mirza Emad al-Saltanah Salvar, one of the princes during the Qajar period.  After only one year of marriage, Miryam secured a divorce. \n\nSeven years later, Maryam married a contemporary intellectual named Qawamul Hakmah.

Shokouefeh provided the opportunity for both women and men to be informed about [[Women's rights|equal rights]]. Additionally, Maryam established two branches of a modern school named Dokhetaran Dar al-'Elm and Sanuayeh Maziniyeh. She was also a member of the [[Women's rights in Iran|Women's Rights]] Activists Association, which promoted the use of domestic goods and encouraged the acquisition of handicrafts by men. She translated several French books into the [[Persian language]].\n\n== The establishment of a girls\u2019 school ==\nThe establishment of a [[Single-sex education|girls' school]] was one of the lasting and enduring works of Maryam Amid. In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.\n\nDue to patriarchal circumstances and the reluctance of families to educate their daughters, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying the student registration fee. This was done for one out of every two students and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school till the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches. One of the branches was Dar al-'Elm and various sciences (Such as reading and writing to mathematics and geography and foreign language training) were taught, and the condition of admission was passing a test held by the Ministry of Education. This school was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh. The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in the Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>\n\n== First Iranian woman journalist ==\nAt a time when reading and writing were uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]].

This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.\n\nThe features of this newspaper were written in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.\n\n=== From copies to caricaturing\t===\nThe newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, originally consisted of four pages with the Traditional version in the writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters.

One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at that time the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. As a result, nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting against old traditions, especially among women was one of the activities of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to expose the voice of suppression and reactionary ideas.

Later IS-2 converted models were replaced with the [[122 mm gun M1931/37 (A-19)|122mm D-25T gun]] whilst retaining the same hull.]]\nThe [[Kliment Voroshilov tank|KV-1]] was criticized by its crews for its poor mobility and the lack of a larger caliber gun than the [[T-34]] medium tank. It was much more expensive than the T-34, without having greater combat performance. Moscow ordered some KV-1 assembly lines to shift to T-34 production, leading to fears that KV-1 production would be halted and the SKB-2 design bureau, led by Kotin, closed.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=4}} In 1942, this problem was partially addressed by the KV-1S tank, which had thinner armor than the original, making it lighter and faster. It was competitive with the T-34 but at the cost of no longer having the heavier armor. Production of the KV-1S was gradually replaced by the [[SU-152]]{{Sfn|Zaloga|1996|p=44}} and ended in April 1943.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1996|p=42}}\n\nThe capture of a German [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tank in January 1943 led to a decision to develop a new heavy tank, which was given the codename Object 237.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=5}} Before Object 237 had time to mature, intense tank fighting in the summer of 1943 demanded a response. Dukhov's team was instructed to create a [[wikt:stopgap#Pronunciation|stopgap]] KV tank, the KV-85, which was armed with the [[85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K)|52-K]]-derivative gun of the [[SU-85]], the 85&nbsp;mm D-5T, that proved capable of penetrating the [[Tiger I]] from {{convert|1000|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The KV-85 was created by mounting an Object 237 turret on a KV-1S hull. To accommodate the Object 237 turret, the KV-1S hull was modified, increasing the diameter of the turret ring with fillets on the sides of the hull. The radio operator was replaced with an ammunition rack for the larger 85&nbsp;mm ammunition. The hull MG was then moved to the opposite side of the driver and fixed in place to be operated by the driver. From September to October 1943, a total of 130 KV-85s were produced, before the assembly lines began to shift over. Like the KV-1S, the KV-85 served in dwindling numbers and was quickly overshadowed by the superior IS series.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1996|p=45}}\n\nThe Object 237 prototype, a version of the cancelled [[KV-13]], was accepted for production as the '''IS-85''' heavy tank.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=6}} First deliveries were made in October 1943, and the tanks went immediately into service. Production ended in January 1944. Its designation was simplified to IS-1 after the introduction of the IS-122, later renamed as IS-2 for security purposes.\n\n===Object 240 IS-2===\n==== Gun ====\nBy 1943, engineers had succeeded in mounting the 85&nbsp;mm gun to the T-34 medium tank, making it as well-armed as the KV-85 heavy tank. Efforts to up-gun the IS-85 began in late 1943. Two candidate weapons were the D-25 122&nbsp;mm tank gun, the ballistic characteristics of which were identical to the [[122 mm gun M1931/37 (A-19)|A-19 122&nbsp;mm gun]],<ref name=Testing/> and the [[D-10 tank gun|D-10 100&nbsp;mm gun]], which was based on a naval [[dual-purpose gun]]. The D-10 had been designed for anti-tank fire and had better armor penetration than the A-19, but the smaller caliber meant it had a less useful [[High explosives|high explosive]] round. Also, the D-10 was a relatively new weapon in short supply, while there was excess production capacity for the A-19 and its ammunition. Compared to the older [[F-34 tank gun|F-34 76.2&nbsp;mm]] tank gun, the D-25 delivered 5.37 times the muzzle energy.\n\nAfter testing both the D-25 and D-10 on the IS-122, the former was selected as the main armament of the new tank. The D-25 used a separate shell and powder charge, resulting in a lower rate of fire compared to the single-piece ammunition used in most tanks, a serious disadvantage in tank-to-tank engagements. Soviet proving-ground tests showed that the D-25 could penetrate the front armor of the German [[Panther tank|Panther]] at {{convert|2500|m|yd|abbr=on}} while the D-10 could do so at a maximum range of {{convert|1500|m|yd|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Testing>{{cite web|title=Report on the results of testing of the 100 mm and the 122 mm tank guns at the Kubinka proving grounds|url=http://english.battlefield.ru/documents/29-technics/96-testing-100-mm-and-122-mm-tank-guns.html|website=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate=27 October 2014 |date=September 12, 1944 |last1=Tolochkov |last2=Volosatov}}</ref><ref>Zaloga 1984:172</ref> It was therefore considered an adequate anti-tank gun.

The 85&nbsp;mm guns could be reserved for the new T-34-85 medium tank and some of the IS-1s built were rearmed before leaving the factory and issued as IS-2s. It was slightly lighter and faster than the heaviest KV model 1942 tank, with thicker front armor and a much-improved turret design. The tank could carry thicker armor than the KV series, while remaining lighter, due to the better layout of the armor envelope. The KV's armor was less well-shaped and featured heavy armor even on the rear, while the IS series concentrated its armor at the front. The IS-2 was slightly heavier than the Panther, much lighter than the [[Tiger I]] and [[Tiger II]] and had a lower silhouette than both. Western observers tended to criticize Soviet tanks for their lack of finish and crude construction. The Soviets argued that it was warranted, considering the need for wartime expediency and the typically short battlefield life of their tanks.<ref>Perrett 1987:20</ref>\n\n[[File:IS-2 scheme of armour.jpg|thumb|Armor plan of IS-2, models 1943 (top) and 1944 (bottom).]]\nEarly IS-2s can be identified by the 'stepped' front hull casting with its small, opening driver's visor. The early tanks lacked gun tube travel locks or anti-aircraft-capable machine guns and had narrow mantlets.\n\nIn late 1944, the stepped hull front was replaced with an improved single casting of 120&nbsp;mm thickness angled at 60 degrees. This new nose lacked the opening driver's visor. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the IS-2M, but that designation actually refers to a much later modernization program from the 1950s. Other minor upgrades included the addition of a travel lock on the hull rear, wider mantlet and, on very late models, an [[DShK|anti-aircraft machine gun]].\n\nIn comparison to the Tiger I, the IS-2 had modest advantages in armour, even though it was 10 tons lighter<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zaloga|first1=Steven|title=IS-2 Heavy Tank 1944\u201373|date=1994|publisher=Osprey |page=25}}</ref> In 1944, IS-2 tank was the only large-scale Allied tank whose armor provided some protection from the well-known Tiger 88mm long-barreled guns and Panther 75mm L/70 guns.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the remaining IS-2 tanks (mostly model 1944 variants) were upgraded to the IS-2M standard, which introduced fittings such as external fuel tanks on the rear hull (the basic IS-2 had these only on the hull sides), stowage bins on both sides of the hull and protective skirting along the top edges of the [[Caterpillar track|tracks]].\n\n== Combat history ==\nThe IS-2 tank first saw combat in early 1944, equipping elite Guards Heavy Tank Regiments of the Red Army. A regiment had 21 IS-2 tanks in four companies of five tanks each and one being used by the regimental commander.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=8}} The special tank regiments were reserved for important attacks, often to spearhead attempts to break through fortified German positions like anti-tank defence lines and bunkers.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=8}} The tanks supporting infantry in the assault by destroying bunkers, buildings, dug-in weapons and engaging German armoured vehicles. Once a breakthrough was achieved, lighter and more mobile tanks were used for exploitation and mopping-up. The IS-2 tank first saw action in [[Ukraine]] in early 1944 and claimed to have destroyed more than forty Tigers and [[Elefant]]s for the loss of only eight tanks. While the German heavy tanks could knock out the IS-2, they had no real answer to its {{nowrap|122 mm}} gun, which easily outgunned them.<ref>Tiger I and Tiger II. [[Anthony Tucker-Jones]].

Later in the day, Soviet forces counter-attacked and seized the town of [[Ogl\u0119d\u00f3w]] and found three abandoned Tiger IIs.

In the late 1960s the remaining Soviet heavy tanks were transferred to Red Army reserve service and storage. The IS-2 Model 1944 remained in service much longer in the armies of [[Cuba]], [[China]] and [[North Korea]]. A regiment of Chinese IS-2s was available for use in the [[Korean War]] but saw no service there.\n\nAfter the Korean War, China attempted to reverse-engineer the IS-2/IS-3 as the Type 122 medium tank.

Later IS-2 converted models were replaced with the [[122 mm gun M1931/37 (A-19)|122mm D-25T gun]] whilst retaining the same hull.]]\nThe [[Kliment Voroshilov tank|KV-1]] was criticized by its crews for its poor mobility and the lack of a larger caliber gun than the [[T-34]] medium tank. It was much more expensive than the T-34, without having greater combat performance. Moscow ordered some KV-1 assembly lines to shift to T-34 production, leading to fears that KV-1 production would be halted and the SKB-2 design bureau, led by Kotin, closed.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=4}} In 1942, this problem was partially addressed by the KV-1S tank, which had thinner armor than the original, making it lighter and faster. It was competitive with the T-34 but at the cost of no longer having the heavier armor. Production of the KV-1S was gradually replaced by the [[SU-152]]{{Sfn|Zaloga|1996|p=44}} and ended in April 1943.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1996|p=42}}\n\nThe capture of a German [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tank in January 1943 led to a decision to develop a new heavy tank, which was given the codename Object 237.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=5}} Before Object 237 had time to mature, intense tank fighting in the summer of 1943 demanded a response. Dukhov's team was instructed to create a [[wikt:stopgap#Pronunciation|stopgap]] KV tank, the KV-85, which was armed with the [[85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K)|52-K]]-derivative gun of the [[SU-85]], the 85&nbsp;mm D-5T, that proved capable of penetrating the [[Tiger I]] from {{convert|1000|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The KV-85 was created by mounting an Object 237 turret on a KV-1S hull. To accommodate the Object 237 turret, the KV-1S hull was modified, increasing the diameter of the turret ring with fillets on the sides of the hull. The radio operator was replaced with an ammunition rack for the larger 85&nbsp;mm ammunition. The hull MG was then moved to the opposite side of the driver and fixed in place to be operated by the driver. From September to October 1943, a total of 130 KV-85s were produced, before the assembly lines began to shift over. Like the KV-1S, the KV-85 served in dwindling numbers and was quickly overshadowed by the superior IS series.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1996|p=45}}\n\nThe Object 237 prototype, a version of the cancelled [[KV-13]], was accepted for production as the '''IS-85''' heavy tank.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=6}} First deliveries were made in October 1943, and the tanks went immediately into service. Production ended in January 1944. Its designation was simplified to IS-1 after the introduction of the IS-122, later renamed as IS-2 for security purposes.\n\n===Object 240 IS-2===\n==== Gun ====\nBy 1943, engineers had succeeded in mounting the 85&nbsp;mm gun to the T-34 medium tank, making it as well-armed as the KV-85 heavy tank. Efforts to up-gun the IS-85 began in late 1943. Two candidate weapons were the D-25 122&nbsp;mm tank gun, the ballistic characteristics of which were identical to the [[122 mm gun M1931/37 (A-19)|A-19 122&nbsp;mm gun]],<ref name=Testing/> and the [[D-10 tank gun|D-10 100&nbsp;mm gun]], which was based on a naval [[dual-purpose gun]]. The D-10 had been designed for anti-tank fire and had better armor penetration than the A-19, but the smaller caliber meant it had a less useful [[High explosives|high explosive]] round. Also, the D-10 was a relatively new weapon in short supply, while there was excess production capacity for the A-19 and its ammunition. Compared to the older [[F-34 tank gun|F-34 76.2&nbsp;mm]] tank gun, the D-25 delivered 5.37 times the muzzle energy.\n\nAfter testing both the D-25 and D-10 on the IS-122, the former was selected as the main armament of the new tank. The D-25 used a separate shell and powder charge, resulting in a lower rate of fire compared to the single-piece ammunition used in most tanks, a serious disadvantage in tank-to-tank engagements. Soviet proving-ground tests showed that the D-25 could penetrate the front armor of the German [[Panther tank|Panther]] at {{convert|2500|m|yd|abbr=on}} while the D-10 could do so at a maximum range of {{convert|1500|m|yd|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Testing>{{cite web|title=Report on the results of testing of the 100 mm and the 122 mm tank guns at the Kubinka proving grounds|url=http://english.battlefield.ru/documents/29-technics/96-testing-100-mm-and-122-mm-tank-guns.html|website=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate=27 October 2014 |date=September 12, 1944 |last1=Tolochkov |last2=Volosatov}}</ref><ref>Zaloga 1984:172</ref> It was therefore considered an adequate anti-tank gun.

The 85&nbsp;mm guns could be reserved for the new T-34-85 medium tank and some of the IS-1s built were rearmed before leaving the factory and issued as IS-2s. It was slightly lighter and faster than the heaviest KV model 1942 tank, with thicker front armor and a much-improved turret design. The tank could carry thicker armor than the KV series, while remaining lighter, due to the better layout of the armor envelope. The KV's armor was less well-shaped and featured heavy armor even on the rear, while the IS series concentrated its armor at the front. The IS-2 was slightly heavier than the Panther, much lighter than the [[Tiger I]] and [[Tiger II]] and had a lower silhouette than both. Western observers tended to criticize Soviet tanks for their lack of finish and crude construction. The Soviets argued that it was warranted, considering the need for wartime expediency and the typically short battlefield life of their tanks.<ref>Perrett 1987:20</ref>\n\n[[File:IS-2 scheme of armour.jpg|thumb|Armor plan of IS-2, models 1943 (top) and 1944 (bottom).]]\nEarly IS-2s can be identified by the 'stepped' front hull casting with its small, opening driver's visor. The early tanks lacked gun tube travel locks or anti-aircraft-capable machine guns and had narrow mantlets.\n\nIn late 1944, the stepped hull front was replaced with an improved single casting of 120&nbsp;mm thickness angled at 60 degrees. This new nose lacked the opening driver's visor. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the IS-2M, but that designation actually refers to a much later modernization program from the 1950s. Other minor upgrades included the addition of a travel lock on the hull rear, wider mantlet and, on very late models, an [[DShK|anti-aircraft machine gun]].\n\nIn comparison to the Tiger I, the IS-2 had modest advantages in armour, even though it was 10 tons lighter<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zaloga|first1=Steven|title=IS-2 Heavy Tank 1944\u201373|date=1994|publisher=Osprey |page=25}}</ref> In 1944, IS-2 tank was the only large-scale Allied tank whose armor provided some protection from the well-known Tiger 88mm long-barreled guns and Panther 75mm L/70 guns.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the remaining IS-2 tanks (mostly model 1944 variants) were upgraded to the IS-2M standard, which introduced fittings such as external fuel tanks on the rear hull (the basic IS-2 had these only on the hull sides), stowage bins on both sides of the hull and protective skirting along the top edges of the [[Caterpillar track|tracks]].\n\n== Combat history ==\nThe IS-2 tank first saw combat in early 1944, equipping elite Guards Heavy Tank Regiments of the Red Army. A regiment had 21 IS-2 tanks in four companies of five tanks each and one being used by the regimental commander.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=8}} The special tank regiments were reserved for important attacks, often to spearhead attempts to break through fortified German positions like anti-tank defence lines and bunkers.{{Sfn|Zaloga|1994|p=8}} The tanks supporting infantry in the assault by destroying bunkers, buildings, dug-in weapons and engaging German armoured vehicles. Once a breakthrough was achieved, lighter and more mobile tanks were used for exploitation and mopping-up. The IS-2 tank first saw action in [[Ukraine]] in early 1944 and claimed to have destroyed more than forty Tigers and [[Elefant]]s for the loss of only eight tanks. While the German heavy tanks could knock out the IS-2, they had no real answer to its {{nowrap|122 mm}} gun, which easily outgunned them.<ref>Tiger I and Tiger II. [[Anthony Tucker-Jones]].

In the late 1960s the remaining Soviet heavy tanks were transferred to Red Army reserve service and storage. The IS-2 Model 1944 remained in service much longer in the armies of [[Cuba]], [[China]] and [[North Korea]]. A regiment of Chinese IS-2s was available for use in the [[Korean War]] but saw no service there.\n\nAfter the Korean War, China attempted to reverse-engineer the IS-2/IS-3 as the Type 122 medium tank.

Developing countries are, in general, countries that have not achieved a significant degree of [[industrialization]] relative to their populations, and have, in most cases, a medium to low [[standard of living]]. There is an association between low income and high population growth.<ref name=\"Population and poverty\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/resources/population-and-poverty|title=Population and poverty|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> The development of a country is measured with statistical indexes such as income [[per capita]] (per person), [[gross domestic product]] per capita, [[life expectancy]], the rate of literacy, freedom index and others. The UN has developed the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), a compound indicator of some of the above statistics, to gauge the level of human development for countries where data is available. The UN had set [[Millennium Development Goals]] from a blueprint developed by all of the world's countries and leading development institutions, in order to evaluate growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|website=www.un.org|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> These goals ended in 2015, to be superseded by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].\n\nThe concept of the developing nation is found, under one term or another, in numerous theoretical systems having diverse orientations \u2014 for example, theories of [[decolonization]], [[liberation theology]], [[Marxism]], [[anti-imperialism]], [[Modernization theory|modernization]], [[social change]] and [[political economy]].\n\nAnother important indicator is the sectoral changes that have occurred since the stage of development of the country. On an average, countries with a 50% contribution from the [[secondary sector]] ([[manufacturing]]) have grown substantially. Similarly countries with a [[tertiary sector]] stronghold also see a greater rate of [[economic development]].\n\n=== Terms used to classify levels of development ===\n\nThere are several terms used to classify countries into rough levels of development. Classification of any given country differs across sources, and sometimes these classifications or the specific terminology used is considered disparaging.

Developing countries are, in general, countries that have not achieved a significant degree of [[industrialization]] relative to their populations, and have, in most cases, a medium to low [[standard of living]]. There is an association between low income and high population growth.<ref name=\"Population and poverty\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unfpa.org/resources/population-and-poverty|title=Population and poverty|website=www.unfpa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> The development of a country is measured with statistical indexes such as income [[per capita]] (per person), [[gross domestic product]] per capita, [[life expectancy]], the rate of literacy, freedom index and others. The UN has developed the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), a compound indicator of some of the above statistics, to gauge the level of human development for countries where data is available. The UN had set [[Millennium Development Goals]] from a blueprint developed by all of the world's countries and leading development institutions, in order to evaluate growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/|title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals|website=www.un.org|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> These goals ended in 2015, to be superseded by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].\n\nThe concept of the developing nation is found, under one term or another, in numerous theoretical systems having diverse orientations \u2014 for example, theories of [[decolonization]], [[liberation theology]], [[Marxism]], [[anti-imperialism]], [[Modernization theory|modernization]], [[social change]] and [[political economy]].\n\nAnother important indicator is the sectoral changes that have occurred since the stage of development of the country. On an average, countries with a 50% contribution from the [[secondary sector]] ([[manufacturing]]) have grown substantially. Similarly countries with a [[tertiary sector]] stronghold also see a greater rate of [[economic development]].\n\n=== Terms used to classify levels of development ===\n\nThere are several terms used to classify countries into rough levels of development. Classification of any given country differs across sources, and sometimes these classifications or the specific terminology used is considered disparaging.

It is the sequel to 1997's ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'', and the second installment of the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]]. The game focuses on players taking on the role of a criminal as they roam a fictional futuristic city, conducting jobs for various crime syndicates and having free reign to do whatever they wish to achieve their goal. The game's intro is unique for a title in the series, as it involved live-action scenes filmed by Rockstar Games.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews from critics, though the GBC version fared the worst, but was a modest commercial success. ''Grand Theft Auto 2'' was succeed by ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' in October 2001, while the game itself was re-released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/1395/ |title=News \u2013 Rockstar Games Brings Full Line-up to Steam |author=[[Steam (software)|Steam]] |publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820162759/http://store.steampowered.com/news/1395 |archivedate=20 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[Image:GTA2 PC in-game screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''Grand Theft Auto 2'' being played at \"dusk\" in the Windows version.]]\nLike its predecessor ''Grand Theft Auto'', the game focuses on players completing a series of levels, each requiring a set target [[Score (game)#Video games|score]] being achieved in order to progress to the next stage. Points are awarded from various criminal actions such as destroying cars, selling vehicles, and completing [[Quest (video gaming)|missions]] for various crime syndicates, with the latter awarding more points than doing simple criminal actions. Unlike its predecessor, ''Grand Theft Auto 2'' is set in an unspecified time period - conflicting sources suggest anything from \"three weeks into the future\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/gta2/frameset.html |title=GTA2 \u2013 Frameset |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date= |accessdate=5 February 2011 }}</ref> to the year to be 2013,<ref name=\"rockstargames.com\"/> despite in-game references - and within a [[Retrofuturism|retrofuturistic]] metropolis referred to only as \"Anywhere, USA\",<ref name=\"rockstargames.com\">{{cite web | url=http://www.rockstargames.com/gta2/journal/journal_list.html | title=GTA2 \u2013 Individual Police Files |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |accessdate=29 April 2007 }}</ref> with each level focused on a different district of the city. Completing jobs earns points and a multiplier bonus, while failing them earns nothing. Creating chaos from their crimes will cause the player to be wanted by the police who will hound the player to arrest or kill them, with higher wanted levels increasing the level of response used. Being arrested or dying loses the player any equipment they found, and impacts their multiplier bonus.\n\n''Grand Theft Auto 2'' introduced several new features and improvements to the game. Players can now [[Saved game|save their game]] during a playthrough of a level by visiting the church they start at, but must pay a set amount of points to do so. Jobs on offer come from three different syndicates - each level features two unique syndicates, alongside a third syndicate present in all levels. By doing jobs for a syndicate and successfully completing it, the player gains respect with that syndicate, allowing them to take on tougher jobs with enough respect, but lose it with their chief rivals, locking them out of their jobs and making the syndicate's members hostile to the player. Other improvements include vehicles and pedestrians being more interactive with the game's environment - such as gang members engaging in fights with police - the presence of other criminals (such as muggers),<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/161/161648p1.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 \u2013 IGN |last=Blevins |first=Tal |website=[[IGN]] |date=18 November 1999 |accessdate=29 April 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213210410/http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/161/161648p1.html |archivedate=13 February 2008 }}</ref> a [[Health (gaming)|health meter]], garages that can modify vehicles with special improvements, a selection of side missions ranging from running a taxi to driving a semi-truck, and groups of 'hidden' [[Item (gaming)|packages]] to find across the level.\n\n== ''GTA 2 \u2013 The Movie'' ==\nThe game was developed with a special eight-minute [[short film]] of [[live-action]] footage, filmed by [[Rockstar Games]] within New York City. The movie was devised as an intro sequence for the game, before it was later made available on Rockstar's website. The film focused on the exploit of a criminal (deemed \"Claude\") who conducted jobs around Anywhere City (despite several landmarks of New York featuring in the film), before being killed by an assassin from one of the syndicates. The film was based on a screenplay [[Dan Houser]], directed by [[Alex De Rakoff]], and starred [[Scott Maslen]]\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\nEach area features five radio stations from a pool of eleven, one of which is heard as the player drives most vehicles in game. Changing radio stations for preference is possible. \"Head Radio\" was present in the original ''Grand Theft Auto'', ''Grand Theft Auto III'' and ''Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories''. Each gang has its own radio station that transmits within a limited area. Police vehicles, ambulances, fire trucks and tanks had no ability to listen to the radio channels. Instead, the player would hear the radio transmitter of the emergency services.\n\nAll the [[Video game music|music]] and the ads included in the game are exclusive, following the tradition of previous games.

It is the sequel to 1997's ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'', and the second installment of the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]]. The game focuses on players taking on the role of a criminal as they roam a fictional futuristic city, conducting jobs for various crime syndicates and having free reign to do whatever they wish to achieve their goal. The game's intro is unique for a title in the series, as it involved live-action scenes filmed by Rockstar Games.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews from critics, though the GBC version fared the worst, but was a modest commercial success. ''Grand Theft Auto 2'' was succeed by ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' in October 2001, while the game itself was re-released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/1395/ |title=News \u2013 Rockstar Games Brings Full Line-up to Steam |author=[[Steam (software)|Steam]] |publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820162759/http://store.steampowered.com/news/1395 |archivedate=20 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[Image:GTA2 PC in-game screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''Grand Theft Auto 2'' being played at \"dusk\" in the Windows version.]]\nLike its predecessor ''Grand Theft Auto'', the game focuses on players completing a series of levels, each requiring a set target [[Score (game)#Video games|score]] being achieved in order to progress to the next stage. Points are awarded from various criminal actions such as destroying cars, selling vehicles, and completing [[Quest (video gaming)|missions]] for various crime syndicates, with the latter awarding more points than doing simple criminal actions. Unlike its predecessor, ''Grand Theft Auto 2'' is set in an unspecified time period - conflicting sources suggest anything from \"three weeks into the future\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/gta2/frameset.html |title=GTA2 \u2013 Frameset |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date= |accessdate=5 February 2011 }}</ref> to the year to be 2013,<ref name=\"rockstargames.com\"/> despite in-game references - and within a [[Retrofuturism|retrofuturistic]] metropolis referred to only as \"Anywhere, USA\",<ref name=\"rockstargames.com\">{{cite web | url=http://www.rockstargames.com/gta2/journal/journal_list.html | title=GTA2 \u2013 Individual Police Files |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |accessdate=29 April 2007 }}</ref> with each level focused on a different district of the city. Completing jobs earns points and a multiplier bonus, while failing them earns nothing. Creating chaos from their crimes will cause the player to be wanted by the police who will hound the player to arrest or kill them, with higher wanted levels increasing the level of response used. Being arrested or dying loses the player any equipment they found, and impacts their multiplier bonus.\n\n''Grand Theft Auto 2'' introduced several new features and improvements to the game. Players can now [[Saved game|save their game]] during a playthrough of a level by visiting the church they start at, but must pay a set amount of points to do so. Jobs on offer come from three different syndicates - each level features two unique syndicates, alongside a third syndicate present in all levels. By doing jobs for a syndicate and successfully completing it, the player gains respect with that syndicate, allowing them to take on tougher jobs with enough respect, but lose it with their chief rivals, locking them out of their jobs and making the syndicate's members hostile to the player. Other improvements include vehicles and pedestrians being more interactive with the game's environment - such as gang members engaging in fights with police - the presence of other criminals (such as muggers),<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/161/161648p1.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 \u2013 IGN |last=Blevins |first=Tal |website=[[IGN]] |date=18 November 1999 |accessdate=29 April 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213210410/http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/161/161648p1.html |archivedate=13 February 2008 }}</ref> a [[Health (gaming)|health meter]], garages that can modify vehicles with special improvements, a selection of side missions ranging from running a taxi to driving a semi-truck, and groups of 'hidden' [[Item (gaming)|packages]] to find across the level.\n\n== ''GTA 2 \u2013 The Movie'' ==\nThe game was developed with a special eight-minute [[short film]] of [[live-action]] footage, filmed by [[Rockstar Games]] within New York City. The movie was devised as an intro sequence for the game, before it was later made available on Rockstar's website. The film focused on the exploit of a criminal (deemed \"Claude\") who conducted jobs around Anywhere City (despite several landmarks of New York featuring in the film), before being killed by an assassin from one of the syndicates. The film was based on a screenplay [[Dan Houser]], directed by [[Alex De Rakoff]] ,and starred [[Scott Maslen]]\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\nEach area features five radio stations from a pool of eleven, one of which is heard as the player drives most vehicles in game. Changing radio stations for preference is possible. \"Head Radio\" was present in the original ''Grand Theft Auto'', ''Grand Theft Auto III'' and ''Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories''. Each gang has its own radio station that transmits within a limited area. Police vehicles, ambulances, fire trucks and tanks had no ability to listen to the radio channels. Instead, the player would hear the radio transmitter of the emergency services.\n\nAll the [[Video game music|music]] and the ads included in the game are exclusive, following the tradition of previous games. People in charge of the musical content were Craig Conner, Stuart Ross, Paul Scargill, Colin Anderson, Bert Reid and [[Moving Shadow]]. Some of these producers would keep their work on subsequent GTA releases.\n\nThe Game Boy Color version uses some real songs, one of which is a sped up version of [[Back in Black (song)|Back in Black]] by [[AC/DC]]. The Character Selection theme is an old Brazilian song titled \"[[Chega de Saudade]]\".\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 71.50% (PC)<ref name=\"GR PC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/197478-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for PC |accessdate=12 August 2012 |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620024652/http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/197478-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |archivedate=20 June 2012 }}</ref><br />70.80% (DC)<ref name=\"GR DC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/dreamcast/197479-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for Dreamcast |accessdate=12 August 2012 |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830094948/http://www.gamerankings.com/dreamcast/197479-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |archivedate=30 August 2012 }}</ref><br />69.92% (PS1)<ref name=\"GR PS1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps/185853-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for PlayStation |accessdate=12 August 2012 |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905210433/http://www.gamerankings.com/ps/185853-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |archivedate=5 September 2012 }}</ref><br />35.00% (GBC)<ref name=\"GR GBC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/gbc/562989-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for Game Boy Color |accessdate=12 August 2012 |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809001631/http://www.gamerankings.com/gbc/562989-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |archivedate=9 August 2012 }}</ref>\n| MC = 70/100 (PS1)<ref name=\"MC PS1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/grand-theft-auto-2 |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for PlayStation Reviews |accessdate=13 February 2013 |website=[[Metacritic]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430224838/http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/grand-theft-auto-2 |archivedate=30 April 2013 }}</ref>\n| GSpot = 6.9/10 (PS1)<ref name=\"GSpot PS\">{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/grand-theft-auto-2/platform/ps/ |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 -

Murray|Jack Murray]] purchased the old hotel, which was abandoned for around 10 years, and converted it into Harvey Cedars Bible Presbyterian Conference. After around 10 years of directing the conference, Jack left the operations to Al Oldham. The name was changed to Harvey Cedars Bible Conference by 1949 while Jack Murray was still involved, and was run by Al until the mid-1990s when the director position was passed on to his son, Jon Oldham.\n\nOriginally a small one story hotel started in the 1830s for fishermen and hunters, it was expanded throughout the 19th century to a two-story. A large renovation, completed in 1903, led to the three-story structure which was kept rather similar until the late 1990s when sections of it were gutted and rebuilt, out of style with the original [[Victorian architecture]].\n\nIn 1949/1950, a separate chapel was built on the property. [[Stained glass]] windows purchased from the [[Engleside Hotel]] in [[Beach Haven, New Jersey|Beach Haven]] (built in the 1870s, and torn down during [[World War II]]) were used in the new chapel. These windows were, with the exception of two sashes, completely removed years later after years of damage from the high winds. Two of the old sashes remained in the bookstore, off the chapel, until around 2003 when they were also removed.\n\nThe HCBC complex also contains a modern hotel, a 1960s motel-style building, separate dining hall, a dock and elevated bayside deck, tennis courts, an indoor heated swimming pool, an indoor hot tub, a gymnasium, volleyball court, and soccer fields.\n\n== Current Ministry ==\nThe Bible Conference has a long history of Biblically oriented ministries and vacations for families and people of all ages and ethnicities.  \n\nThe summers feature week-long Family Weeks and Teen Weeks.  The rest of the year is filled with weekend retreats for different organizations, including at least one retreat which brings in hundreds from other countries.\n\n== Renovations ==\nChanging times, expectations for improved accommodations and guest amenities led to decisions to renovate in the 1990s, up to the present time. \n\nThe former bar, (which during the first days of Harvey Cedars Bible Presbyterian Conference served as a lounge, and during the 1980s and 1990s served as the staff lounge, was rebuilt as office space containing 4 rooms around 1996/1997 (several years later the porch on the north end of the former bar was also altered for further office space). The decorative steel ceiling may have been removed\u2014it was at least covered by a drop ceiling. This bar originally contained one of a set of matching decorative fireplaces completed in 1903 after the major renovation. \n\nThe matching decorative fireplace in the former South Lounge was removed around 2004 when the South Lounge was completely remodeled. The decorative, functional south porches were also removed, on the first floor to extend former South lounge into needed meeting rooms. On the 2nd and 3rd floor, the former porches were replaced mostly by a concrete block fireproof stairwell. \n\nThe former dining room (which has served as the main lounge since the 1940s) has been kept mostly original.  All the exterior old windows were replaced, but the decorative embossed-steel walls and ceiling are still present.  This room originally had gas light fixtures which were removed long ago.  The pocket doors on the south side were covered, but are still in the walls.  \n\nAlso on the first floor, the former \"Woman's Lounge\" during the Hotel days (which served as the \"Game Room\" during the early Harvey Cedar's Bible (Presbyterian) Conference days, followed by living quarters for staff in the 1990s) was gutted and converted into modern bathrooms around 2004.   \n\nOn the north side of the hotel the old back stairway which extended from the first floor (former kitchen) to the attic was removed.  A concrete block fireproof stairwell was added to the north and south side to adhere to New Jersey fire code.\n\nOn the second floor, many guest rooms were gutted and renovated. Some restrooms were also gutted and renovated.\n\nAll other historic hotels of the same size located on the island have long since been destroyed. \n\nFor more old photographs of the old hotel, see [[Harvey Cedars Hotel]] and [[Camp Whelen]] as they occupied the same building during different eras.\n\n==Namesake==\nA significant signpost in the history of the Bible Presbyterian Church was the publication and approval of what came to be known as the '''Harvey Cedars Resolutions'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.pcahistory.org/documents/harveycedars.html|title = The Harvey Cedars Resolutions [The Bible Presbyterian Church, 1945]|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> In 1945 the Eighth General Synod of the BPC convened at the denomination's conference center in Harvey Cedars, New Jersey.

Contrary to most other governments of the Nazi-invaded countries, King [[Christian X of Denmark]] and his government ordered the [[Royal Danish Army|army]] and [[Royal Danish Navy|navy]] to stop fighting, and chose to remain in their country also under the occupation, which is believed to have contributed to the Nazi years being more lenient in Denmark than in other countries under Hitler's control.

The following [[Great Depression]] brought Danish unemployment to unprecedented heights. This period of widespread social malaise was fertile ground for leaders who could communicate a confident and coherent vision to the masses.

His popularity in the 1930s acted as a force limiting the growth of other populist parties\u2014most importantly, the Nazi party, which remained politically insignificant. Stauning also played a major role in containing the constitutional [[Easter Crisis of 1920]] where he brokered a deal with the [[Christian X of Denmark|king]] in which the monarch accepted a reduction of his own role to a merely symbolical one, avoiding any future interference in the functioning of [[parliamentary democracy]]. In return, Stauning kept the pro-republican elements of the Social Democratic Party in line, and ensured his party's political support to the continuation of the Danish monarchy.
