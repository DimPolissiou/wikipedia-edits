He was admitted to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in Edinburgh in 1896 and in the following year was called to the English Bar at the [[Middle Temple]]. He obtained a large practice in Scotland and was Senior Advocate Depute from 1913\u20131916.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/>\n\nHe was made a [[King's Counsel]] in Scotland in January 1914.<ref name=\"gazette-1914-kc\">{{London Gazette | issue = 12633 | date = 13 January 1914 |page=57 | city = Edinburgh }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nMillar was elected Liberal MP for [[St Andrews Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|St Andrews Burghs]] at the general election of [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910]] when he defeated the sitting [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], [[William Anstruther-Gray (senior)|William Anstruther-Gray]]. However he lost the seat back to Anstruther-Gray at the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910 general election]]. In 1911, an opportunity arose for Millar with the resignation from Parliament of the Liberal MP for [[North East Lanarkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Lanarkshire]], Thomas Fleming Wilson and Millar was re-elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] at a [[by-election]] held on 9 March 1911. He held North East Lanarkshire until 1918, when the seat was abolished. He moved to contest [[Motherwell (UK Parliament constituency)|Motherwell]] at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 General Election]] as the Liberal party candidate, but finished second to the Unionist in a three-way contest.\n\nMillar did not find another seat until the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]] when he was successful at [[East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|East Fife]], gaining the seat from the Tories. This must have been a particularly sweet victory as the MP he defeated had taken the constituency from former Liberal leader [[H H Asquith]] in 1918, a seat Asquith had held since 1886. Millar was able to hold the seat at the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] but lost in [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]] to the Conservative [[Archibald Cochrane (politician)|Archibald Cochrane]]. He won the seat back from Cochrane at the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]] albeit by the narrow margin of 581 votes <ref>''The Times'', 30 October 1961</ref>\n\n==National Liberal==\nIn 1931, an economic crisis led to the formation of a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] led by Labour prime minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and initially supported by the Conservative and Liberal parties. However the Liberals were increasingly divided over the issue of the National Government, particularly over the policy of [[Free Trade]]. The official party led by [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]] although agreeing to go into the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] supporting MacDonald became increasingly alarmed about the government's stance on Free Trade and worried about the predominance of the Conservatives in the coalition. However a group of Liberal MPs led by [[Sir John Simon]] who were concerned to ensure the National Government had a wide cross-party base formed the Liberal National Party to more openly support MacDonald's administration.  Millar was not one of the founding members of  the Liberal National Party but his endorsement of the government's programme was enough to ensure the Conservatives did not put up a candidate against him in East Fife in 1931 and on 16 October 1931, Millar found himself returned unopposed to represent East Fife in the next Parliament.<ref>The Times, 17 October 1931</ref> He then chose to support the administration loyally and continued to describe himself as a Liberal National when the Samuelite Liberals withdrew from the coalition. He continued to enjoy the support of both the local Liberal and Conservative Associations in East Fife, with both of which organisations he had gained the reputation for being a good constituency MP, particularly in representing the interests of fishing and agriculture.<ref>''The Times'', 12 December 1932</ref>\n\nMillar died in office at the aged of 61. At [[1933 East Fife by-election|the by-election]] held on 2 February 1933 to fill the East Fife seat following Millar's death, the local Liberal Association selected the Simonite [[James Henderson-Stewart]] to fight the seat.<ref>David Dutton, ''Liberal Schism: A History of the National Liberal Party''; I B Tauris, 2008 p69</ref> Standing as a Liberal National, Henderson-Stewart easily held the seat with a majority of 9,135 votes. He did not face Conservative opposition but there were four other candidates, including [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], [[Agricultural Party]], Independent Liberal and [[National Party of Scotland]].\n\n==Honours==\nIn 1913, Millar was appointed by the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] to sit on a committee of experts to look into the spread of various diseases in Africa and how they could be controlled.<ref>''The Times'', 30 July 1913</ref> Millar was [[knighted]] in the [[1932 New Year Honours]] for political and public services.<ref>''The Times'', 1 January 1932</ref>\n\n==Death==\nMillar died at his home, Remony Lodge, [[Aberfeldy, Scotland|Aberfeldy]] in [[Perthshire]], following a period of some weeks suffering badly with [[phlebitis]] and complications.<ref>''The Times'', 10 October 1932 & 12 December 1932</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Hansard-contribs | sir-james-millar | James Duncan Millar }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[St Andrews Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Member for St Andrews Burghs]]\n | years  = [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910]] \u2013 [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910]]\n | before = [[William Anstruther-Gray (senior)|William Anstruther-Gray]]\n | after  = [[William Anstruther-Gray (senior)|William Anstruther-Gray]]\n}}\n{{s-bef | before=[[Thomas Fleming Wilson]] }}\n{{s-ttl\n | title = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[North East Lanarkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Lanarkshire]]\n | years = [[1911 North East Lanarkshire by-election|1911]]\u2013[[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n}}\n{{s-non | reason = Constituency abolished}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|East Fife]]\n | years  = [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]\u2013[[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]]\n | before = [[Alexander Sprot]]\n | after  = [[Archibald Cochrane (politician)|Archibald Cochrane]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|East Fife]]\n | years  = [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]]\u2013[[1933 East Fife by-election|1933]]\n | before = [[Archibald Cochrane (politician)|Archibald Cochrane]]\n | after  = [[Sir James Henderson-Stewart, 1st Baronet|James Henderson-Stewart]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Millar, James Duncan}}\n[[Category:1871 births]]\n[[Category:1932 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the Faculty of Advocates]]\n[[Category:Knights Bachelor]]\n[[Category:Scottish Queen's Counsel]]\n[[Category:Queen's Counsel 1901\u20132000]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies]]\n[[Category:Scottish Liberal Party MPs]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1910]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1910\u20131918]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1922\u20131923]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1923\u20131924]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1929\u20131931]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1931\u20131935]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Fife constituencies]]\n[[Category:National Liberal Party (UK, 1931) politicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2017}}\n[[File:James_Duncan_Millar.jpg|thumb|right|Duncan Millar]]\n'''Sir James Duncan Millar''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KC}}  (5 August 1871 \u2013 10 December 1932) was a Scottish [[barrister]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], later [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberal]] politician.\n\n==Family and education==\nJames Duncan Millar was the son of John Millar, a medical doctor from [[Edinburgh]].

He obtained a large practice in Scotland and was Senior Advocate Depute from 1913-1916.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/>\n\nHe was made a [[King's Counsel]] in Scotland in January 1914.<ref name=\"gazette-1914-kc\">{{London Gazette | issue = 12633 | date = 13 January 1914 |page=57 | city = Edinburgh }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nMillar was elected Liberal MP for [[St Andrews Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|St Andrews Burghs]] at the general election of [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910]] when he defeated the sitting [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], [[William Anstruther-Gray (senior)|William Anstruther-Gray]]. However he lost the seat back to Anstruther-Gray at the [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910 general election]]. In 1911, an opportunity arose for Millar with the resignation from Parliament of the Liberal MP for [[North East Lanarkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Lanarkshire]], Thomas Fleming Wilson and Millar was re-elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] at a [[by-election]] held on 9 March 1911. He held North East Lanarkshire until 1918, when the seat was abolished. He moved to contest [[Motherwell (UK Parliament constituency)|Motherwell]] at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 General Election]] as the Liberal party candidate, but finished second to the Unionist in a three-way contest.\n\nMillar did not find another seat until the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]] when he was successful at [[East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|East Fife]], gaining the seat from the Tories. This must have been a particularly sweet victory as the MP he defeated had taken the constituency from former Liberal leader [[H H Asquith]] in 1918, a seat Asquith had held since 1886. Millar was able to hold the seat at the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] but lost in [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]] to the Conservative [[Archibald Cochrane (politician)|Archibald Cochrane]]. He won the seat back from Cochrane at the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]] albeit by the narrow margin of 581 votes <ref>''The Times'', 30 October 1961</ref>\n\n==National Liberal==\nIn 1931, an economic crisis led to the formation of a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] led by Labour prime minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and initially supported by the Conservative and Liberal parties. However the Liberals were increasingly divided over the issue of the National Government, particularly over the policy of [[Free Trade]]. The official party led by [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]] although agreeing to go into the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] supporting MacDonald became increasingly alarmed about the government\u2019s stance on Free Trade and worried about the predominance of the Conservatives in the coalition. However a group of Liberal MPs led by [[Sir John Simon]] who were concerned to ensure the National Government had a wide cross-party base formed the Liberal National Party to more openly support MacDonald\u2019s administration.  Millar was not one of the founding members of  the Liberal National Party but his endorsement of the government\u2019s programme was enough to ensure the Conservatives did not put up a candidate against him in East Fife in 1931 and on 16 October 1931, Millar found himself returned unopposed to represent East Fife in the next Parliament.<ref>The Times, 17 October 1931</ref> He then chose to support the administration loyally and continued to describe himself as a Liberal National when the Samuelite Liberals withdrew from the coalition. He continued to enjoy the support of both the local Liberal and Conservative Associations in East Fife, with both of which organisations he had gained the reputation for being a good constituency MP, particularly in representing the interests of fishing and agriculture.<ref>''The Times'', 12 December 1932</ref>\n\nMillar died in office at the aged of 61. At [[1933 East Fife by-election|the by-election]] held on 2 February 1933 to fill the East Fife seat following Millar\u2019s death, the local Liberal Association selected the Simonite [[James Henderson-Stewart]] to fight the seat.<ref>David Dutton, ''Liberal Schism: A History of the National Liberal Party''; I B Tauris, 2008 p69</ref> Standing as a Liberal National, Henderson-Stewart easily held the seat with a majority of 9,135 votes. He did not face Conservative opposition but there were four other candidates, including [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], [[Agricultural Party]], Independent Liberal and [[National Party of Scotland]].\n\n==Honours==\nIn 1913, Millar was appointed by the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] to sit on a committee of experts to look into the spread of various diseases in Africa and how they could be controlled.<ref>''The Times'', 30 July 1913</ref> Millar was [[knighted]] in the [[1932 New Year Honours]] for political and public services.<ref>''The Times'', 1 January 1932</ref>\n\n==Death==\nMillar died at his home, Remony Lodge, [[Aberfeldy, Scotland|Aberfeldy]] in [[Perthshire]], following a period of some weeks suffering badly with [[phlebitis]] and complications.<ref>''The Times'', 10 October 1932 & 12 December 1932</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Hansard-contribs | sir-james-millar | James Duncan Millar }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[St Andrews Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Member for St Andrews Burghs]]\n | years  = [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910]] \u2013 [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910]]\n | before = [[William Anstruther-Gray (senior)|William Anstruther-Gray]]\n | after  = [[William Anstruther-Gray (senior)|William Anstruther-Gray]]\n}}\n{{s-bef | before=[[Thomas Fleming Wilson]] }}\n{{s-ttl\n | title = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[North East Lanarkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Lanarkshire]]\n | years = [[1911 North East Lanarkshire by-election|1911]]\u2013[[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n}}\n{{s-non | reason = Constituency abolished}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|East Fife]]\n | years  = [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]\u2013[[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924]]\n | before = [[Alexander Sprot]]\n | after  = [[Archibald Cochrane (politician)|Archibald Cochrane]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|East Fife]]\n | years  = [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929]]\u2013[[1933 East Fife by-election|1933]]\n | before = [[Archibald Cochrane (politician)|Archibald Cochrane]]\n | after  = [[Sir James Henderson-Stewart, 1st Baronet|James Henderson-Stewart]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Millar, James Duncan}}\n[[Category:1871 births]]\n[[Category:1932 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the Faculty of Advocates]]\n[[Category:Knights Bachelor]]\n[[Category:Scottish Queen's Counsel]]\n[[Category:Queen's Counsel 1901\u20132000]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies]]\n[[Category:Scottish Liberal Party MPs]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1910]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1910\u20131918]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1922\u20131923]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1923\u20131924]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1929\u20131931]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1931\u20131935]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Fife constituencies]]\n[[Category:National Liberal Party (UK, 1931) politicians]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (4), 1913-1916 \u2192 1913\u20131916", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Duncan_Millar"}

While continuing his academic career part-time, he was also the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Glasgow Camlachie (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Camlachie]] from 1910 to 1922. From 1923, he was [[Professor (highest academic rank)|Professor]] of Geography at the London School of Economics. \n\nAn avowed white supremacist who compared [[Swahili people]] to 'human camel', Halford became infamous after murdering eight of his African porters during his expedition of [[Mount Kenya]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kearns|first=Gerry|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rUQTDAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA111&dq=Halford%20Mackinder%20shot%20killed%20murder&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q=Halford%20Mackinder%20shot%20killed%20murder&f=false|title=Geopolotics and Empire: The Legacy of Halford Mackinder|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-923011-2|location=New York|pages=111}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Elswitha Hall - geograph.org.uk - 273945.jpg|thumb|His birthplace Elswitha Hall in [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire]]]]\nMackinder was born in [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire]], England, the son of a doctor, and educated at [[Queen Elizabeth's High School|Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School]] in Gainsborough, [[Epsom College]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. At Oxford he started studying natural sciences, specialising in [[zoology]] under [[Henry Nottidge Moseley]], who had been the naturalist on the [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]]. When he turned to the study of history, he remarked that he was returning \"to an old interest and took up modern history with the idea of seeing how the theory of evolution would appear in human development\". He was a strong proponent of treating both [[physical geography]] and [[human geography]] as a single discipline. Mackinder served as President of the [[Oxford Union]] in 1883.<ref>Edmund W.

As Mackinder himself put it, \"a platform has been given to a geographer\". This was arguably at the time the most prestigious academic position for a British geographer.\n\nIn 1892, he was the first Principal of University Extension College, Reading, a role he retained until he was succeeded, in 1903, by [[William Macbride Childs]].

The principal concern of his work was to warn of the possibility of another major war (a warning also given by economist [[John Maynard Keynes]]).\n\nMackinder was anti-[[Bolshevik]], and as British High Commissioner in [[Southern Russia Intervention|Southern Russia]] in late 1919 and early 1920, during the Russian Civil War, he stressed the need for Britain to continue her support to the [[White Movement|White Russian]] forces, which he attempted to unite.<ref>Brian W.

He reiterated and expanded his Heartland view of the world, suggesting that the Atlantic Ocean would be jumped, with North America's influence pulled into the region by its use of Britain as an \"moated aerodrome\".  Elsewhere in the world, beyond the \"girdle of deserts and wilderness\", and the \"Great Ocean\" region of the Indo-Pacific Rim, was the \"Monsoon lands\" area of India and China that would grow in power.<ref>[http://thediplomat.com/2015/03/halford-mackinders-last-view-of-the-round-world/ Halford Mackinder\u2019s Last View of the Round World]</ref>\n\nMackinder was contemporary of the Swedish political scientist [[Rudolf Kjell\u00e9n]], born three years later, who like Mackinder was a conservative member of the national parliament from 1910 until 1922 (year of his death).<ref>{{cite book | author = Giorgio Galli | chapter-url = https://books.google.it/books?id=MUm9saHBVj8C&dq=il+nazismo+magico&source=gbs_navlinks_s | title = Hitler and the magic Nazism (''Hitler e il Nazismo magico'') | publisher = [[Angelo Rizzoli|Rizzoli]] | location = Trabesaleghe (Padua, IT) | date = 1 April 2016 | chapter = 3 | isbn = 978-88-17-00634-7 | page = 76|author-link = Giorgio Galli}}</ref> The two fathers of geopolitics both believed that the development of international transportation on land was growing to such a high rate \"that the advantage of the sea powers was more of historical importance.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://varldsinbordeskriget.wordpress.com/2011/02/09/rudolf-kjellen-the-swedish-father-of-geopolitics/ | title = Rudolf Kjellen, the Swedish Father of Geopolitics | language = en | website = varldsinbordeskriget.wordpress.com | access-date = 10 November 2018 | archive-url = | archive-date = | url-status = live| date = 9 February 2011 }}</ref> Hence, they argued that the pivot of the global political power was the land control of the [[Eurasia]] while a naval power -such as the Great Britain- was playing a secondary role.

His role in fostering the teaching of geography is probably greater than that of any other single British geographer.\n\nWhilst Oxford did not appoint a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|Professor]] of Geography until 1934, both the [[University of Liverpool]] and [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]] established professorial chairs in Geography in 1917. Mackinder himself became Professor of Geography at the University of London ([[London School of Economics]]) in 1923.\n\nMackinder is often credited with introducing two new terms into the English language: \"manpower\" and \"heartland\". In 1944, he received the Charles P. Daley medal from the [[American Geographical Society]], and in 1945 was awarded the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Gold Medal]] for his service in the advancement of the science of Geography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf| title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners|publisher= Royal Geographical Society|accessdate = 24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Heartland Theory and more generally classical geopolitics and geostrategy were extremely influential in the making of US strategic policy during the period of the Cold War.<ref>Sloan, G.R.

He was the first Principal of University Extension College, Reading (which became the [[University of Reading]]) from 1892 to 1903, and Director of the [[London School of Economics]] from 1903 to 1908. While continuing his academic career part-time, he was also the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Glasgow Camlachie (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Camlachie]] from 1910 to 1922. From 1923, he was [[Professor (highest academic rank)|Professor]] of Geography at the London School of Economics. \n\nAn avowed white supremacist who compared [[Swahili people]] to 'human camel', Halford became infamous after murdering eight of his African porters during his expedition of [[Mount Kenya]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kearns|first=Gerry|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rUQTDAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA111&dq=Halford%20Mackinder%20shot%20killed%20murder&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q=Halford%20Mackinder%20shot%20killed%20murder&f=false|title=Geopolotics and Empire: The Legacy of Halford Mackinder|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-923011-2|location=New York|pages=111}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Elswitha Hall - geograph.org.uk - 273945.jpg|thumb|His birthplace Elswitha Hall in [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire]]]]\nMackinder was born in [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire]], England, the son of a doctor, and educated at [[Queen Elizabeth's High School|Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School]] in Gainsborough, [[Epsom College]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. At Oxford he started studying natural sciences, specialising in [[zoology]] under [[Henry Nottidge Moseley]], who had been the naturalist on the [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' expedition]]. When he turned to the study of history, he remarked that he was returning \"to an old interest and took up modern history with the idea of seeing how the theory of evolution would appear in human development\". He was a strong proponent of treating both [[physical geography]] and [[human geography]] as a single discipline. Mackinder served as President of the [[Oxford Union]] in 1883.<ref>Edmund W. Gilbert, ''British Pioneers in Geography'' (Newton Abbot, David & Charles, 1972), p. 141.</ref>\n\nHe received a degree in biology in 1883 and one in modern history the next year.<ref name=\"Sloan1988\">{{cite book|last=Sloan|first=Geoffrey R.|title=Geopolitics in United States Strategic Policy, 1890\u20131987|date=1 January 1988|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9780312019549|page=6}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1887, he published \"On the Scope and Methods of Geography\", a manifesto for the ''[[Political_geography|New Geography]]''.<ref>H.J.

As Mackinder himself put it, \"a platform has been given to a geographer\". This was arguably at the time the most prestigious academic position for a British geographer.\n\nIn 1892, he was the first Principal of University Extension College, Reading, a role he retained until he was succeeded, in 1903, by [[William Macbride Childs]].

These were created by the peace negotiators but proved to be ineffective bulwarks in 1939 (although this may be seen as a failure of other, later statesmen during the interbellum). The principal concern of his work was to warn of the possibility of another major war (a warning also given by economist [[John Maynard Keynes]]).\n\nMackinder was anti-[[Bolshevik]], and as British High Commissioner in [[Southern Russia Intervention|Southern Russia]] in late 1919 and early 1920, during the Russian Civil War, he stressed the need for Britain to continue her support to the [[White Movement|White Russian]] forces, which he attempted to unite.<ref>Brian W.

He reiterated and expanded his Heartland view of the world, suggesting that the Atlantic Ocean would be jumped, with North America's influence pulled into the region by its use of Britain as an \"moated aerodrome\".  Elsewhere in the world, beyond the \"girdle of deserts and wilderness\", and the \"Great Ocean\" region of the Indo-Pacific Rim, was the \"Monsoon lands\" area of India and China that would grow in power.<ref>[http://thediplomat.com/2015/03/halford-mackinders-last-view-of-the-round-world/ Halford Mackinder\u2019s Last View of the Round World]</ref>\n\nMackinder was contemporary of the Swedish political scientist [[Rudolf Kjell\u00e9n]], born three years later, who like Mackinder was a conservative member of the national parliament from 1910 until 1922 (year of his death).<ref>{{cite book | author = Giorgio Galli | chapter-url = https://books.google.it/books?id=MUm9saHBVj8C&dq=il+nazismo+magico&source=gbs_navlinks_s | title = Hitler and the magic Nazism (''Hitler e il Nazismo magico'') | publisher = [[Angelo Rizzoli|Rizzoli]] | location = Trabesaleghe (Padua, IT) | date = 1 April 2016 | chapter = 3 | isbn = 978-88-17-00634-7 | page = 76|author-link = Giorgio Galli}}</ref> The two fathers of geopolitics both believed that the development of international transportation on land was growing to such a high rate \"that the advantage of the sea powers was more of historical importance.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://varldsinbordeskriget.wordpress.com/2011/02/09/rudolf-kjellen-the-swedish-father-of-geopolitics/ | title = Rudolf Kjellen, the Swedish Father of Geopolitics | language = en | website = varldsinbordeskriget.wordpress.com | access-date = 10 November 2018 | archive-url = | archive-date = | url-status = live| date = 9 February 2011 }}</ref> Hence, they argued that the pivot of the global political power was the land control of the [[Eurasia]] while a naval power -such as the Great Britain- was playing a secondary role.

His role in fostering the teaching of geography is probably greater than that of any other single British geographer.\n\nWhilst Oxford did not appoint a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|Professor]] of Geography until 1934, both the [[University of Liverpool]] and [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]] established professorial chairs in Geography in 1917. Mackinder himself became Professor of Geography at the University of London ([[London School of Economics]]) in 1923.\n\nMackinder is often credited with introducing two new terms into the English language: \"manpower\" and \"heartland\". In 1944, he received the Charles P. Daley medal from the [[American Geographical Society]], and in 1945 was awarded the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Gold Medal]] for his service in the advancement of the science of Geography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf| title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners|publisher= Royal Geographical Society|accessdate = 24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Heartland Theory and more generally classical geopolitics and geostrategy were extremely influential in the making of US strategic policy during the period of the Cold War.<ref>Sloan, G.R. ''Geopolitics in United States Strategic Policy'', Brighton: Wheatsheaf Books, 1988.</ref>  Arguably it continued afterwards.<ref>[http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/176007/tomgram%3A_alfred_mccoy,_washington%27s_great_game_and_why_it%27s_failing_/ Tomgram: Alfred McCoy, Washington's Great Game and Why It's Failing]</ref> The theory has seen a revival in application to China's [[Belt and Road Initiative]].\n\nEvidence of Mackinder's Heartland Theory can be found in the works of geopolitician [[Dimitri Kitsikis]], particularly in his geopolitical model \"[[Intermediate Region]]\". To date, at least one academic study, by Mehmet Akif Okur, has critiqued the main perspective of his works.<ref>Mehmet Akif Okur, [http://tdid.ege.edu.tr/files/dergi_14_2/mehmet_akif_okur.pdf \u201cClassical Texts Of the Geopolitics and the \u201cHeart Of Eurasia\u201d], Journal of Turkish World Studies, XIV/2, pp.77-81</ref>\n\nIn the book ''Sri Lanka at Crossroads,'' [[Asanga Abeyagoonasekera]] revisits Mackinder's 1904 Map while highlighting the geostrategic importance of [[Sri Lanka]].<ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1142/11167|title = Sri Lanka at Crossroads|year = 2019|last1 = Abeyagoonasekera|first1 = Asanga|isbn = 978-981-327-672-7}}</ref> Reviewing the work, Swaran Singh writes, \"Asanga talks of Mackinder's 'outer crescent' that makes him see two other nations, Britain and Japan, being similarly ordained.

He returned home with the ''SS Kinfauns Castle'' after the war had ended, leaving [[Cape Town]] in early August 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Army in South Africa - Return of Troops|day_of_week=Thursday |date=14 August 1902 |page_number=8 |issue=36846| }}</ref> After a couple of months on leave, during which there were formal celebrations as he attained his majority, he re-joined the regiment in South Africa in late 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular|day_of_week=Friday |date=24 October 1902 |page_number=8 |issue=36907| }}</ref> From 1905 to 1908 he was again back in South Africa as [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[British High Commissioner to South Africa|High Commissioner]].\n\nLyttelton was elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] for [[Droitwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Droitwich]] in the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910 general election]], a seat he held until his resignation 1916 (being appointed [[Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead]]). During the [[First World War]] he fought at [[Gallipoli]] and in [[Egypt]], the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], achieving the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]]. He succeeded his father as ninth Viscount Cobham in 1922 and entered the [[House of Lords]]. In 1939 he was appointed [[Under-Secretary of State for War]] in the government of [[Neville Chamberlain]], a position he retained until May 1940. Apart from his political and military career he was also [[Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire]] from 1923 to 1949.\n\n==Marriage and children==\n[[File:Hagley, St John the Baptist - Lyttelton plot, row 1 grave 1 - photo 2.JPG|thumb| [[St John the Baptist Church, Hagley]], grave of John Lyttelton, 9th Viscount Cobham (1881\u20131949)]]\n[[File:Hagley, St John the Baptist - interior, Violet Cobham memorial - photo 1.jpg|thumb|St John the Baptist Church, Hagley, memorial to Violet, wife of the 9th Viscount Cobham]]\nCobham married Violet, daughter of Charles Leonard, on 30 June 1908.

He was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Ramsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Ramsey]], [[Huntingdonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdonshire]] and [[Birmingham Handsworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Handsworth]] from 1910 to 1945 as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]].\n\nHe was the brother of [[Godfrey Locker-Lampson]] MP and cousin of the diplomat [[Miles Lampson]].\n\n==Birth and education==\nHe was the younger son of the poet [[Frederick Locker-Lampson|Frederick Locker]], and his second wife, Hannah Jane Lampson (daughter of Sir [[Curtis Lampson]], Bt. Frederick Locker took the name Locker-Lampson as a condition of his father-in-law's will). His ancestors included Captain [[William Locker (Royal Navy)|William Locker]], [[Edward Hawke Locker]], [[Benjamin Stillingfleet]] and [[Jonathan Boucher]]. Oliver was educated at [[Cheam School]], [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he gained an Honours Tripos Degree in History and Modern Languages.<ref>{{acad|id=LKR899OS|name=Locker-Lampson, Oliver Stillingfleet}}</ref> While at Cambridge, he was co-editor of ''[[Granta]]'' with [[Edwin Samuel Montagu|Edwin Montagu]] and President of the [[Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club|Amateur Dramatic Club]].<ref>[http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1954-10-09-08-014&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1954-10-09-08 Obituary in ''The Times''  9 October 1954]</ref>\n\nAfter Cambridge he studied law at the [[Inner Temple]] and was called to the Bar in 1907 but never practised. Instead he worked as a journalist for several years and was also a founding director of a [[Norwich]]-based motorcar vendor, Duff, Morgan and Vermont. As an MP, he did not wish his name to appear in the company name, so he used the home state of his mother, Vermont. In 1911 he was the victim of a practical joke by an old school friend, [[Horace de Vere Cole]]. Cole challenged Locker-Lampson to a footrace on a London street, and allowed him to pull ahead. Then he shouted \"Stop thief! He's got my watch!\" - having previously slipped his gold watch into Locker-Lampson's pocket.<ref>Downer, Martyn. ''The Sultan of Zanzibar. The bizarre world of Horace de Vere Cole''. London: [[Black Spring Press]], 2010</ref>\n\n== Parliamentary career ==\nLocker-Lampson was elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] at the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910 general election]] as the member for the Ramsey Division in [[Huntingdonshire]], defeating the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] incumbent. He stood as a [[Conservative Unionist]] on a [[Tariff Reform League|Tariff Reform]] ticket. He was re-elected in the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910 general election]]. With the outbreak of the [[First World War]], there were no elections held until 1918, and he continued as an MP throughout this period although absent on active service abroad for much of 1915 to 1918.\n\nBefore the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]], constituencies were redrawn and the Ramsey Division was abolished. A new all [[Huntingdonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdonshire seat]] was created, and Locker-Lampson stood for this instead, and was elected.\n\nHe was [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Austen Chamberlain]] from 1919 to 1921, and accompanied Chamberlain to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.\n\nIn the  [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 election]] he moved to [[Birmingham Handsworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Handsworth]] and was elected there. He held Birmingham Handsworth from 1922 until the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], when he was de-selected by the constituency party.\n\n==Political activity before the First World War==\nLocker-Lampson's early political career was taken up with a number of causes. He was appointed by the Conservative and Unionist Party to raise money for the Unionist Working Men's Candidates Fund. He was also involved in a secret plan by [[Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, 1st Baronet|Arthur Steel-Maitland]] and Conservative Central Office to gain control of the ''[[Daily Express]]'', but was outmanoeuvred by the future [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]].\n\nHowever, his main political preoccupation before 1914 was harrying [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]]'s Liberal government over the selling of [[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925|honours]] and the [[Marconi scandal]]. He also opposed [[Irish Home Rule]], and raised funds for [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Edward Carson]]'s Pro-Unionist [[Ulster Volunteers|Ulster Volunteer Force]].\n\n==Great War service==\nIn December 1914 Locker-Lampson received a commission in the [[Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve]] with the rank of Lieutenant Commander. This was largely on the basis of an understanding with the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Winston Churchill]], that he would personally fund the establishment of an armoured car squadron for the [[Royal Naval Air Service#RNAS Armoured Car Section|Royal Naval Air Service's Armoured Car Division]]. After training at [[Whale Island, Hampshire]] and in north Norfolk near his family home, Newhaven Court, [[Cromer]], Locker-Lampson's No. 15 Squadron was sent to France, then operated in the unoccupied portion of [[Belgium]] on attachment to the [[Belgian Army order of battle (1914)|Belgian Army]] during much of 1915.\n\nBy the end of 1915, trench warfare meant there was no scope for armoured cars on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and most of the RNAS's armoured car squadrons were disbanded by the Admiralty. However, three squadrons of RNAS armoured cars were assembled and sent by ship to [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] as the Armoured Car Expeditionary Force (ACEF), also known as the Russian Armoured Car Division,<ref>Bartholemew, E. (1988). ''Early Armoured Cars'', Shire Publications. p21.</ref> with Locker-Lampson in command in order to show support for Britain's Russian ally. Sea ice prevented the Division from reaching Archangel and men and armoured cars were landed at the small town of [[Polyarny, Murmansk Oblast|Alexandrovsk]].<ref>Stibbons, B.. ''The Baker Brothers: Diaries from the East Front 1914-1919''. Lowestoft: Poppyland Publishing, 2018.</ref> The ACEF operated with the Russian Army in several areas, including [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Romania]], and the [[Caucasus]].<ref>Perrett, Bryan; Lord, Anthony.

London: HMSO, 1987</ref>\n\nLocker-Lampson became somewhat entangled in Russian politics at this time. He said later that he had been asked to participate in the 1916 assassination of [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]],<ref>Napley, Sir David. ''Rasputin in Hollywood''. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1990</ref> and that he had a secret plan to get Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] out of Russia after his abdication in March 1917. It is also alleged that in September 1917 he was involved in [[Kornilov affair|Kornilov's attempted coup]] against the provisional government of [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]].<ref>Ullman, Richard. ''Intervention and the War''. Princeton University Press, 1961. pp. 11-13; and Kettle, Michael. ''The Allies and the Russian Collapse. March 1917-March 1918''. Andre Deutsch, London: 1981</ref>\n\nAfter the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] of October 1917, the ACEF was withdrawn from Russia. In 1918 selected personnel and armoured cars transferred to the [[Machine Gun Corps]] and served as 'Duncars' within [[Dunsterforce]] in [[Persia]] and [[Turkey]], though without Commander Locker-Lampson, who in 1918 became the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]'s Russian Representative.\n\n==Post-First World War career==\n\nPartly because of his experiences in Russia, Locker-Lampson became fiercely anti-[[Communism|Communist]] and suspicious of covert Bolshevik influence in Britain's economy, society and politics. In the 1920s he organised several mass rallies under the banner 'Rout the Reds', many of which were stewarded by members of [[Rotha Lintorn-Orman]]'s [[British Fascists|British Fascisti]].<ref>[[Martin Pugh (author)|Pugh, Martin]], ''Hurrah for the Blackshirts!: Fascists and Fascism in Britain between the Wars'' (London: Pimlico, 2006) p. 61.</ref> He also expressed admiration for [[Adolf Hitler]] in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', touting the future leader of Nazi Germany as \"a legendary hero\" and \"the most masterly expounder and contriver in the length and breadth of the Reich\".<ref>''The Daily Mirror'', 30 Sept. 1930, p. 7.</ref> In 1931, he founded the \"Sentinels of Empire\", also known as the Blue Shirts, a quasi-paramilitary organisation \"to peacefully fight Bolshevism and clear out the Reds!\" Their motto was his family motto \"Fear God! Fear Naught!\" Their anthem, \"March On\", with words written by Locker-Lampson, music originally from the film ''[[High Treason (1929 British film)|High Treason]]'', was sold as sheet music and as a 78-rpm record. A [[phonograph]] record of the anthem was sent to [[Mussolini]], along with silver and blue-enamelled cufflinks and badge, as a gift from the Blue Shirts.<ref>''Berkeley Daily Gazette'', 8 March 1932, p. 6.</ref> Time - Volume 18 - 1931 \"This lyric was personally composed by Commander Locker-Lampson, son of English poet Frederick Locker, maternal ... The music for Commander Locker-Lampson's patriotic song March On! is from the British Gaumont talking film High Treason...</ref>\n\nAlthough Locker-Lampson claimed that the organisation had 100,000 members, the Blue Shirts were short-lived and appeared to make little impact. Nevertheless,  they did attract the praise of the Nazi philosopher [[Alfred Rosenberg]], who in 1931 had lunch with Locker-Lampson at the Savoy during a visit to London. This was organised by the MI6 spy [[F. W. Winterbotham]] who was investigating the Nazis at the time, posing as an admirer who could help the Nazis make links with prominent figures in Britain. Locker-Lampson\u2019s Blue Shirts apparently \"delighted Rosenberg, and when he heard that their objective was to counter Communist propaganda he was even more enthusiastic\", and Rosenberg later sent him a gold cigarette case as a \"token of his esteem\". Locker-Lampson returned the gift with some embarrassment.<ref>Winterbotham, F. W. ''The Nazi Connection'' (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1978) pp. 34-5. The meeting is further verified in a report in the ''Daily Express'', 5 May 1933, p. 19.</ref>\n\nFrom 1933 onwards, Locker-Lampson redirected his political ire against fascism both in Britain and in continental Europe. In July 1933 he introduced a [[Private member's bill]] to extend British citizenship to [[Judaism|Jewish]] refugees from Nazi persecution, though it failed to become law. In September, he provided [[Albert Einstein]] with refuge at a camp on [[Roughton, Norfolk|Roughton Heath]] near his home in [[Cromer]] in north [[Norfolk]], after Einstein had received death threats while living in Belgium.<ref>Clark, Ronald W., ''Einstein: the Life and Times''. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1973.</ref> He later worked to help other high-profile victims of fascism, including [[Haile Selassie]] and [[Sigmund Freud]],<ref>[http://www.freud.org.uk/exhibitions/10025/promised-lands-freuds-exiles/ Sigmund Freud Museum, London, U.K.] Locker-Lampson proposed a parliamentary bill to confer citizenship on Freud.</ref> as well as numerous ordinary Jewish people, whom he personally sponsored in order they might escape Nazi persecution in Germany and Austria.<ref>See, for example, Lambert, Anna. ''Du Kannst Vor Nichts Davonlaufen''. Picus, Vienna: 1992; and letter in ''The Times'', 25 March 2010: http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article7074535.ece</ref> Some have called his efforts \"exceptional in how he saved Jews from Germany.\"<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article7074535.ece \"Saviour of Jews\"], ''The Sunday Times'', U.K., 25 March 2010</ref>\n\nIn 1934 he introduced a [[Ten Minute Rule]] Bill to ban the wearing of political uniforms - aimed at [[Oswald Mosley]]'s Black Shirts ([[British Union of Fascists]]). The Bill did not become law, but a similar bill sponsored by the government did become law in 1936. In 1935 he was a founding member of Focus,<ref>See Spier, Eugen. ''Focus. A footnote to the history of the thirties''. Oswald Wolff, London: 1963</ref> a cross-party group opposed to the prevailing policy of [[Appeasement]] of German and Italian aggression. In 1936 he was instrumental in the successful prosecution of the British fascist [[Arnold Leese]] for his publication of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic literature]]. Throughout the 1930s he was one of the few Conservative MPs to continue to support [[Winston Churchill]] during his \"wilderness years\" of political isolation.\n\nAge and ill-health prevented him from taking a very active part in the Second World War, though he joined the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] and continued to support Winston Churchill vociferously from the [[backbencher|backbenches]].<ref>James, Robert Rhodes ed. (1967) 'Chips' The Diaries of Sir Henry Channon, p.387 in Phoenix paperback edn.</ref> He retired from politics at the 1945 General Election.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nThe Locker-Lampson family's principal home was [[Rowfant]] in West Sussex. Following his mother's death in 1915 Oliver's older brother Godfrey inherited Rowfant while Oliver inherited the family's summer home, Newhaven Court in Cromer, Norfolk. He was married twice. His first wife, Bianca Jacqueline Paget, whom he married in 1923, died in 1929. He married his second wife, Barbara Goodall, in 1935. They had two sons, Jonathan and Stephen.\n\nOliver Locker-Lampson is buried in [[St Nicholas' Church, Worth|Worth]] churchyard near Crawley, Sussex.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Perrett, Bryan; Lord, Anthony.

A new all [[Huntingdonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdonshire seat]] was created, and Locker-Lampson stood for this instead, and was elected.\n\nHe was [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Austen Chamberlain]] from 1919 to 1921, and accompanied Chamberlain to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.\n\nIn the  [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 election]] he moved to [[Birmingham Handsworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Handsworth]] and was elected there. He held Birmingham Handsworth from 1922 until the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], when he was de-selected by the constituency party.\n\n==Political activity before the First World War==\nLocker-Lampson's early political career was taken up with a number of causes. He was appointed by the Conservative and Unionist Party to raise money for the Unionist Working Men\u2019s Candidates Fund. He was also involved in a secret plan by [[Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, 1st Baronet|Arthur Steel-Maitland]] and Conservative Central Office to gain control of the ''[[Daily Express]]'', but was outmanoeuvred by the future [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]].\n\nHowever, his main political preoccupation before 1914 was harrying [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]]'s Liberal government over the selling of [[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925|honours]] and the [[Marconi scandal]]. He also opposed [[Irish Home Rule]], and raised funds for [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Edward Carson]]'s Pro-Unionist [[Ulster Volunteers|Ulster Volunteer Force]].\n\n==Great War service==\nIn December 1914 Locker-Lampson received a commission in the [[Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve]] with the rank of Lieutenant Commander. This was largely on the basis of an understanding with the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Winston Churchill]], that he would personally fund the establishment of an armoured car squadron for the [[Royal Naval Air Service#RNAS Armoured Car Section|Royal Naval Air Service's Armoured Car Division]]. After training at [[Whale Island, Hampshire]] and in north Norfolk near his family home, Newhaven Court, [[Cromer]], Locker-Lampson's No. 15 Squadron was sent to France, then operated in the unoccupied portion of [[Belgium]] on attachment to the [[Belgian Army order of battle (1914)|Belgian Army]] during much of 1915.\n\nBy the end of 1915, trench warfare meant there was no scope for armoured cars on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and most of the RNAS's armoured car squadrons were disbanded by the Admiralty. However, three squadrons of RNAS armoured cars were assembled and sent by ship to [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] as the Armoured Car Expeditionary Force (ACEF), also known as the Russian Armoured Car Division,<ref>Bartholemew, E. (1988). ''Early Armoured Cars'', Shire Publications. p21.</ref> with Locker-Lampson in command in order to show support for Britain's Russian ally. Sea ice prevented the Division from reaching Archangel and men and armoured cars were landed at the small town of [[Polyarny, Murmansk Oblast|Alexandrovsk]].<ref>Stibbons, B.. ''The Baker Brothers: Diaries from the East Front 1914-1919''. Lowestoft: Poppyland Publishing, 2018.</ref> The ACEF operated with the Russian Army in several areas, including [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Romania]], and the [[Caucasus]].<ref>Perrett, Bryan; Lord, Anthony. ''The Czar\u2019s British Squadron''. London: William Kimber, 1981; and Fletcher, David. ''War Cars: British Armoured Cars in the First World War''. London: HMSO, 1987</ref>\n\nLocker-Lampson became somewhat entangled in Russian politics at this time. He said later that he had been asked to participate in the 1916 assassination of [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]],<ref>Napley, Sir David. ''Rasputin in Hollywood''. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1990</ref> and that he had a secret plan to get Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] out of Russia after his abdication in March 1917. It is also alleged that in September 1917 he was involved in [[Kornilov affair|Kornilov's attempted coup]] against the provisional government of [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]].<ref>Ullman, Richard. ''Intervention and the War''. Princeton University Press, 1961. pp. 11-13; and Kettle, Michael. ''The Allies and the Russian Collapse. March 1917-March 1918''. Andre Deutsch, London: 1981</ref>\n\nAfter the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]] of October 1917, the ACEF was withdrawn from Russia. In 1918 selected personnel and armoured cars transferred to the [[Machine Gun Corps]] and served as 'Duncars' within [[Dunsterforce]] in [[Persia]] and [[Turkey]], though without Commander Locker-Lampson, who in 1918 became the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]'s Russian Representative.\n\n==Post-First World War career==\n\nPartly because of his experiences in Russia, Locker-Lampson became fiercely anti-[[Communism|Communist]] and suspicious of covert Bolshevik influence in Britain's economy, society and politics. In the 1920s he organised several mass rallies under the banner 'Rout the Reds', many of which were stewarded by members of [[Rotha Lintorn-Orman]]'s [[British Fascists|British Fascisti]].<ref>[[Martin Pugh (author)|Pugh, Martin]], ''Hurrah for the Blackshirts!: Fascists and Fascism in Britain between the Wars'' (London: Pimlico, 2006) p. 61.</ref> He also expressed admiration for [[Adolf Hitler]] in the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', touting the future leader of Nazi Germany as \"a legendary hero\" and \"the most masterly expounder and contriver in the length and breadth of the Reich\".<ref>''The Daily Mirror'', 30 Sept. 1930, p. 7.</ref> In 1931, he founded the \"Sentinels of Empire\", also known as the Blue Shirts, a quasi-paramilitary organisation \"to peacefully fight Bolshevism and clear out the Reds!\" Their motto was his family motto \"Fear God! Fear Naught!\" Their anthem, \"March On\", with words written by Locker-Lampson, music originally from the film ''[[High Treason (1929 British film)|High Treason]]'', was sold as sheet music and as a 78-rpm record. A [[phonograph]] record of the anthem was sent to [[Mussolini]], along with silver and blue-enamelled cufflinks and badge, as a gift from the Blue Shirts.<ref>''Berkeley Daily Gazette'', 8 March 1932, p. 6.</ref> Time - Volume 18 - 1931 \"This lyric was personally composed by Commander Locker-Lampson, son of English poet Frederick Locker, maternal ... The music for Commander Locker-Lampson's patriotic song March On! is from the British Gaumont talking film High Treason...</ref>\n\nAlthough Locker-Lampson claimed that the organisation had 100,000 members, the Blue Shirts were short-lived and appeared to make little impact. Nevertheless,  they did attract the praise of the Nazi philosopher [[Alfred Rosenberg]], who in 1931 had lunch with Locker-Lampson at the Savoy during a visit to London. This was organised by the MI6 spy [[F. W. Winterbotham]] who was investigating the Nazis at the time, posing as an admirer who could help the Nazis make links with prominent figures in Britain. Locker-Lampson\u2019s Blue Shirts apparently \"delighted Rosenberg, and when he heard that their objective was to counter Communist propaganda he was even more enthusiastic\", and Rosenberg later sent him a gold cigarette case as a \"token of his esteem\". Locker-Lampson returned the gift with some embarrassment.<ref>Winterbotham, F. W. ''The Nazi Connection'' (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1978) pp. 34-5. The meeting is further verified in a report in the ''Daily Express'', 5 May 1933, p. 19.</ref>\n\nFrom 1933 onwards, Locker-Lampson redirected his political ire against fascism both in Britain and in continental Europe. In July 1933 he introduced a [[Private member's bill]] to extend British citizenship to [[Judaism|Jewish]] refugees from Nazi persecution, though it failed to become law. In September, he provided [[Albert Einstein]] with refuge at a camp on [[Roughton, Norfolk|Roughton Heath]] near his home in [[Cromer]] in north [[Norfolk]], after Einstein had received death threats while living in Belgium.<ref>Clark, Ronald W., ''Einstein: the Life and Times''. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1973.</ref> He later worked to help other high-profile victims of fascism, including [[Haile Selassie]] and [[Sigmund Freud]],<ref>[http://www.freud.org.uk/exhibitions/10025/promised-lands-freuds-exiles/ Sigmund Freud Museum, London, U.K.] Locker-Lampson proposed a parliamentary bill to confer citizenship on Freud.</ref> as well as numerous ordinary Jewish people, whom he personally sponsored in order they might escape Nazi persecution in Germany and Austria.<ref>See, for example, Lambert, Anna. ''Du Kannst Vor Nichts Davonlaufen''. Picus, Vienna: 1992; and letter in ''The Times'', 25 March 2010: http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article7074535.ece</ref> Some have called his efforts \"exceptional in how he saved Jews from Germany.\"<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article7074535.ece \"Saviour of Jews\"], ''The Sunday Times'', U.K., 25 March 2010</ref>\n\nIn 1934 he introduced a [[Ten Minute Rule]] Bill to ban the wearing of political uniforms - aimed at [[Oswald Mosley]]'s Black Shirts ([[British Union of Fascists]]). The Bill did not become law, but a similar bill sponsored by the government did become law in 1936. In 1935 he was a founding member of Focus,<ref>See Spier, Eugen. ''Focus. A footnote to the history of the thirties''. Oswald Wolff, London: 1963</ref> a cross-party group opposed to the prevailing policy of [[Appeasement]] of German and Italian aggression. In 1936 he was instrumental in the successful prosecution of the British fascist [[Arnold Leese]] for his publication of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic literature]]. Throughout the 1930s he was one of the few Conservative MPs to continue to support [[Winston Churchill]] during his \"wilderness years\" of political isolation.\n\nAge and ill-health prevented him from taking a very active part in the Second World War, though he joined the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]] and continued to support Winston Churchill vociferously from the [[backbencher|backbenches]].<ref>James, Robert Rhodes ed. (1967) 'Chips' The Diaries of Sir Henry Channon, p.387 in Phoenix paperback edn.</ref> He retired from politics at the 1945 General Election.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nThe Locker-Lampson family's principal home was [[Rowfant]] in West Sussex. Following his mother's death in 1915 Oliver's older brother Godfrey inherited Rowfant while Oliver inherited the family's summer home, Newhaven Court in Cromer, Norfolk. He was married twice. His first wife, Bianca Jacqueline Paget, whom he married in 1923, died in 1929. He married his second wife, Barbara Goodall, in 1935. They had two sons, Jonathan and Stephen.\n\nOliver Locker-Lampson is buried in [[St Nicholas' Church, Worth|Worth]] churchyard near Crawley, Sussex.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Perrett, Bryan; Lord, Anthony.

He would also give discourses on [[Bhagawata Purana]] on a regular basis, besides looking after the Balkrishna Library and the Vaishnava School at Mota Mandir. He composed many of his own monumental works relating to [[Gita]], Lord [[Krishna]], [[Chhandogya Upanishad]] etc., besides books on philosophy of Pure Non-dualism ([[Shuddhadvaita]]) during this period.<ref>\u2018Brahmasambandh athva Pushtimargiya Diksha\u2019, Sanatan Bhaktimargiya Sahitya Sewa Sadan, Mathura, 1932.</ref>\n\n== Interaction with Eminent Citizens and Leaders ==\n\nWhile in Mumbai, Pt.
