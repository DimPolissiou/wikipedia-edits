Over a three-year period, Freud worked in various departments of the hospital. His time spent in [[Theodor Meynert]]'s [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] clinic and as a [[locum]] in a local asylum led to an increased interest in clinical work. His substantial body of published research led to his appointment as a university lecturer or [[docent]] in [[neuropathology]] in 1885, a non-salaried post but one which entitled him to give lectures at the University of Vienna.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 42\u201347.</ref>\n\nIn 1886, Freud resigned his hospital post and entered private practice specializing in \"nervous disorders\".

He adopted the approach of his friend and collaborator, [[Josef Breuer]], in a type of hypnosis which was different from the French methods he had studied, in that it did not use suggestion. The treatment of one particular patient of Breuer's proved to be transformative for Freud's clinical practice. Described as [[Anna O.]], she was invited to talk about her symptoms while under hypnosis (she would coin the phrase \"[[talking cure]]\" for her treatment). In the course of talking in this way, her symptoms became reduced in severity as she retrieved memories of traumatic incidents associated with their onset.\n\nThe inconsistent results of Freud's early clinical work eventually led him to abandon hypnosis, having concluded that more consistent and effective symptom relief could be achieved by encouraging patients to talk freely, without censorship or inhibition, about whatever ideas or memories occurred to them. In conjunction with this procedure, which he called \"[[free association (psychology)|free association]]\", Freud found that patients' dreams could be fruitfully analyzed to reveal the complex structuring of unconscious material and to demonstrate the psychic action of [[Repression (psychology)|repression]] which, he had concluded, underlay symptom formation. By 1896 he was using the term \"[[psychoanalysis]]\" to refer to his new clinical method and the theories on which it was based.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 64\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[File:Freudsdoor.JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Ornate staircase, a landing with an interior door and window, staircase continuing up|Approach to Freud's consulting rooms at Berggasse 19]]\n\nFreud's development of these new theories took place during a period in which he experienced heart irregularities, disturbing dreams and periods of depression, a \"neurasthenia\" which he linked to the death of his father in 1896<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/freud.html |title=jewishvirtuallibrary Sigmund Freud (1856\u20131939) |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=20 May 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509021811/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/freud.html |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and which prompted a \"self-analysis\" of his own dreams and memories of childhood. His explorations of his feelings of hostility to his father and rivalrous jealousy over his mother's affections led him to fundamentally revise his theory of the origin of the neuroses.\n\nOn the basis of his early clinical work, Freud had postulated that unconscious memories of sexual molestation in early childhood were a necessary precondition for the psychoneuroses (hysteria and obsessional neurosis), a formulation now known as [[Freud's seduction theory]].<ref>Freud 1896c, pp. 203, 211, 219; Eissler 2005, p. 96.</ref> In the light of his self-analysis, Freud abandoned the theory that every neurosis can be traced back to the effects of infantile sexual abuse, now arguing that infantile sexual scenarios still had a causative function, but it did not matter whether they were real or imagined and that in either case they became pathogenic only when acting as repressed memories.<ref>J. Forrester ''The Seductions of Psychoanalysis'' Cambridge University Press 1990, pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nThis transition from the theory of infantile sexual trauma as a general explanation of how all neuroses originate to one that presupposes an autonomous infantile sexuality provided the basis for Freud's subsequent formulation of the theory of the [[Oedipus complex]].<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 88\u201396.</ref>\n\nFreud described the evolution of his clinical method and set out his theory of the psychogenetic origins of hysteria, demonstrated in a number of case histories, in ''Studies on Hysteria'' published in 1895 (co-authored with [[Josef Breuer]]). In 1899 he published ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' in which, following a critical review of existing theory, Freud gives detailed interpretations of his own and his patients' dreams in terms of [[Wish fulfillment|wish-fulfillments]] made subject to the repression and censorship of the \"dream work\". He then sets out the theoretical model of mental structure (the unconscious, pre-conscious and conscious) on which this account is based. An abridged version, ''On Dreams'', was published in 1901. In works which would win him a more general readership, Freud applied his theories outside the clinical setting in ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]]'' (1901) and ''[[Humor in Freud|Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious]]'' (1905).<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015, pp. 55\u201381.</ref> In ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', published in 1905, Freud elaborates his theory of infantile sexuality, describing its \"polymorphous perverse\" forms and the functioning of the \"drives\", to which it gives rise, in the formation of sexual identity.<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015, p. 91.</ref> The same year he published ''[[Dora (case study)|Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria]]'', which became one of his more famous and controversial case studies.<ref>Charles Bernheimer and Claire Kahane (eds) ''In Dora's Case: Freud \u2013 Hysteria \u2013 Feminism'', London: Virago 1985.</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Fliess===\nDuring this formative period of his work, Freud valued and came to rely on the intellectual and emotional support of his friend [[Wilhelm Fliess]], a Berlin-based ear, nose and throat specialist whom he had first met 1887. Both men saw themselves as isolated from the prevailing clinical and theoretical mainstream because of their ambitions to develop radical new theories of sexuality. Fliess developed highly eccentric theories of human [[biorhythm]]s and a nasogenital connection which are today considered pseudoscientific. He shared Freud's views on the importance of certain aspects of sexuality \u2014 masturbation, [[coitus interruptus]], and the use of condoms \u2014 in the etiology of what were then called the \"actual neuroses,\" primarily [[neurasthenia]] and certain physically manifested anxiety symptoms.<ref name=massonee>{{cite book |last=Masson |first=Jeffrey Moussaieff |authorlink=Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson |title=The Assault on Truth |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jDkkSLkjdJ8C&printsec=frontcover |year=2012 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=5G0QAQAAIAAJ 1984] |publisher=Untreed Reads |isbn=978-1-61187-280-4 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=jDkkSLkjdJ8C&pg=PT18 18]}}</ref> They maintained an extensive correspondence from which Freud drew on Fliess's speculations on infantile sexuality and bisexuality to elaborate and revise his own ideas.

According to Freud, her history of symptoms included severe leg pains with consequent restricted mobility, as well as stomach and menstrual pains. These pains were, according to Fliess's theories, caused by habitual masturbation which, as the tissue of the nose and genitalia were linked, was curable by removal of part of the [[Middle nasal concha|middle turbinate]].<ref name=Masson>Masson, Jeffrey M.

Freud ultimately, in light of Eckstein's history of adolescent self-cutting and irregular nasal (and menstrual) bleeding, concluded that Fliess was \"completely without blame\", as Eckstein's post-operative haemorrhages were hysterical \"wish-bleedings\" linked to \"an old wish to be loved in her illness\" and triggered as a means of \"rearousing [Freud's] affection\". Eckstein nonetheless continued her analysis with Freud.

Their friendship came to an acrimonious end with Fliess angry at Freud's unwillingness to endorse his general theory of sexual periodicity and accusing him of collusion in the plagiarism of his work.

This meeting, which was retrospectively deemed to be the first International Psychoanalytic Congress,<ref>Jones, E. 1955, pp. 44\u201345</ref> was convened at the suggestion of [[Ernest Jones]], then a London-based neurologist who had discovered Freud's writings and begun applying psychoanalytic methods in his clinical work. Jones had met Jung at a conference the previous year and they met up again in Z\u00fcrich to organize the Congress. There were, as Jones records, \"forty-two present, half of whom were or became practicing analysts.\"<ref>Jones, Ernest (1964) Sigmund Freud: Life and Work. Edited and abridged by Lionel Trilling and Stephen Marcus. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books p. 332</ref> In addition to Jones and the Viennese and Z\u00fcrich contingents accompanying Freud and Jung, also present and notable for their subsequent importance in the psychoanalytic movement were [[Karl Abraham]] and [[Max Eitingon]] from Berlin, [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]] from Budapest and the New York-based [[Abraham Brill]].\n\nImportant decisions were taken at the Congress with a view to advancing the impact of Freud's work. A journal, the ''Jahrbuch f\u00fcr psychoanalytische und psychopathologishe Forschungen'', was launched in 1909 under the editorship of Jung. This was followed in 1910 by the monthly ''[[Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse]]'' edited by Adler and Stekel, in 1911 by ''Imago'', a journal devoted to the application of psychoanalysis to the field of cultural and literary studies edited by Rank and in 1913 by the ''[[Internationale Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse]]'', also edited by Rank.<ref>Jones, Ernest (1964) ''Sigmund Freud: Life and Work''. Edited and abridged by Lionel Trilling and Stephen Marcus. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books pp. 334, 352, 361</ref> Plans for an [[International Psychoanalytical Association|international association of psychoanalysts]] were put in place and these were implemented at the Nuremberg Congress of 1910 where Jung was elected, with Freud's support, as its first president.\n\nFreud turned to Brill and Jones to further his ambition to spread the psychoanalytic cause in the English-speaking world. Both were invited to Vienna following the Salzburg Congress and a division of labour was agreed with Brill given the translation rights for Freud's works, and Jones, who was to take up a post at the [[University of Toronto]] later in the year, tasked with establishing a platform for Freudian ideas in North American academic and medical life.<ref>Gay 2006, p. 186</ref> Jones's advocacy prepared the way for Freud's visit to the United States, accompanied by Jung and Ferenczi, in September 1909 at the invitation of [[G.

Freud's audience included the distinguished neurologist and psychiatrist [[James Jackson Putnam]], Professor of Diseases of the Nervous System at [[Harvard]], who invited Freud to his country retreat where they held extensive discussions over a period of four days. Putnam's subsequent public endorsement of Freud's work represented a significant breakthrough for the psychoanalytic cause in the United States.<ref name=\"Gaypage212\">Gay 2006, p. 212</ref> When Putnam and Jones organised the founding of the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] in May 1911 they were elected president and secretary respectively. Brill founded the [[New York Psychoanalytic Society]] the same year. His English translations of Freud's work began to appear from 1909.\n\n====Resignations from the IPA====\nSome of Freud's followers subsequently withdrew from the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] (IPA) and founded their own schools.\n\nFrom 1909, Adler's views on topics such as neurosis began to differ markedly from those held by Freud. As Adler's position appeared increasingly incompatible with Freudianism, a series of confrontations between their respective viewpoints took place at the meetings of the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society in January and February 1911. In February 1911, Adler, then the president of the society, resigned his position. At this time, Stekel also resigned his position as vice president of the society. Adler finally left the Freudian group altogether in June 1911 to found his own organization with nine other members who had also resigned from the group.<ref>Three members of the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society resigned at the same time as Adler to establish the Society for Free Psychoanalysis.

Formed in the autumn of 1912, the Committee comprised Freud, Jones, Abraham, Ferenczi, Rank, and [[Hanns Sachs]]. Max Eitingon joined the Committee in 1919. Each member pledged himself not to make any public departure from the fundamental tenets of [[psychoanalytic theory]] before he had discussed his views with the others. After this development, Jung recognised that his position was untenable and resigned as editor of the ''Jarhbuch'' and then as president of the IPA in April 1914. The Z\u00fcrich Society withdrew from the IPA the following July.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 229\u201330, 241</ref><!--This might have more meaning if we actually knew what the Z\u00fcrich Society was.-->\n\nLater the same year, Freud published a paper entitled \"[[s:The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement|The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement]]\", the German original being first published in the ''Jahrbuch'', giving his view on the birth and evolution of the psychoanalytic movement and the withdrawal of Adler and Jung from it.\n\nThe final defection from Freud's inner circle occurred following the publication in 1924 of Rank's ''[[The Trauma of Birth]]'' which other members of the committee read as, in effect, abandoning the Oedipus Complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytic theory. Abraham and Jones became increasingly forceful critics of Rank and though he and Freud were reluctant to end their close and long-standing relationship the break finally came in 1926 when Rank resigned from his official posts in the IPA and left Vienna for Paris. His place on the committee was taken by [[Anna Freud]].<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 474\u201381</ref> Rank eventually settled in the United States where his revisions of Freudian theory were to influence a new generation of therapists uncomfortable with the orthodoxies of the IPA.\n\n===Early psychoanalytic movement===\n{{psychoanalysis}}\nAfter the founding of the IPA in 1910, an international network of psychoanalytical societies, training institutes and clinics became well established and a regular schedule of biannual Congresses commenced after the end of [[World War I]] to coordinate their activities.<ref>Gay 2006, p. 460</ref>\n\nAbraham and Eitingon founded the Berlin Psychoanalytic Society in 1910 and then the [[Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute]] and the Poliklinik in 1920. The Poliklinik's innovations of free treatment, and child analysis and the Berlin Institute's standardisation of psychoanalytic training had a major influence on the wider psychoanalytic movement. In 1927 [[Ernst Simmel]] founded the [[Schloss Tegel]] Sanatorium on the outskirts of [[Berlin]], the first such establishment to provide psychoanalytic treatment in an institutional framework. Freud organised a fund to help finance its activities and his architect son, Ernst, was commissioned to refurbish the building. It was forced to close in 1931 for economic reasons.<ref>[[Elizabeth Danto|Danto, Elizabeth Ann]] (2005). ''Freud's Free Clinics: Psychoanalysis and Social Justice, 1918\u20131938''.

There remained, however, significant differences over the issue of lay analysis \u2013 i.e. the acceptance of non-medically qualified candidates for psychoanalytic training. Freud set out his case in favour in 1926 in his ''[[The Question of Lay Analysis]]''. He was resolutely opposed by the American societies who expressed concerns over professional standards and the risk of litigation (though child analysts were made exempt). These concerns were also shared by some of his European colleagues. Eventually an agreement was reached allowing societies autonomy in setting criteria for candidature.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 490\u2013500</ref>\n\nIn 1930 Freud was awarded the [[Goethe Prize]] in recognition of his contributions to psychology and to German literary culture.<ref>Gay 2006, p. 571</ref>\n\n===Patients===\nFreud used pseudonyms in his case histories. Some patients known by pseudonyms were [[C\u00e4cilie M.]] (Anna von Lieben); [[Dora (case study)|Dora]] (Ida Bauer, 1882\u20131945); Frau Emmy von N. (Fanny Moser); Fr\u00e4ulein Elisabeth von R.

He initially kept this secret, but in April 1923 he informed Ernest Jones, telling him that the growth had been removed. Freud consulted the [[dermatologist]] Maximilian Steiner, who advised him to quit smoking but lied about the growth's seriousness, minimizing its importance. Freud later saw Felix Deutsch, who saw that the growth was cancerous; he identified it to Freud using the euphemism \"a bad leukoplakia\" instead of the technical diagnosis [[epithelioma]]. Deutsch advised Freud to stop smoking and have the growth excised. Freud was treated by Marcus Hajek, a [[rhinologist]] whose competence he had previously questioned. Hajek performed an unnecessary cosmetic surgery in his clinic's outpatient department. Freud bled during and after the operation, and may narrowly have escaped death. Freud subsequently saw Deutsch again. Deutsch saw that further surgery would be required, but did not tell Freud he had cancer because he was worried that Freud might wish to commit suicide.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 419\u201320</ref>\n\n===Escape from Nazism===\nIn January 1933, the [[Nazi Party]] took control of Germany, and Freud's books were prominent among those they [[Nazi book burnings|burned and destroyed]]. Freud remarked to [[Ernest Jones]]: \"What progress we are making. In the [[Middle Ages]] they would have burned me. Now, they are content with burning my books.\"<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 592\u201393.</ref> Freud continued to underestimate the growing Nazi threat and remained determined to stay in Vienna, even following the [[Anschluss]] of 13 March 1938, in which [[Nazi Germany]] annexed Austria, and the outbreaks of violent [[antisemitism]] that ensued.<ref name=Gay618>Gay 2006, pp. 618\u201320, 624\u201325.</ref> Jones, the then president of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] (IPA), flew into Vienna from London via Prague on 15 March determined to get Freud to change his mind and seek exile in Britain. This prospect and the shock of the arrest and interrogation of Anna Freud by the [[Gestapo]] finally convinced Freud it was time to leave Austria.<ref name=Gay618/> Jones left for London the following week with a list provided by Freud of the party of \u00e9migr\u00e9s for whom immigration permits would be required. Back in London, Jones used his personal acquaintance with the Home Secretary, [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]], to expedite the granting of permits. There were seventeen in all and work permits were provided where relevant. Jones also used his influence in scientific circles, persuading the president of the [[Royal Society]], [[William Henry Bragg|Sir William Bragg]], to write to the Foreign Secretary [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], requesting to good effect that diplomatic pressure be applied in Berlin and Vienna on Freud's behalf. Freud also had support from American diplomats, notably his ex-patient and American ambassador to France, [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William Bullitt]]. Bullitt alerted U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] to the increased dangers facing the Freuds, resulting in the American consul-general in Vienna, [[John Cooper Wiley]], arranging regular monitoring of Berggasse 19. He also intervened by phone call during the Gestapo interrogation of Anna Freud.<ref>Cohen 2009, pp. 152\u201353.</ref>\n\nThe departure from Vienna began in stages throughout April and May 1938. Freud's grandson Ernst Halberstadt and Freud's son Martin's wife and children left for Paris in April. Freud's sister-in-law, Minna Bernays, left for London on 5 May, Martin Freud the following week and Freud's daughter Mathilde and her husband, Robert Hollitscher, on 24 May.<ref>Cohen 2009, pp. 157\u201359.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month, arrangements for Freud's own departure for London had become stalled, mired in a legally tortuous and financially extortionate process of negotiation with the Nazi authorities. Under regulations imposed on its Jewish population by the new Nazi regime, a [[Reichskommissar|Kommissar]] was appointed to manage Freud's assets and those of the IPA whose headquarters were nearby Freud's home. Freud was allocated to Dr. Anton Sauerwald, who had studied chemistry at [[Vienna University]] under Professor [[Josef Herzig]], an old friend of Freud's. Sauerwald read Freud's books to further learn about him and became sympathetic towards his situation. Though required to disclose details of all Freud's bank accounts to his superiors and to arrange the destruction of the historic library of books housed in the offices of the IPA, Sauerwald did neither. Instead he removed evidence of Freud's foreign bank accounts to his own safe-keeping and arranged the storage of the IPA library in the Austrian National Library where it remained until the end of the war.<ref>Cohen 2009, p. 160.</ref>\n\nThough Sauerwald's intervention lessened the financial burden of the \"flight\" tax on Freud's declared assets, other substantial charges were levied in relation to the debts of the IPA and the valuable collection of antiquities Freud possessed. Unable to access his own accounts, Freud turned to [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], the most eminent and wealthy of his French followers, who had travelled to Vienna to offer her support and it was she who made the necessary funds available.<ref>Cohen 2009, p. 166</ref> This allowed Sauerwald to sign the necessary exit visas for Freud, his wife Martha and daughter Anna. They left Vienna on the [[Orient Express]] on 4 June, accompanied by their housekeeper and a doctor, arriving in Paris the following day where they stayed as guests of Marie Bonaparte before travelling overnight to London arriving at [[London Victoria station]] on 6 June.\n\nAmong those soon to call on Freud to pay their respects were [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Leonard Woolf]], [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[H. G. Wells]]. Representatives of the [[Royal Society]] called with the Society's Charter for Freud, who had been elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1936|Foreign Member]] in 1936, to sign himself into membership. Marie Bonaparte arrived towards the end of June to discuss the fate of Freud's four elderly sisters left behind in Vienna. Her subsequent attempts to get them exit visas failed and they would all die in [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref>Cohen 2009, pp. 178, 205\u201307.</ref>\n\n[[File:Freud Museum London 2.jpg|thumb|right|Freud's last home, now dedicated to his life and work as the [[Freud Museum|Freud Museum, {{nowrap|20 Maresfield Gardens,}} Hampstead, London NW3, England]].]]\nIn early 1939 Sauerwald arrived in London in mysterious circumstances where he met Freud's brother Alexander.<ref>Schur, Max (1972) ''Freud: Living and Dying'', London: Hogarth Press, pp. 498\u201399.</ref> He was tried and imprisoned in 1945 by an Austrian court for his activities as a Nazi Party official. Responding to a plea from his wife, Anna Freud wrote to confirm that Sauerwald \"used his office as our appointed commissar in such a manner as to protect my father\". Her intervention helped secure his release from jail in 1947.<ref>Cohen 2009, p. 213.</ref>\n\nIn the Freuds' new home, [[Freud Museum|20 Maresfield Gardens, Hampstead, North London]], Freud's Vienna consulting room was recreated in faithful detail.

The last book he read, [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]]'s ''[[La Peau de chagrin]]'', prompted reflections on his own increasing frailty and a few days later he turned to his doctor, friend and fellow refugee, [[Max Schur]], reminding him that they had previously discussed the terminal stages of his illness: \"Schur, you remember our 'contract' not to leave me in the lurch when the time had come. Now it is nothing but torture and makes no sense.\" When Schur replied that he had not forgotten, Freud said, \"I thank you,\" and then \"Talk it over with Anna, and if she thinks it's right, then make an end of it.\" Anna Freud wanted to postpone her father's death, but Schur convinced her it was pointless to keep him alive and on 21 and 22 September administered doses of morphine that resulted in Freud's death around 3&nbsp;am on 23 September 1939.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 650\u201351</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=1i7bxu%2FFMHIpo2b6nEloZg&scan=1 |title=Index entry |accessdate=2 September 2016 |website=FreeBMD |publisher=ONS}}</ref> However, discrepancies in the various accounts Schur gave of his role in Freud's final hours, which have in turn led to inconsistencies between Freud's main biographers, has led to further research and a revised account.

He entered private practice in neurology for financial reasons, receiving his M.D. degree in 1881 at the age of 25.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/62292238/History-of-Psychiatry |title=The History of Psychiatry |format=PDF |accessdate=6 February 2011 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Amongst his principal concerns in the 1880s was the anatomy of the brain, specifically the [[medulla oblongata]]. He intervened in the important debates about [[aphasia]] with his monograph of 1891, ''Zur Auffassung der Aphasien'', in which he coined the term [[agnosia]] and counselled against a too locationist view of the explanation of neurological deficits. Like his contemporary [[Eugen Bleuler]], he emphasized brain function rather than brain structure.\n\nFreud was also an early researcher in the field of [[cerebral palsy]], which was then known as \"cerebral paralysis\". He published several medical papers on the topic, and showed that the disease existed long before other researchers of the period began to notice and study it. He also suggested that [[William John Little]], the man who first identified cerebral palsy, was wrong about lack of oxygen during birth being a cause. Instead, he suggested that complications in birth were only a symptom.\n\nFreud hoped that his research would provide a solid scientific basis for his therapeutic technique. The goal of Freudian therapy, or psychoanalysis, was to bring repressed thoughts and feelings into [[consciousness]] in order to free the patient from suffering repetitive distorted emotions.\n\nClassically, the bringing of unconscious thoughts and feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk about dreams and engage in free association, in which patients report their thoughts without reservation and make no attempt to concentrate while doing so.<ref>Rycroft, Charles. ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 59</ref> Another important element of psychoanalysis is [[transference]], the process by which patients displace onto their analysts feelings and ideas which derive from previous figures in their lives. Transference was first seen as a regrettable phenomenon that interfered with the recovery of repressed memories and disturbed patients' objectivity, but by 1912, Freud had come to see it as an essential part of the therapeutic process.<ref>Rycroft, Charles. ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, pp. 185\u201386</ref>\n\nThe origin of Freud's early work with psychoanalysis can be linked to [[Josef Breuer]]. Freud credited Breuer with opening the way to the discovery of the psychoanalytical method by his treatment of the case of [[Anna O.]] In November 1880, Breuer was called in to treat a highly intelligent 21-year-old woman ([[Bertha Pappenheim]]) for a persistent cough that he diagnosed as hysterical. He found that while nursing her dying father, she had developed a number of transitory symptoms, including visual disorders and paralysis and contractures of limbs, which he also diagnosed as hysterical. Breuer began to see his patient almost every day as the symptoms increased and became more persistent, and observed that she entered states of ''absence''. He found that when, with his encouragement, she told fantasy stories in her evening states of ''absence'' her condition improved, and most of her symptoms had disappeared by April 1881. Following the death of her father in that month her condition deteriorated again. Breuer recorded that some of the symptoms eventually remitted spontaneously, and that full recovery was achieved by inducing her to recall events that had precipitated the occurrence of a specific symptom.<ref>Hirschmuller, Albrecht.

New York: New York University Press, 1989, pp. 101\u201316, 276\u2013307.</ref> In the years immediately following Breuer's treatment, Anna O. spent three short periods in sanatoria with the diagnosis \"hysteria\" with \"somatic symptoms\",<ref>Hirschmuller, Albrecht.

According to Freud's later accounts of this period, as a result of his use of this procedure most of his patients in the mid-1890s reported early [[childhood sexual abuse]]. He believed these stories, which he used as the basis for his [[Freud's seduction theory|seduction theory]], but then he came to believe that they were fantasies. He explained these at first as having the function of \"fending off\" memories of infantile masturbation, but in later years he wrote that they represented Oedipal fantasies, stemming from innate [[Drive theory|drives]] that are sexual and destructive in nature.<ref>Freud, ''Standard Edition'', vol. 7, 1906, p. 274; ''S.E. 14'', 1914, p. 18; '' S.E. 20'', 1925, p. 34; ''S.E. 22'', 1933, p. 120; Schimek, J.G.

He believed that cocaine was a cure for many mental and physical problems, and in his 1884 paper \"On Coca\" he extolled its virtues. Between 1883 and 1887 he wrote several articles recommending medical applications, including its use as an [[antidepressant]]. He narrowly missed out on obtaining [[scientific priority]] for discovering its [[anaesthesia|anesthetic]] properties of which he was aware but had mentioned only in passing.<ref>Jones, Ernest.

Freud believed that while poets and thinkers had long known of the existence of the unconscious, he had ensured that it received scientific recognition in the field of psychology.<ref name=\"WollheimChap6\" />\n\nFreud states explicitly that his concept of the unconscious as he first formulated it was based on the theory of repression. He postulated a cycle in which ideas are repressed, but remain in the mind, removed from consciousness yet operative, then reappear in consciousness under certain circumstances. The postulate was based upon the investigation of cases of [[hysteria]], which revealed instances of behaviour in patients that could not be explained without reference to ideas or thoughts of which they had no awareness and which analysis revealed were linked to the (real or imagined) repressed sexual scenarios of childhood. In his later re-formulations of the concept of repression in his 1915 paper 'Repression' ([[#The Standard Edition|''Standard Edition'']] XIV) Freud introduced the distinction in the unconscious between primary repression linked to the universal taboo on incest ('innately present originally') and repression ('after expulsion') that was a product of an individual's life history ('acquired in the course of the ego's development') in which something that was at one point conscious is rejected or eliminated from consciousness.<ref name=\"WollheimChap6\">Wollheim, Richard (1971). ''Freud''. London, Fontana Press, pp. 157\u201376</ref>\n\nIn his account of the development and modification of his theory of unconscious mental processes he sets out in his 1915 paper 'The Unconscious' ([[#The Standard Edition|''Standard Edition'']] XIV), Freud identifies the three perspectives he employs: the dynamic, the economic and the topographical.\n\nThe '''dynamic perspective''' concerns firstly the constitution of the unconscious by repression and secondly the process of \"censorship\" which maintains unwanted, anxiety inducing thoughts as such. Here Freud is drawing on observations from his earliest clinical work in the treatment of hysteria.\n\nIn the '''economic perspective''' the focus is upon the trajectories of the repressed contents \"the vicissitudes of sexual impulses\" as they undergo complex transformations in the process of both symptom formation and normal unconscious thought such as dreams and slips of the tongue. These were topics Freud explored in detail in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' and ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]].''\n\nWhereas both these former perspectives focus on the unconscious as it is about to enter consciousness, the '''topographical perspective''' represents a shift in which the systemic properties of the unconscious, its characteristic processes and modes of operation such as condensation and displacement, are placed in the foreground.\n\nThis \"first topography\" presents a model of psychic structure comprising three systems:\n\n*The System Ucs - the unconscious: \"primary process\" mentation governed by the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] characterised by \"exemption from mutual contradiction,{{nbsp}}... mobility of cathexes, timelessness and replacement of external by psychical reality.\" ('The Unconscious' (1915) [[#The Standard Edition|''Standard Edition'']] XIV).\n*The System Pcs - the preconscious in which the unconscious thing-presentations of the primary process are bound by the secondary processes of language (word presentations), a prerequisite for their becoming available to consciousness.\n*The System Cns - conscious thought governed by the reality principle.\n\nIn his later work, notably in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923), a second topography is introduced comprising [[id, ego and super-ego]], which is superimposed on the first without replacing it.<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015 [1971], pp. 137-140.</ref> In this later formulation of the concept of the unconscious the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]]<ref name=\"id\">{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Laplanche |first2=Jean-Bertrand |last2=Pontalis |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |chapter=Id |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT363&dq=%22Id+%3D+D.\\+Es%22 |title=The Language of Psychoanalysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |year=2018 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |isbn=978-0-429-92124-7}}</ref> comprises a reservoir of instincts or [[Drive theory|drives]] a portion of them being hereditary or innate, a portion repressed or acquired.

''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 41.</ref>\n\nIn Freud's theory dreams are instigated by the daily occurrences and thoughts of everyday life. In what Freud called the \"dream-work\", these \"secondary process\" thoughts (\"word presentations\"), governed by the rules of language and the reality principle, become subject to the \"primary process\" of unconscious thought (\"thing presentations\") governed by the pleasure principle, wish gratification and the repressed sexual scenarios of childhood. Because of the disturbing nature of the latter and other repressed thoughts and desires which may have become linked to them, the dream-work operates a censorship function, disguising by distortion, displacement and condensation the repressed thoughts so as to preserve sleep.<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015 [1971], pp. 55-58.</ref>\n\nIn the clinical setting Freud encouraged free association to the dream's manifest content, as recounted in the dream narrative, so as to facilitate interpretative work on its latent content \u2013 the repressed thoughts and fantasies \u2013 and also on the underlying mechanisms and structures operative in the dream-work. As Freud developed his theoretical work on dreams he went beyond his theory of dreams as wish-fulfillments to arrive at an emphasis on dreams as \"nothing other than a particular form of thinking.{{nbsp}}... It is the dream-work that creates that form, and it alone is the essence of dreaming\".<ref>Freud, Sigmund ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' (1976 [1900]) Harmondsworth: Pelican Books, p. 650.</ref>\n\n===Psychosexual development===\n{{Main|Psychosexual development}}\nFreud's theory of psychosexual development proposes that, following on from the initial [[polymorphous perversity]] of infantile sexuality, the sexual \"drives\" pass through the distinct developmental phases of the [[oral stage|oral]], the [[anal stage|anal]], and the [[phallic stage|phallic]]. Though these phases then give way to a [[latency stage]] of reduced sexual interest and activity (from the age of five to puberty, approximately), they leave, to a greater or lesser extent, a \"perverse\" and bisexual residue which persists during the formation of adult genital sexuality. Freud argued that [[neurosis]] or [[perversion]] could be explained in terms of fixation or regression to these phases whereas adult character and cultural creativity could achieve a [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] of their perverse residue.<ref>Mannoni 2015 [1971], pp. 93\u201397.</ref>\n\nAfter Freud's later development of the theory of the [[Oedipus complex]] this normative developmental trajectory becomes formulated in terms of the child's renunciation of incestuous desires under the fantasised threat of (or phantasised fact of, in the case of the girl) castration.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 515\u201318</ref> The \"dissolution\" of the Oedipus complex is then achieved when the child's rivalrous identification with the parental figure is transformed into the pacifying identifications of the [[Ego ideal]] which assume both similarity and difference and acknowledge the separateness and autonomy of the other.<ref>Cavell, Marcia ''The Psychoanalytic Mind'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press 1996, p. 225.</ref>\n\nFreud hoped to prove that his model was universally valid and turned to ancient mythology and contemporary ethnography for comparative material arguing that totemism reflected a ritualized enactment of a tribal Oedipal conflict.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paul|first=Robert A.|title=The Cambridge Companion to Freud|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-37779-9|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=J4UNrJlLGjoC&pg=PA274|editor=James Neu |page=274|chapter=Freud's anthropology}}</ref>\n\n===Id, ego, and super-ego===\n[[File:Structural-Iceberg.svg|thumb|The [[iceberg]] metaphor is often used to explain the psyche's parts in relation to one another]]\n{{Main|Id, ego and super-ego}}\nFreud proposed that the human psyche could be divided into three parts: Id, ego and super-ego. Freud discussed this model in the 1920 essay ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'', and fully elaborated upon it in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923), in which he developed it as an alternative to his previous topographic schema (i.e., conscious, unconscious and preconscious). The id is the completely unconscious, impulsive, childlike portion of the psyche that operates on the \"pleasure principle\" and is the source of basic impulses and drives; it seeks immediate pleasure and gratification.<ref name=\"Hothersall, D 2004. p. 290\">Hothersall, D. 2004. \"History of Psychology\", 4th ed., Mcgraw-Hill: NY p. 290</ref>\n\nFreud acknowledged that his use of the term ''Id'' (''das Es'', \"the It\") derives from the writings of [[Georg Groddeck]].<ref name=\"id\"/><ref>Freud, S.

''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 95.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'' (1920), Freud inferred the existence of a death drive. Its premise was a regulatory principle that has been described as \"the principle of psychic inertia\", \"the Nirvana principle\",<ref>Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (2018) [1973]. \"[https://books.google.com/?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT493&dq=%22Nirvana+Principle+%3D+D.:+Nirwanaprinzip%22+%22Term+proposed+by+Barbara+Low%22 Nirvana Principle\"].</ref> and \"the conservatism of instinct\". Its background was Freud's earlier ''Project for a Scientific Psychology'', where he had defined the principle governing the mental apparatus as its tendency to divest itself of quantity or to reduce tension to zero. Freud had been obliged to abandon that definition, since it proved adequate only to the most rudimentary kinds of mental functioning, and replaced the idea that the apparatus tends toward a level of zero tension with the idea that it tends toward a minimum level of tension.<ref name=\"Wollheim\">Wollheim, Richard. ''Freud''. London, Fontana Press, pp. 184\u201386.</ref>\n\nFreud in effect readopted the original definition in ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'', this time applying it to a different principle. He asserted that on certain occasions the mind acts as though it could eliminate tension entirely, or in effect to reduce itself to a state of extinction; his key evidence for this was the existence of the [[repetition compulsion|compulsion to repeat]]. Examples of such repetition included the dream life of traumatic neurotics and children's play. In the phenomenon of repetition, Freud saw a psychic trend to work over earlier impressions, to master them and derive pleasure from them, a trend was prior to the pleasure principle but not opposed to it. In addition to that trend, there was also a principle at work that was opposed to, and thus \"beyond\" the pleasure principle. If repetition is a necessary element in the binding of energy or adaptation, when carried to inordinate lengths it becomes a means of abandoning adaptations and reinstating earlier or less evolved psychic positions. By combining this idea with the hypothesis that all repetition is a form of discharge, Freud reached the conclusion that the compulsion to repeat is an effort to restore a state that is both historically primitive and marked by the total draining of energy: death.<ref name=\"Wollheim\" /> Such an explanation has been defined by some scholars as \"metaphysical biology\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Schuster |first=Aaron |title=The Trouble with Pleasure.

Freud claimed that, in normal mourning, the ego was responsible for narcissistically detaching the libido from the lost one as a means of self-preservation, but that in \"melancholia\", prior ambivalence towards the lost one prevents this from occurring. Suicide, Freud hypothesized, could result in extreme cases, when unconscious feelings of conflict became directed against the mourner's own ego.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perelberg|first1=Rosine Jozef|title=Freud: A Modern Reader|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-71373-0|page=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4v7fxQifjxAC&pg=PA168|language=en|date=2008-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Howarth|first1=Glennys|last2=Leaman|first2=Oliver|title=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-91378-5|page=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pMi2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT304|language=en|date=2003-12-16}}</ref>\n\n===Femininity and female sexuality===\nInitiating what became the first debate within psychoanalysis on femininity, [[Karen Horney]] of the Berlin Institute set out to challenge Freud's account of the development of feminine sexuality. Rejecting Freud's theories of the feminine [[castration complex]] and [[penis envy]], Horney argued for a primary femininity and penis envy as a defensive formation rather than arising from the fact, or \"injury\", of biological asymmetry as Freud held. Horney had the influential support of [[Melanie Klein]] and [[Ernest Jones]] who coined the term \"[[phallogocentrism|phallocentrism]]\" in his critique of Freud's position.<ref>Appignanesi, Lisa & Forrester, John. ''Freud's Women''. London: Penguin Books, 1992, pp. 433\u201337</ref>\n\nIn defending Freud against this critique, feminist scholar [[Jacqueline Rose]] has argued that it presupposes a more normative account of female sexual development than that given by Freud. She notes that Freud moved from a description of the little girl stuck with her 'inferiority' or 'injury' in the face of the anatomy of the little boy to an account in his later work which explicitly describes the process of becoming 'feminine' as an 'injury' or 'catastrophe' for the complexity of her earlier psychic and sexual life.<ref>Rose, J. ''Sexuality in the Field of Vision'', London: Verso 1986 pp. 91\u201393</ref>\n\nAccording to Freud, \"Elimination of clitoral sexuality is a necessary precondition for the development of femininity, since it is immature and masculine in its nature.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Julie M.L.C.L.

In 1905, he stated that clitoral orgasms are purely an adolescent phenomenon and that, upon reaching puberty, the proper response of mature women is a change-over to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation. This theory has been criticized on the grounds that Freud provided no evidence for this basic assumption, and because it made many women feel inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone.<ref name=\"Zastrow\">{{cite book | author= Charles Zastrow|author-link=Charles Zastrow|title = Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare: Empowering People | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year= 2007|page=228|accessdate = 15 March 2014| isbn = 978-0-495-09510-1 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=tco4YjyZab4C&pg=PT248&dq=#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"Irvine\">{{cite book|title=Disorders of Desire: Sexuality and Gender in Modern American Sexology|isbn =978-1-59213-151-8|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|pages=37\u201338|accessdate=3 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uIJXT7ZCTCsC&pg=PA37&dq=Kinsey+criticized+Freud#v=onepage&q=Kinsey%20criticized%20Freud&f=false|author=Janice M.

Freud argues the belief of a supernatural protector serves as a buffer from man's \"fear of nature\" just as the belief in an afterlife serves as a buffer from man's fear of death. The core idea of the work is that all of religious belief can be explained through its function to society, not for its relation to the truth. This is why, according to Freud, religious beliefs are \"illusions\". In ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1930), he quotes his friend [[Romain Rolland]], who described religion as an \"oceanic sensation\", but says he never experienced this feeling.<ref>Rubin, Jeffrey B., [https://books.google.com/?id=c0CBs5KeujoC&pg=PA79 'Psychoanalysis is self-centred'] in Charles Spezzano and Gerald J.

Adler originated the approach, although his influence was indirect due to his inability to systematically formulate his ideas. Neo-Freudian analysis places more emphasis on the patient's relationship with the analyst and less on exploration of the unconscious.<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Carl Jung]] believed that the [[collective unconscious]], which reflects the cosmic order and the history of the human species, is the most important part of the mind. It contains [[archetype]]s, which are manifested in symbols that appear in dreams, disturbed states of mind, and various products of culture. Jungians are less interested in infantile development and psychological conflict between wishes and the forces that frustrate them than in integration between different parts of the person. The object of Jungian therapy was to mend such splits. Jung focused in particular on problems of middle and later life. His objective was to allow people to experience the split-off aspects of themselves, such as the [[anima and animus|anima]] (a man's suppressed female self), the [[anima and animus|animus]] (a woman's suppressed male self), or the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] (an inferior self-image), and thereby attain wisdom.<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Jacques Lacan]] approached psychoanalysis through [[linguistics]] and literature. Lacan believed Freud's essential work had been done prior to 1905 and concerned the interpretation of dreams, neurotic symptoms, and slips, which had been based on a revolutionary way of understanding language and its relation to experience and subjectivity, and that [[ego psychology]] and [[object relations theory]] were based upon misreadings of Freud's work. For Lacan, the determinative dimension of human experience is neither the self (as in ego psychology) nor relations with others (as in object relations theory), but language. Lacan saw desire as more important than need and considered it necessarily ungratifiable.<ref>Mitchell, Stephen A. & Black, Margaret J. ''Freud and Beyond: A History of Modern Psychoanalytic Thought''. New York: Basic Books, 1995, pp. 193\u2013203</ref>\n\n[[Wilhelm Reich]] developed ideas that Freud had developed at the beginning of his psychoanalytic investigation but then superseded but never finally discarded. These were the concept of the Actualneurosis and a theory of anxiety based upon the idea of dammed-up libido. In Freud's original view, what really happened to a person (the \"actual\") determined the resulting neurotic disposition. Freud applied that idea both to infants and to adults. In the former case, seductions were sought as the causes of later neuroses and in the latter incomplete sexual release. Unlike Freud, Reich retained the idea that actual experience, especially sexual experience, was of key significance. By the 1920s, Reich had \"taken Freud's original ideas about sexual release to the point of specifying the orgasm as the criteria of healthy function.\" Reich was also \"developing his ideas about character into a form that would later take shape, first as \"muscular armour\", and eventually as a transducer of universal biological energy, the \"orgone\".\"<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Fritz Perls]], who helped to develop [[Gestalt therapy]], was influenced by Reich, Jung and Freud. The key idea of gestalt therapy is that Freud overlooked the structure of awareness, \"an active process that moves toward the construction of organized meaningful wholes{{nbsp}}... between an organism and its environment.\" These wholes, called ''gestalts'', are \"patterns involving all the layers of organismic function \u2013 thought, feeling, and activity.\" Neurosis is seen as splitting in the formation of gestalts, and anxiety as the organism sensing \"the struggle towards its creative unification.\" Gestalt therapy attempts to cure patients through placing them in contact with \"immediate organismic needs.\" Perls rejected the verbal approach of classical psychoanalysis; talking in gestalt therapy serves the purpose of self-expression rather than gaining self-knowledge. Gestalt therapy usually takes place in groups, and in concentrated \"workshops\" rather than being spread out over a long period of time; it has been extended into new forms of communal living.<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Arthur Janov]]'s [[primal therapy]], which has been an influential post-Freudian psychotherapy, resembles psychoanalytic therapy in its emphasis on early childhood experience, but has also differences with it. While Janov's theory is akin to Freud's early idea of Actualneurosis, he does not have a dynamic psychology but a nature psychology like that of Reich or Perls, in which need is primary while wish is derivative and dispensable when need is met. Despite its surface similarity to Freud's ideas, Janov's theory lacks a strictly psychological account of the unconscious and belief in infantile sexuality. While for Freud there was a hierarchy of danger situations, for Janov the key event in the child's life is awareness that the parents do not love it.<ref name=\"Kovel\">{{cite book |author=Kovel, Joel |title=A Complete Guide to Therapy |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1991 |pages=96, 123\u201335, 165\u201398 |isbn=978-0-14-013631-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Janov writes in ''[[The Primal Scream]]'' (1970) that primal therapy has in some ways returned to Freud's early ideas and techniques.<ref>Janov, Arthur.

They also found limited and equivocal support for [[Sigmund Freud's views on homosexuality|Freud's theories about the development of homosexuality]]. They found that several of Freud's other theories, including his portrayal of dreams as primarily containers of secret, unconscious wishes, as well as some of his views about the [[psychodynamics]] of women, were either not supported or contradicted by research.

By the 1940s, it had come to be seen as conservative by the European and American intellectual community. Critics outside the psychoanalytic movement, whether on the political left or right, saw Freud as a conservative. Fromm had argued that several aspects of psychoanalytic theory served the interests of political reaction in his ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' (1942), an assessment confirmed by sympathetic writers on the right. In ''[[Freud: The Mind of the Moralist]]'' (1959), [[Philip Rieff]] portrayed Freud as a man who urged men to make the best of an inevitably unhappy fate, and admirable for that reason. In the 1950s, [[Herbert Marcuse]] challenged the then prevailing interpretation of Freud as a conservative in ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' (1955), as did [[Lionel Trilling]] in ''Freud and the Crisis of Our Culture'' and [[Norman O.

In 1938, Freud left Austria to escape the [[Nazi]]s. He died in exile in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1939.\n\nIn founding psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of [[free association (psychology)|free association]] and discovered [[transference]], establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the [[Oedipus complex]] as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory.<ref>Jones, Ernest (1949) ''What is Psychoanalysis ?'' London: Allen & Unwin. p. 47.</ref> His analysis of [[dream]]s as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of [[Repression (psychology)|repression]].

It thus continues to generate extensive and highly contested debate with regard to its therapeutic efficacy, its scientific status, and whether it advances or is detrimental to the [[feminist]] cause.<ref>For its efficacy and the influence of psychoanalysis on psychiatry and psychotherapy, see ''The Challenge to Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy'', [http://americanmentalhealthfoundation.org/a.php?id=24 Chapter 9, Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry: A Changing Relationship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606094737/http://americanmentalhealthfoundation.org/a.php?id=24 |date=6 June 2009 }} by [[Robert Michels (physician)|Robert Michels]], 1999 and Tom Burns ''Our Necessary Shadow: The Nature and Meaning of Psychiatry'' London: Allen Lane 2013 pp. 96\u201397.\n* For the influence on psychology, see [http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-13/edition-12 ''The Psychologist'', December 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231004848/http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-13/edition-12 |date=31 December 2014 }}\n* For the influence of psychoanalysis in the humanities, see J.

His research work in cerebral anatomy led to the publication of an influential paper on the palliative effects of cocaine in 1884 and his work on [[aphasia]] would form the basis of his first book ''On the Aphasias: a Critical Study'', published in 1891. Over a three-year period, Freud worked in various departments of the hospital. His time spent in [[Theodor Meynert]]'s [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] clinic and as a [[locum]] in a local asylum led to an increased interest in clinical work. His substantial body of published research led to his appointment as a university lecturer or [[docent]] in [[neuropathology]] in 1885, a non-salaried post but one which entitled him to give lectures at the University of Vienna.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 42\u201347.</ref>\n\nIn 1886, Freud resigned his hospital post and entered private practice specializing in \"nervous disorders\". The same year he married [[Martha Bernays]], the granddaughter of [[Isaac Bernays]], a chief rabbi in Hamburg. They had six children: Mathilde (b. 1887), Jean-Martin (b. 1889), Oliver (b. 1891), [[Ernst L. Freud|Ernst]] (b. 1892), Sophie (b. 1893), and [[Anna Freud|Anna]] (b. 1895). From 1891 until they left Vienna in 1938, Freud and his family lived in an apartment at [[Sigmund Freud Museum (Vienna)|Berggasse 19]], near [[Innere Stadt]], a historical district of Vienna.\n\n[[File:Freud egykori lakhelye B\u00e9csben (Berggasse 19.).jpg|thumb|right|alt=photograph|Freud's home at [[Sigmund Freud Museum (Vienna)|Berggasse 19]], Vienna]]\nIn 1896, Minna Bernays, Martha Freud's sister, became a permanent member of the Freud household after the death of her fianc\u00e9.

He adopted the approach of his friend and collaborator, [[Josef Breuer]], in a type of hypnosis which was different from the French methods he had studied, in that it did not use suggestion. The treatment of one particular patient of Breuer's proved to be transformative for Freud's clinical practice. Described as [[Anna O.]], she was invited to talk about her symptoms while under hypnosis (she would coin the phrase \"[[talking cure]]\" for her treatment). In the course of talking in this way, her symptoms became reduced in severity as she retrieved memories of traumatic incidents associated with their onset.\n\nThe inconsistent results of Freud's early clinical work eventually led him to abandon hypnosis, having concluded that more consistent and effective symptom relief could be achieved by encouraging patients to talk freely, without censorship or inhibition, about whatever ideas or memories occurred to them. In conjunction with this procedure, which he called \"[[free association (psychology)|free association]]\", Freud found that patients' dreams could be fruitfully analyzed to reveal the complex structuring of unconscious material and to demonstrate the psychic action of [[Repression (psychology)|repression]] which, he had concluded, underlay symptom formation. By 1896 he was using the term \"[[psychoanalysis]]\" to refer to his new clinical method and the theories on which it was based.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 64\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[File:Freudsdoor.JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Ornate staircase, a landing with an interior door and window, staircase continuing up|Approach to Freud's consulting rooms at Berggasse 19]]\n\nFreud's development of these new theories took place during a period in which he experienced heart irregularities, disturbing dreams and periods of depression, a \"neurasthenia\" which he linked to the death of his father in 1896<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/freud.html |title=jewishvirtuallibrary Sigmund Freud (1856\u20131939) |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=20 May 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509021811/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/freud.html |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and which prompted a \"self-analysis\" of his own dreams and memories of childhood. His explorations of his feelings of hostility to his father and rivalrous jealousy over his mother's affections led him to fundamentally revise his theory of the origin of the neuroses.\n\nOn the basis of his early clinical work, Freud had postulated that unconscious memories of sexual molestation in early childhood were a necessary precondition for the psychoneuroses (hysteria and obsessional neurosis), a formulation now known as [[Freud's seduction theory]].<ref>Freud 1896c, pp. 203, 211, 219; Eissler 2005, p. 96.</ref> In the light of his self-analysis, Freud abandoned the theory that every neurosis can be traced back to the effects of infantile sexual abuse, now arguing that infantile sexual scenarios still had a causative function, but it did not matter whether they were real or imagined and that in either case they became pathogenic only when acting as repressed memories.<ref>J. Forrester ''The Seductions of Psychoanalysis'' Cambridge University Press 1990, pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nThis transition from the theory of infantile sexual trauma as a general explanation of how all neuroses originate to one that presupposes an autonomous infantile sexuality provided the basis for Freud's subsequent formulation of the theory of the [[Oedipus complex]].<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 88\u201396.</ref>\n\nFreud described the evolution of his clinical method and set out his theory of the psychogenetic origins of hysteria, demonstrated in a number of case histories, in ''Studies on Hysteria'' published in 1895 (co-authored with [[Josef Breuer]]). In 1899 he published ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' in which, following a critical review of existing theory, Freud gives detailed interpretations of his own and his patients' dreams in terms of [[Wish fulfillment|wish-fulfillments]] made subject to the repression and censorship of the \"dream work\". He then sets out the theoretical model of mental structure (the unconscious, pre-conscious and conscious) on which this account is based. An abridged version, ''On Dreams'', was published in 1901. In works which would win him a more general readership, Freud applied his theories outside the clinical setting in ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]]'' (1901) and ''[[Humor in Freud|Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious]]'' (1905).<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015, pp. 55\u201381.</ref> In ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', published in 1905, Freud elaborates his theory of infantile sexuality, describing its \"polymorphous perverse\" forms and the functioning of the \"drives\", to which it gives rise, in the formation of sexual identity.<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015, p. 91.</ref> The same year he published ''[[Dora (case study)|Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria]]'', which became one of his more famous and controversial case studies.<ref>Charles Bernheimer and Claire Kahane (eds) ''In Dora's Case: Freud \u2013 Hysteria \u2013 Feminism'', London: Virago 1985.</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Fliess===\nDuring this formative period of his work, Freud valued and came to rely on the intellectual and emotional support of his friend [[Wilhelm Fliess]], a Berlin-based ear, nose and throat specialist whom he had first met 1887. Both men saw themselves as isolated from the prevailing clinical and theoretical mainstream because of their ambitions to develop radical new theories of sexuality. Fliess developed highly eccentric theories of human [[biorhythm]]s and a nasogenital connection which are today considered pseudoscientific. He shared Freud's views on the importance of certain aspects of sexuality \u2014 masturbation, [[coitus interruptus]], and the use of condoms \u2014 in the etiology of what were then called the \"actual neuroses,\" primarily [[neurasthenia]] and certain physically manifested anxiety symptoms.<ref name=massonee>{{cite book |last=Masson |first=Jeffrey Moussaieff |authorlink=Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson |title=The Assault on Truth |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jDkkSLkjdJ8C&printsec=frontcover |year=2012 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=5G0QAQAAIAAJ 1984] |publisher=Untreed Reads |isbn=978-1-61187-280-4 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=jDkkSLkjdJ8C&pg=PT18 18]}}</ref> They maintained an extensive correspondence from which Freud drew on Fliess's speculations on infantile sexuality and bisexuality to elaborate and revise his own ideas.

According to Freud, her history of symptoms included severe leg pains with consequent restricted mobility, as well as stomach and menstrual pains. These pains were, according to Fliess's theories, caused by habitual masturbation which, as the tissue of the nose and genitalia were linked, was curable by removal of part of the [[Middle nasal concha|middle turbinate]].<ref name=Masson>Masson, Jeffrey M.

At first, though aware of Fliess's culpability \u2013 Freud fled from the remedial surgery in horror \u2013 he could only bring himself to delicately intimate in his correspondence to Fliess the nature of his disastrous role and in subsequent letters maintained a tactful silence on the matter or else returned to the face-saving topic of Eckstein's hysteria. Freud ultimately, in light of Eckstein's history of adolescent self-cutting and irregular nasal (and menstrual) bleeding, concluded that Fliess was \"completely without blame\", as Eckstein's post-operative haemorrhages were hysterical \"wish-bleedings\" linked to \"an old wish to be loved in her illness\" and triggered as a means of \"rearousing [Freud's] affection\". Eckstein nonetheless continued her analysis with Freud. She was restored to full mobility and went on to practice psychoanalysis herself.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 84\u201387, 154\u201356.</ref><ref>Schur, Max. \"Some Additional 'Day Residues' of the Specimen Dream of Psychoanalysis.\" In ''Psychoananalysis, A General Psychology'', ed.

Their friendship came to an acrimonious end with Fliess angry at Freud's unwillingness to endorse his general theory of sexual periodicity and accusing him of collusion in the plagiarism of his work. After Fliess failed to respond to Freud's offer of collaboration over publication of his ''Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality'' in 1906, their relationship came to an end.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 154\u201356.</ref>\n\n===Early followers===\n[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark.jpg|thumb|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]].

Prior to the completion of her studies, Spielrein had been a patient of Jung at the Burgh\u00f6lzli and the clinical and personal details of their relationship became the subject of an extensive correspondence between Freud and Jung. Both women would go on to make important contributions to the work of the Russian Psychoanalytic Society founded in 1910.<ref>Martin Miller(1998) ''Freud and the Bolsheviks'', Yale University Press, pp. 24, 45</ref>\n\nFreud's early followers met together formally for the first time at the Hotel Bristol, [[Salzburg]] on 27 April 1908. This meeting, which was retrospectively deemed to be the first International Psychoanalytic Congress,<ref>Jones, E. 1955, pp. 44\u201345</ref> was convened at the suggestion of [[Ernest Jones]], then a London-based neurologist who had discovered Freud's writings and begun applying psychoanalytic methods in his clinical work. Jones had met Jung at a conference the previous year and they met up again in Z\u00fcrich to organize the Congress. There were, as Jones records, \"forty-two present, half of whom were or became practicing analysts.\"<ref>Jones, Ernest (1964) Sigmund Freud: Life and Work. Edited and abridged by Lionel Trilling and Stephen Marcus. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books p. 332</ref> In addition to Jones and the Viennese and Z\u00fcrich contingents accompanying Freud and Jung, also present and notable for their subsequent importance in the psychoanalytic movement were [[Karl Abraham]] and [[Max Eitingon]] from Berlin, [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]] from Budapest and the New York-based [[Abraham Brill]].\n\nImportant decisions were taken at the Congress with a view to advancing the impact of Freud's work. A journal, the ''Jahrbuch f\u00fcr psychoanalytische und psychopathologishe Forschungen'', was launched in 1909 under the editorship of Jung. This was followed in 1910 by the monthly ''[[Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse]]'' edited by Adler and Stekel, in 1911 by ''Imago'', a journal devoted to the application of psychoanalysis to the field of cultural and literary studies edited by Rank and in 1913 by the ''[[Internationale Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse]]'', also edited by Rank.<ref>Jones, Ernest (1964) ''Sigmund Freud: Life and Work''. Edited and abridged by Lionel Trilling and Stephen Marcus. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books pp. 334, 352, 361</ref> Plans for an [[International Psychoanalytical Association|international association of psychoanalysts]] were put in place and these were implemented at the Nuremberg Congress of 1910 where Jung was elected, with Freud's support, as its first president.\n\nFreud turned to Brill and Jones to further his ambition to spread the psychoanalytic cause in the English-speaking world. Both were invited to Vienna following the Salzburg Congress and a division of labour was agreed with Brill given the translation rights for Freud's works, and Jones, who was to take up a post at the [[University of Toronto]] later in the year, tasked with establishing a platform for Freudian ideas in North American academic and medical life.<ref>Gay 2006, p. 186</ref> Jones's advocacy prepared the way for Freud's visit to the United States, accompanied by Jung and Ferenczi, in September 1909 at the invitation of [[G. Stanley Hall|Stanley Hall]], president of [[Clark University]], Worcester, Massachusetts, where he gave five lectures on psychoanalysis.<ref name=\"Gaypage212\" />\n\nThe event, at which Freud was awarded an Honorary Doctorate, marked the first public recognition of Freud's work and attracted widespread media interest. Freud's audience included the distinguished neurologist and psychiatrist [[James Jackson Putnam]], Professor of Diseases of the Nervous System at [[Harvard]], who invited Freud to his country retreat where they held extensive discussions over a period of four days. Putnam's subsequent public endorsement of Freud's work represented a significant breakthrough for the psychoanalytic cause in the United States.<ref name=\"Gaypage212\">Gay 2006, p. 212</ref> When Putnam and Jones organised the founding of the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] in May 1911 they were elected president and secretary respectively. Brill founded the [[New York Psychoanalytic Society]] the same year. His English translations of Freud's work began to appear from 1909.\n\n====Resignations from the IPA====\nSome of Freud's followers subsequently withdrew from the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] (IPA) and founded their own schools.\n\nFrom 1909, Adler's views on topics such as neurosis began to differ markedly from those held by Freud. As Adler's position appeared increasingly incompatible with Freudianism, a series of confrontations between their respective viewpoints took place at the meetings of the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society in January and February 1911. In February 1911, Adler, then the president of the society, resigned his position. At this time, Stekel also resigned his position as vice president of the society. Adler finally left the Freudian group altogether in June 1911 to found his own organization with nine other members who had also resigned from the group.<ref>Three members of the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society resigned at the same time as Adler to establish the Society for Free Psychoanalysis. Six other members of the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society who attempted to retain links to both the Adlerian and Freudian camps were forced out after Freud insisted that they must choose one side or another. {{cite book|last=Makari|first=George|title=Revolution in Mind: the Creation of Psychoanalysis|year=2008|publisher=Melbourne University Publishing|location=Carlton, Vic.|isbn=978-0-522-85480-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uPWBHwLjeXsC&pg=PA262|edition=Australian|page=262}}</ref> This new formation was initially called ''Society for Free Psychoanalysis'' but it was soon renamed the ''Society for Individual Psychology''.

Formed in the autumn of 1912, the Committee comprised Freud, Jones, Abraham, Ferenczi, Rank, and [[Hanns Sachs]]. Max Eitingon joined the Committee in 1919. Each member pledged himself not to make any public departure from the fundamental tenets of [[psychoanalytic theory]] before he had discussed his views with the others. After this development, Jung recognised that his position was untenable and resigned as editor of the ''Jarhbuch'' and then as president of the IPA in April 1914. The Z\u00fcrich Society withdrew from the IPA the following July.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 229\u201330, 241</ref><!--This might have more meaning if we actually knew what the Z\u00fcrich Society was.-->\n\nLater the same year, Freud published a paper entitled \"[[s:The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement|The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement]]\", the German original being first published in the ''Jahrbuch'', giving his view on the birth and evolution of the psychoanalytic movement and the withdrawal of Adler and Jung from it.\n\nThe final defection from Freud's inner circle occurred following the publication in 1924 of Rank's ''[[The Trauma of Birth]]'' which other members of the committee read as, in effect, abandoning the Oedipus Complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytic theory. Abraham and Jones became increasingly forceful critics of Rank and though he and Freud were reluctant to end their close and long-standing relationship the break finally came in 1926 when Rank resigned from his official posts in the IPA and left Vienna for Paris. His place on the committee was taken by [[Anna Freud]].<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 474\u201381</ref> Rank eventually settled in the United States where his revisions of Freudian theory were to influence a new generation of therapists uncomfortable with the orthodoxies of the IPA.\n\n===Early psychoanalytic movement===\n{{psychoanalysis}}\nAfter the founding of the IPA in 1910, an international network of psychoanalytical societies, training institutes and clinics became well established and a regular schedule of biannual Congresses commenced after the end of [[World War I]] to coordinate their activities.<ref>Gay 2006, p. 460</ref>\n\nAbraham and Eitingon founded the Berlin Psychoanalytic Society in 1910 and then the [[Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute]] and the Poliklinik in 1920. The Poliklinik's innovations of free treatment, and child analysis and the Berlin Institute's standardisation of psychoanalytic training had a major influence on the wider psychoanalytic movement. In 1927 [[Ernst Simmel]] founded the [[Schloss Tegel]] Sanatorium on the outskirts of [[Berlin]], the first such establishment to provide psychoanalytic treatment in an institutional framework. Freud organised a fund to help finance its activities and his architect son, Ernst, was commissioned to refurbish the building. It was forced to close in 1931 for economic reasons.<ref>[[Elizabeth Danto|Danto, Elizabeth Ann]] (2005). ''Freud's Free Clinics: Psychoanalysis and Social Justice, 1918\u20131938''.

Freud's Russian followers were the first to benefit from translations of his work, the 1904 Russian translation of ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' appearing nine years before Brill's English edition. The Russian Institute was unique in receiving state support for its activities, including publication of translations of Freud's works.<ref>Miller, Martin (1998) ''Freud and the Bolsheviks'', Yale University Press pp. 24, 59</ref> Support was abruptly annulled in 1924, when [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power, after which psychoanalysis was denounced on ideological grounds.<ref>Miller (1998), p. 94.</ref>\n\nAfter helping found the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] in 1911, Ernest Jones returned to Britain from Canada in 1913 and founded the London Psychoanalytic Society the same year. In 1919, he dissolved this organisation and, with its core membership purged of Jungian adherents, founded the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]], serving as its president until 1944. The Institute of Psychoanalysis was established 1924 and the London Clinic of Psychoanalysis established in 1926, both under Jones's directorship.<ref>Maddox, Brenda (2006).

He kept abreast of developments through a regular correspondence with his principal followers and via the circular letters and meetings of the secret Committee which he continued to attend.\n\nThe Committee continued to function until 1927 by which time institutional developments within the IPA, such as the establishment of the International Training Commission, had addressed concerns about the transmission of psychoanalytic theory and practice. There remained, however, significant differences over the issue of lay analysis \u2013 i.e. the acceptance of non-medically qualified candidates for psychoanalytic training. Freud set out his case in favour in 1926 in his ''[[The Question of Lay Analysis]]''. He was resolutely opposed by the American societies who expressed concerns over professional standards and the risk of litigation (though child analysts were made exempt). These concerns were also shared by some of his European colleagues. Eventually an agreement was reached allowing societies autonomy in setting criteria for candidature.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 490\u2013500</ref>\n\nIn 1930 Freud was awarded the [[Goethe Prize]] in recognition of his contributions to psychology and to German literary culture.<ref>Gay 2006, p. 571</ref>\n\n===Patients===\nFreud used pseudonyms in his case histories. Some patients known by pseudonyms were [[C\u00e4cilie M.]] (Anna von Lieben); [[Dora (case study)|Dora]] (Ida Bauer, 1882\u20131945); Frau Emmy von N. (Fanny Moser); Fr\u00e4ulein Elisabeth von R.

He initially kept this secret, but in April 1923 he informed Ernest Jones, telling him that the growth had been removed. Freud consulted the [[dermatologist]] Maximilian Steiner, who advised him to quit smoking but lied about the growth's seriousness, minimizing its importance. Freud later saw Felix Deutsch, who saw that the growth was cancerous; he identified it to Freud using the euphemism \"a bad leukoplakia\" instead of the technical diagnosis [[epithelioma]]. Deutsch advised Freud to stop smoking and have the growth excised. Freud was treated by Marcus Hajek, a [[rhinologist]] whose competence he had previously questioned. Hajek performed an unnecessary cosmetic surgery in his clinic's outpatient department. Freud bled during and after the operation, and may narrowly have escaped death. Freud subsequently saw Deutsch again. Deutsch saw that further surgery would be required, but did not tell Freud he had cancer because he was worried that Freud might wish to commit suicide.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 419\u201320</ref>\n\n===Escape from Nazism===\nIn January 1933, the [[Nazi Party]] took control of Germany, and Freud's books were prominent among those they [[Nazi book burnings|burned and destroyed]]. Freud remarked to [[Ernest Jones]]: \"What progress we are making. In the [[Middle Ages]] they would have burned me. Now, they are content with burning my books.\"<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 592\u201393.</ref> Freud continued to underestimate the growing Nazi threat and remained determined to stay in Vienna, even following the [[Anschluss]] of 13 March 1938, in which [[Nazi Germany]] annexed Austria, and the outbreaks of violent [[antisemitism]] that ensued.<ref name=Gay618>Gay 2006, pp. 618\u201320, 624\u201325.</ref> Jones, the then president of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] (IPA), flew into Vienna from London via Prague on 15 March determined to get Freud to change his mind and seek exile in Britain. This prospect and the shock of the arrest and interrogation of Anna Freud by the [[Gestapo]] finally convinced Freud it was time to leave Austria.<ref name=Gay618/> Jones left for London the following week with a list provided by Freud of the party of \u00e9migr\u00e9s for whom immigration permits would be required. Back in London, Jones used his personal acquaintance with the Home Secretary, [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]], to expedite the granting of permits. There were seventeen in all and work permits were provided where relevant. Jones also used his influence in scientific circles, persuading the president of the [[Royal Society]], [[William Henry Bragg|Sir William Bragg]], to write to the Foreign Secretary [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], requesting to good effect that diplomatic pressure be applied in Berlin and Vienna on Freud's behalf. Freud also had support from American diplomats, notably his ex-patient and American ambassador to France, [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William Bullitt]]. Bullitt alerted U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] to the increased dangers facing the Freuds, resulting in the American consul-general in Vienna, [[John Cooper Wiley]], arranging regular monitoring of Berggasse 19. He also intervened by phone call during the Gestapo interrogation of Anna Freud.<ref>Cohen 2009, pp. 152\u201353.</ref>\n\nThe departure from Vienna began in stages throughout April and May 1938. Freud's grandson Ernst Halberstadt and Freud's son Martin's wife and children left for Paris in April. Freud's sister-in-law, Minna Bernays, left for London on 5 May, Martin Freud the following week and Freud's daughter Mathilde and her husband, Robert Hollitscher, on 24 May.<ref>Cohen 2009, pp. 157\u201359.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month, arrangements for Freud's own departure for London had become stalled, mired in a legally tortuous and financially extortionate process of negotiation with the Nazi authorities. Under regulations imposed on its Jewish population by the new Nazi regime, a [[Reichskommissar|Kommissar]] was appointed to manage Freud's assets and those of the IPA whose headquarters were nearby Freud's home. Freud was allocated to Dr. Anton Sauerwald, who had studied chemistry at [[Vienna University]] under Professor [[Josef Herzig]], an old friend of Freud's. Sauerwald read Freud's books to further learn about him and became sympathetic towards his situation. Though required to disclose details of all Freud's bank accounts to his superiors and to arrange the destruction of the historic library of books housed in the offices of the IPA, Sauerwald did neither. Instead he removed evidence of Freud's foreign bank accounts to his own safe-keeping and arranged the storage of the IPA library in the Austrian National Library where it remained until the end of the war.<ref>Cohen 2009, p. 160.</ref>\n\nThough Sauerwald's intervention lessened the financial burden of the \"flight\" tax on Freud's declared assets, other substantial charges were levied in relation to the debts of the IPA and the valuable collection of antiquities Freud possessed. Unable to access his own accounts, Freud turned to [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], the most eminent and wealthy of his French followers, who had travelled to Vienna to offer her support and it was she who made the necessary funds available.<ref>Cohen 2009, p. 166</ref> This allowed Sauerwald to sign the necessary exit visas for Freud, his wife Martha and daughter Anna. They left Vienna on the [[Orient Express]] on 4 June, accompanied by their housekeeper and a doctor, arriving in Paris the following day where they stayed as guests of Marie Bonaparte before travelling overnight to London arriving at [[London Victoria station]] on 6 June.\n\nAmong those soon to call on Freud to pay their respects were [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Leonard Woolf]], [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[H. G. Wells]]. Representatives of the [[Royal Society]] called with the Society's Charter for Freud, who had been elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1936|Foreign Member]] in 1936, to sign himself into membership. Marie Bonaparte arrived towards the end of June to discuss the fate of Freud's four elderly sisters left behind in Vienna. Her subsequent attempts to get them exit visas failed and they would all die in [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref>Cohen 2009, pp. 178, 205\u201307.</ref>\n\n[[File:Freud Museum London 2.jpg|thumb|right|Freud's last home, now dedicated to his life and work as the [[Freud Museum|Freud Museum, {{nowrap|20 Maresfield Gardens,}} Hampstead, London NW3, England]].]]\nIn early 1939 Sauerwald arrived in London in mysterious circumstances where he met Freud's brother Alexander.<ref>Schur, Max (1972) ''Freud: Living and Dying'', London: Hogarth Press, pp. 498\u201399.</ref> He was tried and imprisoned in 1945 by an Austrian court for his activities as a Nazi Party official.

The last book he read, [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]]'s ''[[La Peau de chagrin]]'', prompted reflections on his own increasing frailty and a few days later he turned to his doctor, friend and fellow refugee, [[Max Schur]], reminding him that they had previously discussed the terminal stages of his illness: \"Schur, you remember our 'contract' not to leave me in the lurch when the time had come. Now it is nothing but torture and makes no sense.\" When Schur replied that he had not forgotten, Freud said, \"I thank you,\" and then \"Talk it over with Anna, and if she thinks it's right, then make an end of it.\" Anna Freud wanted to postpone her father's death, but Schur convinced her it was pointless to keep him alive and on 21 and 22 September administered doses of morphine that resulted in Freud's death around 3&nbsp;am on 23 September 1939.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 650\u201351</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=1i7bxu%2FFMHIpo2b6nEloZg&scan=1 |title=Index entry |accessdate=2 September 2016 |website=FreeBMD |publisher=ONS}}</ref> However, discrepancies in the various accounts Schur gave of his role in Freud's final hours, which have in turn led to inconsistencies between Freud's main biographers, has led to further research and a revised account.

He entered private practice in neurology for financial reasons, receiving his M.D. degree in 1881 at the age of 25.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/62292238/History-of-Psychiatry |title=The History of Psychiatry |format=PDF |accessdate=6 February 2011 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Amongst his principal concerns in the 1880s was the anatomy of the brain, specifically the [[medulla oblongata]]. He intervened in the important debates about [[aphasia]] with his monograph of 1891, ''Zur Auffassung der Aphasien'', in which he coined the term [[agnosia]] and counselled against a too locationist view of the explanation of neurological deficits. Like his contemporary [[Eugen Bleuler]], he emphasized brain function rather than brain structure.\n\nFreud was also an early researcher in the field of [[cerebral palsy]], which was then known as \"cerebral paralysis\". He published several medical papers on the topic, and showed that the disease existed long before other researchers of the period began to notice and study it. He also suggested that [[William John Little]], the man who first identified cerebral palsy, was wrong about lack of oxygen during birth being a cause. Instead, he suggested that complications in birth were only a symptom.\n\nFreud hoped that his research would provide a solid scientific basis for his therapeutic technique. The goal of Freudian therapy, or psychoanalysis, was to bring repressed thoughts and feelings into [[consciousness]] in order to free the patient from suffering repetitive distorted emotions.\n\nClassically, the bringing of unconscious thoughts and feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk about dreams and engage in free association, in which patients report their thoughts without reservation and make no attempt to concentrate while doing so.<ref>Rycroft, Charles. ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 59</ref> Another important element of psychoanalysis is [[transference]], the process by which patients displace onto their analysts feelings and ideas which derive from previous figures in their lives. Transference was first seen as a regrettable phenomenon that interfered with the recovery of repressed memories and disturbed patients' objectivity, but by 1912, Freud had come to see it as an essential part of the therapeutic process.<ref>Rycroft, Charles. ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, pp. 185\u201386</ref>\n\nThe origin of Freud's early work with psychoanalysis can be linked to [[Josef Breuer]]. Freud credited Breuer with opening the way to the discovery of the psychoanalytical method by his treatment of the case of [[Anna O.]] In November 1880, Breuer was called in to treat a highly intelligent 21-year-old woman ([[Bertha Pappenheim]]) for a persistent cough that he diagnosed as hysterical. He found that while nursing her dying father, she had developed a number of transitory symptoms, including visual disorders and paralysis and contractures of limbs, which he also diagnosed as hysterical. Breuer began to see his patient almost every day as the symptoms increased and became more persistent, and observed that she entered states of ''absence''. He found that when, with his encouragement, she told fantasy stories in her evening states of ''absence'' her condition improved, and most of her symptoms had disappeared by April 1881. Following the death of her father in that month her condition deteriorated again. Breuer recorded that some of the symptoms eventually remitted spontaneously, and that full recovery was achieved by inducing her to recall events that had precipitated the occurrence of a specific symptom.<ref>Hirschmuller, Albrecht.

According to Freud's later accounts of this period, as a result of his use of this procedure most of his patients in the mid-1890s reported early [[childhood sexual abuse]]. He believed these stories, which he used as the basis for his [[Freud's seduction theory|seduction theory]], but then he came to believe that they were fantasies. He explained these at first as having the function of \"fending off\" memories of infantile masturbation, but in later years he wrote that they represented Oedipal fantasies, stemming from innate [[Drive theory|drives]] that are sexual and destructive in nature.<ref>Freud, ''Standard Edition'', vol. 7, 1906, p. 274; ''S.E. 14'', 1914, p. 18; '' S.E. 20'', 1925, p. 34; ''S.E. 22'', 1933, p. 120; Schimek, J.G.

He believed that cocaine was a cure for many mental and physical problems, and in his 1884 paper \"On Coca\" he extolled its virtues. Between 1883 and 1887 he wrote several articles recommending medical applications, including its use as an [[antidepressant]].

Freud believed that while poets and thinkers had long known of the existence of the unconscious, he had ensured that it received scientific recognition in the field of psychology.<ref name=\"WollheimChap6\" />\n\nFreud states explicitly that his concept of the unconscious as he first formulated it was based on the theory of repression. He postulated a cycle in which ideas are repressed, but remain in the mind, removed from consciousness yet operative, then reappear in consciousness under certain circumstances. The postulate was based upon the investigation of cases of [[hysteria]], which revealed instances of behaviour in patients that could not be explained without reference to ideas or thoughts of which they had no awareness and which analysis revealed were linked to the (real or imagined) repressed sexual scenarios of childhood. In his later re-formulations of the concept of repression in his 1915 paper 'Repression' ([[#The Standard Edition|''Standard Edition'']] XIV) Freud introduced the distinction in the unconscious between primary repression linked to the universal taboo on incest ('innately present originally') and repression ('after expulsion') that was a product of an individual's life history ('acquired in the course of the ego's development') in which something that was at one point conscious is rejected or eliminated from consciousness.<ref name=\"WollheimChap6\">Wollheim, Richard (1971). ''Freud''. London, Fontana Press, pp. 157\u201376</ref>\n\nIn his account of the development and modification of his theory of unconscious mental processes he sets out in his 1915 paper 'The Unconscious' ([[#The Standard Edition|''Standard Edition'']] XIV), Freud identifies the three perspectives he employs: the dynamic, the economic and the topographical.\n\nThe '''dynamic perspective''' concerns firstly the constitution of the unconscious by repression and secondly the process of \"censorship\" which maintains unwanted, anxiety inducing thoughts as such. Here Freud is drawing on observations from his earliest clinical work in the treatment of hysteria.\n\nIn the '''economic perspective''' the focus is upon the trajectories of the repressed contents \"the vicissitudes of sexual impulses\" as they undergo complex transformations in the process of both symptom formation and normal unconscious thought such as dreams and slips of the tongue. These were topics Freud explored in detail in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' and ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]].''\n\nWhereas both these former perspectives focus on the unconscious as it is about to enter consciousness, the '''topographical perspective''' represents a shift in which the systemic properties of the unconscious, its characteristic processes and modes of operation such as condensation and displacement, are placed in the foreground.\n\nThis \"first topography\" presents a model of psychic structure comprising three systems:\n\n*The System Ucs - the unconscious: \"primary process\" mentation governed by the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] characterised by \"exemption from mutual contradiction,{{nbsp}}... mobility of cathexes, timelessness and replacement of external by psychical reality.\" ('The Unconscious' (1915) [[#The Standard Edition|''Standard Edition'']] XIV).\n*The System Pcs - the preconscious in which the unconscious thing-presentations of the primary process are bound by the secondary processes of language (word presentations), a prerequisite for their becoming available to consciousness.\n*The System Cns - conscious thought governed by the reality principle.\n\nIn his later work, notably in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923), a second topography is introduced comprising [[id, ego and super-ego]], which is superimposed on the first without replacing it.<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015 [1971], pp. 137-140.</ref> In this later formulation of the concept of the unconscious the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]]<ref name=\"id\">{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Laplanche |first2=Jean-Bertrand |last2=Pontalis |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |chapter=Id |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT363&dq=%22Id+%3D+D.\\+Es%22 |title=The Language of Psychoanalysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |year=2018 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |isbn=978-0-429-92124-7}}</ref> comprises a reservoir of instincts or [[Drive theory|drives]] a portion of them being hereditary or innate, a portion repressed or acquired.

''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 41.</ref>\n\nIn Freud's theory dreams are instigated by the daily occurrences and thoughts of everyday life. In what Freud called the \"dream-work\", these \"secondary process\" thoughts (\"word presentations\"), governed by the rules of language and the reality principle, become subject to the \"primary process\" of unconscious thought (\"thing presentations\") governed by the pleasure principle, wish gratification and the repressed sexual scenarios of childhood. Because of the disturbing nature of the latter and other repressed thoughts and desires which may have become linked to them, the dream-work operates a censorship function, disguising by distortion, displacement and condensation the repressed thoughts so as to preserve sleep.<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015 [1971], pp. 55-58.</ref>\n\nIn the clinical setting Freud encouraged free association to the dream's manifest content, as recounted in the dream narrative, so as to facilitate interpretative work on its latent content \u2013 the repressed thoughts and fantasies \u2013 and also on the underlying mechanisms and structures operative in the dream-work. As Freud developed his theoretical work on dreams he went beyond his theory of dreams as wish-fulfillments to arrive at an emphasis on dreams as \"nothing other than a particular form of thinking.{{nbsp}}... It is the dream-work that creates that form, and it alone is the essence of dreaming\".<ref>Freud, Sigmund ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' (1976 [1900]) Harmondsworth: Pelican Books, p. 650.</ref>\n\n===Psychosexual development===\n{{Main|Psychosexual development}}\nFreud's theory of psychosexual development proposes that, following on from the initial [[polymorphous perversity]] of infantile sexuality, the sexual \"drives\" pass through the distinct developmental phases of the [[oral stage|oral]], the [[anal stage|anal]], and the [[phallic stage|phallic]]. Though these phases then give way to a [[latency stage]] of reduced sexual interest and activity (from the age of five to puberty, approximately), they leave, to a greater or lesser extent, a \"perverse\" and bisexual residue which persists during the formation of adult genital sexuality.

Freud discussed this model in the 1920 essay ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'', and fully elaborated upon it in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923), in which he developed it as an alternative to his previous topographic schema (i.e., conscious, unconscious and preconscious). The id is the completely unconscious, impulsive, childlike portion of the psyche that operates on the \"pleasure principle\" and is the source of basic impulses and drives; it seeks immediate pleasure and gratification.<ref name=\"Hothersall, D 2004. p. 290\">Hothersall, D. 2004. \"History of Psychology\", 4th ed., Mcgraw-Hill: NY p. 290</ref>\n\nFreud acknowledged that his use of the term ''Id'' (''das Es'', \"the It\") derives from the writings of [[Georg Groddeck]].<ref name=\"id\"/><ref>Freud, S.

''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 95.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'' (1920), Freud inferred the existence of a death drive. Its premise was a regulatory principle that has been described as \"the principle of psychic inertia\", \"the Nirvana principle\",<ref>Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (2018) [1973]. \"[https://books.google.com/?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT493&dq=%22Nirvana+Principle+%3D+D.:+Nirwanaprinzip%22+%22Term+proposed+by+Barbara+Low%22 Nirvana Principle\"].</ref> and \"the conservatism of instinct\". Its background was Freud's earlier ''Project for a Scientific Psychology'', where he had defined the principle governing the mental apparatus as its tendency to divest itself of quantity or to reduce tension to zero. Freud had been obliged to abandon that definition, since it proved adequate only to the most rudimentary kinds of mental functioning, and replaced the idea that the apparatus tends toward a level of zero tension with the idea that it tends toward a minimum level of tension.<ref name=\"Wollheim\">Wollheim, Richard. ''Freud''. London, Fontana Press, pp. 184\u201386.</ref>\n\nFreud in effect readopted the original definition in ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'', this time applying it to a different principle. He asserted that on certain occasions the mind acts as though it could eliminate tension entirely, or in effect to reduce itself to a state of extinction; his key evidence for this was the existence of the [[repetition compulsion|compulsion to repeat]]. Examples of such repetition included the dream life of traumatic neurotics and children's play. In the phenomenon of repetition, Freud saw a psychic trend to work over earlier impressions, to master them and derive pleasure from them, a trend was prior to the pleasure principle but not opposed to it. In addition to that trend, there was also a principle at work that was opposed to, and thus \"beyond\" the pleasure principle. If repetition is a necessary element in the binding of energy or adaptation, when carried to inordinate lengths it becomes a means of abandoning adaptations and reinstating earlier or less evolved psychic positions. By combining this idea with the hypothesis that all repetition is a form of discharge, Freud reached the conclusion that the compulsion to repeat is an effort to restore a state that is both historically primitive and marked by the total draining of energy: death.<ref name=\"Wollheim\" /> Such an explanation has been defined by some scholars as \"metaphysical biology\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Schuster |first=Aaron |title=The Trouble with Pleasure.

Freud claimed that, in normal mourning, the ego was responsible for narcissistically detaching the libido from the lost one as a means of self-preservation, but that in \"melancholia\", prior ambivalence towards the lost one prevents this from occurring. Suicide, Freud hypothesized, could result in extreme cases, when unconscious feelings of conflict became directed against the mourner's own ego.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perelberg|first1=Rosine Jozef|title=Freud: A Modern Reader|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-71373-0|page=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4v7fxQifjxAC&pg=PA168|language=en|date=2008-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Howarth|first1=Glennys|last2=Leaman|first2=Oliver|title=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-91378-5|page=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pMi2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT304|language=en|date=2003-12-16}}</ref>\n\n===Femininity and female sexuality===\nInitiating what became the first debate within psychoanalysis on femininity, [[Karen Horney]] of the Berlin Institute set out to challenge Freud's account of the development of feminine sexuality. Rejecting Freud's theories of the feminine [[castration complex]] and [[penis envy]], Horney argued for a primary femininity and penis envy as a defensive formation rather than arising from the fact, or \"injury\", of biological asymmetry as Freud held. Horney had the influential support of [[Melanie Klein]] and [[Ernest Jones]] who coined the term \"[[phallogocentrism|phallocentrism]]\" in his critique of Freud's position.<ref>Appignanesi, Lisa & Forrester, John. ''Freud's Women''. London: Penguin Books, 1992, pp. 433\u201337</ref>\n\nIn defending Freud against this critique, feminist scholar [[Jacqueline Rose]] has argued that it presupposes a more normative account of female sexual development than that given by Freud. She notes that Freud moved from a description of the little girl stuck with her 'inferiority' or 'injury' in the face of the anatomy of the little boy to an account in his later work which explicitly describes the process of becoming 'feminine' as an 'injury' or 'catastrophe' for the complexity of her earlier psychic and sexual life.<ref>Rose, J. ''Sexuality in the Field of Vision'', London: Verso 1986 pp. 91\u201393</ref>\n\nAccording to Freud, \"Elimination of clitoral sexuality is a necessary precondition for the development of femininity, since it is immature and masculine in its nature.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Julie M.L.C.L.

In 1905, he stated that clitoral orgasms are purely an adolescent phenomenon and that, upon reaching puberty, the proper response of mature women is a change-over to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation. This theory has been criticized on the grounds that Freud provided no evidence for this basic assumption, and because it made many women feel inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone.<ref name=\"Zastrow\">{{cite book | author= Charles Zastrow|author-link=Charles Zastrow|title = Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare: Empowering People | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year= 2007|page=228|accessdate = 15 March 2014| isbn = 978-0-495-09510-1 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=tco4YjyZab4C&pg=PT248&dq=#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"Irvine\">{{cite book|title=Disorders of Desire: Sexuality and Gender in Modern American Sexology|isbn =978-1-59213-151-8|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|pages=37\u201338|accessdate=3 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uIJXT7ZCTCsC&pg=PA37&dq=Kinsey+criticized+Freud#v=onepage&q=Kinsey%20criticized%20Freud&f=false|author=Janice M.

Freud argues the belief of a supernatural protector serves as a buffer from man's \"fear of nature\" just as the belief in an afterlife serves as a buffer from man's fear of death. The core idea of the work is that all of religious belief can be explained through its function to society, not for its relation to the truth. This is why, according to Freud, religious beliefs are \"illusions\". In ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1930), he quotes his friend [[Romain Rolland]], who described religion as an \"oceanic sensation\", but says he never experienced this feeling.<ref>Rubin, Jeffrey B., [https://books.google.com/?id=c0CBs5KeujoC&pg=PA79 'Psychoanalysis is self-centred'] in Charles Spezzano and Gerald J.

Neo-Freudian analysis places more emphasis on the patient's relationship with the analyst and less on exploration of the unconscious.<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Carl Jung]] believed that the [[collective unconscious]], which reflects the cosmic order and the history of the human species, is the most important part of the mind. It contains [[archetype]]s, which are manifested in symbols that appear in dreams, disturbed states of mind, and various products of culture. Jungians are less interested in infantile development and psychological conflict between wishes and the forces that frustrate them than in integration between different parts of the person. The object of Jungian therapy was to mend such splits. Jung focused in particular on problems of middle and later life. His objective was to allow people to experience the split-off aspects of themselves, such as the [[anima and animus|anima]] (a man's suppressed female self), the [[anima and animus|animus]] (a woman's suppressed male self), or the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] (an inferior self-image), and thereby attain wisdom.<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Jacques Lacan]] approached psychoanalysis through [[linguistics]] and literature. Lacan believed Freud's essential work had been done prior to 1905 and concerned the interpretation of dreams, neurotic symptoms, and slips, which had been based on a revolutionary way of understanding language and its relation to experience and subjectivity, and that [[ego psychology]] and [[object relations theory]] were based upon misreadings of Freud's work. For Lacan, the determinative dimension of human experience is neither the self (as in ego psychology) nor relations with others (as in object relations theory), but language. Lacan saw desire as more important than need and considered it necessarily ungratifiable.<ref>Mitchell, Stephen A. & Black, Margaret J. ''Freud and Beyond: A History of Modern Psychoanalytic Thought''. New York: Basic Books, 1995, pp. 193\u2013203</ref>\n\n[[Wilhelm Reich]] developed ideas that Freud had developed at the beginning of his psychoanalytic investigation but then superseded but never finally discarded. These were the concept of the Actualneurosis and a theory of anxiety based upon the idea of dammed-up libido. In Freud's original view, what really happened to a person (the \"actual\") determined the resulting neurotic disposition. Freud applied that idea both to infants and to adults. In the former case, seductions were sought as the causes of later neuroses and in the latter incomplete sexual release. Unlike Freud, Reich retained the idea that actual experience, especially sexual experience, was of key significance. By the 1920s, Reich had \"taken Freud's original ideas about sexual release to the point of specifying the orgasm as the criteria of healthy function.\" Reich was also \"developing his ideas about character into a form that would later take shape, first as \"muscular armour\", and eventually as a transducer of universal biological energy, the \"orgone\".\"<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Fritz Perls]], who helped to develop [[Gestalt therapy]], was influenced by Reich, Jung and Freud. The key idea of gestalt therapy is that Freud overlooked the structure of awareness, \"an active process that moves toward the construction of organized meaningful wholes{{nbsp}}... between an organism and its environment.\" These wholes, called ''gestalts'', are \"patterns involving all the layers of organismic function \u2013 thought, feeling, and activity.\" Neurosis is seen as splitting in the formation of gestalts, and anxiety as the organism sensing \"the struggle towards its creative unification.\" Gestalt therapy attempts to cure patients through placing them in contact with \"immediate organismic needs.\" Perls rejected the verbal approach of classical psychoanalysis; talking in gestalt therapy serves the purpose of self-expression rather than gaining self-knowledge. Gestalt therapy usually takes place in groups, and in concentrated \"workshops\" rather than being spread out over a long period of time; it has been extended into new forms of communal living.<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Arthur Janov]]'s [[primal therapy]], which has been an influential post-Freudian psychotherapy, resembles psychoanalytic therapy in its emphasis on early childhood experience, but has also differences with it. While Janov's theory is akin to Freud's early idea of Actualneurosis, he does not have a dynamic psychology but a nature psychology like that of Reich or Perls, in which need is primary while wish is derivative and dispensable when need is met. Despite its surface similarity to Freud's ideas, Janov's theory lacks a strictly psychological account of the unconscious and belief in infantile sexuality. While for Freud there was a hierarchy of danger situations, for Janov the key event in the child's life is awareness that the parents do not love it.<ref name=\"Kovel\">{{cite book |author=Kovel, Joel |title=A Complete Guide to Therapy |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1991 |pages=96, 123\u201335, 165\u201398 |isbn=978-0-14-013631-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Janov writes in ''[[The Primal Scream]]'' (1970) that primal therapy has in some ways returned to Freud's early ideas and techniques.<ref>Janov, Arthur.

Their analysis of research literature supported Freud's concepts of oral and anal personality constellations, his account of the role of Oedipal factors in certain aspects of male personality functioning, his formulations about the relatively greater concern about loss of love in women's as compared to men's personality economy, and his views about the instigating effects of homosexual anxieties on the formation of paranoid delusions. They also found limited and equivocal support for [[Sigmund Freud's views on homosexuality|Freud's theories about the development of homosexuality]]. They found that several of Freud's other theories, including his portrayal of dreams as primarily containers of secret, unconscious wishes, as well as some of his views about the [[psychodynamics]] of women, were either not supported or contradicted by research. Reviewing the issues again in 1996, they concluded that much experimental data relevant to Freud's work exists, and supports some of his major ideas and theories.<ref name=\"FisherandGreenberg\">Fisher, Seymour & Greenberg, Roger P.

Whereas Plato saw a hierarchy inherent in the nature of reality, and relied upon it to validate norms, Freud was a naturalist who could not follow such an approach. Both men's theories drew a parallel between the structure of the human mind and that of society, but while Plato wanted to strengthen the super-ego, which corresponded to the aristocracy, Freud wanted to strengthen the ego, which corresponded to the middle class.<ref name=\"Gellnerpp140-143\">Gellner, Ernest.

In ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'' (1970), Firestone argues that Freud was a \"poet\" who produced metaphors rather than literal truths; in her view, Freud, like feminists, recognized that sexuality was the crucial problem of modern life, but ignored the social context and failed to question society itself. Firestone interprets Freud's \"metaphors\" in terms of the facts of power within the family. Figes tries in ''Patriarchal Attitudes'' (1970) to place Freud within a \"[[history of ideas]]\". [[Juliet Mitchell]] defends Freud against his feminist critics in ''Psychoanalysis and Feminism'' (1974), accusing them of misreading him and misunderstanding the implications of psychoanalytic theory for feminism. Mitchell helped introduce English-speaking feminists to Lacan.<ref name=\"Mitchell\">Mitchell, Juliet. ''Psychoanalysis and Feminism: A Radical Reassessment of Freudian Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 2000, pp. xxix, 303\u201356</ref> Mitchell is criticized by [[Jane Gallop]] in ''The Daughter's Seduction'' (1982). Gallop compliments Mitchell for her criticism of feminist discussions of Freud, but finds her treatment of Lacanian theory lacking.<ref>Gallop, Jane. ''The Daughter's Seduction: Feminism and Psychoanalysis''. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1992</ref>\n\nSome French feminists, among them [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Luce Irigaray]], have been influenced by Freud as interpreted by Lacan.<ref>Gallop, Jane & Burke, Carolyn, in Eisenstein, Hester & Jardine, Alice (eds.). ''The Future of Difference''. New Brunswick and London: Rutgers University Press, 1987, pp. 106\u201308</ref> Irigaray has produced a theoretical challenge to Freud and Lacan, using their theories against them to put forward a \"psychoanalytic explanation for theoretical bias\". Irigaray, who claims that \"the cultural unconscious only recognizes the male sex\", describes how this affects \"accounts of the psychology of women\".<ref>Whitford, Margaret. ''Luce Irigaray: Philosophy in the Feminine''. London and New York: Routledge, 1991, pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nPsychologist [[Carol Gilligan]] writes that \"The penchant of developmental theorists to project a masculine image, and one that appears frightening to women, goes back at least to Freud.\" She sees Freud's criticism of women's sense of justice reappearing in the work of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]. Gilligan notes that [[Nancy Chodorow]], in contrast to Freud, attributes sexual difference not to anatomy but to the fact that male and female children have different early social environments. Chodorow, writing against the masculine bias of psychoanalysis, \"replaces Freud's negative and derivative description of female psychology with a positive and direct account of her own.\"<ref>Gilligan, Carol.

A girl named Ananthi loves Kavin, unaware of his real identity. One day, Kavin tries to help Suruli pay his debt by extracting money from Ananthi through lies, but she helps him in spite of knowing the truth. After taking the money, Kavin is enraged and so is Ezhil after a party. That night, one of them breaks into the house of a young man named Akash and beats him to death. The next day, Kavin frees Suruli by paying his debt and wins Ananthi's trust by returning her money and telling her the truth. However, as the investigation of Akash's murder proceeds, a selfie clicked by a couple nearby is found with either of Ezhil or Kavin in it. Both Ezhil and Kavin are brought in and investigated without their knowledge of each other's existence. Gopalakrishnan, an inspector who shares an old rivalry with Ezhil, tortures him. Ezhil reveals his car broke down, and a call taxi driver helped him. Kavin, on the other hand, cites various laws to escape torture. Sub-inspector Malarvizhi is assigned to solve the case. She reaches out to Akash's friend and shows him the photograph of Ezhil/Kavin but he refuses to recognize him. She also questions Suruli and tells him not to leave city without permission, but he secretly escapes.\n\nMalarvizhi then learns of the rivalry between Ezhil and Gopalakrishnan. Ezhil helped the latter's daughter elope with her lover, much against her father's wishes. She gets a call from a forensic expert who informs her about a hair sample recovered from the crime scene and how it doesn't match anyone else in Akash's home. At the police station, a restless Ezhil uses an opportunity to escape, but is interrupted by Kavin. The two violently fight, hurting everyone and destroying the station in the process. It is then revealed they're both identical twins after their DNA is found identical. Both Ezhil and Kavin confess about the same; they parted ways when their parents divorced. Kavin went with his mother who used to gamble a lot and one day tried to convince him that she'd give up gambling, but instead committed suicide. Kavin was then taken in by his father but often got into brawls with him and Ezhil. Growing up, Kavin became interested in studying the law but left studies due to his lack of college ethics. One day, when Kavin came home and left in front of Ezhil whose ring for Deepika went missing, Ezhil reported him to the police. The police beat up Kavin who himself told Ezhil to look for the ring in the drawer. Ezhil realized his mistake but Kavin, who came home for a photo of their mother, vowed to seek revenge. \n\nOn the other hand, Gopalakrishnan still wants to frame Ezhil but the call taxi driver who helped Ezhil reveals he was really stuck on the night of murder. Since it also gets proved that Kavin paid Suruli's debt with gambling money he won after playing all night, the case further complicates. The brothers are presented before the court, where the judge acquits both of them in order to prevent the innocent one from suffering the consequences. A disappointed Malazvizhi later calls Akash's friend to inquire about the girl he was infatuated to. Learning it was Deepika, she is shocked. It is finally revealed that Ezhil murdered Akash for drugging, kidnapping and raping Deepika to death, while Kavin found out about akash's death and helped Ezhil by getting arrested and complicating the case. \n\nKavin meets with Ezhil in the highways and says that Malarvizhi can't reopen the case because she created a fake witness to help Ezhil, and could herself get into trouble. Kavin further reveals that he has forever lost all interest in gambling and he's going to marry Ananthi soon. Ezhil hands him over a photograph of them with their mother and tells him he is going to Mumbai, and later to Copenhagen, never to return. Ezhil has sold all of his property in India, and gives 50% share to Kavin as a tribute. A month later, Kavin marries Ananthi, and realises that his lack of trust in his mother, prompted her to kill herself. At the end, one of the investigating officers claims in a documentary shooting that such a case never happened in the past, before someone tells him similar cases did occur in America and some such cases are listed on the screen.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Arun Vijay]] in a dual role as Ezhil and Kavin\n*[[Tanya Hope]] as Deepika, Ezhil's love interest\n*[[Smruthi Venkat]] as Ananthi, an innocent women and Kavin's one-sided lover \n*[[Vidya Pradeep]] as Sub-Inspector Malarvizhi\n*[[Sonia Aggarwal]] as Ezhil and Kavin's mother\n*[[FEFSI Vijayan]] as Inspector M.

She was built by the ''[[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]]'' in [[Trieste]] between June 1896 and May 1900, when she was commissioned into the fleet. ''Kaiser Karl VI'' represented a significant improvement over the preceding design&mdash;{{SMS|Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia||2}}&mdash;being faster and more heavily armed and armored. She provided the basis for the third design, {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}, which featured further incremental improvements. Having no overseas colonies to patrol, Austria-Hungary built the ship solely to reinforce its battle fleet.\n\n''Kaiser Karl VI'' spent the first decade in service rotating between the training and reserve squadrons, alternating with ''Sankt Georg''. In 1910, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' went on a major overseas cruise to South America, visiting Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina; this was the last trans-Atlantic voyage of an Austro-Hungarian warship. After the outbreak of war, she was mobilized into the Cruiser Flotilla, which spent the majority of the war moored at [[Kotor|Cattaro]]. The lengthy inactivity eventually led to the [[Cattaro Mutiny]] in February 1918, which the crew of ''Kaiser Karl VI'' joined. After the mutiny collapsed, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' and several other warships were decommissioned to reduce the number of idle sailors. After the war, she was allocated as a [[war prize]] to Britain and was sold to ship-breakers in Italy, where she was scrapped in 1920.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:KuK Maria Theresa.png|thumb|left|{{SMS|Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia}}, the basis of ''Kaiser Karl VI''{{'}}s design]]\n\nStarting in the mid-18080s, the new Austro-Hungarian ''[[Marinekommandant]]'' (Navy Commander), ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (Vice Admiral) [[Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck]], began a reorientation of Austro-Hungarian naval strategy. The fleet had until then been centered on large [[ironclad warship]]s, but had been unable to continue building vessels of that type under the direction of the previous ''Marinekommandant'', ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Friedrich von P\u00f6ck]], owing to the refusal of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] of Austria and the [[Diet of Hungary]] to grant sufficient naval budgets. Sterneck decided to adopt the concepts espoused by the French ''[[Jeune \u00c9cole]]'' (Young School), which suggested that [[flotilla]]s of cheap [[torpedo boat]]s could effectively defend a coastline against a fleet of expensive [[battleship]]s. The torpedo boats would be supported by what Sterneck termed \"torpedo-ram-cruisers\", which would protect the torpedo boats from enemy cruisers.{{sfn|Sondhaus|pp=51\u201353}}{{sfn|Dodson|p=46}}\n\nIn his fleet plan for 1891, Sterneck proposed that the future Austro-Hungarian fleet would consist of four squadrons, each consisting of one torpedo-ram-cruiser, a smaller [[torpedo cruiser]], a large torpedo boat and six smaller torpedo boats. The first three of these squadrons would be led by the two {{sclass-|Kaiser Franz Joseph I|cruiser|0}} [[protected cruiser]]s and the [[armored cruiser]] {{SMS|Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia||2}}, and in 1891 the design staff began work on the fourth cruiser. Three proposals were considered, the first modeled on {{SMS|Kaiser Franz Joseph I||2}}, the second on the small protected cruiser {{SMS|Panther|1885|2}}, and the last derived from the British armored cruiser {{HMS|Royal Arthur|1891|6}}. All three designs [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|5090|LT|t}}. But by the time work on ''Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia'' began that year, naval officers who opposed Sterneck's theories forced him to postpone the fourth cruiser in favor of beginning work on a new generation of [[capital ship]]s, what would become the {{sclass-|Monarch|coastal defense ship}}s.{{sfn|Dodson|pp=46\u201347, 66}}\n\nThose opposed to Sterneck believed the new cruisers should be formed into their own squadron to serve with the main battle fleet, and so in 1894, began preparations to build another armored cruiser. Three competing designs were submitted, two by the naval architect Josef Kellner and the third by Viktor Lollok. Kellner's initial design was for a {{cvt|5800|LT|t|adj=on}} ship similar to ''Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia'', armed with the same battery of two {{cvt|24|cm}} guns and eight {{cvt|15|cm}} guns. The second was broadly similar with the same but differently arranged armament, and displacement increased to {{cvt|6000|LT|t}} and two [[funnel (ship)|funnels]] instead of the one in his other design. Lollok's proposal was also 6,000&nbsp;tons, and instead of carrying all eight 15&nbsp;cm guns in main-deck [[casemate]]s, four would be moved up to open mounts on the upper deck.{{sfn|Dodson|pp=47, 66}}\n\nThe naval command selected Kellner's second design, although it mandated a change to [[water-tube boiler]]s for increased engine power, which in turn necessitated the addition of a third funnel. She also received the latest version of 24&nbsp;cm guns manufactured by the German firm [[Krupp]]: the longer-barreled [[24 cm SK L/40|SK L/40 C/94]] version. The new cruiser, named ''Kaiser Karl VI'', was about {{cvt|1000|LT|t}} larger than her predecessor, ''Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia'', and was a significantly more effective vessel as a result, being a [[Knot (unit)|knot]] faster, mounting more powerful guns, and carrying heavier armor.{{sfn|Dodson|p=66}}\n\n===General characteristics and machinery===\n[[File:Kaiser-Karl-VI Brassey's1915.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Line-drawing of ''Kaiser Karl VI'' showing the disposition of the armament and armor]]\n\n''Kaiser Karl VI'' was {{convert|117.9|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and was {{convert|118.96|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17.27|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|6.75|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|6166|LT|t}} as designed and up to {{convert|6864|LT|t}} at [[full load]]. Having gained experience with the stability problems caused by ''Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia''{{'}}s [[military mast]]s, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was completed with lighter pole masts and a significantly smaller [[superstructure]]. Her crew varied between 535 and 550&nbsp;officers and men over the course of her career. ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was fitted with two pole masts for observation.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=273}}{{sfn|Dodson|pp=47, 170}}\n\nThe ship's propulsion system consisted of two 4-cylinder [[triple-expansion engine]]s that drove a pair of [[screw propeller]]s.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=273}} The engines were built at the ''[[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]]'' (STT) shipyard in Trieste that built the ship. Steam was provided by water-tube [[Belleville boiler]]s manufactured by [[Maudslay, Sons and Field]] of Britain.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=160}}{{sfn|Dodson|p=170}} The engines were rated at {{convert|12000|ihp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|20|kn}}, though on trials they produced a top speed of {{convert|20.83|kn}}. Coal storage amounted to {{cvt|500|LT|t}} normally and up to {{cvt|818|LT|t}} under wartime loading.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=273}}{{sfn|Dodson|p=170}}\n\n===Armament and armor===\n''Kaiser Karl VI'' was armed with a [[main battery]] of two large-caliber guns and several medium-caliber pieces. She carried two 24&nbsp;cm L/40 C/94 guns manufactured by Krupp in single [[gun turret]]s on the [[centerline (nautical)|centerline]], one forward and one aft. Eight [[15 cm SK L/40 naval gun|{{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} L/40 guns]] mounted individually in casemates rounded out her offensive armament; these were carried in the main deck, two on either side amidships, [[sponson]]ed out over the hull, and two abreast both of the main battery turrets. She was armed with sixteen [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss#Austro-Hungarian service|{{convert|47|mm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] L/44 guns built by [[\u0160koda Works|\u0160koda]] and two 4.7&nbsp;cm L/33 [[Hotchkiss gun]]s for close-range defense against torpedo boats. She carried several smaller weapons, including a pair of {{convert|8|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} [[machine gun]]s and two [[\u0160koda 7 cm guns|{{convert|7|cm|in|abbr=on}}]] L/18 landing guns. ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was also equipped with a pair of {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s, one on each broadside.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=273}}{{sfn|Dodson|p=170}}\n\nThe ship's armor consisted of [[Harvey armor]].{{sfn|Dodson|p=66}} She was protected by a main [[belt armor|armored belt]] that was {{convert|220|mm|abbr=on}} thick in the central portion that protected the ammunition [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s and machinery spaces, and reduced to {{convert|170|mm|abbr=on}} on either end. She had an armored deck that was {{convert|40|to|60|mm|abbr=on}} thick. Her two gun turrets had {{convert|200|mm|abbr=on}} thick faces, and the 15&nbsp;cm guns had {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick casemates. The [[conning tower]] had 200&nbsp;mm thick sides and a {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick roof.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=273}}\n\n==Service history==\nNamed for the 18th-century [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Karl VI]], ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was built at the STT shipyard in Trieste. Her keel was laid on 1 June 1896 and her completed hull was launched on 4 October 1898. [[Fitting-out]] work then commenced, which lasted until 23 May 1900 when the ship was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian fleet.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=273}} Starting from her commissioning, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' frequently served in the training squadron, along with the three {{sclass-|Habsburg|battleship|1}}s, though she alternated in the squadron with the armored cruiser ''Sankt Georg''. Once the summer training schedule was completed each year, the ships of the training squadron were demobilized in the reserve squadron, which was held in a state of partial readiness.{{sfn|Sondhaus|pp=172&ndash;173}} In 1900, she served as the flagship of then-[[Rear Admiral]] [[Rudolf Montecuccoli]] in the training squadron, along with ''Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia''.{{sfn|Garbett 1900|p=808}} During the summer maneuvers of June 1901, she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral G. Ritter von Brosch, commander of the reserve squadron. The other major ships in the squadron included the old ironclad {{SMS|Tegetthoff|1878|2}} and the cruiser ''Kaiser Franz Joseph I''.{{sfn|Garbett 1901|p=1130}}\n\nIn mid-1910, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' conducted the last trans-Atlantic cruise of an Austrian vessel, when she visited Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. On 25 May, she represented Austria-Hungary at the centennial of Argentina's [[May Revolution]], which won the country's independence from Spain.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=185}}\n\n===World War I===\nOn 28 June 1914, Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated in Sarajevo]]; the assassination sparked the [[July Crisis]] and ultimately the [[First World War]], which broke out a month later on 28 July. At the moment of the assassination, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was stationed in [[Barcelona]], where the crew was received by the Captain General of the Catalan military region. A mass was held in the [[Barcelona Cathedral|city cathedral]] honouring the Archduke with the assistance of ''Kaiser Karl VI'' crew and officers. The German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}}, which had been assigned to the [[Mediterranean Division]], sought the protection of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, and so Admiral [[Anton Haus]] sent the fleet, including ''Kaiser Karl VI'', south on 7 August to assist his German ally. ''Goeben''{{'}}s commander, Admiral [[Wilhelm Souchon]], intended to use the Austro-Hungarian move as a feint to distract the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] which was [[Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|pursuing ''Goeben'']]; Souchon instead took his ship to [[Constantinople]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Their decoy mission complete, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' and the rest of the fleet returned to port without engaging any British forces.{{sfn|Sondhaus|pp=245&ndash;249}}\n\nOn 8 August, Montenegrin gun batteries on [[Mount Lov\u0107en]] began shelling the Austro-Hungarian at [[Kotor|Cattaro]]. At the time, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was the only large warship in the harbor, and so she assisted the local army artillery in attempting to suppress the hostile guns. The Austro-Hungarian gunners were aided by navy [[seaplane]]s that could spot the fall of their shots. On 13 September, the three ''Monarch''-class coastal defense ships arrived to strengthen the Austro-Hungarian force. Five days later, a French artillery battery was landed in Montenegro to reinforce the guns on Lov\u0107en with the aim of eventually capturing the port, which prompted the Austro-Hungarians to send the [[pre-dreadnought]] battleship {{SMS|Radetzky||2}} with its {{convert|30.5|cm|abbr=on|0}} guns. By 27 October, the French and Montenegrin gun batteries had been silenced, and the French abandoned its attempt to seize Cattaro.{{sfn|Noppen|pp=28&ndash;30}}\n\n[[File:SMS Kaiser Karl IV 1917.jpg|thumb|left|''Kaiser Karl VI'' on 22 May 1917]]\nBy the end of August, the mobilization of the fleet was complete; ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was assigned to the Cruiser Flotilla, which was commanded by Vice Admiral [[Paul Fiedler]].{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=257}} For most of the war, the Cruiser Flotilla and based at Cattaro, though the armored cruisers were too slow to operate with the newer {{sclass-|Novara|cruiser}}s that carried out the bulk of offensive operations.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=303}} In May 1915, Italy declared war on the Central Powers. The Austro-Hungarians continued their strategy of serving as a [[fleet in being]], which would tie down the now further numerically superior Allied naval forces. Haus hoped that torpedo boats and mines could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the Italian fleet before a decisive battle could be fought.{{sfn|Halpern ''Naval History''|p=141}}\n\nBy early 1918, the long periods of inactivity had begun to wear on the crews of several warships at Cattaro, including ''Kaiser Karl VI''. On 1 February, the [[Cattaro Mutiny]] broke out, starting aboard ''Sankt Georg'' and quickly spreading to ''Kaiser Karl VI''.{{sfn|Halpern ''Cattaro Mutiny''|pp=49&ndash;50}} Officers were confined to their quarters while a committee of sailors met to formulate a list of demands, which ranged from longer periods of leave and better rations to an end to the war, based on the United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]]. The following day, shore batteries loyal to the government fired on the old ironclad {{SMS|Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf||2}}, which prompted many of the mutinous ships to abandon the effort.

She was built by the ''[[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]]'' in [[Trieste]] between June 1896 and May 1900, when she was commissioned into the fleet. ''Kaiser Karl VI'' represented a significant improvement over the preceding design&mdash;{{SMS|Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia||2}}&mdash;being faster and more heavily armed and armored. She provided the basis for the third design, {{SMS|Sankt Georg||2}}, which featured further incremental improvements. Having no overseas colonies to patrol, Austria-Hungary built the ship solely to reinforce its battle fleet.\n\n''Kaiser Karl VI'' spent the first decade in service rotating between the training and reserve squadrons, alternating with ''Sankt Georg''. In 1910, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' went on a major overseas cruise to South America, visiting Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina; this was the last trans-Atlantic voyage of an Austro-Hungarian warship. After the outbreak of war, she was mobilized into the Cruiser Flotilla, which spent the majority of the war moored at [[Kotor|Cattaro]]. The lengthy inactivity eventually led to the [[Cattaro Mutiny]] in February 1918, which the crew of ''Kaiser Karl VI'' joined. After the mutiny collapsed, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' and several other warships were decommissioned to reduce the number of idle sailors. After the war, she was allocated as a [[war prize]] to Britain and was sold to ship-breakers in Italy, where she was scrapped in 1920.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:KuK Maria Theresa.png|thumb|left|{{SMS|Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia}}, the basis of ''Kaiser Karl VI''{{'}}s design]]\n\nStarting in the mid-18080s, the new Austro-Hungarian ''[[Marinekommandant]]'' (Navy Commander), ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (Vice Admiral) [[Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck]], began a reorientation of Austro-Hungarian naval strategy. The fleet had until then been centered on large [[ironclad warship]]s, but had been unable to continue building vessels of that type under the direction of the previous ''Marinekommandant'', ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Friedrich von P\u00f6ck]], owing to the refusal of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] of Austria and the [[Diet of Hungary]] to grant sufficient naval budgets. Sterneck decided to adopt the concepts espoused by the French ''[[Jeune \u00c9cole]]'' (Young School), which suggested that [[flotilla]]s of cheap [[torpedo boat]]s could effectively defend a coastline against a fleet of expensive [[battleship]]s. The torpedo boats would be supported by what Sterneck termed \"torpedo-ram-cruisers\", which would protect the torpedo boats from enemy cruisers.{{sfn|Sondhaus|pp=51\u201353}}{{sfn|Dodson|p=46}}\n\nIn his fleet plan for 1891, Sterneck proposed that the future Austro-Hungarian fleet would consist of four squadrons, each consisting of one torpedo-ram-cruiser, a smaller [[torpedo cruiser]], a large torpedo boat and six smaller torpedo boats. The first three of these squadrons would be led by the two {{sclass-|Kaiser Franz Joseph I|cruiser|0}} [[protected cruiser]]s and the [[armored cruiser]] {{SMS|Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia||2}}, and in 1891 the design staff began work on the fourth cruiser. Three proposals were considered, the first modeled on {{SMS|Kaiser Franz Joseph I||2}}, the second on the small protected cruiser {{SMS|Panther|1885|2}}, and the last derived from the British armored cruiser {{HMS|Royal Arthur|1891|6}}. All three designs [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|5090|LT|t}}. But by the time work on ''Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia'' began that year, naval officers who opposed Sterneck's theories forced him to postpone the fourth cruiser in favor of beginning work on a new generation of [[capital ship]]s, what would become the {{sclass-|Monarch|coastal defense ship}}s.{{sfn|Dodson|pp=46\u201347, 66}}\n\nThose opposed to Sterneck believed the new cruisers should be formed into their own squadron to serve with the main battle fleet, and so in 1894, began preparations to build another armored cruiser. Three competing designs were submitted, two by the naval architect Josef Kellner and the third by Viktor Lollok. Kellner's initial design was for a {{cvt|5800|LT|t|adj=on}} ship similar to ''Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia'', armed with the same battery of two {{cvt|24|cm}} guns and eight {{cvt|15|cm}} guns. The second was broadly similar with the same but differently arranged armament, and displacement increased to {{cvt|6000|LT|t}} and two [[funnel (ship)|funnels]] instead of the one in his other design. Lollok's proposal was also 6,000&nbsp;tons, and instead of carrying all eight 15&nbsp;cm guns in main-deck [[casemate]]s, four would be moved up to open mounts on the upper deck.{{sfn|Dodson|pp=47, 66}}\n\nThe naval command selected Kellner's second design, although it mandated a change to [[water-tube boiler]]s for increased engine power, which in turn necessitated the addition of a third funnel. She also received the latest version of 24&nbsp;cm guns manufactured by the German firm [[Krupp]]: the longer-barreled [[24 cm SK L/40|SK L/40 C/94]] version. The new cruiser, named ''Kaiser Karl VI'', was about {{cvt|1000|LT|t}} larger than her predecessor, ''Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia'', and was a significantly more effective vessel as a result, being a [[Knot (unit)|knot]] faster, mounting more powerful guns, and carrying heavier armor.{{sfn|Dodson|p=66}}\n\n===General characteristics and machinery===\n[[File:Kaiser-Karl-VI Brassey's1915.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Line-drawing of ''Kaiser Karl VI'' showing the disposition of the armament and armor]]\n\n''Kaiser Karl VI'' was {{convert|117.9|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and was {{convert|118.96|m|ftin|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17.27|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|6.75|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|6166|LT|t}} as designed and up to {{convert|6864|LT|t}} at [[full load]]. Having gained experience with the stability problems caused by ''Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia''{{'}}s [[military mast]]s, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was completed with lighter pole masts and a significantly smaller [[superstructure]]. Her crew varied between 535 and 550&nbsp;officers and men over the course of her career. ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was fitted with two pole masts for observation.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=273}}{{sfn|Dodson|pp=47, 170}}\n\nThe ship's propulsion system consisted of two 4-cylinder [[triple-expansion engine]]s that drove a pair of [[screw propeller]]s.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=273}} The engines were built at the ''[[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]]'' (STT) shipyard in Trieste that built the ship. Steam was provided by water-tube [[Belleville boiler]]s manufactured by [[Maudslay, Sons and Field]] of Britain.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=160}}{{sfn|Dodson|p=170}} The engines were rated at {{convert|12000|ihp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|20|kn}}, though on trials they produced a top speed of {{convert|20.83|kn}}. Coal storage amounted to {{cvt|500|LT|t}} normally and up to {{cvt|818|LT|t}} under wartime loading.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=273}}{{sfn|Dodson|p=170}}\n\n===Armament and armor===\n''Kaiser Karl VI'' was armed with a [[main battery]] of two large-caliber guns and several medium-caliber pieces. She carried two 24&nbsp;cm L/40 C/94 guns manufactured by Krupp in single [[gun turret]]s on the [[centerline (nautical)|centerline]], one forward and one aft. Eight [[15 cm SK L/40 naval gun|{{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} L/40 guns]] mounted individually in casemates rounded out her offensive armament; these were carried in the main deck, two on either side amidships, [[sponson]]ed out over the hull, and two abreast both of the main battery turrets. She was armed with sixteen [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss#Austro-Hungarian service|{{convert|47|mm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}]] L/44 guns built by [[\u0160koda Works|\u0160koda]] and two 4.7&nbsp;cm L/33 [[Hotchkiss gun]]s for close-range defense against torpedo boats. She carried several smaller weapons, including a pair of {{convert|8|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} [[machine gun]]s and two [[\u0160koda 7 cm guns|{{convert|7|cm|in|abbr=on}}]] L/18 landing guns. ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was also equipped with a pair of {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s, one on each broadside.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=273}}{{sfn|Dodson|p=170}}\n\nThe ship's armor consisted of [[Harvey armor]].{{sfn|Dodson|p=66}} She was protected by a main [[belt armor|armored belt]] that was {{convert|220|mm|abbr=on}} thick in the central portion that protected the ammunition [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s and machinery spaces, and reduced to {{convert|170|mm|abbr=on}} on either end. She had an armored deck that was {{convert|40|to|60|mm|abbr=on}} thick. Her two gun turrets had {{convert|200|mm|abbr=on}} thick faces, and the 15&nbsp;cm guns had {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick casemates. The [[conning tower]] had 200&nbsp;mm thick sides and a {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick roof.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=273}}\n\n==Service history==\nNamed for the 18th-century [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Karl VI]], ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was built at the STT shipyard in Trieste. Her keel was laid on 1 June 1896 and her completed hull was launched on 4 October 1898. [[Fitting-out]] work then commenced, which lasted until 23 May 1900 when the ship was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian fleet.{{sfn|Gardiner|p=273}} Starting from her commissioning, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' frequently served in the training squadron, along with the three {{sclass-|Habsburg|battleship|1}}s, though she alternated in the squadron with the armored cruiser ''Sankt Georg''. Once the summer training schedule was completed each year, the ships of the training squadron were demobilized in the reserve squadron, which was held in a state of partial readiness.{{sfn|Sondhaus|pp=172&ndash;173}} In 1900, she served as the flagship of then-[[Rear Admiral]] [[Rudolf Montecuccoli]] in the training squadron, along with ''Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia''.{{sfn|Garbett 1900|p=808}} During the summer maneuvers of June 1901, she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral G. Ritter von Brosch, commander of the reserve squadron. The other major ships in the squadron included the old ironclad {{SMS|Tegetthoff|1878|2}} and the cruiser ''Kaiser Franz Joseph I''.{{sfn|Garbett 1901|p=1130}}\n\nIn mid-1910, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' conducted the last trans-Atlantic cruise of an Austrian vessel, when she visited Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. On 25 May, she represented Austria-Hungary at the centennial of Argentina's [[May Revolution]], which won the country's independence from Spain.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=185}}\n\n===World War I===\nOn 28 June 1914, Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated in Sarajevo]]; the assassination sparked the [[July Crisis]] and ultimately the [[First World War]], which broke out a month later on 28 July. At the moment of the assassination, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was stationed in [[Barcelona]], where the crew was recieved by the Captain General of the Catalan military region. A mass was held in the [[Barcelona Cathedral|city cathedral]] honouring the Archduke with the assistance of ''Kaiser Karl VI'' crew and officers. The German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}}, which had been assigned to the [[Mediterranean Division]], sought the protection of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, and so Admiral [[Anton Haus]] sent the fleet, including ''Kaiser Karl VI'', south on 7 August to assist his German ally. ''Goeben''{{'}}s commander, Admiral [[Wilhelm Souchon]], intended to use the Austro-Hungarian move as a feint to distract the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] which was [[Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|pursuing ''Goeben'']]; Souchon instead took his ship to [[Constantinople]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Their decoy mission complete, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' and the rest of the fleet returned to port without engaging any British forces.{{sfn|Sondhaus|pp=245&ndash;249}}\n\nOn 8 August, Montenegrin gun batteries on [[Mount Lov\u0107en]] began shelling the Austro-Hungarian at [[Kotor|Cattaro]]. At the time, ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was the only large warship in the harbor, and so she assisted the local army artillery in attempting to suppress the hostile guns. The Austro-Hungarian gunners were aided by navy [[seaplane]]s that could spot the fall of their shots. On 13 September, the three ''Monarch''-class coastal defense ships arrived to strengthen the Austro-Hungarian force. Five days later, a French artillery battery was landed in Montenegro to reinforce the guns on Lov\u0107en with the aim of eventually capturing the port, which prompted the Austro-Hungarians to send the [[pre-dreadnought]] battleship {{SMS|Radetzky||2}} with its {{convert|30.5|cm|abbr=on|0}} guns. By 27 October, the French and Montenegrin gun batteries had been silenced, and the French abandoned its attempt to seize Cattaro.{{sfn|Noppen|pp=28&ndash;30}}\n\n[[File:SMS Kaiser Karl IV 1917.jpg|thumb|left|''Kaiser Karl VI'' on 22 May 1917]]\nBy the end of August, the mobilization of the fleet was complete; ''Kaiser Karl VI'' was assigned to the Cruiser Flotilla, which was commanded by Vice Admiral [[Paul Fiedler]].{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=257}} For most of the war, the Cruiser Flotilla and based at Cattaro, though the armored cruisers were too slow to operate with the newer {{sclass-|Novara|cruiser}}s that carried out the bulk of offensive operations.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=303}} In May 1915, Italy declared war on the Central Powers. The Austro-Hungarians continued their strategy of serving as a [[fleet in being]], which would tie down the now further numerically superior Allied naval forces. Haus hoped that torpedo boats and mines could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the Italian fleet before a decisive battle could be fought.{{sfn|Halpern ''Naval History''|p=141}}\n\nBy early 1918, the long periods of inactivity had begun to wear on the crews of several warships at Cattaro, including ''Kaiser Karl VI''. On 1 February, the [[Cattaro Mutiny]] broke out, starting aboard ''Sankt Georg'' and quickly spreading to ''Kaiser Karl VI''.{{sfn|Halpern ''Cattaro Mutiny''|pp=49&ndash;50}} Officers were confined to their quarters while a committee of sailors met to formulate a list of demands, which ranged from longer periods of leave and better rations to an end to the war, based on the United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]]. The following day, shore batteries loyal to the government fired on the old ironclad {{SMS|Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf||2}}, which prompted many of the mutinous ships to abandon the effort. Late in the day on 2 February, the [[Red flag (politics)|red flags]] were struck from ''Kaiser Karl VI'' and she rejoined the loyalist ships in the harbor. The next morning, the {{sclass-|Erzherzog Karl|battleship|1}}s of the III Division arrived in Cattaro, which convinced the last holdouts to surrender.
