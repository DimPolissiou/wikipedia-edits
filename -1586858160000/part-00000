Programming languages are used in [[computer programming]] to implement [[algorithm]]s.\n\nMost programming languages consist of [[Machine instruction|instructions]] for [[computer]]s. There are programmable machines that use a set of [[domain-specific language|specific instructions]], rather than [[General-purpose language|general programming languages]]. Early ones preceded the [[History of computing hardware|invention of the digital computer]], the first probably being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101|brothers Musa]] in [[Baghdad]], during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Koetsier | first = Teun | title = On the prehistory of programmable machines; musical automata, looms, calculators |journal= Mechanism and Machine Theory |volume=36 |issue=5 |date=May 2001 | pages = 589\u2013603 |doi=10.1016/S0094-114X(01)00005-2}}</ref> Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as [[Jacquard loom]]s, [[music box]]es and [[player piano]]s.<ref>Ettinger, James (2004) ''Jacquard's Web'', Oxford University Press</ref> The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.\n\nThousands of different programming languages have been created, and more are being created every year. Many programming languages are written in an [[imperative programming|imperative]] form (i.e., as a sequence of operations to perform) while other languages use the [[declarative programming|declarative]] form (i.e. the desired result is specified, not how to achieve it).\n\nThe description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] (form) and [[semantics (computer science)|semantics]] (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language is specified by an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Standard) while other languages (such as [[Perl]]) have a dominant [[Programming language implementation|implementation]] that is treated as a [[reference implementation|reference]].

For example, the instruction to add the value in two memory location might consist of 3 numbers: an \"opcode\" that selects the \"add\" operation, and two memory locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from [[punched card]]s, paper tape, [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] or toggled in on switches on the [[front panel]] of the computer.  Machine languages were later termed ''[[first-generation programming language]]s'' (1GL).\n\nThe next step was development of so-called ''[[second-generation programming language]]s'' (2GL) or [[assembly language]]s, which were still closely tied to the [[instruction set architecture]] of the specific computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations.\n\nThe first ''[[high-level programming language]]s'', or ''[[third-generation programming language]]s'' (3GL), were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was [[Plankalk\u00fcl]], developed for the German [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] by [[Konrad Zuse]] between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.<ref>\n[[Ra\u00fal Rojas|Rojas, Ra\u00fal]], et al. (2000). \"Plankalk\u00fcl: The First High-Level Programming Language and its Implementation\".

In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called [[Fifth-generation programming language|\"fifth-generation\" languages]] that incorporated logic programming constructs.<ref>Tetsuro Fujise, Takashi Chikayama, Kazuaki Rokusawa, Akihiko Nakase (December 1994). \"KLIC: A Portable Implementation of KL1\" ''Proc. of FGCS '94, ICOT'' Tokyo, December 1994. {{cite web |url=http://www.icot.or.jp/ARCHIVE/HomePage-E.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925132105/http://www.icot.or.jp/ARCHIVE/HomePage-E.html |archivedate=25 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }} KLIC is a portable implementation of a concurrent logic programming language [[KL1]].</ref> The functional languages community moved to standardize [[ML (programming language)|ML]] and Lisp. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decades.\n\nOne important trend in language design for programming large-scale systems during the 1980s was an increased focus on the use of ''modules'' or large-scale organizational units of code. [[Modula-2]], Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s, which were often wedded to [[generic programming]] constructs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Bender|url=http://readscheme.org/modules/|title=Mini-Bibliography on Modules for Functional Programming Languages|work=ReadScheme.org|accessdate=27 September 2006|date=15 March 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924085057/http://readscheme.org/modules/|archivedate=24 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe rapid growth of the [[Internet]] in the mid-1990s created opportunities for new languages. [[Perl]], originally a Unix scripting tool first released in 1987, became common in dynamic [[website]]s. [[Java (programming language)|Java]] came to be used for server-side programming, and bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with their promise of \"[[Write once, run anywhere]]\" ([[UCSD Pascal]] had been popular for a time in the early 1980s). These developments were not fundamentally novel; rather, they were refinements of many existing languages and paradigms (although their syntax was often based on the C family of programming languages).\n\nProgramming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Current directions include security and reliability verification, new kinds of modularity ([[mixin]]s, [[Delegation (programming)|delegates]], [[aspect-oriented programming|aspects]]), and database integration such as Microsoft's [[Language Integrated Query|LINQ]].\n\n''[[Fourth-generation programming language]]s'' (4GL) are computer programming languages which aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details than 3GLs. ''[[Fifth-generation programming language]]s'' (5GL) are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an [[algorithm]] written by a programmer.\n\n==Elements==\nAll programming languages have some [[language primitive|primitive]] building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection). These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively.\n\n===Syntax===\n{{Main|Syntax (programming languages)}}\n[[File:Python add5 parse.png|thumb|367px|[[Parse tree]] of [[Python (programming language)|Python code]] with inset tokenization]]\n[[File:Python add5 syntax.svg|thumb|292px|[[Syntax highlighting]] is often used to aid programmers in recognizing elements of source code. The language above is [[Python (programming language)|Python]].]]\nA programming language's surface form is known as its [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]]. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more [[visual programming language|graphical]] in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.\n\nThe syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either [[Formal semantics of programming languages|formal]] or hard-coded in a [[Reference implementation (computing)|reference implementation]]). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.\n\nProgramming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of [[regular expression]]s (for [[lexical analysis|lexical]] structure) and [[Backus\u2013Naur form]] (for [[context-free grammar|grammatical]] structure). Below is a simple grammar, based on [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]:\n<source lang=\"bnf\">\nexpression ::= atom | list\natom       ::= number | symbol\nnumber     ::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+\nsymbol     ::= ['A'-'Z''a'-'z'].*\nlist       ::= '(' expression* ')'\n</source>\n\nThis grammar specifies the following:\n* an ''expression'' is either an ''atom'' or a ''list'';\n* an ''atom'' is either a ''number'' or a ''symbol'';\n* a ''number'' is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign;\n* a ''symbol'' is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters (excluding whitespace); and\n* a ''list'' is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more ''expressions'' inside it.\n\nThe following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar: <code>12345</code>, <code>()</code> and <code>(a b c232 (1))</code>.\n\nNot all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution. In some cases, such programs may exhibit [[undefined behavior]]. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.\n\nUsing [[natural language]] as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false:\n* \"[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]].\" is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning.\n* \"John is a married bachelor.\" is grammatically [[well-formedness|well-formed]] but expresses a meaning that cannot be true.\n\nThe following [[C (programming language)|C language]] fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation <code>*p >> 4</code> has no meaning for a value having a complex type and <code>p->im</code> is not defined because the value of <code>p</code> is the [[null pointer]]):\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\ncomplex *p = NULL;\ncomplex abs_p = sqrt(*p >> 4 + p->im);\n</source>\n\nIf the [[type declaration]] on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on undefined variable \"p\" during compilation. However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.\n\nThe grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]]. The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are [[context-free grammar]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Sipser|year=1996|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|publisher=PWS Publishing|isbn=978-0-534-94728-6 |authorlink=Michael Sipser|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}} Section 2.2: Pushdown Automata, pp.101\u2013114.</ref> Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase.

Examples include checking that every [[identifier]] is declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a [[case statement]] are distinct.<ref>Michael Lee Scott, ''Programming language pragmatics'', Edition 2, Morgan Kaufmann, 2006, {{ISBN|0-12-633951-1}}, p. 18\u201319</ref> Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context (e.g. not adding an integer to a function name), or that [[subroutine]] calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a [[logic]] called a [[type system]]. Other forms of [[static code analysis|static analyses]] like [[data flow analysis]] may also be part of static semantics. Newer programming languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] have [[definite assignment analysis]], a form of data flow analysis, as part of their static semantics.\n\n====Dynamic semantics====\n{{main|Semantics of programming languages}}\nOnce data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example, the semantics may define the [[evaluation strategy|strategy]] by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which [[control flow|control structures]] conditionally execute [[Statement (computer science)|statements]]. The ''dynamic semantics'' (also known as ''execution semantics'') of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research went into [[formal semantics of programming languages]], which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia.\n\n===Type system===\n{{Main|Data type|Type system|Type safety}}\n\nA type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into ''types'', how it can manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations. Any [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs. In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have ''type loopholes'', usually unchecked [[Type conversion#Explicit type conversion|casts]] that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to [[type checking|type check]] programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, [[type inference|infer types]], relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as ''[[type theory]]''.\n\n====Typed versus untyped languages====\nA language is ''typed'' if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable.<ref name=\"typing\">{{cite web|url=http://www.acooke.org/comp-lang.html|author=Andrew Cooke|title=Introduction To Computer Languages|accessdate=13 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815140215/http://www.acooke.org/comp-lang.html|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> For example, the data represented by <code>\"this text between the quotes\"</code> is a [[String literal|string]], and in many programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will not be executed. The invalid operation may be detected when the program is compiled (\"static\" type checking) and will be rejected by the compiler with a compilation error message, or it may be detected while the program is running (\"dynamic\" type checking), resulting in a run-time [[Exception handling|exception]]. Many languages allow a function called an exception handler to handle this exception and, for example, always return \"-1\" as the result.\n\nA special case of typed languages are the ''single-typed'' languages. These are often scripting or markup languages, such as [[REXX]] or [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|SGML]], and have only one data type{{dubious|date=March 2018}}\u2013\u2014most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric data.\n\nIn contrast, an ''untyped language'', such as most [[assembly language]]s, allows any operation to be performed on any data, generally sequences of bits of various lengths.<ref name=\"typing\"/> High-level untyped languages include [[BCPL]], [[Tcl]], and some varieties of [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]].\n\nIn practice, while few languages are considered typed from the [[type theory]] (verifying or rejecting all operations), most modern languages offer a degree of typing.<ref name=\"typing\"/> Many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system, trading type-safety for finer control over the program's execution (see [[Type conversion#Explicit type conversion|casting]]).\n\n====Static versus dynamic typing====\nIn ''[[Type system|static typing]]'', all expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed, typically at compile-time. For example, 1 and (2+2) are integer expressions; they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string, or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates.<ref name=\"typing\"/>\n\nStatically typed languages can be either ''[[Manifest typing|manifestly typed]]'' or ''[[Type inference|type-inferred]]''. In the first case, the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions (for example, at variable [[declaration (computer science)|declarations]]). In the second case, the compiler ''infers'' the types of expressions and declarations based on context. Most mainstream statically typed languages, such as [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], are manifestly typed. Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages, such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. However, many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference; for example, [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] all infer types in certain limited cases.<ref>Specifically, instantiations of [[generic programming|generic]] types are inferred for certain expression forms. Type inference in Generic Java\u2014the research language that provided the basis for Java 1.5's bounded [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming|parametric polymorphism]] extensions\u2014is discussed in two informal manuscripts from the Types mailing list: [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00849.html Generic Java type inference is unsound] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129073839/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00849.html |date=29 January 2007 }} ([[Alan Jeffrey]], 17 December 2001) and [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00921.html Sound Generic Java type inference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129073849/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00921.html |date=29 January 2007 }} ([[Martin Odersky]], 15 January 2002). C#'s type system is similar to Java's, and uses a similar partial type inference scheme.</ref> Additionally, some programming languages allow for some types to be automatically converted to other types; for example, an int can be used where the program expects a float.\n\n''[[Type system|Dynamic typing]]'', also called ''latent typing'', determines the type-safety of operations at run time; in other words, types are associated with ''run-time values'' rather than ''textual expressions''.<ref name=\"typing\"/> As with type-inferred languages, dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions. Among other things, this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution. However, type [[Software bug|errors]] cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed, potentially making [[debugging]] more difficult. [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] are all examples of dynamically typed languages.\n\n====Weak and strong typing====\n''[[Weak typing]]'' allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a [[String (computer science)|string]] as a number.<ref name=\"typing\"/> This can occasionally be useful, but it can also allow some kinds of program faults to go undetected at [[compile time]] and even at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].\n\n''[[Strongly typed programming language|Strong typing]]'' prevents these program faults. An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error.<ref name=\"typing\"/> Strongly typed languages are often termed ''type-safe'' or ''[[type safety|safe]]''.\n\nAn alternative definition for \"weakly typed\" refers to languages, such as [[Perl]] and [[JavaScript]], which permit a large number of implicit type conversions. In JavaScript, for example, the expression <code>2 * x</code> implicitly converts <code>x</code> to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if <code>x</code> is <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, an <code>Array</code>, or a string of letters. Such implicit conversions are often useful, but they can mask programming errors.\n''Strong'' and ''static'' are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs. Some use the term ''strongly typed'' to mean ''strongly, statically typed'', or, even more confusingly, to mean simply ''statically typed''. Thus [[C (programming language)|C]] has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html|title=Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme|date=20 February 1998|accessdate=9 June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714212928/http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html|archivedate=14 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cardelli85understanding.html|title=On Understanding Types, Data Abstraction, and Polymorphism|author=[[Luca Cardelli]] and [[Peter Wegner]]|work=Manuscript (1985)|accessdate=9 June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619072646/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cardelli85understanding.html|archivedate=19 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt may seem odd to some professional programmers that C could be \"weakly, statically typed\". However, notice that the use of the generic pointer, the '''void*''' pointer, does allow for casting of pointers to other pointers without needing to do an explicit cast. This is extremely similar to somehow casting an array of bytes to any kind of datatype in C without using an explicit cast, such as <code>(int)</code> or <code>(char)</code>.\n\n===Standard library and run-time system===\n{{main|Standard library}}\n\nMost programming languages have an associated core [[Library (computing)|library]] (sometimes known as the 'standard library', especially if it is included as part of the published language standard), which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language. Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output.\n\nThe line between a language and its core library differs from language to language. In some cases, the language designers may treat the library as a separate entity from the language. However, a language's core library is often treated as part of the language by its users, and some language specifications even require that this library be made available in all implementations. Indeed, some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library. For example, in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], a string literal is defined as an instance of the <code>java.lang.String</code> class; similarly, in [[Smalltalk]], an [[anonymous function]] expression (a \"block\") constructs an instance of the library's <code>BlockContext</code> class. Conversely, [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros, and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs, and which must be implemented as parts of a library.\n\n==Design and implementation==\nProgramming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing ''language families'' of related languages branching one from another.<ref name=\"Fischer\">Steven R.

A significant difference is that a programming language can be fully described and studied in its entirety, since it has a precise and finite definition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/Projects/Nuprl/cs611/fall94notes/cn2/subsection3_1_3.html|author=Jing Huang|title=Artificial Language vs. Natural Language|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903084542/http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/Projects/Nuprl/cs611/fall94notes/cn2/subsection3_1_3.html|archivedate=3 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> By contrast, natural languages have changing meanings given by their users in different communities. While [[constructed languages]] are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose, they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has.\n\nMany programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one \"universal\" programming language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role.<ref>IBM in first publishing PL/I, for example, rather ambitiously titled its manual ''The universal programming language PL/I'' (IBM Library; 1966). The title reflected IBM's goals for unlimited subsetting capability: \"PL/I is designed in such a way that one can isolate subsets from it satisfying the requirements of particular applications.\" ({{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=PL/I&oldid=19175|title=PL/I|work=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|accessdate=29 June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426010947/http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=PL%2FI&oldid=19175|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}). [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[UNCOL]] had similar early goals.</ref> The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used:\n* Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of [[programmer]]s.\n* Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else, to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity.\n* Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from [[microcontroller]]s to [[supercomputer]]s.\n* Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification.\n* Programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language.\n\nOne common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]]. The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer. As new programming languages have developed, features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer. This lets them write more functionality per time unit.<ref>Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.: ''The Mythical Man-Month'', Addison-Wesley, 1982, pp. 93\u201394</ref>\n\n{{anchor|English-like programming languages}}\n[[Natural language programming]] has been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming.

There are, broadly, two approaches to programming language implementation: ''[[compiler|compilation]]'' and ''[[interpreter (computing)|interpretation]]''. It is generally possible to implement a language using either technique.\n\nThe output of a [[compiler]] may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter. In some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting. For instance, some implementations of [[BASIC]] compile and then execute the source a line at a time.\n\nPrograms that are executed directly on the hardware usually run much faster than those that are interpreted in software.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Code complete|last=Steve|first=McConnell|isbn=0735619670|edition=Second|location=Redmond, Washington|oclc=54974573|pages=[https://archive.org/details/codecomplete0000mcco/page/590 590, 600]|url=https://archive.org/details/codecomplete0000mcco/page/590}}</ref>{{better source|date=March 2019}}\n\nOne technique for improving the performance of interpreted programs is [[just-in-time compilation]]. Here the [[virtual machine]], just before execution, translates the blocks of [[bytecode]] which are going to be used to machine code, for direct execution on the hardware.\n\n==Proprietary languages==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n\nAlthough most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages with the implementation available only from a single vendor, which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property. Proprietary programming languages are commonly [[domain specific language]]s or internal [[scripting language]]s for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users.\n\nSome programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, [[Oracle Corporation]] asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the [[Java programming language]],<ref>See: [[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]</ref> and [[Microsoft]]'s [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system, also has [[Common Language Runtime]] (CLR) as a closed environment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerscience.org/resources/computer-programming-languages/|title=Guide to Programming Languages {{!}} ComputerScience.org|work=ComputerScience.org|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nMany proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature; examples include [[MATLAB]], [[VBScript]], and [[Wolfram Language]].  Some languages may make the transition from closed to open; for example, [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] was originally an Ericsson's internal programming language.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-erlang1/index.html|title=The basics|date=2011-05-10|website=www.ibm.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-13}}</ref>\n\n==Use==\nThousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computing field.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=1 June 2009|url=http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/|title=HOPL: an interactive Roster of Programming Languages|publisher=[[Murdoch University]]|location=Australia|quote=This site lists 8512 languages.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220044217/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/|archivedate=20 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nIndividual software projects commonly use five programming languages or more.<ref>{{cite conference|first1=Philip|conference=Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering \u2013 EASE '15|last1=Mayer|first2=Alexander|last2=Bauer|publisher=ACM|date=2015|location=New York, NY, USA|isbn=978-1-4503-3350-4|pages=4:1\u20134:10|doi=10.1145/2745802.2745805|quote=Results: We found (a) a mean number of 5 languages per project with a clearly dominant main general-purpose language and 5 often-used DSL types, (b) a significant influence of the size, number of commits, and the main language on the number of languages as well as no significant influence of age and number of contributors, and (c) three language ecosystems grouped around XML, Shell/Make, and HTML/CSS.

When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers \"do exactly what they are told to do\", and cannot \"understand\" what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using [[pseudocode]], which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.\n\nA programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A [[programmer]] uses the [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstractions]] present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called [[language primitive|primitives]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html|title=Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs|author=Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman|accessdate=3 March 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226050622/http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html|archivedate=26 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''[[Computer Programming|Programming]]'' is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment.\n\nPrograms for a computer might be [[Execution (computing)|executed]] in a [[Batch processing|batch process]] without human interaction, or a user might type [[Command (computing)|commands]] in an [[Session (computer science)|interactive session]] of an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].

When a language can run its commands through an interpreter (such as a [[Unix shell]] or other [[command-line interface]]), without compiling, it is called a [[scripting language]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.15/15.09/ScriptingLanguages/index.html\n |title       = Scripting Languages\n |year        = 1999\n |accessdate  = November 17, 2014\n |author      = Brown Vicki\n |website     = mactech.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20171202235828/http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.15/15.09/ScriptingLanguages/index.html\n |archivedate = 2 December 2017\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n===Measuring language usage===\n{{Main|Measuring programming language popularity}}\n\nDetermining which is the most widely used programming language is difficult since the definition of usage varies by context.

With languages such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new [[dialect]]. In other cases, a dialect is created for use in a [[domain-specific language]], often a subset. In the [[Common Lisp|Lisp]] world, most languages that use basic [[S-expression]] syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly, as do, say, [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]] and [[Clojure]]. As it is common for one language to have several dialects, it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation. The [[BASIC programming language]] has [[List of BASIC dialects|many dialects]].\n\nThe explosion of Forth dialects led to the saying \"If you've seen one Forth... you've seen ''one'' Forth.\"\n\n==Taxonomies==\n{{details|Categorical list of programming languages}}\nThere is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages. A given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language. Languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time. Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages, and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different family.\n\nThe task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes. For example, Java is both an object-oriented language (because it encourages object-oriented organization) and a concurrent language (because it contains built-in constructs for running multiple [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] in parallel). [[Python (programming language)|Python]] is an object-oriented [[scripting language]].\n\nIn broad strokes, programming languages divide into ''[[programming paradigm]]s'' and a classification by ''intended domain of use,'' with [[general-purpose programming language]]s distinguished from [[domain-specific programming language]]s. Traditionally, programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences, i.e. issuing commands. These are generally called [[imperative programming]] languages. A great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer, which is the main feature of [[declarative programming]].<ref>Carl A. Gunter, ''Semantics of Programming Languages: Structures and Techniques'', MIT Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-262-57095-5}}, p. 1</ref> More refined paradigms include [[procedural programming]], [[object-oriented programming]], [[functional programming]], and [[logic programming]]; some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi-paradigmatic. An [[assembly language]] is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture. By purpose, programming languages might be considered general purpose, [[system programming language]]s, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, or concurrent/distributed languages (or a combination of these).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tunes.org/wiki/programming_20languages.html|title=TUNES: Programming Languages|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020203251/http://tunes.org/wiki/programming_20languages.html|archivedate=20 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wirth|first=Niklaus|authorlink=Niklaus Wirth|title=Recollections about the development of Pascal|journal=Proc. 2nd ACM SIGPLAN Conference on History of Programming Languages|volume=28|issue=3|pages=333\u2013342|year=1993|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155378|accessdate=30 June 2006|doi=10.1145/154766.155378|isbn=978-0-89791-570-0|citeseerx=10.1.1.475.6989}}</ref>\n\nA programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated to programming paradigm. For instance, most programming languages use [[English language]] keywords, while [[Non-English-based programming languages|a minority do not]].

For example, the instruction to add the value in two memory location might consist of 3 numbers: an \"opcode\" that selects the \"add\" operation, and two memory locations. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from [[punched card]]s, paper tape, [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] or toggled in on switches on the [[front panel]] of the computer.  Machine languages were later termed ''[[first-generation programming language]]s'' (1GL).\n\nThe next step was development of so-called ''[[second-generation programming language]]s'' (2GL) or [[assembly language]]s, which were still closely tied to the [[instruction set architecture]] of the specific computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations.\n\nThe first ''[[high-level programming language]]s'', or ''[[third-generation programming language]]s'' (3GL), were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was [[Plankalk\u00fcl]], developed for the German [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] by [[Konrad Zuse]] between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.<ref>\n[[Ra\u00fal Rojas|Rojas, Ra\u00fal]], et al. (2000). \"Plankalk\u00fcl: The First High-Level Programming Language and its Implementation\".

[[C++]] combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], a systems programming language derived from [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called [[Fifth-generation programming language|\"fifth-generation\" languages]] that incorporated logic programming constructs.<ref>Tetsuro Fujise, Takashi Chikayama, Kazuaki Rokusawa, Akihiko Nakase (December 1994). \"KLIC: A Portable Implementation of KL1\" ''Proc. of FGCS '94, ICOT'' Tokyo, December 1994. {{cite web |url=http://www.icot.or.jp/ARCHIVE/HomePage-E.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925132105/http://www.icot.or.jp/ARCHIVE/HomePage-E.html |archivedate=25 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }} KLIC is a portable implementation of a concurrent logic programming language [[KL1]].</ref> The functional languages community moved to standardize [[ML (programming language)|ML]] and Lisp. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decades.\n\nOne important trend in language design for programming large-scale systems during the 1980s was an increased focus on the use of ''modules'' or large-scale organizational units of code. [[Modula-2]], Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s, which were often wedded to [[generic programming]] constructs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Bender|url=http://readscheme.org/modules/|title=Mini-Bibliography on Modules for Functional Programming Languages|work=ReadScheme.org|accessdate=27 September 2006|date=15 March 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924085057/http://readscheme.org/modules/|archivedate=24 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe rapid growth of the [[Internet]] in the mid-1990s created opportunities for new languages. [[Perl]], originally a Unix scripting tool first released in 1987, became common in dynamic [[website]]s. [[Java (programming language)|Java]] came to be used for server-side programming, and bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with their promise of \"[[Write once, run anywhere]]\" ([[UCSD Pascal]] had been popular for a time in the early 1980s). These developments were not fundamentally novel; rather, they were refinements of many existing languages and paradigms (although their syntax was often based on the C family of programming languages).\n\nProgramming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Current directions include security and reliability verification, new kinds of modularity ([[mixin]]s, [[Delegation (programming)|delegates]], [[aspect-oriented programming|aspects]]), and database integration such as Microsoft's [[Language Integrated Query|LINQ]].\n\n''[[Fourth-generation programming language]]s'' (4GL) are computer programming languages which aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details than 3GLs. ''[[Fifth-generation programming language]]s'' (5GL) are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an [[algorithm]] written by a programmer.\n\n==Elements==\nAll programming languages have some [[language primitive|primitive]] building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection). These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively.\n\n===Syntax===\n{{Main|Syntax (programming languages)}}\n[[File:Python add5 parse.png|thumb|367px|[[Parse tree]] of [[Python (programming language)|Python code]] with inset tokenization]]\n[[File:Python add5 syntax.svg|thumb|292px|[[Syntax highlighting]] is often used to aid programmers in recognizing elements of source code. The language above is [[Python (programming language)|Python]].]]\nA programming language's surface form is known as its [[syntax (programming languages)|syntax]]. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more [[visual programming language|graphical]] in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.\n\nThe syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either [[Formal semantics of programming languages|formal]] or hard-coded in a [[Reference implementation (computing)|reference implementation]]). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.\n\nProgramming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of [[regular expression]]s (for [[lexical analysis|lexical]] structure) and [[Backus\u2013Naur form]] (for [[context-free grammar|grammatical]] structure). Below is a simple grammar, based on [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]:\n<source lang=\"bnf\">\nexpression ::= atom | list\natom       ::= number | symbol\nnumber     ::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+\nsymbol     ::= ['A'-'Z''a'-'z'].*\nlist       ::= '(' expression* ')'\n</source>\n\nThis grammar specifies the following:\n* an ''expression'' is either an ''atom'' or a ''list'';\n* an ''atom'' is either a ''number'' or a ''symbol'';\n* a ''number'' is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign;\n* a ''symbol'' is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters (excluding whitespace); and\n* a ''list'' is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more ''expressions'' inside it.\n\nThe following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar: <code>12345</code>, <code>()</code> and <code>(a b c232 (1))</code>.\n\nNot all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution. In some cases, such programs may exhibit [[undefined behavior]]. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.\n\nUsing [[natural language]] as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false:\n* \"[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]].\" is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning.\n* \"John is a married bachelor.\" is grammatically [[well-formedness|well-formed]] but expresses a meaning that cannot be true.\n\nThe following [[C (programming language)|C language]] fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation <code>*p >> 4</code> has no meaning for a value having a complex type and <code>p->im</code> is not defined because the value of <code>p</code> is the [[null pointer]]):\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\ncomplex *p = NULL;\ncomplex abs_p = sqrt(*p >> 4 + p->im);\n</source>\n\nIf the [[type declaration]] on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on undefined variable \"p\" during compilation. However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.\n\nThe grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].

Examples include checking that every [[identifier]] is declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a [[case statement]] are distinct.<ref>Michael Lee Scott, ''Programming language pragmatics'', Edition 2, Morgan Kaufmann, 2006, {{ISBN|0-12-633951-1}}, p. 18\u201319</ref> Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context (e.g. not adding an integer to a function name), or that [[subroutine]] calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a [[logic]] called a [[type system]]. Other forms of [[static code analysis|static analyses]] like [[data flow analysis]] may also be part of static semantics. Newer programming languages like [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] have [[definite assignment analysis]], a form of data flow analysis, as part of their static semantics.\n\n====Dynamic semantics====\n{{main|Semantics of programming languages}}\nOnce data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example, the semantics may define the [[evaluation strategy|strategy]] by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which [[control flow|control structures]] conditionally execute [[Statement (computer science)|statements]]. The ''dynamic semantics'' (also known as ''execution semantics'') of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research went into [[formal semantics of programming languages]], which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia.\n\n===Type system===\n{{Main|Data type|Type system|Type safety}}\n\nA type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into ''types'', how it can manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations. Any [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs. In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have ''type loopholes'', usually unchecked [[Type conversion#Explicit type conversion|casts]] that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to [[type checking|type check]] programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, [[type inference|infer types]], relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as ''[[type theory]]''.\n\n====Typed versus untyped languages====\nA language is ''typed'' if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable.<ref name=\"typing\">{{cite web|url=http://www.acooke.org/comp-lang.html|author=Andrew Cooke|title=Introduction To Computer Languages|accessdate=13 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815140215/http://www.acooke.org/comp-lang.html|archivedate=15 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> For example, the data represented by <code>\"this text between the quotes\"</code> is a [[String literal|string]], and in many programming languages dividing a number by a string has no meaning and will not be executed. The invalid operation may be detected when the program is compiled (\"static\" type checking) and will be rejected by the compiler with a compilation error message, or it may be detected while the program is running (\"dynamic\" type checking), resulting in a run-time [[Exception handling|exception]]. Many languages allow a function called an exception handler to handle this exception and, for example, always return \"-1\" as the result.\n\nA special case of typed languages are the ''single-typed'' languages. These are often scripting or markup languages, such as [[REXX]] or [[Standard Generalized Markup Language|SGML]], and have only one data type{{dubious|date=March 2018}}\u2013\u2014most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric data.\n\nIn contrast, an ''untyped language'', such as most [[assembly language]]s, allows any operation to be performed on any data, generally sequences of bits of various lengths.<ref name=\"typing\"/> High-level untyped languages include [[BCPL]], [[Tcl]], and some varieties of [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]].\n\nIn practice, while few languages are considered typed from the [[type theory]] (verifying or rejecting all operations), most modern languages offer a degree of typing.<ref name=\"typing\"/> Many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system, trading type-safety for finer control over the program's execution (see [[Type conversion#Explicit type conversion|casting]]).\n\n====Static versus dynamic typing====\nIn ''[[Type system|static typing]]'', all expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed, typically at compile-time. For example, 1 and (2+2) are integer expressions; they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string, or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates.<ref name=\"typing\"/>\n\nStatically typed languages can be either ''[[Manifest typing|manifestly typed]]'' or ''[[Type inference|type-inferred]]''. In the first case, the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions (for example, at variable [[declaration (computer science)|declarations]]). In the second case, the compiler ''infers'' the types of expressions and declarations based on context. Most mainstream statically typed languages, such as [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], are manifestly typed. Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages, such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. However, many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference; for example, [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] all infer types in certain limited cases.<ref>Specifically, instantiations of [[generic programming|generic]] types are inferred for certain expression forms. Type inference in Generic Java\u2014the research language that provided the basis for Java 1.5's bounded [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming|parametric polymorphism]] extensions\u2014is discussed in two informal manuscripts from the Types mailing list: [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00849.html Generic Java type inference is unsound] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129073839/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00849.html |date=29 January 2007 }} ([[Alan Jeffrey]], 17 December 2001) and [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00921.html Sound Generic Java type inference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129073849/http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~sweirich/types/archive/1999-2003/msg00921.html |date=29 January 2007 }} ([[Martin Odersky]], 15 January 2002). C#'s type system is similar to Java's, and uses a similar partial type inference scheme.</ref> Additionally, some programming languages allow for some types to be automatically converted to other types; for example, an int can be used where the program expects a float.\n\n''[[Type system|Dynamic typing]]'', also called ''latent typing'', determines the type-safety of operations at run time; in other words, types are associated with ''run-time values'' rather than ''textual expressions''.<ref name=\"typing\"/> As with type-inferred languages, dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions. Among other things, this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution. However, type [[Software bug|errors]] cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed, potentially making [[debugging]] more difficult. [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[JavaScript]], and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] are all examples of dynamically typed languages.\n\n====Weak and strong typing====\n''[[Weak typing]]'' allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a [[String (computer science)|string]] as a number.<ref name=\"typing\"/> This can occasionally be useful, but it can also allow some kinds of program faults to go undetected at [[compile time]] and even at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].\n\n''[[Strongly typed programming language|Strong typing]]'' prevents these program faults. An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error.<ref name=\"typing\"/> Strongly typed languages are often termed ''type-safe'' or ''[[type safety|safe]]''.\n\nAn alternative definition for \"weakly typed\" refers to languages, such as [[Perl]] and [[JavaScript]], which permit a large number of implicit type conversions. In JavaScript, for example, the expression <code>2 * x</code> implicitly converts <code>x</code> to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if <code>x</code> is <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, an <code>Array</code>, or a string of letters. Such implicit conversions are often useful, but they can mask programming errors.\n''Strong'' and ''static'' are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs. Some use the term ''strongly typed'' to mean ''strongly, statically typed'', or, even more confusingly, to mean simply ''statically typed''. Thus [[C (programming language)|C]] has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html|title=Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme|date=20 February 1998|accessdate=9 June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714212928/http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML/r5rs-Z-H-4.html|archivedate=14 July 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cardelli85understanding.html|title=On Understanding Types, Data Abstraction, and Polymorphism|author=[[Luca Cardelli]] and [[Peter Wegner]]|work=Manuscript (1985)|accessdate=9 June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619072646/http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cardelli85understanding.html|archivedate=19 June 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt may seem odd to some professional programmers that C could be \"weakly, statically typed\". However, notice that the use of the generic pointer, the '''void*''' pointer, does allow for casting of pointers to other pointers without needing to do an explicit cast. This is extremely similar to somehow casting an array of bytes to any kind of datatype in C without using an explicit cast, such as <code>(int)</code> or <code>(char)</code>.\n\n===Standard library and run-time system===\n{{main|Standard library}}\n\nMost programming languages have an associated core [[Library (computing)|library]] (sometimes known as the 'standard library', especially if it is included as part of the published language standard), which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language. Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output.\n\nThe line between a language and its core library differs from language to language. In some cases, the language designers may treat the library as a separate entity from the language. However, a language's core library is often treated as part of the language by its users, and some language specifications even require that this library be made available in all implementations. Indeed, some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library. For example, in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], a string literal is defined as an instance of the <code>java.lang.String</code> class; similarly, in [[Smalltalk]], an [[anonymous function]] expression (a \"block\") constructs an instance of the library's <code>BlockContext</code> class. Conversely, [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros, and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs, and which must be implemented as parts of a library.\n\n==Design and implementation==\nProgramming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing ''language families'' of related languages branching one from another.<ref name=\"Fischer\">Steven R.

While [[constructed languages]] are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose, they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has.\n\nMany programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one \"universal\" programming language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role.<ref>IBM in first publishing PL/I, for example, rather ambitiously titled its manual ''The universal programming language PL/I'' (IBM Library; 1966). The title reflected IBM's goals for unlimited subsetting capability: \"PL/I is designed in such a way that one can isolate subsets from it satisfying the requirements of particular applications.\" ({{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=PL/I&oldid=19175|title=PL/I|work=Encyclopedia of Mathematics|accessdate=29 June 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426010947/http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=PL%2FI&oldid=19175|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}). [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[UNCOL]] had similar early goals.</ref> The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used:\n* Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of [[programmer]]s.\n* Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else, to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity.\n* Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from [[microcontroller]]s to [[supercomputer]]s.\n* Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification.\n* Programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language.\n\nOne common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]]. The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer. As new programming languages have developed, features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer. This lets them write more functionality per time unit.<ref>Frederick P.

The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementation.\n\n===Implementation===\n{{Main|Programming language implementation}}\n\nAn ''implementation'' of a programming language provides a way to write programs in that language and execute them on one or more configurations of hardware and software. There are, broadly, two approaches to programming language implementation: ''[[compiler|compilation]]'' and ''[[interpreter (computing)|interpretation]]''. It is generally possible to implement a language using either technique.\n\nThe output of a [[compiler]] may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter. In some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting. For instance, some implementations of [[BASIC]] compile and then execute the source a line at a time.\n\nPrograms that are executed directly on the hardware usually run much faster than those that are interpreted in software.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Code complete|last=Steve|first=McConnell|isbn=0735619670|edition=Second|location=Redmond, Washington|oclc=54974573|pages=[https://archive.org/details/codecomplete0000mcco/page/590 590, 600]|url=https://archive.org/details/codecomplete0000mcco/page/590}}</ref>{{better source|date=March 2019}}\n\nOne technique for improving the performance of interpreted programs is [[just-in-time compilation]].

Proprietary programming languages are commonly [[domain specific language]]s or internal [[scripting language]]s for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor, while others are available to external users.\n\nSome programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example, [[Oracle Corporation]] asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the [[Java programming language]],<ref>See: [[Oracle America, Inc. v.

When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers \"do exactly what they are told to do\", and cannot \"understand\" what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using [[pseudocode]], which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language.\n\nA programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data.

One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours, a different one has more lines of code, and a third may consume the most CPU time. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications. For example, [[COBOL]] is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]];<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/319269/cobol_turns_50/\n |title       = COBOL turns 50\n |date        = 2009-09-21\n |accessdate  = 2013-10-19\n |author      = Georgina Swan\n |publisher   = computerworld.com.au\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019181128/http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/319269/cobol_turns_50/\n |archivedate = 19 October 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.developer.com/lang/other/7-myths-of-cobol-debunked.html\n |title       = 7 Myths of COBOL Debunked\n |date        = 2012-05-03\n |accessdate  = 2013-10-19\n |author      = Ed Airey\n |publisher   = developer.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019171802/http://www.developer.com/lang/other/7-myths-of-cobol-debunked.html\n |archivedate = 19 October 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> [[Fortran]] in scientific and engineering applications; [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] in aerospace, transportation, military, real-time and embedded applications; and [[C (programming language)|C]] in embedded applications and operating systems.

With languages such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] and [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], standards may be considered insufficient, inadequate or illegitimate by implementors, so often they will deviate from the standard, making a new [[dialect]]. In other cases, a dialect is created for use in a [[domain-specific language]], often a subset. In the [[Common Lisp|Lisp]] world, most languages that use basic [[S-expression]] syntax and Lisp-like semantics are considered Lisp dialects, although they vary wildly, as do, say, [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]] and [[Clojure]]. As it is common for one language to have several dialects, it can become quite difficult for an inexperienced programmer to find the right documentation. The [[BASIC programming language]] has [[List of BASIC dialects|many dialects]].\n\nThe explosion of Forth dialects led to the saying \"If you've seen one Forth... you've seen ''one'' Forth.\"\n\n==Taxonomies==\n{{details|Categorical list of programming languages}}\nThere is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages. A given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language. Languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time. Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages, and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different family.\n\nThe task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes. For example, Java is both an object-oriented language (because it encourages object-oriented organization) and a concurrent language (because it contains built-in constructs for running multiple [[Thread (computer science)|threads]] in parallel). [[Python (programming language)|Python]] is an object-oriented [[scripting language]].\n\nIn broad strokes, programming languages divide into ''[[programming paradigm]]s'' and a classification by ''intended domain of use,'' with [[general-purpose programming language]]s distinguished from [[domain-specific programming language]]s. Traditionally, programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences, i.e. issuing commands. These are generally called [[imperative programming]] languages. A great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer, which is the main feature of [[declarative programming]].<ref>Carl A. Gunter, ''Semantics of Programming Languages: Structures and Techniques'', MIT Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-262-57095-5}}, p. 1</ref> More refined paradigms include [[procedural programming]], [[object-oriented programming]], [[functional programming]], and [[logic programming]]; some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi-paradigmatic. An [[assembly language]] is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture. By purpose, programming languages might be considered general purpose, [[system programming language]]s, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, or concurrent/distributed languages (or a combination of these).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tunes.org/wiki/programming_20languages.html|title=TUNES: Programming Languages|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020203251/http://tunes.org/wiki/programming_20languages.html|archivedate=20 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wirth|first=Niklaus|authorlink=Niklaus Wirth|title=Recollections about the development of Pascal|journal=Proc. 2nd ACM SIGPLAN Conference on History of Programming Languages|volume=28|issue=3|pages=333\u2013342|year=1993|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155378|accessdate=30 June 2006|doi=10.1145/154766.155378|isbn=978-0-89791-570-0|citeseerx=10.1.1.475.6989}}</ref>\n\nA programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated to programming paradigm. For instance, most programming languages use [[English language]] keywords, while [[Non-English-based programming languages|a minority do not]]. Other languages may be classified as being [[Esoteric programming language|deliberately esoteric]] or not.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Comparison of programming languages (basic instructions)]]\n* [[Comparison of programming languages]]\n* [[Computer programming]]\n* [[Computer science]] and [[Outline of computer science]]\n* [[Domain-specific language]] \n* [[Domain-specific modelling]] \n* [[Educational programming language]]\n* [[Esoteric programming language]]\n* [[Extensible programming]]\n* [[:Category:Extensible syntax programming languages]]\n* [[Invariant based programming]]\n* [[List of BASIC dialects]]\n* [[Lists of programming languages]]\n* [[List of programming language researchers]]\n* [[Programming languages used in most popular websites]]\n* [[Language-oriented programming]]\n* [[Logic programming]]\n* [[Literate programming]]\n* [[Metaprogramming]]\n** {{Section link|Ruby (programming language)|Metaprogramming}}\n* [[Modeling language]]\n* [[Programming language theory]]\n* [[Pseudocode]]\n* {{Section link|Rebol|Dialects}}\n* [[Reflection (computer science)|Reflection]]\n* [[Scientific programming language]]\n* [[Scripting language]]\n* [[Software engineering]] and [[List of software engineering topics]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{see also|History of programming languages#Further reading}}\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Abelson|first1=Harold|authorlink1=Harold Abelson|last2=Sussman|first2=Gerald Jay|authorlink2=Gerald Jay Sussman|title=Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html|edition=2nd|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|access-date=22 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309173822/https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html|archive-date=9 March 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n* [[Raphael Finkel]]: ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20141022141742/http://www.nondot.org/sabre/Mirrored/AdvProgLangDesign/ Advanced Programming Language Design]'', Addison Wesley 1995.\n* [[Daniel P.

The rise of [[Hitler]] saw an increasingly radicalised Bulgaria, as it eventually adopted anti-Semitic legislation, based on the German one. Bulgaria's alliance with Germany during [[World War II]] placed the former into a position of obedience and conformity. In addition, the Bulgarian government was ridden with politicians that held pro-fascist and anti-democratic sentiments. Such was the case of Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], who on 8 October 1940 marginalised the country's [[Jewry]] by introducing the bill culminating in the passage of the [[Law for Protection of the Nation|Law for the Protection of the Nation]] ({{lang-bg|Zakon za Zashtita na Naciyata}}), which entered into force in January 1941 and which restricted the rights and activities of Jews.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Saliently, it forbade the granting of Bulgarian citizenship to Jews.<ref name=\"ragaru\" /> [[Alexander Belev]] had been sent by the interior minister [[Petar Gabrovski]] to Germany in order to study the racial laws; the legislation was modelled on the racial code of Nazi Germany, the [[Nuremberg Laws]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://newpol.org/issue_post/rescue-bulgarias-jews-world-war-ii/|title=\"The Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews in World War II, by Rossen Vassilev.\"|work= Newpol.org. 2010.

This included the creation of camps designed, not to house deportees, but solely to execute them as quickly as possible after they arrived. Shortly thereafter in June 1942, Gabrovski created within the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior a Commissariat for the Jewish Affairs, and chose Belev to lead it. The new department began to prepare for the Final Solution. Belev signed a secret agreement with Germany's [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]] [[Theodor Dannecker]] on 22 February 1943 to deport 20,000 Jews, starting from the occupied Greek areas of [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]] and Yugoslav areas of [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Morava Valley|Pomoravlje]] first, which had been conquered by Germany but had since 1941 been under occupation by the Bulgarian authorities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe deportation of 11,343 Jews (7,122 from Macedonia and 4,221 from Thrace) was organised and executed by the Bulgarian authorities, with the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Nazi-occupied Poland]] as their final destination.

The passing of the law by Parliament in January 1941 paved the way for the first deportations to take place in November of the same year. \n\nAnti-Jewish propaganda gradually intensified with Bulgaria's rising economic and political dependence on Nazi Germany. This led to the introduction of antisemitic legislation, starting with the Law for Protection of the Nation in 1940. This restricted the civil rights of Jews and was complemented by further laws, such as the establishment of a Commission on Jewish Affairs on 29 August 1942. The commission was tasked with the organisation of the expulsion of Jews and the liquidation of their property. This Act can be interpreted as the immediate precursor of the decision to deport Jews to extermination camps in March 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Bulgarian Jews during the Holocaust \u2014 the Menace, the Rescue, the Aliya|first=Rumyana Dimitrova|last=Marinova-Christidi|url=https://shalom.bg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Holocoust-ENG.pdf|website=shalom.bg}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bulgarian government]] termed the deportations as \"resettlement,\" but Bulgarian citizens were not convinced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Expressions of dissent grew as Bulgarians protested against any Jews being deported from Bulgarian soil, and the [[Bulgarian government]] was flooded with petitions from organisations of writers and artists, lawyers, and religious leaders, among others.

Instead, prosecutions were mainly for \"incidental malfeasance\" and convictions were hard to secure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|date=2017-05-04|title=The Holocaust in Bulgaria: Rescuing History from \u2018Rescue\u2019|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=140-141|doi=10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|issn=2325-6249|via=}}</ref> Now fighting with the Soviets against the Nazis, the Bulgarian Army tried to shield from liability officers who had abused Jewish forced labourers and lawyers engaged in the liquidation of Jews' assets mostly escaped sanction.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|date=2017-05-04|title=The Holocaust in Bulgaria: Rescuing History from \u2018Rescue\u2019|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=141|doi=10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|issn=2325-6249|via=}}</ref> Most defendants were acquitted or received lenient penalties and most offenders were never charged.<ref name=\":5\" /> Two death sentences were handed down, including one for Alexander Belev, but he had already died in 1944 and was tried ''in absentia''.<ref name=\":5\" /> Shortly afterwards, records of the ''People's Court Panel VII'' trial were suppressed, including the \"abundant testimony\", and secreted, unpublished, in the exclusive archives of the communist [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]]'s Interior Ministry.

The rise of [[Hitler]] saw an increasingly radicalised Bulgaria, as it eventually adopted anti-Semitic legislation, based on the German one. Bulgaria's alliance with Germany during [[World War II]] placed the former into a position of obedience and conformity. In addition, the Bulgarian government was ridden with politicians that held pro-fascist and anti-democratic sentiments. Such was the case of Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], who on 8 October 1940 marginalised the country's [[Jewry]] by introducing the bill culminating in the passage of the [[Law for Protection of the Nation|Law for the Protection of the Nation]] ({{lang-bg|Zakon za Zashtita na Naciyata}}), which entered into force in January 1941 and which restricted the rights and activities of Jews.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Saliently, it forbade the granting of Bulgarian citizenship to Jews.<ref name=\"ragaru\" /> [[Alexander Belev]] had been sent by the interior minister [[Petar Gabrovski]] to Germany in order to study the racial laws; the legislation was modelled on the racial code of Nazi Germany, the [[Nuremberg Laws]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://newpol.org/issue_post/rescue-bulgarias-jews-world-war-ii/|title=\"The Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews in World War II, by Rossen Vassilev.\"|work= Newpol.org. 2010.

The professional associations of Bulgarian lawyers, physicians, craftsmen and the Union of Artists' Societies opposed the law with petitions.<ref name=\"auto\" /> The Holy Synod, governing body of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], was also quite critical, with high clergy such as [[Stefan I of Bulgaria|Archbishop Stefan of Sofia]] and bishops Neofit of Vidin and [[Cyril of Bulgaria|Kyril of Plovdiv]] leading the opposition.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nIn January 1942, Germany outlined what it called the [[Final Solution|Final Solution to the Jewish Question]] at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. This included the creation of camps designed, not to house deportees, but solely to execute them as quickly as possible after they arrived.

The passing of the law by Parliament in January 1941 paved the way for the first deportations to take place in November of the same year. \n\nAnti-Jewish propaganda gradually intensified with Bulgaria's rising economic and political dependence on Nazi Germany. This led to the introduction of antisemitic legislation, starting with the Law for Protection of the Nation in 1940. This restricted the civil rights of Jews and was complemented by further laws, such as the establishment of a Commission on Jewish Affairs on 29 August 1942. The commission was tasked with the organisation of the expulsion of Jews and the liquidation of their property. This Act can be interpreted as the immediate precursor of the decision to deport Jews to extermination camps in March 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Bulgarian Jews during the Holocaust \u2014 the Menace, the Rescue, the Aliya|first=Rumyana Dimitrova|last=Marinova-Christidi|url=https://shalom.bg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Holocoust-ENG.pdf|website=shalom.bg}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bulgarian government]] termed the deportations as \"resettlement,\" but Bulgarian citizens were not convinced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Expressions of dissent grew as Bulgarians protested against any Jews being deported from Bulgarian soil, and the [[Bulgarian government]] was flooded with petitions from organisations of writers and artists, lawyers, and religious leaders, among others.

The episodes aired on the U.S. [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] and [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|SPACE]] in Canada respectively on March 13 and March 20, 2009. The second part (\"'''Daybreak, Parts 2 & 3\"''') is double-length. The episodes were written by [[Ronald D. Moore]], and directed by [[Michael Rymer]]. The Season 4.5 DVD and Blu-ray releases for Region 1 feature an extended version of the finale, which not only combines all three parts as a single episode, but also integrates it with new scenes not seen in the aired versions of either part. The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 1 is 39,516. The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 2 is 39,406. At the end of Part 2, Admiral Adama announces the survivor population at approximately 38,000.\n\nThe episodes portray the ''Galactica'' launching a rescue mission to retrieve [[Hera Agathon]] from the \"colony\", a heavily armed and defended Cylon base located near a [[black hole]]. They manage to rescue Hera, and in the end, the fleet finds a new planet to settle on, which they come to call Earth (revealed to be our [[Earth]]). The final episodes gave ''Battlestar Galactica'' the strongest ratings since its second season, though they received mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n===Part 1===\n[[File:DaybreakPart1.jpg|thumbnail|right|The ''Galactica'' crew members and civilians divide themselves between those joining the rescue attempt, and those staying behind with the fleet.]] The flashback sequences during the course of the first part take place a few years before the Cylon attack on Caprica. [[William Adama]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) is reluctant to undergo a lie detector test in preparation for a civilian desk job. Elsewhere, [[Gaius Baltar]] ([[James Callis]]) is getting tired of his father, Julius, who is abusive to his nurse. However, [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Caprica Six]] ([[Tricia Helfer]]) soon informs Baltar that she took his father into a care home, where he will be happier. [[Laura Roslin]] ([[Mary McDonnell]]) is living happily with her two sisters, one of whom is pregnant. But later, Roslin receives distressing news that both her sisters and father were killed in a car accident. Three months after, she is set up for a blind date and is encouraged to join [[Richard Adar|Mayor Adar's]] presidential campaign. [[Lee Adama]] ([[Jamie Bamber]]) meets [[Kara Thrace]] ([[Katee Sackhoff]]) for the first time while she is seeing his brother, [[Zak Adama|Zak]] ([[Tobias Mehler]]). When Lee arrives home drunk, he notices a [[pigeon]] in his house, and he chases it away. Lastly, the flashbacks focus on [[Samuel Anders|Anders]] ([[Michael Trucco]]), who is interviewed during his sporting career, where he admits to playing for the joy of the pursuit of perfection rather than the winning.\n\nBack in the present, ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)#Battlestar Galactica (2003)|Galactica]]'' is being stripped for parts to be used on other ships, while the military will be transferred to control the Rebel [[Basestar]]. The pictures of the fallen in the memorial hallway are also taken down. Baltar wants his people to have a seat on the quorum, but Lee refuses. Admiral Adama later decides to give [[amnesty]] to those who took part in the attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]],<ref>{{cite episode |title=Blood on the Scales |episodelink=Blood on the Scales |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) |credits=[[Wayne Rose]] (director); [[Michael Angeli]] (writer) |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=4 |number=16}}</ref> as well as to [[Galen Tyrol|Tyrol]] ([[Aaron Douglas (actor)|Aaron Douglas]]), who is in the brig for helping [[Sharon Valerii|Boomer]] ([[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]]) escape.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Someone to Watch Over Me |episodelink=Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica) |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) |credits=[[Michael Nankin]] (director); [[Bradley Thompson]] & [[David Weddle]] (writers) |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=4 |number=19}}</ref> This allows Tyrol to take part in the mission to retrieve [[Hera Agathon|Hera]] (Iliana Gomez-Martinez), who is being studied by the [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylons]] to determine how Cylons can reproduce. Adama announces a plan to rescue the child Hera at the colony and that it will be a one-way trip for the Galactica, and requires all Galactica personnel to either volunteer for the mission or decline in person.  He and Starbuck lay a line down the center of the landing bay and personnel move to one side to volunteer or the other to remain with the Fleet.  [[Sherman Cottle|Doc Cottle]] ([[Donnelly Rhodes]]) attempts to join in, but is ordered back by Adama as the fleet cannot afford to lose a doctor. Several others join in the operation, including the original Cylon models, and a weakened Roslin. A Raptor is dispatched to the possible location of the \"Colony\", only to find it located very close to a [[black hole]], but despite the circumstance, Adama orders an attack to begin and planning commences.\n\n===Part 2===\nIn flashback sequences, William Adama and [[Saul Tigh]] ([[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]]) celebrate their upcoming retirement, where Tigh convinces Adama to take his new job. Later, as  Adama is questioned in an interview, he complains that no job is worth questioning his loyalty and decides to rejoin the military. Lee has dinner with Zak and [[Kara Thrace|Starbuck]] again. When Zak passes out, drunk, the sexual tension between Kara and Lee nearly erupts before they are interrupted by a stirring Zak. Back home, Lee again encounters the pigeon, but this time he does not chase it. Roslin meets her blind date, who happens to be a former student of hers. After they go back to her apartment, she has second thoughts and ends the date; she then calls Adar's campaign, informing them of her intention to join it. Boomer meets Adama and Tigh for the first time, where she is warned that she is on the verge of ending her career due to her inability to land a Raptor. Given one last chance, Boomer gratefully tells the two that unlike other pilots, she will repay Adama one day. Meanwhile, Baltar, believing that Caprica Six is a corporate spy, allows her access to the military defense mainframe. He says that he is not doing this for her employers, but for her.\n\nBack in the present of the series, Baltar decides to join the mission with Caprica Six at the last minute; she later admits to being proud of him for the first time. At that moment it is revealed that Baltar's Inner Six and Six's Inner Baltar are aware of each other, and the two real-life counterparts see both of them. [[Romo Lampkin]] ([[Mark Sheppard]]) is installed as president, and Hoshi (Brad Dryborough) is given command of the fleet while Adama and ''Galactica'' set off to rescue Hera. A battalion of the self-aware Cylon Centurions who are aligned with the fleet march down the flight deck  - red stripes painted diagonally on their chests to distinguish them from the others.\n\n''Galactica'' jumps right next to the colony, where they are immediately fired upon. Some of the Raptors, which are armed with [[nuclear weapon]]s, make a short jump into the debris field and fly toward the back of the colony; in the process, [[Margaret Edmondson|Racetrack]] ([[Leah Cairns]]) and Skulls (Collin Lawrence) are killed by an asteroid. Anders has been installed into the CIC computers, and disables the Colony hybrids (Tiffany Lyndall-Knight). Starbuck's Raptor, carrying Athena and Helo, lands on the Colony - the only Raptor to make it through - and they enter to search for Hera. ''Galactica'' rams straight into the colony, where a strike team led by Apollo rappels in from ''Galactica'' to search for Hera, eventually meeting with Starbuck's squad. Hera is rescued by Boomer, who kills [[Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)|Simon]] ([[Rick Worthy]]) and finds Starbuck's team. Boomer hands Hera over to [[Sharon Agathon|Athena]] ([[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]]) and tells her to \"tell the old man I owed him one.\"  After her daughter is returned, Athena kills Boomer.\n\n''Galactica'' is set upon by Cylon boarding parties arriving in \"platoon strength\", as reported to Tigh and Adama in the CIC. As Starbuck, Apollo, Athena and Helo return to the battlestar and make their way to CIC, they encounter a boarding party composed of Cavil's modern Centurions and original Cylon War models.  Hera runs away in the confusion. She is spotted by Roslin, who had a vision of her while assisting with [[triage]], and is able to hide her from the Cylons, until she disappears again. While Roslin gives chase, Baltar and Caprica Six also spot Hera and give chase as well. The chase parallels the Opera House vision shared between Athena, Roslin and Caprica Six.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Crossroads |episodelink=Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica) |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) |credits=[[Michael Rymer]] (director); [[Michael Taylor (screenwriter)|Michael Taylor]] (writer) |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=3 |number=19}}</ref> The chase ends in the CIC, where [[John Cavil|Cavil]] ([[Dean Stockwell]]) takes her hostage and demands to leave with Hera so she can be dissected and establish a method for Cylons to reproduce. Inner Six and Inner Baltar again appear jointly to Baltar, inspiring him to make the speech his entire life has led to, saying, among other things, that he sees angels,<ref name=\"The Final David Eick video blogs\">{{cite web | url=http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/?clip=10| title=Do You Believe in Angels? | publisher=Scifi.com | accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> and that a divine force (\"whether God or Gods\") has entwined the destinies of both sides. Tigh provides the final incentive, saying that the Final Five will give the Cylons back resurrection (a solution to the problem of Cylon extinction) if they vow to forever go separate ways from humanity and end their pursuit.  Combined, this convinces Cavil and Adama to end the war, Cavil gives Hera back and will let them leave in peace when the Final Five give the technology for resurrection.\n\n===Part 3===\nCavil calls a cease fire in preparation for the data download and the boarding parties retreat.  Roslin and Adama look on as the Final Five begin the download of the technology for resurrection, with Saul and [[Ellen Tigh]] ([[Kate Vernon]]), Tory Foster ([[Rekha Sharma]]) and [[Galen Tyrol]] ([[Aaron Douglas (actor)|Aaron Douglas]]) dipping their hands into [[Samuel Anders]]' ([[Michael Trucco]]) tank to transfer the data to the Colony. Ellen warns that during the download they will briefly have full knowledge of each other's memories and experiences.  Tory asks that all bygones be left bygones.  The download commences and the Final Five experience flashbacks to each other's lives on Earth and in the colonies.  Tyrol learns then that Tory murdered his wife, [[Cally Tyrol|Cally]], and kills her in revenge before the downloading is complete. Feeling betrayed, the Cylons resume fighting; after the other Cylons in CIC are killed, Cavil commits [[suicide]]. At the same instant, a chance rock strike in the debris field causes Racetrack's dead hand to fall on the launch button for her Raptor's nuclear weapons, which were primed for launch before the Raptor's crew was lost.  The missiles strike directly into the Colony, knocking it out of orbit.  With ''Galactica'' still tangled in the Colony and being dragged toward the singularity along with it, Adama orders Starbuck to jump the ship away, anywhere. In a flash of inspiration, Starbuck mutters \"[[All Along the Watchtower|there must be some kind of way out of here]]\" and enters coordinates into the computer as if she were playing the [[All Along the Watchtower|mysterious music notes]] which Hera had written. ''Galactica'' jumps away and out of danger, leaving the Colony to fall to its destruction within the black hole.<ref name=\"podcast\">{{cite podcast|url=http://media.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/mp3/421-423/bsg_ep421-423_FULL.mp3 |title=Podcast for \"Daybreak\" (56.3 MB) |website=[scifi.com] |publisher=[[Scifi.com]] |host=Ronald D Moore |accessdate=April 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324221120/http://media.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/mp3/421-423/bsg_ep421-423_FULL.mp3 |archivedate=March 24, 2009 }}</ref>  The war is over, and the Humans and their allies have prevailed.\n\n''Galactica'' arrives at Kara's mysterious coordinates, its final destination as the damage caused in the battle has rendered the ship incapable of surviving any further jumps. Miraculously, the ''Galactica'' finds itself in orbit around a moon, close to a habitable world: our own [[Earth]].\n\nHours later, the rest of the fleet joins ''Galactica'' at this new world.  Lee makes the unorthodox suggestion that they abandon their technology and start afresh, while Adama and others discover primitive humans already occupying the planet. Since finding Earth had always been the goal of the Colonial Fleet, Adama suggests they call this new planet \"Earth\". The survivors - ''Galactica's'' crew, the remaining inhabitants of the fleet, and the Cylon Twos, Sixes and Eights - take basic supplies and spread out across the planet - not to colonize and impose cities like the [[Twelve Colonies]], but to blend in with primitive early humans, adding their own human and humanoid Cylon \"genetics\" to the early humans. Anders takes control of their abandoned fleet and pilots it into the Sun, so that the new arrivals \"can give them the best part of ourselves... not the baggage... not the weapons... our hearts (rather than) our science\". The Rebel Cylons decide that their Centurions have earned their freedom, and give them control of the Basestar, which jumps away to parts unknown.  Baltar and Caprica Six are visited by their [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Head/Inner/Messenger Six|Inner messengers]], who inform them that their destinies - to save Hera - have been fulfilled, and the two decide to live out the rest of their lives together.\n\nWhile resting under a tree, Roslin suddenly begins to have difficulty breathing.  Adama quickly places her aboard a Raptor and says a short, final goodbye to Lee and Starbuck before taking off. While admiring the wildlife below and looking for a place to build a cabin for them, Roslin dies peacefully.  While Lee expresses his desire to venture off and explore the planet, Starbuck, her destiny as an Angel fulfilled, literally vanishes without a trace.  Lee promises to never forget her.  Tyrol decides to settle by himself on a remote northern island (implied to be the Scottish highlands). Helo ([[Tahmoh Penikett]]), Athena and Hera are reunited as a family. Tigh and Ellen stay with the rest of the survivors. Adama eventually finds the place where he will build the cabin, and buries Laura on a nearby hillside.\n\n===Epilogue===\n[[New York City]], 150,000 years later: humanity has reached the early 21st century, and the development of robotics and computerization continues unabated.

Inner Six disagrees with her counterpart about humanity's next future: when a complex system repeats, something new is bound to happen, and ''this'' Earth\u2014descendants of devastated planets [[Kobol]], the [[Twelve Colonies]], and the [[Earth (Battlestar Galactica)|original Earth]]\u2014may escape the vicious cycle of technology, surmising it to be a part of God's plan.  Inner Baltar reminds her \"It doesn't like that name,\" as the two stroll away.   The episode and series end with a montage showing the progress of robotics in modern society indicating that it all had happened before and still might happen again.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[Actroid]] at the [[Expo 2005]] in [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], Japan.

The episodes aired on the U.S. [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] and [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|SPACE]] in Canada respectively on March 13 and March 20, 2009. The second part (\"'''Daybreak, Parts 2 & 3\"''') is double-length. The episodes were written by [[Ronald D. Moore]], and directed by [[Michael Rymer]]. The Season 4.5 DVD and Blu-ray releases for Region 1 feature an extended version of the finale, which not only combines all three parts as a single episode, but also integrates it with new scenes not seen in the aired versions of either part. The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 1 is 39,516. The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 2 is 39,406. At the end of Part 2, Admiral Adama announces the survivor population at approximately 38,000.\n\nThe episodes portray the ''Galactica'' launching a rescue mission to retrieve [[Hera Agathon]] from the \"colony\", a heavily armed and defended Cylon base located near a [[black hole]]. They manage to rescue Hera, and in the end, the fleet finds a new planet to settle on, which they come to call Earth (revealed to be our [[Earth]]). The final episodes gave ''Battlestar Galactica'' the strongest ratings since its second season, though they received mixed reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n===Part 1===\n[[File:DaybreakPart1.jpg|thumbnail|right|The ''Galactica'' crew members and civilians divide themselves between those joining the rescue attempt, and those staying behind with the fleet.]] The flashback sequences during the course of the first part take place a few years before the Cylon attack on Caprica. [[William Adama]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) is reluctant to undergo a lie detector test in preparation for a civilian desk job. Elsewhere, [[Gaius Baltar]] ([[James Callis]]) is getting tired of his father, Julius, who is abusive to his nurse. However, [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Caprica Six]] ([[Tricia Helfer]]) soon informs Baltar that she took his father into a care home, where he will be happier. [[Laura Roslin]] ([[Mary McDonnell]]) is living happily with her two sisters, one of whom is pregnant. But later, Roslin receives distressing news that both her sisters and father were killed in a car accident. Three months after, she is set up for a blind date and is encouraged to join [[Richard Adar|Mayor Adar's]] presidential campaign. [[Lee Adama]] ([[Jamie Bamber]]) meets [[Kara Thrace]] ([[Katee Sackhoff]]) for the first time while she is seeing his brother, [[Zak Adama|Zak]] ([[Tobias Mehler]]). When Lee arrives home drunk, he notices a [[pigeon]] in his house, and he chases it away. Lastly, the flashbacks focus on [[Samuel Anders|Anders]] ([[Michael Trucco]]), who is interviewed during his sporting career, where he admits to playing for the joy of the pursuit of perfection rather than the winning.\n\nBack in the present, ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)#Battlestar Galactica (2003)|Galactica]]'' is being stripped for parts to be used on other ships, while the military will be transferred to control the Rebel [[Basestar]]. The pictures of the fallen in the memorial hallway are also taken down. Baltar wants his people to have a seat on the quorum, but Lee refuses. Admiral Adama later decides to give [[amnesty]] to those who took part in the attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]],<ref>{{cite episode |title=Blood on the Scales |episodelink=Blood on the Scales |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) |credits=[[Wayne Rose]] (director); [[Michael Angeli]] (writer) |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=4 |number=16}}</ref> as well as to [[Galen Tyrol|Tyrol]] ([[Aaron Douglas (actor)|Aaron Douglas]]), who is in the brig for helping [[Sharon Valerii|Boomer]] ([[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]]) escape.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Someone to Watch Over Me |episodelink=Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica) |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) |credits=[[Michael Nankin]] (director); [[Bradley Thompson]] & [[David Weddle]] (writers) |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=4 |number=19}}</ref> This allows Tyrol to take part in the mission to retrieve [[Hera Agathon|Hera]] (Iliana Gomez-Martinez), who is being studied by the [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylons]] to determine how Cylons can reproduce. Adama announces a plan to rescue the child Hera at the colony and that it will be a one-way trip for the Galactica, and requires all Galactica personnel to either volunteer for the mission or decline in person.  He and Starbuck lay a line down the center of the landing bay and personnel move to one side to volunteer or the other to remain with the Fleet.  [[Sherman Cottle|Doc Cottle]] ([[Donnelly Rhodes]]) attempts to join in, but is ordered back by Adama as the fleet cannot afford to lose a doctor. Several others join in the operation, including the original Cylon models, and a weakened Roslin. A Raptor is dispatched to the possible location of the \"Colony\", only to find it located very close to a [[black hole]], but despite the circumstance, Adama orders an attack to begin and planning commences.\n\n===Part 2===\nIn flashback sequences, William Adama and [[Saul Tigh]] ([[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]]) celebrate their upcoming retirement, where Tigh convinces Adama to take his new job. Later, as  Adama is questioned in an interview, he complains that no job is worth questioning his loyalty and decides to rejoin the military. Lee has dinner with Zak and [[Kara Thrace|Starbuck]] again. When Zak passes out, drunk, the sexual tension between Kara and Lee nearly erupts before they are interrupted by a stirring Zak. Back home, Lee again encounters the pigeon, but this time he does not chase it. Roslin meets her blind date, who happens to be a former student of hers. After they go back to her apartment, she has second thoughts and ends the date; she then calls Adar's campaign, informing them of her intention to join it. Boomer meets Adama and Tigh for the first time, where she is warned that she is on the verge of ending her career due to her inability to land a Raptor. Given one last chance, Boomer gratefully tells the two that unlike other pilots, she will repay Adama one day. Meanwhile, Baltar, believing that Caprica Six is a corporate spy, allows her access to the military defense mainframe. He says that he is not doing this for her employers, but for her.\n\nBack in the present of the series, Baltar decides to join the mission with Caprica Six at the last minute; she later admits to being proud of him for the first time. At that moment it is revealed that Baltar's Inner Six and Six's Inner Baltar are aware of each other, and the two real-life counterparts see both of them. [[Romo Lampkin]] ([[Mark Sheppard]]) is installed as president, and Hoshi (Brad Dryborough) is given command of the fleet while Adama and ''Galactica'' set off to rescue Hera. A battalion of the self-aware Cylon Centurions who are aligned with the fleet march down the flight deck  - red stripes painted diagonally on their chests to distinguish them from the others.\n\n''Galactica'' jumps right next to the colony, where they are immediately fired upon. Some of the Raptors, which are armed with [[nuclear weapon]]s, make a short jump into the debris field and fly toward the back of the colony; in the process, [[Margaret Edmondson|Racetrack]] ([[Leah Cairns]]) and Skulls (Collin Lawrence) are killed by an asteroid. Anders has been installed into the CIC computers, and disables the Colony hybrids (Tiffany Lyndall-Knight). Starbuck's Raptor, carrying Athena and Helo, lands on the Colony - the only Raptor to make it through - and they enter to search for Hera. ''Galactica'' rams straight into the colony, where a strike team led by Apollo rappels in from ''Galactica'' to search for Hera, eventually meeting with Starbuck's squad. Hera is rescued by Boomer, who kills [[Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)|Simon]] ([[Rick Worthy]]) and finds Starbuck's team. Boomer hands Hera over to [[Sharon Agathon|Athena]] ([[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]]) and tells her to \"tell the old man I owed him one.\"  After her daughter is returned, Athena kills Boomer.\n\n''Galactica'' is set upon by Cylon boarding parties arriving in \"platoon strength\", as reported to Tigh and Adama in the CIC. As Starbuck, Apollo, Athena and Helo return to the battlestar and make their way to CIC, they encounter a boarding party composed of Cavil's modern Centurions and original Cylon War models.  Hera runs away in the confusion. She is spotted by Roslin, who had a vision of her while assisting with [[triage]], and is able to hide her from the Cylons, until she disappears again. While Roslin gives chase, Baltar and Caprica Six also spot Hera and give chase as well. The chase parallels the Opera House vision shared between Athena, Roslin and Caprica Six.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Crossroads |episodelink=Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica) |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) |credits=[[Michael Rymer]] (director); [[Michael Taylor (screenwriter)|Michael Taylor]] (writer) |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=3 |number=19}}</ref> The chase ends in the CIC, where [[John Cavil|Cavil]] ([[Dean Stockwell]]) takes her hostage and demands to leave with Hera so she can be dissected and establish a method for Cylons to reproduce. Inner Six and Inner Baltar again appear jointly to Baltar, inspiring him to make the speech his entire life has led to, saying, among other things, that he sees angels,<ref name=\"The Final David Eick video blogs\">{{cite web | url=http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/?clip=10| title=Do You Believe in Angels? | publisher=Scifi.com | accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> and that a divine force (\"whether God or Gods\") has entwined the destinies of both sides. Tigh provides the final incentive, saying that the Final Five will give the Cylons back resurrection (a solution to the problem of Cylon extinction) if they vow to forever go separate ways from humanity and end their pursuit.  Combined, this convinces Cavil and Adama to end the war, Cavil gives Hera back and will let them leave in peace when the Final Five give the technology for resurrection.\n\n===Part 3===\nCavil calls a cease fire in preparation for the data download and the boarding parties retreat.  Roslin and Adama look on as the Final Five begin the download of the technology for resurrection, with Saul and [[Ellen Tigh]] ([[Kate Vernon]]), Tory Foster ([[Rekha Sharma]]) and [[Galen Tyrol]] ([[Aaron Douglas (actor)|Aaron Douglas]]) dipping their hands into [[Samuel Anders]]' ([[Michael Trucco]]) tank to transfer the data to the Colony. Ellen warns that during the download they will briefly have full knowledge of each other's memories and experiences.  Tory asks that all bygones be left bygones.  The download commences and the Final Five experience flashbacks to each other's lives on Earth and in the colonies.  Tyrol learns then that Tory murdered his wife, [[Cally Tyrol|Cally]], and kills her in revenge before the downloading is complete. Feeling betrayed, the Cylons resume fighting; after the other Cylons in CIC are killed, Cavil commits [[suicide]]. At the same instant, a chance rock strike in the debris field causes Racetrack's dead hand to fall on the launch button for her Raptor's nuclear weapons, which were primed for launch before the Raptor's crew was lost.  The missiles strike directly into the Colony, knocking it out of orbit.  With ''Galactica'' still tangled in the Colony and being dragged toward the singularity along with it, Adama orders Starbuck to jump the ship away, anywhere. In a flash of inspiration, Starbuck mutters \"[[All Along the Watchtower|there must be some kind of way out of here]]\" and enters coordinates into the computer as if she were playing the [[All Along the Watchtower|mysterious music notes]] which Hera had written. ''Galactica'' jumps away and out of danger, leaving the Colony to fall to its destruction within the black hole.<ref name=\"podcast\">{{cite podcast|url=http://media.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/mp3/421-423/bsg_ep421-423_FULL.mp3 |title=Podcast for \"Daybreak\" (56.3 MB) |website=[scifi.com] |publisher=[[Scifi.com]] |host=Ronald D Moore |accessdate=April 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324221120/http://media.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/mp3/421-423/bsg_ep421-423_FULL.mp3 |archivedate=March 24, 2009 }}</ref>  The war is over, and the Humans and their allies have prevailed.\n\n''Galactica'' arrives at Kara's mysterious coordinates, its final destination as the damage caused in the battle has rendered the ship incapable of surviving any further jumps. Miraculously, the ''Galactica'' finds itself in orbit around a moon, close to a habitable world: our own [[Earth]].\n\nHours later, the rest of the fleet joins ''Galactica'' at this new world.  Lee makes the unorthodox suggestion that they abandon their technology and start afresh, while Adama and others discover primitive humans already occupying the planet. Since finding Earth had always been the goal of the Colonial Fleet, Adama suggests they call this new planet \"Earth\". The survivors - ''Galactica's'' crew, the remaining inhabitants of the fleet, and the Cylon Twos, Sixes and Eights - take basic supplies and spread out across the planet - not to colonize and impose cities like the [[Twelve Colonies]], but to blend in with primitive early humans, adding their own human and humanoid Cylon \"genetics\" to the early humans. Anders takes control of their abandoned fleet and pilots it into the Sun, so that the new arrivals \"can give them the best part of ourselves... not the baggage... not the weapons... our hearts (rather than) our science\". The Rebel Cylons decide that their Centurions have earned their freedom, and give them control of the Basestar, which jumps away to parts unknown.  Baltar and Caprica Six are visited by their [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Head/Inner/Messenger Six|Inner messengers]], who inform them that their destinies - to save Hera - have been fulfilled, and the two decide to live out the rest of their lives together.\n\nWhile resting under a tree, Roslin suddenly begins to have difficulty breathing.  Adama quickly places her aboard a Raptor and says a short, final goodbye to Lee and Starbuck before taking off. While admiring the wildlife below and looking for a place to build a cabin for them, Roslin dies peacefully.  While Lee expresses his desire to venture off and explore the planet, Starbuck, her destiny as an Angel fulfilled, literally vanishes without a trace.  Lee promises to never forget her.  Tyrol decides to settle by himself on a remote northern island (implied to be the Scottish highlands). Helo ([[Tahmoh Penikett]]), Athena and Hera are reunited as a family. Tigh and Ellen stay with the rest of the survivors. Adama eventually finds the place where he will build the cabin, and buries Laura on a nearby hillside.\n\n===Epilogue===\n[[New York City]], 150,000 years later: humanity has reached the early 21st century, and the development of robotics and computerization continues unabated.

Inner Baltar reminds her \"It doesn't like that name,\" as the two stroll away.   The episode and series end with a montage showing the progress of robotics in modern society indicating that it all had happened before and still might happen again.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[Actroid]] at the [[Expo 2005]] in [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], Japan.

Selection of epoxies is based on their superior adhesion, permeability, purity, and corrosion- and stress-resistance properties.}}</ref> Epoxy resins, also known as '''polyepoxides''', are a class of reactive [[prepolymer]]s and [[polymer]]s which contain epoxide groups.\n\nEpoxy resins may be reacted ([[cross-linked]]) either with themselves through catalytic homopolymerisation, or with a wide range of co-reactants including polyfunctional amines, acids (and [[acid anhydride]]s), phenols, alcohols and [[thiols]] (usually called mercaptans). These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.\n\nReaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]ting [[polymer]], often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, [[fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] materials, and [[adhesive]]s for structural and other purposes.\n\n== Epoxy resins (prepolymers and monomers) ==\nMost of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with [[Hydroxy group|acidic hydroxy groups]] and [[epichlorohydrin]]:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis epoxide Epichlorohydrin.svg|400px|First the hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by dehydrohalogenation.]]\n:<small>First a hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by [[dehydrohalogenation]].</small>\n\nEpoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called [[Glycidol|glycidyl]]-based epoxy resins. The hydroxy group may be derived from [[aliphatic diol]]s, [[polyol]]s (polyether polyols), [[phenolic compounds]] or [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. Phenols can be compounds such as [[bisphenol A]] and [[novolak]]. Polyols can be compounds such as [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]]. Di- and polyols lead to diglycid polyethers. Dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid are used for diglycide ester resins. Instead of a hydroxy group, also the nitrogen atom of an [[amine]] or [[amide]] can be  reacted with epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe other production route for epoxy resins is the conversion of [[Aliphatic alkene|aliphatic]] or [[cycloaliphatic alkene]]s with [[peracid]]s:<ref name=\"Ullmann\" /><ref name=\"KunstChem\">[[Wolfgang Kaiser (Chemiker)|Wolfgang Kaiser]]: ''Kunststoffchemie f\u00fcr Ingenieure.'' 3. Aufl. Hanser, M\u00fcnchen 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-446-43047-1}}, S.&nbsp;437 ff.</ref>\n\n:[[File:Synthesis epoxide peracid.svg|500px]]\n\nAs can be seen, in contrast to glycidyl-based epoxy resins, this production of such epoxy monomers does not require an acidic hydrogen atom but an aliphatic double bond.\n\nThe epoxide group is also sometimes referred to as a ''oxirane'' group.\n\n===Bisphenol-based epoxy resins===\nThe most common epoxy resins are based on reacting [[epichlorohydrin]] (ECH) with [[bisphenol A]], \u00a0resulting in a different chemical substance known as [[bisphenol A diglycidyl ether]] (commonly known as BADGE or DGEBA). Bisphenol A-based resins are the most widely commercialised resins but also other [[Bisphenol|bisphenols]] are analogously reacted with epichlorohydrin, for example [[Bisphenol F]].\n\n:[[File:Diglycidether.svg|400px|Synthesis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether.]]\n:<small>In this two-stage reaction, epichlorohydrin is first added to bisphenol A (bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propoxy)bisphenol A is formed), then a bisepoxide is formed in a condensation reaction with a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide. The chlorine atom is released as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), the hydrogen atom as of water.</small>\n\nHigher molecular weight diglycidyl ethers (n \u2265 1) are formed by the reaction of the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether formed with further bisphenol A, this is called prepolymerization:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether higher Mw.svg|600px|Synthesis of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether with a high [[molar mass]].]]\n\nA product comprising a few repeat units (''n'' = 1 to 2) is a viscous, clear liquid; this is called a liquid epoxy resin. A product comprising more repeating units (''n'' = 2 to 30) is at room temperature a colourless solid, which is correspondingly referred to as solid epoxy resin.\n\nInstead of bisphenol A, other bisphenols (especially [[bisphenol F]]) or brominated bisphenols (e. g. [[tetrabromobisphenol A]]) can be used for the said [[epoxidation]] and prepolymerisation. [[Bisphenol F]] may undergo epoxy resin formation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. These resins typically have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gram than bisphenol A resins, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.\n\nImportant epoxy resins are produced from combining [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[bisphenol A]] to give [[bisphenol A diglycidyl ether]]s.\n[[File:Epoxy prepolymer chemical structure.png|thumb|300px|Structure of bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin: ''n'' denotes the number of polymerized subunits and is typically in the range from 0 to 25]]\nIncreasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. This route of synthesis is known as the \"taffy\" process. More modern manufacturing methods of higher molecular weight epoxy resins is to start with liquid epoxy resin (LER) and add a calculated amount of bisphenol A and then a catalyst is added and the reaction heated to circa {{convert|160|C|F}}. This process is known as \"advancement\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5521261.pdf |title=Epoxy resin mixtures containing advancement catalysts |website=freepatentsonline.com |language=en |access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>  As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a [[thermoplastic]]. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 \u2013 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and [[isocyanate]]s.\n\nEpoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials or an [[oligomer]], and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which then require melting to enable processing.\n\nAn important criterion for epoxy resins is the epoxide group content. This is expressed as the \"'''epoxide equivalent weight'''\", which is the ratio between the molecular weight of the monomer and the number of epoxide groups.\nThis parameter is used to calculate the mass of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] or near-stoichiometric quantities of hardener to achieve the best physical properties.\n\n===Novolac epoxy resin===\n[[File:Epoxyphenol-Novolak.svg|thumb|General structure of epoxyphenol novolak with ''n'' usually in the range from 0 to 4. The compound is present in the form of various [[Structural isomer|constitutional isomers]].]]\n\nNovolaks are produced by reacting [[phenol]] with [[methanal]] (formaldehyde). The reaction of [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[novolak]]s produces novolaks with [[Glycidol|glycidyl residues]], such as epoxyphenol novolak (EPN) or epoxycresol novolak (ECN). These highly viscous to solid resins typically carry 2 to 6 epoxy groups per molecule. By curing, highly cross-linked polymers with high temperature and chemical resistance but low mechanical flexibility are formed due to the high functionality of these resins.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">{{cite journal |author = Ha Q.

They are produced by the reaction of a cyclic alkene with a [[peracid]] (see above).<ref>L. Hammerton, ed. by Rebecca Dolbey: ''Recent Developments in Epoxy Resins.'' RAPRA Review Reports, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-85957-083-8}}, S.&nbsp;8.</ref>  Cycloaliphatic epoxides are characterised by their aliphatic structure, high oxirane content and the absence of chlorine, which results in low viscosity and (once cured) good weather resistance, low dielectric constants and high [[Glass transition|T<sub>g</sub>]]. However, aliphatic epoxy resins polymerize very slowly at room temperature, so higher temperatures and suitable accelerators are usually required. Because aliphatic epoxies have a lower electron density than aromatics, cycloaliphatic epoxies react less readily with nucleophiles than bisphenol A-based epoxy resins (which have aromatic ether groups). This means that conventional nucleophilic hardeners such as amines are hardly suitable for crosslinking. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are therefore usually homopolymerized thermally or UV-initiated in an electrophilic or cationic reaction. Due to the low dielectric constants and the absence of chlorine, cycloaliphatic epoxides are often used to encapsulate electronic systems, such as microchips or LEDs. They are also used for radiation-cured paints and varnishes. Due to their high price, however, their use has so far been limited to such applications.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nEpoxidized vegetable oils are formed by epoxidation of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] by reaction with peracids. In this case, the peracids can also be formed in situ by reacting carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide. Compared with LERs (liquid epoxy resins) they have very low viscosities. If, however, they are used in larger proportions as [[reactive diluent]]s, this often leads to reduced chemical and thermal resistance and to poorer mechanical properties of the cured epoxides. Large scale epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soy and lens oils are used to a large extent as secondary plasticizers and cost stabilizers for [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nAliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins of low molar mass (mono-, bi- or polyfunctional) are formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with aliphatic alcohols or polyols (glycidyl ethers are formed) or with aliphatic carboxylic acids (glycidyl esters are formed). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the formation of bisphenol A-diglycidyl ether. Also aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins usually have a low viscosity compared to aromatic epoxy resins. They are therefore added to other epoxy resins as [[reactive diluent]]s or as [[adhesion promoter]]s. Epoxy resins made of (long-chain) polyols are also added to improve tensile strength and impact strength.\n\nA related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays lower viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required. As aromaticity is not present in these materials as it is in Bisphenol A and F resins, the UV stability is considerably improved.\n\n=== Halogenated epoxy resins ===\nHalogenated epoxy resins are admixed for special properties, in particular brominated and fluorinated epoxy resins are used.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nBrominated bisphenol A is used when flame retardant properties are required, such as in some electrical applications (e.g. [[printed circuit board]]s). The tetrabrominated bisphenol A (TBBPA, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromophenyl)propane) or its diglycidyl ether, 2,2-bis[3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)phenyl]propane, can be added to the epoxy [[formulation]]. The formulation may then be reacted in the same way as pure bisphenol A. Some (non-crosslinked) epoxy resins with very high molar mass are added to engineering thermoplastics, again to achieve flame retardant properties.\n\nFluorinated epoxy resins have been investigated for some [[High-performance plastics|high performance applications]], such as the fluorinated diglycidether 5-heptafluoropropyl-1,3-bis[2-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)hexafluoro-2-propyl]benzene. As it has a low surface tension, it is added as a wetting agent (surfactant) for contact with glass fibres. Its reactivity to hardeners is comparable to that of bisphenol A. When cured, the epoxy resin leads to a thermosetting plastic with high chemical resistance and low water absorption. However, the commercial use of fluorinated epoxy resins is limited by their high cost and low T<sub>g</sub>.\n\n===Epoxy resin diluents===\nEpoxy resins diluents are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting materials may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10-200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as [[reactive diluent]]s. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term \u2018modified epoxy resin\u2019 to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents.\n\n===Glycidylamine epoxy resin===\nGlycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-''p''-aminophenol (functionality 3) and ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methane (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.\n\n==Curing epoxy resins==\n[[File:VernetzteEpoxidharze.svg|thumb|320px|right|Structure of a cured epoxy glue. The triamine hardener is shown in red, the resin in black. The resin's epoxide groups have reacted with the hardener and are not present anymore. The material is highly [[crosslink]]ed and contains many OH groups, which confer adhesive properties.]]\nIn general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process.<ref name=\"onepetro.org\">Hakiki, Farizal et al. (2015).

SPE/IATMI Asia Pacific Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition, 20\u201322 October, Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia. doi: [https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS 10.2118/176457-MS]</ref> Curing of epoxy resins is an [[exothermic reaction]] and in some cases produces sufficient heat to cause thermal degradation if not controlled.\n\nCuring may be achieved by reacting an epoxy with itself (homopolymerisation) or by forming a [[copolymer]] with polyfunctional curatives or '''hardeners'''. In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol < anhydride < aromatic amine < cycloaliphatic amine < aliphatic amine < thiol.\n\nWhile some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to {{cvt|150|C}} being common, and up to {{cvt|200|C}} for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the [[glass transition]] temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.\n\nHardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as '''latent hardeners'''. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.\n\nThe epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of [[accelerant|accelerators]]. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance.\n\n===Homopolymerisation===\nEpoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature for the curing process, so finds only niche applications industrially.\nEpoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for [[UV coating]]s).\n\n===Amines===\nPolyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an [[addition reaction]] with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.\nAliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type hardeners will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Overall reactivity potential for different hardeners can roughly be ordered; aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines, though aliphatic amines with steric hindrance near the amino groups may react as slowly as some of the aromatic amines. Slower reactivity allows longer working times for processors. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines were widely used as epoxy resin hardeners, due to the excellent end properties when mixed with a parent resin. Over the past few decades concern about the possible adverse health effects of many aromatic amines has led to increased use of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine alternatives. Amines are also blended, adducted and reacted to alter properties and these amine resins are more often used to cure epoxy resins than a pure amine such as TETA. increasingly, WATER BASED polyamines are also used to help reduce the toxicity profile among other reasons. \n[[File:N1,N1'-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(ethane-1,2-diamine) 200.svg|thumb|150px|Structure of [[Triethylenetetramine|TETA]], a typical hardener. The amine (NH2) groups react with the epoxide groups of the resin during polymerisation.]]\n\n===Anhydrides===\nEpoxy resins may be cured with cyclic anhydrides at elevated temperatures. Reaction occurs only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. A possible side reaction may also occur between the epoxide and hydroxyl groups, but this may suppressed by addition of tertiary amines.\nThe low viscosity and high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators.\n\n===Phenols===\nPolyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures ({{cvt|130|-|180|C|disp=comma}}), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for [[powder coating]]s.\n\n===Thiols===\nAlso known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. While the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical [[rock bolt]] [[Anchor bolt|anchors]]. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.\n\n==History==\nCondensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934.<ref>P. Schlack, I. G. Farbenindustrie, German Patent 676 117 (1938), US Patent 2 136 928 (1938).</ref> Claims of discovery of bisphenol-A-based epoxy resins include [[Pierre Castan]]<ref>{{cite patent |country= US |inventor= Pierre Castan |assignee= DeVoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds |number= 2444333 |gdate= 1948-06-29 |title= Process for the manufacture of thermosetting synthetic resins by the polymerization of alkylene oxide derivatives }}</ref> in 1943. Castan's work was licensed by [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]], Ltd. of Switzerland, which went on to become one of the three major epoxy resin producers worldwide. Ciba's epoxy business was spun off as Vantico in the late 1990s, which was subsequently sold in 2003 and became the Advanced Materials [[strategic business unit|business unit]] of [[Huntsman Corporation]] of the United States. In 1946, Sylvan Greenlee, working for the Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds Company, patented resin derived from bisphenol-A and epichlorohydrin.<ref>{{cite patent |country= US |inventor= Sylvan Owen Greenlee |assignee= DeVoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds |number= 2456408 |gdate= 1948-12-14 |title= Synthetic drying compositions }}</ref> Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds, which was active in the early days of the epoxy resin industry, was sold to [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Chemical]]; the division involved in this work was eventually sold, and via a series of other corporate transactions is now part of [[Hexion Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://epoxyflooringtech.com/history-of-epoxy-resin/|title=History of Epoxy Resin|website=epoxyflooringtech.com}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nThe applications for epoxy-based materials are extensive and include coatings, [[adhesive]]s and [[composite material]]s such as those using [[carbon fiber]] and [[fiberglass]] reinforcements (although [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinyl ester]], and other [[thermosetting polymer|thermosetting]] [[resin]]s are also used for glass-reinforced plastic). The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulating]] properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example [[silver]]-filled epoxies with good [[electrical conductivity]] are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.<ref>{{cite book|last=May |first=Clayton A. |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|location=New York|date=1987-12-23|edition=Second|page=794|isbn=0-8247-7690-9}}</ref>\n\nAs with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost. Use of blending, additives and fillers is often referred to as '''formulating''' (see: [[formulation]].\n\n=== Paints and coatings ===\nTwo part epoxy coatings were developed for heavy duty service on metal substrates and use less energy than heat-cured [[powder coating]]s. These systems provide a tough, protective coating with excellent hardness. One part epoxy coatings are formulated as an emulsion in water, and can be cleaned up without solvents.\n\nEpoxy coatings are often used in industrial and automotive applications since they are more heat resistant than latex-based and alkyd-based paints. Epoxy paints tend to deteriorate, known as \"chalking out\", due to UV exposure.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bayliss |first= D.A. |title= Steelwork corrosion control |year= 2002 |publisher= Spon |location= London |isbn= 978-0-415-26101-2 |pages= 13.6.6 Chalking |edition= 2nd |author2=Deacon, D.H.}}</ref>\n\n[[Polyester]] epoxies are used as [[powder coating]]s for washers, driers and other \"white goods\". [[Fusion bonded epoxy coating|Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings]] (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing [[rebar]]. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as [[Primer (paint)|primers]] to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where [[corrosion]] (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are [[acid]]ic. Another important epoxy application is to protect floors in industrial facilities, car parks or retail establishments  against mechanical wear, chemical attack and thermal stressing. Epoxy resins are also used for decorative flooring applications such as [[terrazzo]] flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.\nEpoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds . Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. \nOne of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.\n\nRecent  developments are coatings for onshore, marine and offshore protection, as well as shipping containers. Traditionally solvent-borne, solvent-free or high-solids, state of the art products are waterborne epoxy systems to protect customers\u2019 metal assets from corrosion. This includes waterborne epoxy resin system for making zinc-rich primers.\n\n=== Adhesives ===<!-- [[Epoxy adhesive]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Titan epoxy.jpg|thumb|right|Special epoxy is strong enough to withstand the forces between a [[surfboard]] fin and the fin mount. This epoxy is waterproof and capable of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] underwater. The blue-coloured epoxy on the left is still undergoing curing.]]\n\nEpoxy [[adhesive]]s are a major part of the class of adhesives called \"structural adhesives\" or \"engineering adhesives\" (that includes [[polyurethane]], [[Acryloyl group|acrylic]], [[cyanoacrylate]], and other chemistries.) These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature. The strength of epoxy adhesives is degraded at temperatures above {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.<ref name='jjmorena'>{{cite book|last=Morena |first=John J |title=Advanced Composite Mold Making|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.

Such epoxies are commonly used in [[optics]], [[optical fiber|fiber optics]], and [[optoelectronics]].\n\n=== Industrial tooling and composites ===\nEpoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce [[Molding (process)|molds]], master models, [[laminate]]s, [[casting]]s, [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and other industrial production aids. This \"plastic tooling\" replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and [[vinyl ester resin]]s, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant [[thermoset polymer matrix]] composite parts.\n\nMore details in the following chapters about Wind, Leisure & Marine and Aerospace applications.\n\n=== Wind Turbine Technology composites ===\nEpoxy resins are used as bonding matrix along with glass or carbon fiber fabrics to produce composites with very high strength to weight characteristics, allowing longer and more efficient rotor blades to be produced. In addition, for offshore and onshore wind energy installations, epoxy resins are used as protective coatings on steel towers, base struts and concrete foundations. Aliphatic polyurethane top coats are applied on top to ensure full UV protection, prolong operational lifetimes and lowering maintenance costs. Electric generators, connected via the drivetrain with the rotor blades, convert mechanical wind energy in usable electric energy, and rely on epoxies electrical insulation and high thermal resistance properties. The same applies to transformers, bushings, spacers, and composites cables connecting the windmills to the grid In Europe, wind energy components account for the largest segment of epoxy applications, about 27% of the market.<ref name=socio2013>[https://epoxy-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epoxy_Socioeconomic_Study_Main_Findings_August-2017.pdf Epoxy Resins Committee > Socioeconomic Analysis] 2013</ref>\n\n=== Electrical systems and electronics ===\n[[File:Hybridcircuit.jpg|thumb|An epoxy [[conformal coating|encapsulated]] [[hybrid circuit]] on a [[printed circuit board]].]]\n[[File:Citizen se-733 int 1ac.jpg|thumb|The interior of a pocket calculator. The dark lump of epoxy in the center covers the processor chip]]\n\nEpoxy resin formulations are important in the electronics industry, and are employed in motors, generators, transformers, switchgear, bushings, insulators, printed wiring boards (PWB), and semiconductor encapsulants. Epoxy resins are excellent electrical insulators and protect electrical components from short circuiting, dust and moisture. In the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding [[integrated circuit]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[hybrid circuit]]s, and making [[printed circuit boards]]. The largest volume type of circuit board\u2014an \"[[FR-4]] board\"\u2014is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards.\n\nFlexible epoxy resins are used for [[Potting (electronics)|potting]] transformers and inductors. By using vacuum impregnation on uncured epoxy, winding-to-winding, winding-to-core, and winding-to-insulator air voids are eliminated. The cured epoxy is an electrical insulator and a much better conductor of heat than air. Transformer and inductor hot spots are greatly reduced, giving the component a stable and longer life than unpotted product.\n\nEpoxy resins are applied using the technology of [[resin dispensing]].\n\n=== Petroleum & petrochemical ===\nEpoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine. The technique is named \"water shut-off treatment\".<ref name=\"onepetro.org\"/>\n\n=== Consumer and marine applications ===\nEpoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to [[UV]] light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.\n\nThere are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common [[polyester resins]], epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.\n\nNormal [[gelcoat]] formulated for use with [[polyester]] resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. \"Flocoat\" that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.\n\nEpoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used.<ref>Hakiki, F., Nuraeni, N., Salam, D.D., Aditya, W., Akbari, A., Mazrad, Z.A.I. and Siregar, S. [http://archives.datapages.com/data/ipa_pdf/2015/ipa15-se-025.htm Preliminary Study on Epoxy-Based Polymer for Water Shut-Off Application]. Paper IPA15-SE-025. Proceeding of The 39th IPA Conference and Exhibition, Jakarta, Indonesia, May 2015.</ref> The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic. Large quantities of mix will generate their own heat and greatly speed the reaction, so it is usual to mix small amounts which can be used quickly.\n\nWhile it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.\n\nEpoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in every case they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermo-setting plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the 'hardeners' tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.\n\nBy contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide ([[MEKP]]), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.\n\nAs adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) by proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.\n\n=== Aerospace applications ===\nIn the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include [[glass]], [[carbon]], [[Kevlar]], and [[boron]].\nEpoxies are also used as a structural [[glue]]. Materials like [[wood]], and others that are 'low-tech' are glued with epoxy resin. Epoxies generally out-perform most other resin types in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental degradation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/guide/resin-systems/epoxy-resins/ |title=Epoxy Resins |website=netcomposites.com |language=en |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Biology ===\nWater-soluble epoxies such as [[Durcupan]]<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A new embedding technique for electron microscopy, combining a water-soluble epoxy resin (Durcupan) with water-insoluble Araldite\n |author=St\u00e4ubli, W.\n |journal=The Journal of Cell Biology\n |volume=16\n |issue=1\n |pages=197\n |year=1963\n |publisher=Rockefeller Univ Press\n |url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/16/1/197.full.pdf\n |doi=10.1083/jcb.16.1.197|pmc=2106182\n |pmid=13978678\n }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A Modification of the Water-miscible Epoxy Resin \"Durcupan\" Embedding Method for Ultrathin Sectioning\n |author=Kushida, H.\n |journal=Journal of Electron Microscopy\n |volume=12\n |issue=1\n |pages=72\n |year=1963\n |publisher=Japan Society Microscopy\n |url=http://jmicro.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/1/72.extract }}\n</ref>\nare commonly used for [[electron microscope#Sample preparation|embedding]]\n[[electron microscope]] samples in plastic so they may be sectioned (sliced thin) with a [[microtome]] and then imaged.<ref>{{Cite news\n |title=Improvements in epoxy resin embedding methods\n |author=Luft, J.H.\n |journal=The Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology\n |volume=9\n |issue=2\n |pages=409\n |year=1961\n |publisher=Rockefeller Univ Press\n |url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/9/2/409.full.pdf }}\n</ref>\n\n===Art===\nEpoxy resin, mixed with [[pigment]], may be used as a painting [[Media (arts)#Painting|medium]], by pouring layers on top of each other to form a complete picture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCreight|first1=Tim|last2=Bsullak|first2=Nicole|title=Color on Metal: 50 Artists Share Insights and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nBQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1|year=2001|publisher=Guild Pub.|isbn=978-1-893164-06-2}}</ref> It is also used in jewelry, as a doming resin for decorations and labels, and in decoupage type applications for art, countertops, and tables.\n\n== Industry ==\nThe global epoxy resin market was valued at approximately $8 billion in 2016. The epoxy resin market is dominated by the Asia-Pacific region, which contributes 55.2% of the total market share. China is the major producer and consumer globally, consuming almost 35% of the global resin production. The global market is made up of approximately 50\u2013100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners. In Europe, about 323,000 tonnes of epoxy resin were manufactured in 2017 generating some \u20ac1,055 million in sales. Germany <ref name=socio2013 />  is the largest market for epoxy resins in Europe, followed by Italy, France, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Austria.\n\nThese commodity epoxy [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these [[raw material]]s. These companies are known as \"formulators\". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies\u2014by adding [[mineral]] fillers ([[talc]], [[silica]], [[alumina]], etc.), by adding flexibilizers, [[viscosity]] reducers, [[colorant]]s, thickeners, accelerators, [[adhesion]] promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations\u2014each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.\n\nThe raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely [[petroleum]] derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make [[epichlorohydrin]]).\n\n== Health risks ==\nThe primary risk associated with epoxy use is often related to the hardener component and not to the epoxy resin itself. Amine hardeners in particular are generally [[corrosive]], but may also be classed as [[toxic]] or [[carcinogenic]]/[[mutagenic]]. Aromatic amines present a particular health hazard (most are known or suspected carcinogens), but their use is now restricted to specific industrial applications, and safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines are commonly employed.\n\nLiquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as [[Irritation|irritant]] to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrpdf/rr079.pdf] An assessment of skin sensitisation by the use of epoxy resin in the construction industry, 2003</ref> Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an [[Allergy|allergic reaction]]. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of [[dermatitis]], particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms).

These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.\n\nReaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]ting [[polymer]], often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, [[fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] materials, and [[adhesive]]s for structural and other purposes.\n\n== Epoxy resins (prepolymers and monomers) ==\nMost of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with [[Hydroxy group|acidic hydroxy groups]] and [[epichlorohydrin]]:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis epoxide Epichlorohydrin.svg|400px|First the hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by dehydrohalogenation.]]\n:<small>First a hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by [[dehydrohalogenation]].</small>\n\nEpoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called [[Glycidol|glycidyl]]-based epoxy resins. The hydroxy group may be derived from [[aliphatic diol]]s, [[polyol]]s (polyether polyols), [[phenolic compounds]] or [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. Phenols can be compounds such as [[bisphenol A]] and [[novolak]]. Polyols can be compounds such as [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]]. Di- and polyols lead to diglycid polyethers. Dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid are used for diglycide ester resins. Instead of a hydroxy group, also the nitrogen atom of an [[amine]] or [[amide]] can be  reacted with epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe other production route for epoxy resins is the conversion of [[Aliphatic alkene|aliphatic]] or [[cycloaliphatic alkene]]s with [[peracid]]s:<ref name=\"Ullmann\" /><ref name=\"KunstChem\">[[Wolfgang Kaiser (Chemiker)|Wolfgang Kaiser]]: ''Kunststoffchemie f\u00fcr Ingenieure.'' 3.

Bisphenol A-based resins are the most widely commercialised resins but also other [[Bisphenol|bisphenols]] are analogously reacted with epichlorohydrin, for example [[Bisphenol F]].\n\n:[[File:Diglycidether.svg|400px|Synthesis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether.]]\n:<small>In this two-stage reaction, epichlorohydrin is first added to bisphenol A (bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propoxy)bisphenol A is formed), then a bisepoxide is formed in a condensation reaction with a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide. The chlorine atom is released as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), the hydrogen atom as of water.</small>\n\nHigher molecular weight diglycidyl ethers (n \u2265 1) are formed by the reaction of the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether formed with further bisphenol A, this is called prepolymerization:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether higher Mw.svg|600px|Synthesis of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether with a high [[molar mass]].]]\n\nA product comprising a few repeat units (''n'' = 1 to 2) is a viscous, clear liquid; this is called a liquid epoxy resin. A product comprising more repeating units (''n'' = 2 to 30) is at room temperature a colourless solid, which is correspondingly referred to as solid epoxy resin.\n\nInstead of bisphenol A, other bisphenols (especially [[bisphenol F]]) or brominated bisphenols (e. g. [[tetrabromobisphenol A]]) can be used for the said [[epoxidation]] and prepolymerisation. [[Bisphenol F]] may undergo epoxy resin formation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. These resins typically have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gram than bisphenol A resins, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.\n\nImportant epoxy resins are produced from combining [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[bisphenol A]] to give [[bisphenol A diglycidyl ether]]s.\n[[File:Epoxy prepolymer chemical structure.png|thumb|300px|Structure of bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin: ''n'' denotes the number of polymerized subunits and is typically in the range from 0 to 25]]\nIncreasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. This route of synthesis is known as the \"taffy\" process. More modern manufacturing methods of higher molecular weight epoxy resins is to start with liquid epoxy resin (LER) and add a calculated amount of bisphenol A and then a catalyst is added and the reaction heated to circa {{convert|160|C|F}}. This process is known as \"advancement\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5521261.pdf |title=Epoxy resin mixtures containing advancement catalysts |website=freepatentsonline.com |language=en |access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>  As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a [[thermoplastic]]. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 \u2013 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and [[isocyanate]]s.\n\nEpoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials or an [[oligomer]], and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which then require melting to enable processing.\n\nAn important criterion for epoxy resins is the epoxide group content. This is expressed as the \"'''epoxide equivalent weight'''\", which is the ratio between the molecular weight of the monomer and the number of epoxide groups.\nThis parameter is used to calculate the mass of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] or near-stoichiometric quantities of hardener to achieve the best physical properties.\n\n===Novolac epoxy resin===\n[[File:Epoxyphenol-Novolak.svg|thumb|General structure of epoxyphenol novolak with ''n'' usually in the range from 0 to 4. The compound is present in the form of various [[Structural isomer|constitutional isomers]].]]\n\nNovolaks are produced by reacting [[phenol]] with [[methanal]] (formaldehyde). The reaction of [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[novolak]]s produces novolaks with [[Glycidol|glycidyl residues]], such as epoxyphenol novolak (EPN) or epoxycresol novolak (ECN). These highly viscous to solid resins typically carry 2 to 6 epoxy groups per molecule. By curing, highly cross-linked polymers with high temperature and chemical resistance but low mechanical flexibility are formed due to the high functionality of these resins.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">{{cite journal |author = Ha Q.

They are produced by the reaction of a cyclic alkene with a [[peracid]] (see above).<ref>L. Hammerton, ed. by Rebecca Dolbey: ''Recent Developments in Epoxy Resins.'' RAPRA Review Reports, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-85957-083-8}}, S.&nbsp;8.</ref>  Cycloaliphatic epoxides are characterised by their aliphatic structure, high oxirane content and the absence of chlorine, which results in low viscosity and (once cured) good weather resistance, low dielectric constants and high [[Glass transition|T<sub>g</sub>]]. However, aliphatic epoxy resins polymerize very slowly at room temperature, so higher temperatures and suitable accelerators are usually required. Because aliphatic epoxies have a lower electron density than aromatics, cycloaliphatic epoxies react less readily with nucleophiles than bisphenol A-based epoxy resins (which have aromatic ether groups). This means that conventional nucleophilic hardeners such as amines are hardly suitable for crosslinking. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are therefore usually homopolymerized thermally or UV-initiated in an electrophilic or cationic reaction. Due to the low dielectric constants and the absence of chlorine, cycloaliphatic epoxides are often used to encapsulate electronic systems, such as microchips or LEDs. They are also used for radiation-cured paints and varnishes. Due to their high price, however, their use has so far been limited to such applications.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nEpoxidized vegetable oils are formed by epoxidation of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] by reaction with peracids. In this case, the peracids can also be formed in situ by reacting carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide. Compared with LERs (liquid epoxy resins) they have very low viscosities. If, however, they are used in larger proportions as [[reactive diluent]]s, this often leads to reduced chemical and thermal resistance and to poorer mechanical properties of the cured epoxides. Large scale epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soy and lens oils are used to a large extent as secondary plasticizers and cost stabilizers for [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nAliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins of low molar mass (mono-, bi- or polyfunctional) are formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with aliphatic alcohols or polyols (glycidyl ethers are formed) or with aliphatic carboxylic acids (glycidyl esters are formed). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the formation of bisphenol A-diglycidyl ether. Also aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins usually have a low viscosity compared to aromatic epoxy resins. They are therefore added to other epoxy resins as [[reactive diluent]]s or as [[adhesion promoter]]s. Epoxy resins made of (long-chain) polyols are also added to improve tensile strength and impact strength.\n\nA related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays lower viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required. As aromaticity is not present in these materials as it is in Bisphenol A and F resins, the UV stability is considerably improved.\n\n=== Halogenated epoxy resins ===\nHalogenated epoxy resins are admixed for special properties, in particular brominated and fluorinated epoxy resins are used.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nBrominated bisphenol A is used when flame retardant properties are required, such as in some electrical applications (e.g. [[printed circuit board]]s). The tetrabrominated bisphenol A (TBBPA, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromophenyl)propane) or its diglycidyl ether, 2,2-bis[3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)phenyl]propane, can be added to the epoxy [[formulation]]. The formulation may then be reacted in the same way as pure bisphenol A. Some (non-crosslinked) epoxy resins with very high molar mass are added to engineering thermoplastics, again to achieve flame retardant properties.\n\nFluorinated epoxy resins have been investigated for some [[High-performance plastics|high performance applications]], such as the fluorinated diglycidether 5-heptafluoropropyl-1,3-bis[2-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)hexafluoro-2-propyl]benzene. As it has a low surface tension, it is added as a wetting agent (surfactant) for contact with glass fibres. Its reactivity to hardeners is comparable to that of bisphenol A. When cured, the epoxy resin leads to a thermosetting plastic with high chemical resistance and low water absorption. However, the commercial use of fluorinated epoxy resins is limited by their high cost and low T<sub>g</sub>.\n\n===Epoxy resin diluents===\nEpoxy resins diluents are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting materials may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10-200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as [[reactive diluent]]s. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term \u2018modified epoxy resin\u2019 to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents.\n\n===Glycidylamine epoxy resin===\nGlycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-''p''-aminophenol (functionality 3) and ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methane (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.\n\n==Curing epoxy resins==\n[[File:VernetzteEpoxidharze.svg|thumb|320px|right|Structure of a cured epoxy glue. The triamine hardener is shown in red, the resin in black. The resin's epoxide groups have reacted with the hardener and are not present anymore. The material is highly [[crosslink]]ed and contains many OH groups, which confer adhesive properties.]]\nIn general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process.<ref name=\"onepetro.org\">Hakiki, Farizal et al. (2015).

In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol < anhydride < aromatic amine < cycloaliphatic amine < aliphatic amine < thiol.\n\nWhile some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to {{cvt|150|C}} being common, and up to {{cvt|200|C}} for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the [[glass transition]] temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.\n\nHardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as '''latent hardeners'''. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.\n\nThe epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of [[accelerant|accelerators]]. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance.\n\n===Homopolymerisation===\nEpoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature for the curing process, so finds only niche applications industrially.\nEpoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for [[UV coating]]s).\n\n===Amines===\nPolyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an [[addition reaction]] with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.\nAliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type hardeners will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Overall reactivity potential for different hardeners can roughly be ordered; aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines, though aliphatic amines with steric hindrance near the amino groups may react as slowly as some of the aromatic amines. Slower reactivity allows longer working times for processors. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines were widely used as epoxy resin hardeners, due to the excellent end properties when mixed with a parent resin. Over the past few decades concern about the possible adverse health effects of many aromatic amines has led to increased use of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine alternatives. Amines are also blended, adducted and reacted to alter properties and these amine resins are more often used to cure epoxy resins than a pure amine such as TETA. increasingly, WATER BASED polyamines are also used to help reduce the toxicity profile among other reasons. \n[[File:N1,N1'-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(ethane-1,2-diamine) 200.svg|thumb|150px|Structure of [[Triethylenetetramine|TETA]], a typical hardener. The amine (NH2) groups react with the epoxide groups of the resin during polymerisation.]]\n\n===Anhydrides===\nEpoxy resins may be cured with cyclic anhydrides at elevated temperatures. Reaction occurs only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. A possible side reaction may also occur between the epoxide and hydroxyl groups, but this may suppressed by addition of tertiary amines.\nThe low viscosity and high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators.\n\n===Phenols===\nPolyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures ({{cvt|130|-|180|C|disp=comma}}), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for [[powder coating]]s.\n\n===Thiols===\nAlso known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. While the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical [[rock bolt]] [[Anchor bolt|anchors]]. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.\n\n==History==\nCondensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934.<ref>P.

The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulating]] properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example [[silver]]-filled epoxies with good [[electrical conductivity]] are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.<ref>{{cite book|last=May |first=Clayton A. |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|location=New York|date=1987-12-23|edition=Second|page=794|isbn=0-8247-7690-9}}</ref>\n\nAs with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost. Use of blending, additives and fillers is often referred to as '''formulating''' (see: [[formulation]].\n\n=== Paints and coatings ===\nTwo part epoxy coatings were developed for heavy duty service on metal substrates and use less energy than heat-cured [[powder coating]]s. These systems provide a tough, protective coating with excellent hardness.

[[Fusion bonded epoxy coating|Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings]] (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing [[rebar]]. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as [[Primer (paint)|primers]] to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where [[corrosion]] (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are [[acid]]ic. Another important epoxy application is to protect floors in industrial facilities, car parks or retail establishments  against mechanical wear, chemical attack and thermal stressing. Epoxy resins are also used for decorative flooring applications such as [[terrazzo]] flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.\nEpoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds . Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. \nOne of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.\n\nRecent  developments are coatings for onshore, marine and offshore protection, as well as shipping containers. Traditionally solvent-borne, solvent-free or high-solids, state of the art products are waterborne epoxy systems to protect customers\u2019 metal assets from corrosion. This includes waterborne epoxy resin system for making zinc-rich primers.\n\n=== Adhesives ===<!-- [[Epoxy adhesive]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Titan epoxy.jpg|thumb|right|Special epoxy is strong enough to withstand the forces between a [[surfboard]] fin and the fin mount. This epoxy is waterproof and capable of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] underwater. The blue-coloured epoxy on the left is still undergoing curing.]]\n\nEpoxy [[adhesive]]s are a major part of the class of adhesives called \"structural adhesives\" or \"engineering adhesives\" (that includes [[polyurethane]], [[Acryloyl group|acrylic]], [[cyanoacrylate]], and other chemistries.) These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature. The strength of epoxy adhesives is degraded at temperatures above {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.<ref name='jjmorena'>{{cite book|last=Morena |first=John J |title=Advanced Composite Mold Making|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.

Such epoxies are commonly used in [[optics]], [[optical fiber|fiber optics]], and [[optoelectronics]].\n\n=== Industrial tooling and composites ===\nEpoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce [[Molding (process)|molds]], master models, [[laminate]]s, [[casting]]s, [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and other industrial production aids. This \"plastic tooling\" replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and [[vinyl ester resin]]s, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant [[thermoset polymer matrix]] composite parts.\n\n=== Wind Turbine Technology composites ===\nEpoxy resins are used as bonding matrix along with glass or carbon fiber fabrics to produce composites with very high strength to weight characteristics, allowing longer and more efficient rotor blades to be produced. In addition, for offshore and onshore wind energy installations, epoxy resins are used as protective coatings on steel towers, base struts and concrete foundations. Aliphatic polyurethane top coats are applied on top to ensure full UV protection, prolong operational lifetimes and lowering maintenance costs. Electric generators, connected via the drivetrain with the rotor blades, convert mechanical wind energy in usable electric energy, and rely on epoxies electrical insulation and high thermal resistance properties. The same applies to transformers, bushings, spacers, and composites cables connecting the windmills to the grid In Europe, wind energy components account for the largest segment of epoxy applications, about 27% of the market.<ref name=socio2013>[https://epoxy-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epoxy_Socioeconomic_Study_Main_Findings_August-2017.pdf Epoxy Resins Committee > Socioeconomic Analysis] 2013</ref>\n\n=== Electrical systems and electronics ===\n[[File:Hybridcircuit.jpg|thumb|An epoxy [[conformal coating|encapsulated]] [[hybrid circuit]] on a [[printed circuit board]].]]\n[[File:Citizen se-733 int 1ac.jpg|thumb|The interior of a pocket calculator. The dark lump of epoxy in the center covers the processor chip]]\n\nEpoxy resin formulations are important in the electronics industry, and are employed in motors, generators, transformers, switchgear, bushings, insulators, printed wiring boards (PWB), and semiconductor encapsulants. Epoxy resins are excellent electrical insulators and protect electrical components from short circuiting, dust and moisture. In the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding [[integrated circuit]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[hybrid circuit]]s, and making [[printed circuit boards]]. The largest volume type of circuit board\u2014an \"[[FR-4]] board\"\u2014is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards.\n\nFlexible epoxy resins are used for [[Potting (electronics)|potting]] transformers and inductors. By using vacuum impregnation on uncured epoxy, winding-to-winding, winding-to-core, and winding-to-insulator air voids are eliminated. The cured epoxy is an electrical insulator and a much better conductor of heat than air. Transformer and inductor hot spots are greatly reduced, giving the component a stable and longer life than unpotted product.\n\nEpoxy resins are applied using the technology of [[resin dispensing]].\n\n=== Petroleum & petrochemical ===\nEpoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine. The technique is named \"water shut-off treatment\".<ref name=\"onepetro.org\"/>\n\n=== Consumer and marine applications ===\nEpoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to [[UV]] light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.\n\nThere are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common [[polyester resins]], epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.\n\nNormal [[gelcoat]] formulated for use with [[polyester]] resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. \"Flocoat\" that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.\n\nEpoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used.<ref>Hakiki, F., Nuraeni, N., Salam, D.D., Aditya, W., Akbari, A., Mazrad, Z.A.I. and Siregar, S. [http://archives.datapages.com/data/ipa_pdf/2015/ipa15-se-025.htm Preliminary Study on Epoxy-Based Polymer for Water Shut-Off Application]. Paper IPA15-SE-025. Proceeding of The 39th IPA Conference and Exhibition, Jakarta, Indonesia, May 2015.</ref> The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic. Large quantities of mix will generate their own heat and greatly speed the reaction, so it is usual to mix small amounts which can be used quickly.\n\nWhile it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.\n\nEpoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in every case they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermo-setting plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the 'hardeners' tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.\n\nBy contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide ([[MEKP]]), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.\n\nAs adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) by proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.\n\n=== Aerospace applications ===\nIn the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include [[glass]], [[carbon]], [[Kevlar]], and [[boron]].\nEpoxies are also used as a structural [[glue]]. Materials like [[wood]], and others that are 'low-tech' are glued with epoxy resin. Epoxies generally out-perform most other resin types in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental degradation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/guide/resin-systems/epoxy-resins/ |title=Epoxy Resins |website=netcomposites.com |language=en |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Biology ===\nWater-soluble epoxies such as [[Durcupan]]<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A new embedding technique for electron microscopy, combining a water-soluble epoxy resin (Durcupan) with water-insoluble Araldite\n |author=St\u00e4ubli, W.\n |journal=The Journal of Cell Biology\n |volume=16\n |issue=1\n |pages=197\n |year=1963\n |publisher=Rockefeller Univ Press\n |url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/16/1/197.full.pdf\n |doi=10.1083/jcb.16.1.197|pmc=2106182\n |pmid=13978678\n }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A Modification of the Water-miscible Epoxy Resin \"Durcupan\" Embedding Method for Ultrathin Sectioning\n |author=Kushida, H.\n |journal=Journal of Electron Microscopy\n |volume=12\n |issue=1\n |pages=72\n |year=1963\n |publisher=Japan Society Microscopy\n |url=http://jmicro.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/1/72.extract }}\n</ref>\nare commonly used for [[electron microscope#Sample preparation|embedding]]\n[[electron microscope]] samples in plastic so they may be sectioned (sliced thin) with a [[microtome]] and then imaged.<ref>{{Cite news\n |title=Improvements in epoxy resin embedding methods\n |author=Luft, J.H.\n |journal=The Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology\n |volume=9\n |issue=2\n |pages=409\n |year=1961\n |publisher=Rockefeller Univ Press\n |url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/9/2/409.full.pdf }}\n</ref>\n\n===Art===\nEpoxy resin, mixed with [[pigment]], may be used as a painting [[Media (arts)#Painting|medium]], by pouring layers on top of each other to form a complete picture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCreight|first1=Tim|last2=Bsullak|first2=Nicole|title=Color on Metal: 50 Artists Share Insights and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nBQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1|year=2001|publisher=Guild Pub.|isbn=978-1-893164-06-2}}</ref> It is also used in jewelry, as a doming resin for decorations and labels, and in decoupage type applications for art, countertops, and tables.\n\n== Industry ==\nThe global epoxy resin market was valued at approximately $8 billion in 2016. The epoxy resin market is dominated by the Asia-Pacific region, which contributes 55.2% of the total market share. China is the major producer and consumer globally, consuming almost 35% of the global resin production. The global market is made up of approximately 50\u2013100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners. In Europe, about 323,000 tonnes of epoxy resin were manufactured in 2017 generating some \u20ac1,055 million in sales. Germany <ref name=socio2013 />  is the largest market for epoxy resins in Europe, followed by Italy, France, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Austria.\n\nThese commodity epoxy [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these [[raw material]]s. These companies are known as \"formulators\". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies\u2014by adding [[mineral]] fillers ([[talc]], [[silica]], [[alumina]], etc.), by adding flexibilizers, [[viscosity]] reducers, [[colorant]]s, thickeners, accelerators, [[adhesion]] promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations\u2014each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.\n\nThe raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely [[petroleum]] derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make [[epichlorohydrin]]).\n\n== Health risks ==\nThe primary risk associated with epoxy use is often related to the hardener component and not to the epoxy resin itself. Amine hardeners in particular are generally [[corrosive]], but may also be classed as [[toxic]] or [[carcinogenic]]/[[mutagenic]]. Aromatic amines present a particular health hazard (most are known or suspected carcinogens), but their use is now restricted to specific industrial applications, and safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines are commonly employed.\n\nLiquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as [[Irritation|irritant]] to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrpdf/rr079.pdf] An assessment of skin sensitisation by the use of epoxy resin in the construction industry, 2003</ref> Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an [[Allergy|allergic reaction]]. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of [[dermatitis]], particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). Epoxy use is a main source of [[occupational asthma]] among users of plastics.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/occupational-asthma/DS00591/DSECTION=risk-factors MayoClinic --> Occupational asthma] May 23, 2009</ref> [[Bisphenol A]], which is used to manufacture a common class of epoxy resins, is a known [[endocrine disruptor]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Thermosetting polymer]]\n* [[Thermoset polymer matrix]]\n* [[Plastic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220105252/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm Epoxy Resin health hazards] (California Department of Health Services) 21 April 2008 @ [[Wayback Machine]] [https://epoxi.es/2HfHeiX https://web.archive.org/web/20080421095718/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm]\n* [http://pslc.ws/macrog/epoxy.htm The chemistry of epoxide], simple to understand\n\n<!-- LocalWords: catalyzing epoxies -->\n\n[[Category:Organic polymers]]\n[[Category:Adhesives]]\n[[Category:Synthetic resins]]\n[[Category:Thermosetting plastics]]\n\n[[da:Kunstharpiks]]\n", "name_user": "HGChemEng", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIndustrial tooling and composites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy"}

Based on this, UCSF recommended 1 drop per 10 kg of body weight per visit.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nThe US FDA reviewed the dose limit based on all evidence for the US multi-centered clinical trial sponsored by the NIH and FDA run by UM, NYU, and UIowa, and set a dose limit of 260 \u00b5L for any patient 12 - 59 months old at the start of the study. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03649659.\n\n== Precautions and adverse effects ==\nThe main side effect of SDF is non-medical and is the prominent black staining of carious tooth tissue where the solution is applied.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Patel J, Anthonappa RP, King NM | title = Evaluation of the staining potential of silver diamine fluoride: in\u00a0vitro | journal = International Journal of Paediatric Dentistry | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 514\u2013522 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 29974546 | doi = 10.1111/ipd.12401 }}</ref>\n\nSDF will stain most things it touches, including skin, mucous membranes, clothing and work surfaces.

Silver nitrate followed by application of [[fluoride varnish]] was the only non-invasive option available for caries treatment before the advent for silver diamine fluoride (SDF). Cases of carious lesions treated and arrested by the application of silver nitrate date to 19th century.
