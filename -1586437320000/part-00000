When hostilities began, ''Richmond'', HM ships {{HMS|Chatham|F87|2}}, {{HMS|Marlborough|F233|2}} and {{HMAS|Anzac|FFH 150|6}} of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] provided Naval Gunfire Support (NGS) during the [[Royal Marines]]' [[2003 invasion of Iraq#Opening attack|amphibious assault of the Al Faw Peninsula]], the first amphibious assault by the Marines since the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. ''Richmond'' remained in the region at the war's end and returned home in August.\n\nIn July 2004, under the command of Commander [[Mike McCartain]], ''Richmond'' deployed on [[Atlantic Patrol Task (North)]], which encompasses the Atlantic and [[Caribbean]] regions. Two of the ports she visited early in the deployment were [[Jamaica]] and [[Belize]]. In September ''Richmond'' came to the assistance of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] when they were struck by [[Hurricane Frances]].  Turks and Caicos suffered only minimal damage to buildings. ''Richmond'' then sailed to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Netherlands Antilles]] where she resumed her maintenance period, which had been interrupted due to the hurricane, but remained on standby to provide assistance due to the imminent arrival of [[Hurricane Ivan]].\n\nHurricane Ivan eventually hit the region, causing significant damage and fatalities, particularly inflicting enormous damage and a number of fatalities to [[Grenada]], which included immense damage to the capital [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]]. ''Richmond'' and her accompanying [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] vessel {{ship|RFA|Wave Ruler|A390|2}} came to the assistance of the island. The extent of the damage in Grenada reached such levels that [[Keith Mitchell]], Prime Minister of Grenada, was forced to relocate to ''Richmond'' after his residence was destroyed by the hurricane. The Prime Minister effectively ran his country from ''Richmond'' for several hours.\n\nHer crew having performed vital assistance on land at Grenada, ''Richmond'' steamed at her top speed for Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to assist those territories in recovering from the ravages of Hurricane Ivan.\n\n''Richmond'' returned from her deployment in December 2004, and began a refit period at [[HMNB Portsmouth|HM Naval Base Portsmouth]] in mid-2005. The refit, undertaken by [[Fleet Support Limited]], was completed in late 2006 and ''Richmond'' was returned to the operational fleet in October 2006.

In 2002 she arrived in the Caribbean where she performed tasks including obligatory \"fly-the-flag\" duties to the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries in the region as well as undergoing trials. In June 2002, two officers were killed when ''Richmond''{{'}}s [[HMS Richmond helicopter crash|Lynx helicopter crashed]] off the coast of Virginia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2046318.stm |title=Navy investigators head for crash scene |date=15 June 2002 |website=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, under the command of Commander [[Wayne Keble]], she deployed to the [[Persian Gulf]] on [[Armilla Patrol]] where she relieved {{HMS|Cardiff|D108|6}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.3706/changeNav/3533 |title=News and Events |website=Royal Navy |accessdate=4 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> She had arrived shortly before the [[2003 Iraq War]]. When hostilities began, ''Richmond'', HM ships {{HMS|Chatham|F87|2}}, {{HMS|Marlborough|F233|2}} and {{HMAS|Anzac|FFH 150|6}} of the [[Royal Australian Navy]] provided Naval Gunfire Support (NGS) during the [[Royal Marines]]' [[2003 invasion of Iraq#Opening attack|amphibious assault of the Al Faw Peninsula]], the first amphibious assault by the Marines since the [[Falklands War]] in 1982. ''Richmond'' remained in the region at the war's end and returned home in August.\n\nIn July 2004, under the command of Commander [[Mike McCartain]], ''Richmond'' deployed on [[Atlantic Patrol Task (North)]], which encompasses the Atlantic and [[Caribbean]] regions. Two of the ports she visited early in the deployment were [[Jamaica]] and [[Belize]]. In September ''Richmond'' came to the assistance of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] when they were struck by [[Hurricane Frances]].  Turks and Caicos suffered only minimal damage to buildings. ''Richmond'' then sailed to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Netherlands Antilles]] where she resumed her maintenance period, which had been interrupted due to the hurricane, but remained on standby to provide assistance due to the imminent arrival of [[Hurricane Ivan]].\n\nHurricane Ivan eventually hit the region, causing significant damage and fatalities, particularly inflicting enormous damage and a number of fatalities to [[Grenada]], which included immense damage to the capital [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]]. ''Richmond'' and her accompanying [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] vessel {{ship|RFA|Wave Ruler|A390|2}} came to the assistance of the island. The extent of the damage in Grenada reached such levels that [[Keith Mitchell]], Prime Minister of Grenada, was forced to relocate to ''Richmond'' after his residence was destroyed by the hurricane. The Prime Minister effectively ran his country from ''Richmond'' for several hours.\n\nHer crew having performed vital assistance on land at Grenada, ''Richmond'' steamed at her top speed for Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to assist those territories in recovering from the ravages of Hurricane Ivan.\n\n''Richmond'' returned from her deployment in December 2004, and began a refit period at [[HMNB Portsmouth|HM Naval Base Portsmouth]] in mid-2005. The refit, undertaken by [[Fleet Support Limited]], was completed in late 2006 and ''Richmond'' was returned to the operational fleet in October 2006. With 44 major upgrades to her sensor and weapon systems, ''Richmond'' was at that time one of the most capable Type 23 frigates.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.fleet-support.co.uk/Docs/FirstBase/firstbase-winter2006.pdf |title=Fresh-faced ''Richmond'' re-dedicated to the Fleet |date=December 2006 |magazine=firstBASE |page=7 |publisher=[[HMNB Portsmouth]] |access-date=3 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809192438/http://www.fleet-support.co.uk/Docs/FirstBase/firstbase-winter2006.pdf |archive-date=9 August 2007}}</ref> From 5 to 12 July 2010 she anchored beside {{HMS|Belfast||6}} in London to foster the ship's relations with the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Borough of Richmond-upon-Thames]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4659 |title=HMS ''Richmond'' arrives in the Pool of London |date=5 July 2010 |website=London SE1 |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2011\u2013present===\n[[File:HMS Richmond at South Quay.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Richmond'' moored at South Quay in London in 2017]]\nIn 2011, she deployed to the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, the latter for upcoming [[Five Power Defence Arrangement]] exercises, specifically Exercise Bersama Shield 11.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/news/1215-richmond-enjoys-some-happy-torque-in-the-far-east.aspx |title=''Richmond'' enjoys some happy torque in the Far East |newspaper=[[Navy News]]}} {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> She assisted with anti-piracy operations with the EU Naval Force and was also a participant in the IMEX Asia 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/HmsRichmondDeploysOnCounterpiracyMission.htm |author=Ministry of Defence |title=HMS ''Richmond'' deploys on counter-piracy mission  |date=5 January 2011 |website=[[Gov.uk]] |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cornwallcommunitynews.co.uk/2011/05/10/navy-take-on-pirates-real-ones/ |title=Navy Takes On Pirates (Real Ones) |date=10 May 2011 |website=Cornwall Community News |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513134031/http://www.cornwallcommunitynews.co.uk/2011/05/10/navy-take-on-pirates-real-ones/ |archive-date=13 May 2011}}</ref> After Singapore, she rendered honours to the fallen of [[Force Z]] (see the [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|Sinking of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navynews.co.uk/news/1203-richmond-honours-the-dead-of-force-z.aspx |title=''Richmond'' honours the dead of Force Z |newspaper=Navy News}} {{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref>\n\nShe took part in exercise FRUKUS 2011 with ships from the [[United States Navy]] and [[Russian Navy]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/06/01/51118143.html |title=Russian warship heads out for joint maneuvers |date=1 June 2011 |website=[[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]] |access-date=1 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906022428/http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/06/01/51118143.html |archive-date=6 September 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn early August 2013, she deployed under the command of Commander Robert G.

The feudal dynasties always considered [[agriculture]] as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on [[physiocracy]]. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] were constructed in the [[Red River Delta]] to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term ''con bu\u00f4n''. The national economy was self-sufficient.\n\nFrom the 16th century, [[Confucianism]] was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary economy began to develop. Early commercial ports, such as [[H\u1ed9i An]], were constrained, and foreign countries with their different cultures and their invasion ambitions were seen as a threat. This policy of closure led to a degree of stagnation in the Vietnamese economy, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== 1858\u20131975 ===\nUntil the [[French Indochina|French colonization]] in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the [[Cochinchina|South]] for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the [[Tonkin|North]] for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports\u2014coal from the North, rice from the South\u2014and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.<ref name=\"cs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html Vietnam country study]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 1987). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].</ref>\n\nThe separation distorted the basic Vietnamese economy by overly stressing regional economic differences. In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi;  railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy - Historical Background|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the North and South were divided [[Geneva Conference (1954)|politically]] in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: communism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the [[Second Indochina War]] from 1954 to 1975 seriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country's 1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1 million refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals, technicians and skilled workers.<ref name=\"cs\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+GDP per capita in Vietnam, 1956\u20131974 (in US$/year)\n!Year\n!1956\n!1958\n!1960\n!1962\n!1964\n!1966\n!1968\n!1970\n!1972\n!1974\n|-\n|[[Republic of Vietnam]]\n|62\n|88\n|105\n|100\n|118\n|100\n|85\n|81\n|90\n|65\n|-\n|[[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]\n|40\n|50\n|51\n|68\n|59\n|60\n|55\n|60\n|60\n|65\n|}\n\n=== 1976\u20131997 ===\nThe government's [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam#The Second Five-Year Plan (1976\u201380)|Second Five-Year Plan]] (1976\u20131981) aimed for extraordinarily high{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} annual growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and sought to integrate the North and the South, but the goals were not attained.

Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed international aid for reconstruction).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/45.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref> \n\nReminder: \n\nVietnam's occupation of Cambodia came [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/khmer-rouge-topple-dominates-cambodian-politics-40-years-190106235355551.html after the defeating the Khmer Rouge.]  \n\n[[Allegations of United States support for the Khmer Rouge|The Khmer Rouge were a genocidal regime supported by the United States.]] \n\nSubsequently, '''having lost <u>twice</u> to Vietnam''': \n\n\"[The United States].... employed its ''de facto'' veto at the World Bank, IMF, and Asian Development Bank in order to block all multilateral financial lending to [Vietnam].\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Vietnam was a member of the [[Comecon]], and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies.

''\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi'' combined government planning with [[free-market]] incentives and encouraged the establishment of private businesses and foreign investment, including [[Foreign direct investment|foreign-owned enterprises]].

The BTA provided for \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) status of Vietnamese goods in the U.S. market. It was expected that access to the U.S. market would allow Vietnam to hasten its transformation into a [[manufacturing]]-based, [[export]]-oriented economy. Furthermore, it would attract foreign investment, not only from the U.S., but also from [[Europe]], Asia and other regions.\n\nIn 2001, the ruling [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] approved a 10-year economic plan that enhanced the role of the private sector, while reaffirming the primacy of the state.<ref name=\"cp\"/> Growth then rose to 6% to 7% between 2000 and 2002 even in the midst of the global [[recession]], making it the world's second fastest-growing economy.

However, the WTO accession also brought serious challenges, requiring the economy to open up to increasing foreign competition.\n\nVietnam's economy continues to expand at an annual rate in excess of 7%, one of the fastest-growing in the world, but it grew from an extremely low base, as it suffered the crippling effect of the [[Vietnam War]] from the 1950s to the 1970s, as well as the austerity measures introduced in its aftermath.<ref name=\"cp\"/> In 2012, the communist party was forced to apologise about the mismanagement of the economy after large numbers of SOEs went bankrupt and inflation rose.

The main destinations of Vietnam's exports were the [[United States]] (18.8%), [[Japan]] (13.2%), [[China]] (10.3%), [[Australia]] (6.9%), [[Singapore]] (5.2%), [[Germany]] (4.0%), and the [[United Kingdom]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nIn 2012, export rose 18.2%, valued at US$114.57 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/> Vietnam's main export market included the [[European Union|EU]] with US$20 billion, United States with US$19 billion, [[ASEAN]] with $US 17.8 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.9 billion, [[China]] with US$14.2 billion, and [[South Korea]] with US$7 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|title=T\u1ea1p ch\u00ed C\u1ed9ng S\u1ea3n - Xu\u1ea5t, nh\u1eadp kh\u1ea9u c\u1ee7a Vi\u1ec7t Nam n\u0103m 2012 - k\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 v\u00e0 nh\u1eefng v\u1ea5n \u0111\u1ec1 \u0111\u1eb7t ra|access-date=3 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106070648/http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|archivedate=6 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, exports rose 15.4%, valued at US$132.17 billion, of which export of electronics now comprised 24.5% of total export, compared with a 4.4% in 2008. Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam's export, valued about US$17.9 billion in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, exports rose 13.6%, reaching US$150.1 billion. Electronics and electronics parts, textiles and garments, computers and computer parts are the three main export groups of Vietnam. The [[United States]] continued to be Vietnam's largest export market, with US$28.5 billion. The [[EU]] is second with US$27.9 billion, [[ASEAN]] is third, [[China]] is fourth and [[Japan]] is the fifth largest export market of Vietnam.\n\n====Imports====\nIn 2004 Vietnam's merchandise [[import]]s were valued at US$31.5 billion, and growing rapidly. Vietnam's principal imports were machinery (17.5%), refined petroleum (11.5%), steel (8.3%), material for the textile industry (7.2%), and cloth (6.0%). The main origins of Vietnam's imports were China (13.9%), [[Taiwan]] (11.6%), [[Singapore]] (11.3%), [[Japan]] (11.1%), [[South Korea]] (10.4%), [[Thailand]] (5.8%), and [[Malaysia]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam import rose 6.6% in 2012, valued at US$113.79 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/>  Major import countries were [[China]] US$29.2 billion, [[ASEAN]] with US$22.3 billion, [[South Korea]] with US$16.2 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.7 billion, [[European Union|EU]] with US$10 billion, and United States with US$6.3 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\"/>\n\nIn 2014, imports rose 12.1%, reaching US$148 billion, most of which are materials and machinery needed for export.

By December 2004, about 58% had been dispersed. About half of FDI has been directed at the two major cities (and environs) of Ho Chi Minh City and [[Hanoi]]. In 2003 new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and [[construction]]. Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation and communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of 7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the [[Japan External Trade Organization]] of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment, according to the U.S. State Department. Vietnam tied with several nations for the 102nd place in Transparencies International's Corruption Perceptions Index in 2004.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives: to support Vietnam's transition to a market economy, to enhance equitable and [[sustainable development]] and to promote good governance. From 1993 through 2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of [[official development assistance]] (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49%, has been disbursed. In 2004, international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65 billion actually was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80% of disbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.

So from a theoretical and practical view industrialization and modernization are a necessary historical process that Vietnam must go through change our country into an industrial country [\u2026]\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n====Socialist-Oriented Market Economy (SOME)====\n''\u201cThe nature of a socialist-oriented market economy in our country:\n\u2022\tIt is not an economy managed according in the style of a centralized bureaucratic subsidized system\n\u2022\tIt is not a free market capitalist economy\n\u2022\tIt is not yet entirely a socialist-oriented economy. This is because our country is in the period of transition to socialism, and there is still a mixture of, and a struggle between, the old and the new, so there simultaneously are, and are not yet sufficiently, socialist factors\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n===Development strategy===\n====Trade liberalization====\nOver the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customs.gov.vn/Lists/ThongKeHaiQuan/Default.aspx|title=Chuy\u00ean trang Th\u1ed1ng k\u00ea H\u1ea3i quan :: H\u1ea3i quan Vi\u1ec7t Nam|website=www.customs.gov.vn}}</ref> Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)\n\n====Domestic reform====\nThe government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018/|title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006 . In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings,<ref>http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2018-Full-Report.pdf</ref> Viet Nam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.\n\n====Human and physical capital investment====\nVietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population \u2013 96 million today, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35\u2013 Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessity like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operation in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of international business community.\n\n====Sustainable growth====\nCompare to other developing countries, the economic growth in Vietnam was considered to be fairly inclusive and equitable. The Inclusive Development Index<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-inclusive-development-index-2018/|title=The Inclusive Development Index 2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011-2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.\n\nIn 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the \"One Strategic Plan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/topics/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable Development Goals}}</ref> integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs.

Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy. Almost all Vietnamese enterprises are small and medium enterprises ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]). Vietnam has become a leading agricultural exporter and served as an attractive destination for foreign investment in [[Southeast Asia]].

The feudal dynasties always considered [[agriculture]] as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on [[physiocracy]]. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] were constructed in the [[Red River Delta]] to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term ''con bu\u00f4n''. The national economy was self-sufficient.\n\nFrom the 16th century, [[Confucianism]] was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary economy began to develop. Early commercial ports, such as [[H\u1ed9i An]], were constrained, and foreign countries with their different cultures and their invasion ambitions were seen as a threat. This policy of closure led to a degree of stagnation in the Vietnamese economy, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== 1858\u20131975 ===\nUntil the [[French Indochina|French colonization]] in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the [[Cochinchina|South]] for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the [[Tonkin|North]] for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports\u2014coal from the North, rice from the South\u2014and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.<ref name=\"cs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html Vietnam country study]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 1987). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].</ref>\n\nThe separation distorted the basic Vietnamese economy by overly stressing regional economic differences. In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi;  railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy - Historical Background|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the North and South were divided [[Geneva Conference (1954)|politically]] in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: communism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the [[Second Indochina War]] from 1954 to 1975 seriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country's 1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1 million refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals, technicians and skilled workers.<ref name=\"cs\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+GDP per capita in Vietnam, 1956\u20131974 (in US$/year)\n!Year\n!1956\n!1958\n!1960\n!1962\n!1964\n!1966\n!1968\n!1970\n!1972\n!1974\n|-\n|[[Republic of Vietnam]]\n|62\n|88\n|105\n|100\n|118\n|100\n|85\n|81\n|90\n|65\n|-\n|[[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]\n|40\n|50\n|51\n|68\n|59\n|60\n|55\n|60\n|60\n|65\n|}\n\n=== 1976\u20131997 ===\nThe government's [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam#The Second Five-Year Plan (1976\u201380)|Second Five-Year Plan]] (1976\u20131981) aimed for extraordinarily high{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} annual growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and sought to integrate the North and the South, but the goals were not attained.

Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed international aid for reconstruction).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/45.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref> \n\nReminder: \n\nVietnam's occupation of Cambodia came after the defeating the Khmer er Rouge,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/khmer-rouge-topple-dominates-cambodian-politics-40-years-190106235355551.html|title=Khmer Rouge Topple Dominates Cambodian Politics 40 Years On|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> [[Allegations of United States support for the Khmer Rouge|a genocidal regime supported by the United States.

''\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi'' combined government planning with [[free-market]] incentives and encouraged the establishment of private businesses and foreign investment, including [[Foreign direct investment|foreign-owned enterprises]]. Furthermore, the Vietnam government stressed the necessity to lower birth rates when developing the economic and social rights of the population by implementing a policy that restricted the number of children per household to two, called the [[two-child policy]].<ref name=\"Policy 1989\">{{cite journal|title=Vietnam's New Fertility Policy|journal=Population and Development Review|date=March 1989|volume=15|issue=1|pages=169\u2013172|doi=10.2307/1973424|jstor=1973424|last1=&#91;Council Of Ministers&#93;}}</ref> By the late 1990s, the success of the business and agricultural reforms ushered in under ''\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi'' was evident.

In 1999, exports accounted for 40% of GDP, an impressive performance in the midst of the economic crisis that hit other countries in Asia.

The economy saw continuous real GDP growth of at least 5% since 2000.\n\nThe signing of the [[Bilateral Trade Agreement]] (BTA) between the United States and Vietnam on July 13, 2000, was a significant milestone. The BTA provided for \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) status of Vietnamese goods in the U.S. market. It was expected that access to the U.S. market would allow Vietnam to hasten its transformation into a [[manufacturing]]-based, [[export]]-oriented economy. Furthermore, it would attract foreign investment, not only from the U.S., but also from [[Europe]], Asia and other regions.\n\nIn 2001, the ruling [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] approved a 10-year economic plan that enhanced the role of the private sector, while reaffirming the primacy of the state.<ref name=\"cp\"/> Growth then rose to 6% to 7% between 2000 and 2002 even in the midst of the global [[recession]], making it the world's second fastest-growing economy. At the same time, [[investment]] grew threefold and [[domestic savings]] quintupled.\n\nIn 2003, the private sector accounted for more than one-quarter of all industrial output.<ref name=\"cp\"/> However, between 2003 and 2005, Vietnam fell dramatically in the [[World Economic Forum]]'s global competitiveness report rankings, largely due to negative perceptions of the effectiveness of government institutions.<ref name=\"cp\"/> Official [[political corruption|corruption]] is endemic, and Vietnam lags in property rights, efficient regulation of markets, and labor and financial market reforms.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam had an average GDP growth of 7.1% a year from 2000 to 2004. The GDP growth was 8.4% in 2005, the second-largest in Asia, trailing only [[China]]'s. The government estimated that GDP grew in 2006 by 8.17%.

However, the WTO accession also brought serious challenges, requiring the economy to open up to increasing foreign competition.\n\nVietnam's economy continues to expand at an annual rate in excess of 7%, one of the fastest-growing in the world, but it grew from an extremely low base, as it suffered the crippling effect of the [[Vietnam War]] from the 1950s to the 1970s, as well as the austerity measures introduced in its aftermath.<ref name=\"cp\"/> In 2012, the communist party was forced to apologise about the mismanagement of the economy after large numbers of SOEs went bankrupt and inflation rose.

The main destinations of Vietnam's exports were the [[United States]] (18.8%), [[Japan]] (13.2%), [[China]] (10.3%), [[Australia]] (6.9%), [[Singapore]] (5.2%), [[Germany]] (4.0%), and the [[United Kingdom]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nIn 2012, export rose 18.2%, valued at US$114.57 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/> Vietnam's main export market included the [[European Union|EU]] with US$20 billion, United States with US$19 billion, [[ASEAN]] with $US 17.8 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.9 billion, [[China]] with US$14.2 billion, and [[South Korea]] with US$7 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|title=T\u1ea1p ch\u00ed C\u1ed9ng S\u1ea3n - Xu\u1ea5t, nh\u1eadp kh\u1ea9u c\u1ee7a Vi\u1ec7t Nam n\u0103m 2012 - k\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 v\u00e0 nh\u1eefng v\u1ea5n \u0111\u1ec1 \u0111\u1eb7t ra|access-date=3 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106070648/http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|archivedate=6 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, exports rose 15.4%, valued at US$132.17 billion, of which export of electronics now comprised 24.5% of total export, compared with a 4.4% in 2008. Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam's export, valued about US$17.9 billion in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, exports rose 13.6%, reaching US$150.1 billion. Electronics and electronics parts, textiles and garments, computers and computer parts are the three main export groups of Vietnam. The [[United States]] continued to be Vietnam's largest export market, with US$28.5 billion. The [[EU]] is second with US$27.9 billion, [[ASEAN]] is third, [[China]] is fourth and [[Japan]] is the fifth largest export market of Vietnam.\n\n====Imports====\nIn 2004 Vietnam's merchandise [[import]]s were valued at US$31.5 billion, and growing rapidly. Vietnam's principal imports were machinery (17.5%), refined petroleum (11.5%), steel (8.3%), material for the textile industry (7.2%), and cloth (6.0%). The main origins of Vietnam's imports were China (13.9%), [[Taiwan]] (11.6%), [[Singapore]] (11.3%), [[Japan]] (11.1%), [[South Korea]] (10.4%), [[Thailand]] (5.8%), and [[Malaysia]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam import rose 6.6% in 2012, valued at US$113.79 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/>  Major import countries were [[China]] US$29.2 billion, [[ASEAN]] with US$22.3 billion, [[South Korea]] with US$16.2 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.7 billion, [[European Union|EU]] with US$10 billion, and United States with US$6.3 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\"/>\n\nIn 2014, imports rose 12.1%, reaching US$148 billion, most of which are materials and machinery needed for export.

The [[ASEAN]] is second with US$23.1 billion, [[South Korea]] is third, [[Japan]] is fourth and the [[EU]] is the fifth largest import partner of Vietnam.\n\n===External debt, foreign aid and foreign investment===\n{{See also|Foreign aid to Vietnam}}\nIn 2004, external debt amounted to US$16.6 billion, or 37% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/444743/gross-domestic-product-gdp-per-capita-in-vietnam/|title=Vietnam- Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita 2020 - Statistic|author=|date=|website=Statista|access-date=5 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nFrom 1988 to December 2004, cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI) commitments totaled US$46 billion. By December 2004, about 58% had been dispersed. About half of FDI has been directed at the two major cities (and environs) of Ho Chi Minh City and [[Hanoi]]. In 2003 new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and [[construction]]. Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation and communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of 7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the [[Japan External Trade Organization]] of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment, according to the U.S. State Department. Vietnam tied with several nations for the 102nd place in Transparencies International's Corruption Perceptions Index in 2004.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives: to support Vietnam's transition to a market economy, to enhance equitable and [[sustainable development]] and to promote good governance. From 1993 through 2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of [[official development assistance]] (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49%, has been disbursed. In 2004, international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65 billion actually was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80% of disbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hopes to receive US$14 billion to US$15 billion of ODA.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nPledged foreign direct investment US$21.3 billion for 2007 and a record US$31.6 billion for the first half of 2008.<ref name=\"IHT1\"/> Mergers and acquisitions have gradually become an important channel of investments in the economy, especially after 2005.\n\n===Free trade agreements===\n* [[ASEAN Free Trade Area]] (AFTA)\n* [[ASEAN\u2013Australia\u2013New Zealand Free Trade Area]] (AANZFTA) is a free trade area between ASEAN and [[ANZCERTA]], signed on 27 February 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseansec.org/22255.htm|title=Welcome To The World Of Smokeless Cigarettes!|last=atinder|access-date=23 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527152141/http://www.aseansec.org/22255.htm|archivedate=27 May 2013}}</ref> and coming into effect on 1 January 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.15thaseansummit-th.org/PDF/25-01_2.4outcome_AANZFTA.pdf|title=ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand Leaders' Statement: Entry into Force of the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area 25 October 2009, Cha am Hua Hin, Thailand|access-date=3 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929174055/http://www.15thaseansummit-th.org/PDF/25-01_2.4outcome_AANZFTA.pdf|archivedate=29 September 2015}}</ref> Details of the AANZFTA agreement are available online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.fta.govt.nz/|title=ASEAN - Australia - New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) - ASEAN - Australia - New Zealand Free Trade Agreement|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n* [[ASEAN\u2013China Free Trade Area]] (ACFTA), in effect as of 1 January 2010<ref name=\"Pushpanathan\">{{Cite news| last = Pushpanathan | first = Sundram | title = ASEAN Charter: One year and going strong | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/12/22/asean-charter-one-year-and-going-strong.html | work = [[The Jakarta Post]] | date = 22 December 2009 | accessdate = 1 January 2010}}</ref>\n* [[ASEAN\u2013India Free Trade Area]] (AIFTA), in effect as of 1 January 2010<ref name=\"Pushpanathan\"/>\n* [[ASEAN\u2013Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership]] (AJCEP)\n* [[ASEAN\u2013Korea Free Trade Area]] (AKFTA), in effect as of 1 January 2010<ref name=\"Pushpanathan\"/>\n* [[Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia]]\n* [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]].\n* On 29 May 2015, Vietnam signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with [[Eurasian Economic Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/vietnam-new-trade-agreement-with-eurasia-economic-union/|title=Vietnam: New Trade Agreement with Eurasia Economic Union - Global Legal Monitor|author=|date=16 June 2015|website=www.LOC.gov|access-date=5 May 2017}}</ref>\n* On 2 December 2015, the EU and Vietnam announced the conclusion of the negotiations for an EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).<ref>{{cite web|title=Vietnam|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/vietnam/|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Vietnam-Chile Free Trade Agreement]] (VCFTA) came into effect on 1 January 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtocenter.vn/fta/190-vietnam-chile/1|title=Vietnam - Chile - WTO and International trade Policies|website=WTOCenter.vn|access-date=5 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513212731/http://wtocenter.vn/fta/concluded/vietnam-chile|archive-date=2017-05-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Vietnam-Korea Free Trade Agreement]] (VKFTA) came into effect on 20 December 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtocenter.vn/fta/189-vietnam-south-korea/1|title=Vietnam - Korea - WTO and International trade Policies|website=WTOCenter.vn|access-date=5 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520075539/http://wtocenter.vn/fta/negotiations/vietnam-korea|archive-date=2017-05-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Japan-Vietnam Economic Partnership Agreement]] came into effect on 1 October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtocenter.vn/fta/187-vietnam-japan/1|title=Vietnam - Japan - WTO and International trade Policies|website=WTOCenter.vn|access-date=5 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513212740/http://wtocenter.vn/fta/concluded/vietnam-japan|archive-date=2017-05-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Economic development strategy==\n===Guiding principle===\n====Industrialization and Modernization (IM)====\n''\u201cIndustrialization and modernization is a process of fundamental and all-rounded change of production, business, services and social and economic management from the predominant use of artisanal labor to a predominant use of labor power17 with technology, methods and ways of working that are advanced, modern and rely upon the development of industry and scientific \u2013 technical progress to create high labor productivity. So from a theoretical and practical view industrialization and modernization are a necessary historical process that Vietnam must go through change our country into an industrial country [\u2026]\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n====Socialist-Oriented Market Economy (SOME)====\n''\u201cThe nature of a socialist-oriented market economy in our country:\n\u2022\tIt is not an economy managed according in the style of a centralized bureaucratic subsidized system\n\u2022\tIt is not a free market capitalist economy\n\u2022\tIt is not yet entirely a socialist-oriented economy. This is because our country is in the period of transition to socialism, and there is still a mixture of, and a struggle between, the old and the new, so there simultaneously are, and are not yet sufficiently, socialist factors\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n===Development strategy===\n====Trade liberalization====\nOver the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customs.gov.vn/Lists/ThongKeHaiQuan/Default.aspx|title=Chuy\u00ean trang Th\u1ed1ng k\u00ea H\u1ea3i quan :: H\u1ea3i quan Vi\u1ec7t Nam|website=www.customs.gov.vn}}</ref> Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)\n\n====Domestic reform====\nThe government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018/|title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006 . In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings,<ref>http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2018-Full-Report.pdf</ref> Viet Nam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.\n\n====Human and physical capital investment====\nVietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population \u2013 96 million today, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35\u2013 Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessity like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operation in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of international business community.\n\n====Sustainable growth====\nCompare to other developing countries, the economic growth in Vietnam was considered to be fairly inclusive and equitable. The Inclusive Development Index<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-inclusive-development-index-2018/|title=The Inclusive Development Index 2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011-2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.\n\nIn 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the \"One Strategic Plan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/topics/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable Development Goals}}</ref> integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs. This is done in consultation with ministries, local governments, and other stakeholders so that a common framework can be set forward.\n\n==Economic indicators and international rankings==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Zoroastrians usually pray in the presence of some form of fire (which can be considered evident in any source of light), and the [[Ab-Zohr|culminating rite]] of the principal act of worship constitutes a \"strengthening of the waters\". Fire is considered a medium through which spiritual insight and wisdom are gained, and water is considered the source of that wisdom. Both fire and water are also hypostasized as the Yazatas [[Atar]] and [[Anahita]], which worship hymns and litanies dedicated to them.\n\nA corpse is considered a host for decay, i.e., of ''druj''. Consequently, scripture enjoins the safe disposal of the dead in a manner such that a corpse does not pollute the good creation. These injunctions are the doctrinal basis of the fast-fading traditional practice of ritual exposure, most commonly identified with the so-called [[Tower of Silence|Towers of Silence]] for which there is no standard technical term in either scripture or tradition. Ritual exposure is currently mainly practiced by Zoroastrian communities of the [[Indian subcontinent]], in locations where it is not illegal and [[diclofenac]] poisoning has not led to the virtual extinction of scavenger birds. Other Zoroastrian communities either [[cremation|cremate]] their dead, or bury them in graves that are cased with [[lime mortar]], though Zoroastrians are keen to dispose of their dead in the most environmental way possible.\n\nWhile the [[Parsi|Parsees]] in India have traditionally since the 19th century been opposed to [[proselytizing]],<ref name=\":8\" /> and even considered it a crime for which the culprit may face expulsion,<ref>{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Roni K|edition=Online|year=1996|title=Traditional Zoroastrianism: Tenets of the Religion|url=http://tenets.parsizoroastrianism.com/ |website=World of Traditional Zoroastrianism|accessdate=2009-10-08}}</ref> Iranian Zoroastrians have never been opposed to conversion, and the practice has been endorsed by the Council of [[Mobad|Mobeds]] of [[Tehran]].

In time, this poll-tax came to be used as a means to humble the non-Muslims, and a number of laws and restrictions evolved to emphasize their inferior status. Under the early orthodox [[caliphs]], as long as the non-Muslims paid their taxes and adhered to the ''dhimmi'' laws, administrators were enjoined to leave non-Muslims \"in their religion and their land.\" ([[Abu Bakr|Caliph Abu Bakr]], qtd. in {{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=146}}).\n\nUnder [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] rule, Muslim Iranians (who by then were in the majority) in many instances showed severe disregard for and mistreated local Zoroastrians. For example, in the 9th century, a deeply venerated [[cypress tree]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (which Parthian-era legend supposed had been planted by Zoroaster himself) was felled for the construction of a palace in Baghdad, {{convert|2000|mi|km}} away.

One example of this was a legend that [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]], son of the fourth caliph [[Ali Ibn Abi Talib|Ali]] and grandson of Islam's prophet [[Muhammad]], had married a captive Sassanid princess named [[Shahrbanu]]. This \"wholly fictitious figure\"<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_151\">{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=151}}.</ref> was said to have borne Husayn [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|a son]], the historical fourth [[Shi'a]] [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|imam]], who claimed that the [[caliphate]] rightly belonged to him and his descendants, and that the [[Umayyad]]s had wrongfully wrested it from him. The alleged descent from the Sassanid house counterbalanced the [[Arab nationalism]] of the Umayyads, and the Iranian national association with a Zoroastrian past was disarmed. Thus, according to scholar [[Mary Boyce]], \"it was no longer the Zoroastrians alone who stood for patriotism and loyalty to the past.\"<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_151\" /> The \"damning indictment\" that becoming Muslim was [[Aniran|Un-Iranian]] only remained an idiom in Zoroastrian texts.<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_151\" />\n\nWith Iranian support, the [[Abbasids]] overthrew the Umayyads in 750, and in the subsequent caliphate government\u2014that nominally lasted until 1258\u2014Muslim Iranians received marked favor in the new government, both in Iran and at the capital in [[Baghdad]]. This mitigated the antagonism between Arabs and Iranians, but sharpened the distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims.

In [[Bukhara]] (in present-day [[Uzbekistan]]), resistance to Islam required the 9th-century Arab commander [[Qutayba ibn Muslim|Qutaiba]] to convert his province four times. The first three times the citizens reverted to their old religion. Finally, the governor made their religion \"difficult for them in every way\", turned the local fire temple into a mosque, and encouraged the local population to attend Friday prayers by paying each attendee two [[dirhams]].<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_147\" /> The cities where Arab governors resided were particularly vulnerable to such pressures,<!--147--> and in these cases the Zoroastrians were left with no choice but to either conform or migrate to regions that had a more amicable administration.<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_147\" />\n\nThe 9th century came to define<!--e.g., Bailey's ''Zoroastrian problems in the ninth-century books''--> the great number of Zoroastrian texts that were composed or re-written during the 8th to 10th centuries (excluding copying and lesser amendments, which continued for some time thereafter). All of these works are in the [[Middle Persian]] dialect of that period (free of Arabic words), and written in the difficult [[Pahlavi script]] (hence the adoption of the term \"Pahlavi\" as the name of the variant of the language, and of the genre, of those Zoroastrian books). If read aloud, these books would still have been intelligible to the [[laity]]. Many of these texts are responses to the tribulations of the time, and all of them include exhortations to stand fast in their religious beliefs. Some, such as the \"[[Denkard]]\", are doctrinal defenses of the religion, while others are explanations of theological aspects (such as the [[Bundahishn]]'s) or practical aspects (e.g., explanation of rituals) of it.\n\n[[File:Atashkadeh.jpg|thumb|Fire temple in [[Yazd]]]]\n[[File:Museum of Zoroastrians - Kerman.jpg|thumb|Museum of Zoroastrians in [[Kerman]]]]\nIn [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in northeastern Iran, a 10th-century Iranian nobleman brought together four Zoroastrian priests to transcribe a Sassanid-era Middle Persian work titled ''Book of the Lord'' (''Khwaday Namag'') from Pahlavi script into Arabic script. This transcription, which remained in Middle Persian prose (an Arabic version, by [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa|al-Muqaffa]], also exists), was completed in 957 and subsequently became the basis<!-- so Boyce 159 --> for [[Firdausi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh|Book of Kings]]''. It became enormously popular among both Zoroastrians and Muslims, and also served to propagate the Sassanid justification for overthrowing the Arsacids (i.e., that the Sassanids had restored the faith to its \"orthodox\" form after the Hellenistic Arsacids had allowed Zoroastrianism to become corrupt).\n\nAmong migrations were those to cities in (or on the margins of) the great salt deserts, in particular to [[Yazd]] and [[Kerman]], which remain centers of Iranian Zoroastrianism to this day.

The title means: \u201cRemnants of shamanistic beliefs in Hungarian folklore\u201d.</ref>\n\n===Indo-Iranian origins===\n{{See also|Indo-Iranians|Proto-Indo-Iranian religion}}\nThe religion of Zoroastrianism is closest to [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] to varying degrees. Some historians believe that Zoroastrianism, along with similar philosophical revolutions in South Asia were interconnected strings of reformation against a common Indo-Aryan thread. Many traits of Zoroastrianism can be traced back to the culture and beliefs of the prehistorical Indo-Iranian period, that is, to the time before the migrations that led to the [[Indo-Aryans]] and [[Iranian peoples|Iranics]] becoming distinct peoples. Zoroastrianism consequently shares elements with the [[historical Vedic religion]] that also has its origins in that era. Some examples include cognates between the [[Avestan]] word ''Ahura'' (\"[[Ahura Mazda]]\") and the Vedic [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Asura]]'' (\"demon; evil demigod\"); as well as ''[[Daeva]]'' (\"demon\") and ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]'' (\"god\") and they both descend from a common [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]].\n\n===Manichaeism===\nZoroastrianism is often compared with [[Manichaeism]]. Nominally an Iranian religion, it has its origins in [[Middle-East]]ern [[Gnosticism]]. Superficially such a comparison seems apt, as both are dualistic and Manichaeism adopted many of the [[Yazata]]s for its own pantheon. Gherardo Gnoli, in ''The Encyclopaedia of Religion'',<ref>Gherardo Gnoli, \u201cManichaeism: An Overview\u201d, in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'', ed. Mircea Eliade (NY: MacMillan Library Reference USA, 1987), 9: 165.</ref> says that \"we can assert that Manichaeism has its roots in the Iranian religious tradition and that its relationship to Mazdaism, or Zoroastrianism, is more or less like that of Christianity to Judaism\".<ref name=\"Henning\">Contrast with Henning's observations: Henning, W.B., ''The Book of Giants'', BSOAS, Vol. XI, Part 1, 1943, pp. 52\u201374:\n{{quote|It is noteworthy that Mani, who was brought up and spent most of his life in a province of the Persian empire, and whose mother belonged to a famous Parthian family, did not make any use of the Iranian mythological tradition. There can no longer be any doubt that the Iranian names of S\u0101m, Nar\u012bm\u0101n, etc., that appear in the Persian and Sogdian versions of the Book of the Giants, did not figure in the original edition, written by Mani in the Syriac language}}</ref>\n\nBut they are quite different.<ref>{{harvnb|Zaehner|1956|pp=53\u201354}}.</ref> Manichaeism equated evil with matter and good with spirit, and was therefore particularly suitable as a doctrinal basis for every form of asceticism and many forms of mysticism. Zoroastrianism, on the other hand, rejects every form of asceticism, has no dualism of matter and spirit (only of good and evil), and sees the spiritual world as not very different from the natural one (the word \"paradise\", or ''pairi.daeza'', applies equally to both.)\n\nManichaeism's basic doctrine was that the world and all corporeal bodies were constructed from the substance of Satan, an idea that is fundamentally at odds with the Zoroastrian notion of a world that was created by God and that is all good, and any corruption of it is an effect of the bad.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Present-day Iran===\nMany aspects of Zoroastrianism are present in the culture and mythologies of the peoples of [[Greater Iran]], not least because Zoroastrianism was a dominant influence on the people of the cultural continent for a thousand years. Even after the rise of Islam and the loss of direct influence, Zoroastrianism remained part of the cultural heritage of the [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]]-speaking world, in part as festivals and customs, but also because [[Ferdowsi]] incorporated a number of the figures and stories from the [[Avesta]] in his epic ''[[Shahnameh|Sh\u0101hn\u0101me]]'', which is pivotal to Iranian identity. One notable example is the incorporation of the Yazata [[Sraosha]] as an angel venerated within [[Shia Islam]] in Iran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sraosa|title=SRAO\u0160A |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\n==Religious text==\n\n===Avestan===\n{{Main|Avesta|Avestan language}}\nThe Avesta is a collection of the central religious texts of Zoroastrianism written in the old Iranian dialect of [[Avestan]]. The history of the Avesta is speculated upon in many [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi texts]] with varying degrees of authority, with the current version of the Avesta dating at oldest from the times of the Sasanian Empire.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avesta-holy-book|title=AVESTA i. Survey of the history and contents o |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> According to Middle Persian tradition, [[Ahura Mazda]] created the twenty-one masks of the original Avesta which [[Zoroaster]] brought to [[Vishtaspa]]. Here, two copies were created, one which was put in the house of archives and the other put in the Imperial treasury. During Alexander's conquest of Persia, the Avesta was burned, and the scientific sections that the Greeks could use were dispersed among themselves. However, there is no strong evidence historically towards these claims and they remain contested academically and within the faith.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nAs tradition continues, under the reign of King Valax of the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Parthia|Arsacis Dynasty]], an attempt was made to restore what was considered the Avesta. During the [[Sassanid Empire]], Ardeshir ordered Tansar, [[Dastur|his high priest]], to finish the work that King Valax had started. [[Shapur I]] sent priests to locate the scientific text portions of the Avesta that were in the possession of the Greeks. Under [[Shapur II]], Arderbad Mahrespandand revised the canon to ensure its orthodox character, while under [[Khosrow I]], the Avesta was translated into Pahlavi.\n\nThe compilation of the Avesta can be authoritatively traced, however, to the Sasanian Empire, of which only fraction survive today if the [[Middle Persian literature]] is correct.<ref name=\":12\" /> The later manuscripts all date from after the fall of the Sasanian Empire, the latest being from 1288, 590 years after the fall of the Sasanian Empire. The texts that remain today are the [[Gathas]], [[Yasna]], [[Visperad]] and the [[Vendidad]], of which the latter's inclusion is disputed within the faith.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zoroastrian.org.uk/vohuman/Article/Is%20The%20Vandidad%20a%20%20Zarathushtrian%20Scripture.htm|title=Is The Vandidad a Zarathushtrian Scripture?|website=English Zoroastrian|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> Along with these texts is the individual, communal, and ceremonial prayer book called the [[Khordeh Avesta]], which contains the [[Yasht]]s and other important hymns, prayers, and rituals. The rest of the materials from the Avesta are called \"Avestan fragments\" in that they are written in Avestan, incomplete, and generally of unknown provenance.{{sfn|Bromiley|1995|p=124}}\n\n===Middle Persian (Pahlavi)===\nMiddle Persian and Pahlavi works created in the 9th and 10th century contain many religious Zoroastrian books, as most of the writers and copyists were part of the Zoroastrian clergy. The most significant and important books of this era include the [[Denkard]], [[Bundahishn]], [[Menog-i Khrad]], Selections of Zadspram, [[Jamasp Namag]], Epistles of Manucher, [[Rivayat]]s, Dadestan-i-Denig, and [[Arda Viraf Namag]]. All Middle Persian texts written on Zoroastrianism during this time period are considered secondary works on the religion, and not [[scripture]]. Nonetheless, these texts have had a strong influence on the religion.\n\n==Zoroaster==\n{{Main|Zoroaster}}\nZoroastrianism was founded by Zoroaster (or Zarathushtra) in ancient Iran. The precise date of the founding of Zoroastrianism is uncertain and dates differ wildly from 2000 BCE to \"200 years before Alexander\". Zoroaster was born in either Northeast Iran or Southwest Afghanistan. He was born into a culture with a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religion, which included excessive [[animal sacrifice]]<ref>Boyce (1979), p. 26</ref> and the excessive ritual use of intoxicants, and his life was defined heavily by the settling of his people and the constant threats of raids and conflict. Zoroaster's birth and early life are little documented but speculated heavily upon in later texts. What is known is recorded in the [[Gathas]]\u2014the core of the Avesta, which contains hymns thought to be composed by Zoroaster himself. Born into the [[Spitama]] clan, he refers to himself as a poet-priest and spiritual master. He had a wife, three sons, and three daughters, the numbers of which are gathered from various texts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/zoroaster-index|title=ZOROASTER |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\nZoroaster rejected many of the gods of the [[Bronze Age]] Iranians and their oppressive [[Caste system|class structure]], in which the Karvis and Karapans (princes and priests) controlled the ordinary people. He also opposed cruel animal sacrifices and the excessive use of the [[hallucinogenic]] [[Haoma]] plant (possibly a species of [[Ephedra (genus)|ephedra]]), but did not outright condemn completely either practice in moderate forms.<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sacrifice-i|title=SACRIFICE i.

After this, Vohu Manah took him to the other six Amesha Spentas, where he received the completion of his vision.<ref>Boyce (1979), p. 19</ref> This vision radically transformed his view of the world, and he tried to teach this view to others. Zoroaster believed in one supreme creator deity and acknowledged this creator's emanations ([[Amesha Spenta]]) and other divinities which he called Ahuras ([[Yazata]]). Some of the deities of the old religion, the ''[[Daevas]]'' (''Devas'' in Sanskrit), appeared to delight in war and strife and were condemned as evil workers of Angra Mainyu by Zoroaster.\n\nZoroaster's ideas were not taken up quickly; he originally only had one convert: his cousin Maidhyoimanha.<ref>Boyce (1979), pp. 30\u201331</ref> The local religious authorities opposed his ideas, considering that their faith, power, and particularly their rituals were threatened by Zoroaster's teaching against the bad and overly-complicated ritualization of religious ceremonies. Many did not like Zoroaster's downgrading of the Daevas to evil ones not worthy of worship. After twelve years of little success, Zoroaster left his home.\n\nIn the country of King [[Vishtaspa]], the king and queen heard Zoroaster debating with the religious leaders of the land and decided to accept Zoroaster's ideas as the official religion of their kingdom after having Zoroaster prove himself by healing the king's favorite horse. Zoroaster is believed to have died in his late 70s, either by murder by a [[Turan]]ian or old age. Very little is known of the time between Zoroaster and the [[Achaemenian]] period, except that Zoroastrianism spread to Western Iran and other regions. By the time of the founding of the Achaemenid Empire, Zoroastrianism is believed to have been already a well-established religion.\n\n=== Cypress of Kashmar ===\n{{Main|Cypress of Kashmar}}\nThe Cypress of Kashmar is a mythical cypress tree of legendary beauty and gargantuan dimensions. It is said to have sprung from a branch brought by [[Zoroaster]] from Paradise and to have stood in today's Kashmar in northeastern Iran and to have been planted by Zoroaster in honor of the conversion of [[Vishtaspa|King Vishtaspa]] to Zoroastrianism. According to the Iranian physicist and historian [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] King Vishtaspa had been a patron of Zoroaster who planted the tree himself.

In Zoroastrianism, good transpires for those who do righteous deeds for its own sake, not for the search of reward. Those who do evil are said to be attacked and confused by the druj and are responsible for aligning themselves back to Asha by following this path.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n[[File:Faravahar.svg|thumb|right|[[Faravahar]] (or Ferohar), one of the primary symbols of Zoroastrianism, believed to be the depiction of a ''[[Fravashi]]'' or the ''[[Khvarenah]].'']]\nIn Zoroastrianism, [[Ahura Mazda]] is the beginning and the end, the creator of everything that can and cannot be seen, the eternal and uncreated, the all-good and source of Asha.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the [[Gathas]], the most sacred texts of Zoroastrianism thought to have been composed by Zoroaster himself, Zoroaster acknowledged the highest devotion to Ahura Mazda, with worship and adoration also given to Ahura Mazda's manifestations ([[Amesha Spenta]]) and the other ahuras ([[Yazata]]) that support Ahura Mazda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gathas|title=GATHAS |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\n''[[Daena]]'' (''din'' in modern [[Persian language|Persian]] and meaning \"that which is seen\") is representative of the sum of one's spiritual conscience and attributes, which through one's choice Asha is either strengthened or weakened in the Daena.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/den|title=D\u0112N |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> Traditionally, the ''manthras'', spiritual prayer formulas, are believed to be of immense power and the vehicles of Asha and creation used to maintain good and fight evil.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/zoroastrian-rituals|title=ZOROASTRIAN RITUALS |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> ''Daena'' should not be confused with the fundamental principle of ''[[Asha]]'', believed to be the cosmic order which governs and permeates all existence, and the concept of which governed the life of the ancient Indo-Iranians. For these, ''asha'' was the course of everything observable\u2014the motion of the planets and astral bodies; the progression of the seasons; and the pattern of daily nomadic herdsman life, governed by regular metronomic events such as sunrise and sunset, and was strengthened through truth-telling and following the Threefold Path.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAll physical creation (''geti''g) was thus determined to run according to a master plan\u2014inherent to Ahura Mazda\u2014and violations of the order (''druj'') were violations against creation, and thus violations against Ahura Mazda.<ref name=\":14\" /> This concept of ''asha'' versus the ''druj'' should not be confused with Western and especially Abrahamic notions of good versus evil, for although both forms of opposition express moral conflict, the ''asha'' versus ''druj'' concept is more systemic and less personal, representing, for instance, chaos (that opposes order); or \"uncreation\", evident as natural decay (that opposes creation); or more simply \"the lie\" (that opposes truth and goodness).<ref name=\":5\" /> Moreover, in the role as the one uncreated creator of all, Ahura Mazda is not the creator of ''druj'', which is \"nothing\", anti-creation, and thus (likewise) uncreated and developed as the antithesis of existence through choice.<ref name=\":6\" />\n[[File:Parsee Wedding 1905.jpg|thumb|left|A ''[[Parsi people|Parsi]]'' Wedding, 1905]]\n\nIn this [[Model (abstract)|schema]] of ''asha'' versus ''druj'', mortal beings (both humans and animals) play a critical role, for they too are created. Here, in their lives, they are active participants in the conflict, and it is their spiritual duty to defend Asha, which is under constant assault and would decay in strength without counter''action''.<ref name=\":5\" /> Throughout the [[Gathas]], Zoroaster emphasizes deeds and actions within society and accordingly extreme [[asceticism]] is frowned upon in Zoroastrianism but moderate forms are allowed within.<ref name=\":15\" /> This was explained as fleeing from the experiences and joys of life, which was the very purpose that the ''urvan'' (most commonly translated as the \"soul\") was sent into the mortal world to collect. The avoidance of any aspect of life which does not bring harm to another and engage in activities that support the druj, which includes the avoidance of the pleasures of life, is a shirking of the responsibility and duty to oneself, one's ''urvan'', and one's family and social obligations.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nCentral to Zoroastrianism is the emphasis on moral choice, to choose the responsibility and duty for which one is in the mortal world, or to give up this duty and so facilitate the work of ''druj''. Similarly, [[predestination]] is rejected in Zoroastrian teaching and the absolute free will of all conscious beings is core, with even divine beings having the ability to choose. Humans bear responsibility for all situations they are in, and in the way they act toward one another. Reward, punishment, happiness, and grief all depend on how individuals live their lives.<ref name=Cavendish />\n\nIn the 19th century, through contact with Western academics and missionaries, Zoroastrianism experienced a massive theological change that still affects it today. The [[John Wilson (Scottish missionary)|Rev. John Wilson]] led various missionary campaigns in India against the Parsi community, disparaging the Parsis for their \"[[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]\" and \"polytheism\" and as having unnecessary rituals while declaring the Avesta to not be \"divinely inspired\". This caused mass dismay in the relatively uneducated Parsi community, which blamed its priests and led to some conversions towards Christianity. The arrival of the German [[oriental studies|orientalist]] and [[Philology|philologist]] [[Martin Haug]] led to a rallied defense of the faith through Haug's reinterpretation of the Avesta through Christianized and European orientalist lens. Haug postulated that Zoroastrianism was solely monotheistic with all other divinities reduced to the status of angels while Ahura Mazda became both omnipotent and the source of evil as well as good. Haug's thinking was subsequently disseminated as a Parsi interpretation, thus corroborating Haug's theory, and the idea became so popular that it is now almost universally accepted as doctrine though being reevaluated in modern Zoroastrianism and academia.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThroughout Zoroastrian history, [[shrines]] and [[Fire temple|temples]] have been the focus of worship and pilgrimage for adherents of the religion. Early Zoroastrians were recorded as worshiping in the 5th century BCE on mounds and hills where fires were lit below the open skies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=1:chapter=131|title=Herodotus, The Histories, Book 1, chapter 131|website=Perseus Digital Library|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> In the wake of Achaemenid expansion, shrines were constructed throughout the empire and particularly influenced the role of [[Mithra]], [[Aredvi Sura Anahita]], [[Verethragna]] and [[Tishtrya]], alongside other traditional Yazata who all have hymns within the Avesta and also local deities and culture-heroes. Today, enclosed and covered fire temples tend to be the focus of community worship where fires of varying grades are maintained by the clergy assigned to the temples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ataskada-new-persian-house-of-fire-mid|title=\u0100TA\u0160KADA |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\n===Cosmology: Creation of the universe===\nAccording to the Zoroastrian [[creation myth]], [[Ahura Mazda]] existed in light and goodness above, while [[Angra Mainyu]] existed in darkness and ignorance below. They have existed independently of each other for all time, and manifest contrary substances. Ahura Mazda first manifested seven divine beings called ''[[Amesha Spenta]]s'', who support him and represent beneficent aspects of personality and creation, along with numerous ''[[Yazata]]s'', divinities worthy of worship. Ahura Mazda then created the material and visible world itself in order to ensnare evil. Ahura Mazda created the floating, egg-shaped universe in two parts: first the spiritual (''menog'') and 3,000 years later, the physical (''getig''). Ahura Mazda then created [[Keyumars|Gayomard]], the archetypical perfect man, and [[Gavaevodata]], the primordial bovine.<ref name=Cavendish>{{Citation|title=Mythology: an Illustrated Encyclopedia |pages=40\u201345 |first1=Richard |last1=Cavendish |first2=Trevor Oswald |last2=Ling |publisher=Rizzoli |year=1980 |isbn=978-0847802869 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GdEnAAAAYAAJ}}</ref>\n\nWhile Ahura Mazda created the universe and humankind, Angra Mainyu, whose very nature is to destroy, miscreated demons, evil ''daevas'', and noxious creatures (''khrafstar'') such as snakes, ants, and flies. Angra Mainyu created an opposite, evil being for each good being, except for humans, which he found he could not match. Angra Mainyu invaded the universe through the base of the sky, inflicting Gayomard and the bull with suffering and death. However, the evil forces were trapped in the universe and could not retreat. The dying primordial man and bovine emitted seeds, which were protect by [[Mah]], the Moon. From the bull's seed grew all beneficial plants and animals of the world and from the man's seed grew a plant whose leaves became the [[Mashya and Mashyana|first human couple]]. Humans thus struggle in a two-fold universe of the material and spiritual trapped and in long combat with evil. The evils of this physical world are not products of an inherent weakness, but are the fault of Angra Mainyu's assault on creation. This assault turned the perfectly flat, peaceful, and ever day-lit world into a mountainous, violent place that is half night.<ref name=Cavendish />\n\n===Eschatology: Renovation and judgment===\n{{main|Frashokereti}}\nZoroastrianism also includes beliefs about the [[eschatology|renovation of the world]] ([[Frashokereti]]) and individual judgment (cf. [[general judgment|general]] and [[particular judgment]]), including the [[resurrection of the dead]], which are alluded to in the Gathas but developed in later Avestan and Middle Persian writings.\n\nIndividual judgment at death is at the [[Chinvat Bridge]] (\"bridge of judgement\" or \"bridge of choice\"), which each human must cross, facing a spiritual judgment, though modern belief is split as to whether it is representative of a mental decision during life to choose between good and evil or an afterworld location. Humans' actions under their free will through choice determine the outcome. According to tradition, the soul is judged by the Yazatas [[Mithra]], [[Sraosha]], and [[Rashnu]], where depending on the verdict one is either greeted at the bridge by a beautiful, sweet-smelling maiden or by an ugly, foul-smelling old hag representing their [[Daena]] affected by their actions in life. The maiden leads the dead safely across the bridge, which widens and becomes pleasant for the righteous, towards the House of Song. The hag leads the dead down a bridge that narrows to a razor's edge and is full of stench until the departed falls off into the abyss towards the House of Lies.<ref name=Cavendish/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cinwad-puhl-av|title=\u010cINWAD PUHL |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> Those with a balance of good and evil go to [[Hamistagan]], a neutral place of waiting where according to the [[Dadestan-i Denig]], a Middle Persian work from the 9th century, the souls of the departed can relive their lives and conduct good deeds to raise themselves towards the House of Song or await the final judgement and the mercy of Ahura Mazda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/mp/dd.htm|title=Dadestan-i Denig ('Religious Decisions'): Chapters 1-41|website=Avesta|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\nThe House of Lies is considered temporary and reformative; punishments fit the crimes, and souls do not rest in eternal damnation.

During the final assault, the sun and moon will darken and humankind will lose its reverence for religion, family, and elders. The world will fall into winter, and Angra Mainyu's most fearsome miscreant, [[Azi Dahaka]], will break free and terrorize the world.<ref name=Cavendish />\n\nAccording to legend, the final savior of the world, known as the [[Saoshyant]], will be born to a virgin impregnated by the seed of Zoroaster while bathing in a lake. The Saoshyant will raise the dead\u2014including those in all afterworlds\u2014for final judgment, returning the wicked to hell to be purged of bodily sin. Next, all will wade through a river of molten metal in which the righteous will not burn but through which the impure will be completely purified. The forces of good will ultimately triumph over evil, rendering it forever impotent but not destroyed. The Saoshyant and Ahura Mazda will offer a bull as a final sacrifice for all time and all humans will become immortal. Mountains will again flatten and valleys will rise; the House of Song will descend to the moon, and the earth will rise to meet them both.<ref name=Cavendish /> Humanity will require two judgments because there are as many aspects to our being: spiritual (''menog'') and physical (''getig'').<ref name=\"Cavendish\" /> Thus, Zoroastrianism can be said to be a [[Universalism|universalist]] religion with respect to salvation in that all souls are redeemed at the final judgement.\n\n===Ritual and Prayer===\nThe central ritual of Zoroastrianism is the [[Yasna]], which is a recitation of the eponymous book of the Avesta and sacrificial ritual ceremony involving [[Haoma]].<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/yasna|title=YASNA |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> Extensions to the Yasna ritual are possible through use of the [[Visperad]] and [[Vendidad]], but such an extended ritual is rare in modern Zoroastrianism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/visperad|title=VISPERAD |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/vendidad-parent|title=VEND\u012aD\u0100D |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> The Yasna itself descended from [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] sacrificial ceremonies and animal sacrifice of varying degrees are mentioned in the Avesta and are still practiced in Zoroastrianism albeit through reduced forms such as the sacrifice of fat before meals.<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\" /> High rituals such as the Yasna are considered to be the purview of the [[Mobad|Mobeds]] with a corpus of individual and communal rituals and prayers included in the [[Khordeh Avesta]].<ref name=\":18\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/khordeh-avesta|title=KHORDEH AVEST\u0100 |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> A Zoroastrian is welcomed into the faith through the [[Navjote]]/Sedreh Pushi ceremony, which is traditionally conducted during the later childhood or pre-teen years of the aspirant, though there is no defined age limit for the ritual.<ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":19\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/ritual/navjote.htm|title=Zoroastrian rituals: Navjote/Sudre-Pooshi (initiation) ceremony|website=Avesta|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> After the ceremony, Zoroastrians are encouraged to wear their sedreh (ritual shirt) and kusti (ritual girdle) daily as a spiritual reminder and for mystical protection, though modern Zoroastrians tend to only wear them during festivals, ceremonies, and prayers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kustig|title=KUST\u012aG |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":19\" />\n\nThe incorporation of cultural and local rituals is quite common and traditions have been passed down in historically Zoroastrian communities such as herbal healing practices, wedding ceremonies, and the like.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/apr/11/iran-traditional-medicine-herbs-regulation-tehranbureau|title=Herbal life: traditional medicine gets a modern twist in Iran|last=Ajiri|first=Denise Hassanzade|date=2016-04-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-07-13|last2=correspondent|first2=Tehran Bureau|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/ritual/zwedding.htm|title=Zoroastrian Rituals: Wedding|website=Avesta|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref><ref name=\":17\" /> Traditionally, Zoroastrian rituals have also included [[Shamanism|shamanic]] elements involving [[Mysticism|mystical]] methods such as [[spirit travel]] to the invisible realm and involving the consumption of [[fortified wine]], [[Haoma]], [[Bhang|mang]], and other ritual aids.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arda-wiraz-wiraz|title=ARD\u0100 W\u012aR\u0100Z |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref><ref name=\":14\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kartir|title=KARTIR |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bang-middle-and-new-persian-in-book-pahlavi-also-mang-arabicized-banj-a-kind-of-narcotic-plant|title=BANG |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/magic-i-magical-elements-in-the-avesta-and-nerang-literature|title=MAGIC i.

When the Islamic armies, under the first caliphs, invaded Persia, those locals who were unwilling to convert to Islam sought refuge, first in the mountains of Northern Iran, then the regions of Yazd and its surrounding villages. Later, in the ninth century CE, a group sought refuge in the western coastal region of India, and also scattered to other regions of the world.\nFollowing the fall of the [[Sassanid Empire]] in 651 CE, many Zoroastrians migrated. Among them were several groups who ventured to [[Gujarat]] on the western shores of the [[Indian subcontinent]], where they finally settled.

Prior to being born, the ''urvan'' (soul) of an individual is still united with its ''[[fravashi]]'' (personal/higher spirit), which has existed since Ahura Mazda created the universe. The fravashi before the urvan's split act as aids in the maintenance of creation with Ahura Mazda.

In Zoroastrian [[cosmogony]], water and fire are respectively the second and last primordial elements to have been created, and scripture considers fire to have its origin in the waters<!-- (Boyce supposes this idea is due to an identification of lightning with rain) -->. Both water and fire are considered life-sustaining, and both water and fire are represented within the precinct of a [[fire temple]]. Zoroastrians usually pray in the presence of some form of fire (which can be considered evident in any source of light), and the [[Ab-Zohr|culminating rite]] of the principal act of worship constitutes a \"strengthening of the waters\". Fire is considered a medium through which spiritual insight and wisdom are gained, and water is considered the source of that wisdom. Both fire and water are also hypostasized as the Yazatas [[Atar]] and [[Anahita]], which worship hymns and litanies dedicated to them.\n\nA corpse is considered a host for decay, i.e., of ''druj''. Consequently, scripture enjoins the safe disposal of the dead in a manner such that a corpse does not pollute the good creation. These injunctions are the doctrinal basis of the fast-fading traditional practice of ritual exposure, most commonly identified with the so-called [[Tower of Silence|Towers of Silence]] for which there is no standard technical term in either scripture or tradition. Ritual exposure is currently mainly practiced by Zoroastrian communities of the [[Indian subcontinent]], in locations where it is not illegal and [[diclofenac]] poisoning has not led to the virtual extinction of scavenger birds. Other Zoroastrian communities either [[cremation|cremate]] their dead, or bury them in graves that are cased with [[lime mortar]], though Zoroastrians are keen to dispose of their dead in the most environmental way possible.\n\nWhile the [[Parsi|Parsees]] in India have traditionally since the 19th century been opposed to [[proselytizing]],<ref name=\":8\" /> and even considered it a crime for which the culprit may face expulsion,<ref>{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Roni K|edition=Online|year=1996|title=Traditional Zoroastrianism: Tenets of the Religion|url=http://tenets.parsizoroastrianism.com/ |website=World of Traditional Zoroastrianism|accessdate=2009-10-08}}</ref> Iranian Zoroastrians have never been opposed to conversion, and the practice has been endorsed by the Council of [[Mobad|Mobeds]] of [[Tehran]].

But there was a slow but steady social and economic pressure to convert.<ref name=\"Buillet_1979_37.138\">{{harvnb|Buillet|1978|pp=37, 138}}.</ref><ref name=\"Boyce_1979_147\">{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|pp=147}}.</ref> The nobility and city-dwellers were the first to convert, with Islam more slowly being accepted among the peasantry and landed gentry.<ref name=\"Buillet_1979_59\">{{harvnb|Buillet|1978|p=59}}.</ref> \"Power and worldly-advantage\" now lay with followers of Islam, and although the \"official policy was one of aloof contempt, there were individual Muslims eager to [[proselytize]] and ready to use all sorts of means to do so.\"<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_147\" />\n\nIn time, a tradition evolved by which Islam was made to appear as a partly Iranian religion. One example of this was a legend that [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]], son of the fourth caliph [[Ali Ibn Abi Talib|Ali]] and grandson of Islam's prophet [[Muhammad]], had married a captive Sassanid princess named [[Shahrbanu]]. This \"wholly fictitious figure\"<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_151\">{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=151}}.</ref> was said to have borne Husayn [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|a son]], the historical fourth [[Shi'a]] [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|imam]], who claimed that the [[caliphate]] rightly belonged to him and his descendants, and that the [[Umayyad]]s had wrongfully wrested it from him. The alleged descent from the Sassanid house counterbalanced the [[Arab nationalism]] of the Umayyads, and the Iranian national association with a Zoroastrian past was disarmed. Thus, according to scholar [[Mary Boyce]], \"it was no longer the Zoroastrians alone who stood for patriotism and loyalty to the past.\"<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_151\" /> The \"damning indictment\" that becoming Muslim was [[Aniran|Un-Iranian]] only remained an idiom in Zoroastrian texts.<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_151\" />\n\nWith Iranian support, the [[Abbasids]] overthrew the Umayyads in 750, and in the subsequent caliphate government\u2014that nominally lasted until 1258\u2014Muslim Iranians received marked favor in the new government, both in Iran and at the capital in [[Baghdad]]. This mitigated the antagonism between Arabs and Iranians, but sharpened the distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims. The Abbasids zealously persecuted [[Heresy|heretics]], and although this was directed mainly at Muslim [[sectarians]], it also created a harsher climate for non-Muslims.<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_152\">{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=152}}.</ref> Although the Abbasids were deadly foes of Zoroastrianism, the brand of Islam they propagated throughout Iran became ever more \"Zoroastrianized\", making it easier for Iranians to embrace Islam.<!-- 152 -->\n\n====Survival====\n[[File:USSHER(1865) p012 BAKU, FIRE TEMPLE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The [[Ateshgah of Baku|fire temple]] of [[Baku]], c. 1860]]\nDespite economic and social incentives to convert, Zoroastrianism remained strong in some regions, particularly in those furthest away from the Caliphate capital at Baghdad. In [[Bukhara]] (in present-day [[Uzbekistan]]), resistance to Islam required the 9th-century Arab commander [[Qutayba ibn Muslim|Qutaiba]] to convert his province four times. The first three times the citizens reverted to their old religion. Finally, the governor made their religion \"difficult for them in every way\", turned the local fire temple into a mosque, and encouraged the local population to attend Friday prayers by paying each attendee two [[dirhams]].<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_147\" /> The cities where Arab governors resided were particularly vulnerable to such pressures,<!--147--> and in these cases the Zoroastrians were left with no choice but to either conform or migrate to regions that had a more amicable administration.<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_147\" />\n\nThe 9th century came to define<!--e.g., Bailey's ''Zoroastrian problems in the ninth-century books''--> the great number of Zoroastrian texts that were composed or re-written during the 8th to 10th centuries (excluding copying and lesser amendments, which continued for some time thereafter). All of these works are in the [[Middle Persian]] dialect of that period (free of Arabic words), and written in the difficult [[Pahlavi script]] (hence the adoption of the term \"Pahlavi\" as the name of the variant of the language, and of the genre, of those Zoroastrian books). If read aloud, these books would still have been intelligible to the [[laity]]. Many of these texts are responses to the tribulations of the time, and all of them include exhortations to stand fast in their religious beliefs. Some, such as the \"[[Denkard]]\", are doctrinal defenses of the religion, while others are explanations of theological aspects (such as the [[Bundahishn]]'s) or practical aspects (e.g., explanation of rituals) of it.\n\n[[File:Atashkadeh.jpg|thumb|Fire temple in [[Yazd]]]]\n[[File:Museum of Zoroastrians - Kerman.jpg|thumb|Museum of Zoroastrians in [[Kerman]]]]\nIn [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] in northeastern Iran, a 10th-century Iranian nobleman brought together four Zoroastrian priests to transcribe a Sassanid-era Middle Persian work titled ''Book of the Lord'' (''Khwaday Namag'') from Pahlavi script into Arabic script. This transcription, which remained in Middle Persian prose (an Arabic version, by [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa|al-Muqaffa]], also exists), was completed in 957 and subsequently became the basis<!-- so Boyce 159 --> for [[Firdausi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh|Book of Kings]]''. It became enormously popular among both Zoroastrians and Muslims, and also served to propagate the Sassanid justification for overthrowing the Arsacids (i.e., that the Sassanids had restored the faith to its \"orthodox\" form after the Hellenistic Arsacids had allowed Zoroastrianism to become corrupt).\n\nAmong migrations were those to cities in (or on the margins of) the great salt deserts, in particular to [[Yazd]] and [[Kerman]], which remain centers of Iranian Zoroastrianism to this day. Yazd became the seat of the Iranian high priests during [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Il-Khanate]] rule, when the \"best hope for survival [for a non-Muslim] was to be inconspicuous.\"<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_163\">{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=163}}.</ref> Crucial to the present-day survival of Zoroastrianism was a migration from the northeastern Iranian town of [[Sanjan (Khorasan)|\"Sanjan in south<!-- hyphen-->-<!--per literal quote-->western Khorasan\"]],<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_157\">{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=157}}.</ref> to [[Gujarat]], in western [[India]].

In the 16th century, in one of the early letters between Iranian Zoroastrians and their co-religionists in India, the priests of [[Yazd]] lamented that \"no period [in human history], not even [[Hellenistic period|that of Alexander]], had been more grievous or troublesome for the faithful than 'this millennium of the [[Aeshma|demon of <!--caps cause hypostasis-->Wrath<!-- and because this is a literal quotation-->]]'.\"<ref name=\"Boyce_1979_175\">{{harvnb|Boyce|1979|p=175}}.</ref>\n\n===Modern===\n{{further|Parsi|Irani (India)|Zoroastrians in Iran}}\n[[File:Pundole Agiary Udvada.jpg|thumb|A modern Zoroastrian [[fire temple]] in Western India<!-- please don't name it, could be confused with the Iranshah -->]]\n[[File:Sadeh.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sadeh]] in [[Tehran]], 2011]]\nZoroastrianism has survived into the modern period, particularly in India, where it has been present since about the 9th century.\n\nToday Zoroastrianism can be divided in two main schools of thought: reformists and traditionalists.

Both of these latter schools tend to center the Gathas without outright rejecting other texts except the [[Vendidad]]. [[Ilm-e-Khshnoom]] and the Pundol Group are Zoroastrian mystical schools of thought popular among a small minority of the Parsi community inspired mostly by 19th-century [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and typified by a spiritual [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] mentality.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nFrom the 19th century onward, the Parsis gained a reputation for their education and widespread influence in all aspects of society. They played an instrumental role in the economic development of the region over many decades; several of the best-known business conglomerates of India are run by Parsi-Zoroastrians, including the [[Tata Group|Tata]], [[Godrej family|Godrej]], [[Wadia]] families, and others.\n\nThough the Armenians share a rich history affiliated with Zoroastrianism (that eventually declined with the advent of Christianity), reports indicate that there were [[Zoroastrianism in Armenia|Zoroastrian Armenians]] in [[Armenia]] until the 1920s.<ref>Anne Sofie Roald, Anh Nga Longva.

Some historians believe that Zoroastrianism, along with similar philosophical revolutions in South Asia were interconnected strings of reformation against a common Indo-Aryan thread. Many traits of Zoroastrianism can be traced back to the culture and beliefs of the prehistorical Indo-Iranian period, that is, to the time before the migrations that led to the [[Indo-Aryans]] and [[Iranian peoples|Iranics]] becoming distinct peoples. Zoroastrianism consequently shares elements with the [[historical Vedic religion]] that also has its origins in that era. Some examples include cognates between the [[Avestan]] word ''Ahura'' (\"[[Ahura Mazda]]\") and the Vedic [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Asura]]'' (\"demon; evil demigod\"); as well as ''[[Daeva]]'' (\"demon\") and ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]'' (\"god\") and they both descend from a common [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]].\n\n===Manichaeism===\nZoroastrianism is often compared with [[Manichaeism]]. Nominally an Iranian religion, it has its origins in [[Middle-East]]ern [[Gnosticism]]. Superficially such a comparison seems apt, as both are dualistic and Manichaeism adopted many of the [[Yazata]]s for its own pantheon. Gherardo Gnoli, in ''The Encyclopaedia of Religion'',<ref>Gherardo Gnoli, \u201cManichaeism: An Overview\u201d, in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'', ed. Mircea Eliade (NY: MacMillan Library Reference USA, 1987), 9: 165.</ref> says that \"we can assert that Manichaeism has its roots in the Iranian religious tradition and that its relationship to Mazdaism, or Zoroastrianism, is more or less like that of Christianity to Judaism\".<ref name=\"Henning\">Contrast with Henning's observations: Henning, W.B., ''The Book of Giants'', BSOAS, Vol. XI, Part 1, 1943, pp. 52\u201374:\n{{quote|It is noteworthy that Mani, who was brought up and spent most of his life in a province of the Persian empire, and whose mother belonged to a famous Parthian family, did not make any use of the Iranian mythological tradition.

Zoroastrianism, on the other hand, rejects every form of asceticism, has no dualism of matter and spirit (only of good and evil), and sees the spiritual world as not very different from the natural one (the word \"paradise\", or ''pairi.daeza'', applies equally to both.)\n\nManichaeism's basic doctrine was that the world and all corporeal bodies were constructed from the substance of Satan, an idea that is fundamentally at odds with the Zoroastrian notion of a world that was created by God and that is all good, and any corruption of it is an effect of the bad.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Present-day Iran===\nMany aspects of Zoroastrianism are present in the culture and mythologies of the peoples of [[Greater Iran]], not least because Zoroastrianism was a dominant influence on the people of the cultural continent for a thousand years. Even after the rise of Islam and the loss of direct influence, Zoroastrianism remained part of the cultural heritage of the [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]]-speaking world, in part as festivals and customs, but also because [[Ferdowsi]] incorporated a number of the figures and stories from the [[Avesta]] in his epic ''[[Shahnameh|Sh\u0101hn\u0101me]]'', which is pivotal to Iranian identity. One notable example is the incorporation of the Yazata [[Sraosha]] as an angel venerated within [[Shia Islam]] in Iran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sraosa|title=SRAO\u0160A |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\n==Religious text==\n\n===Avestan===\n{{Main|Avesta|Avestan language}}\nThe Avesta is a collection of the central religious texts of Zoroastrianism written in the old Iranian dialect of [[Avestan]]. The history of the Avesta is speculated upon in many [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi texts]] with varying degrees of authority, with the current version of the Avesta dating at oldest from the times of the Sasanian Empire.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/avesta-holy-book|title=AVESTA i. Survey of the history and contents o |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> According to Middle Persian tradition, [[Ahura Mazda]] created the twenty-one masks of the original Avesta which [[Zoroaster]] brought to [[Vishtaspa]]. Here, two copies were created, one which was put in the house of archives and the other put in the Imperial treasury. During Alexander's conquest of Persia, the Avesta was burned, and the scientific sections that the Greeks could use were dispersed among themselves. However, there is no strong evidence historically towards these claims and they remain contested academically and within the faith.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nAs tradition continues, under the reign of King Valax of the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Parthia|Arsacis Dynasty]], an attempt was made to restore what was considered the Avesta. During the [[Sassanid Empire]], Ardeshir ordered Tansar, [[Dastur|his high priest]], to finish the work that King Valax had started. [[Shapur I]] sent priests to locate the scientific text portions of the Avesta that were in the possession of the Greeks. Under [[Shapur II]], Arderbad Mahrespandand revised the canon to ensure its orthodox character, while under [[Khosrow I]], the Avesta was translated into Pahlavi.\n\nThe compilation of the Avesta can be authoritatively traced, however, to the Sasanian Empire, of which only fraction survive today if the [[Middle Persian literature]] is correct.<ref name=\":12\" /> The later manuscripts all date from after the fall of the Sasanian Empire, the latest being from 1288, 590 years after the fall of the Sasanian Empire. The texts that remain today are the [[Gathas]], [[Yasna]], [[Visperad]] and the [[Vendidad]], of which the latter's inclusion is disputed within the faith.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zoroastrian.org.uk/vohuman/Article/Is%20The%20Vandidad%20a%20%20Zarathushtrian%20Scripture.htm|title=Is The Vandidad a Zarathushtrian Scripture?|website=English Zoroastrian|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> Along with these texts is the individual, communal, and ceremonial prayer book called the [[Khordeh Avesta]], which contains the [[Yasht]]s and other important hymns, prayers, and rituals. The rest of the materials from the Avesta are called \"Avestan fragments\" in that they are written in Avestan, incomplete, and generally of unknown provenance.{{sfn|Bromiley|1995|p=124}}\n\n===Middle Persian (Pahlavi)===\nMiddle Persian and Pahlavi works created in the 9th and 10th century contain many religious Zoroastrian books, as most of the writers and copyists were part of the Zoroastrian clergy. The most significant and important books of this era include the [[Denkard]], [[Bundahishn]], [[Menog-i Khrad]], Selections of Zadspram, [[Jamasp Namag]], Epistles of Manucher, [[Rivayat]]s, Dadestan-i-Denig, and [[Arda Viraf Namag]]. All Middle Persian texts written on Zoroastrianism during this time period are considered secondary works on the religion, and not [[scripture]]. Nonetheless, these texts have had a strong influence on the religion.\n\n==Zoroaster==\n{{Main|Zoroaster}}\nZoroastrianism was founded by Zoroaster (or Zarathushtra) in ancient Iran. The precise date of the founding of Zoroastrianism is uncertain and dates differ wildly from 2000 BCE to \"200 years before Alexander\". Zoroaster was born in either Northeast Iran or Southwest Afghanistan. He was born into a culture with a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religion, which included excessive [[animal sacrifice]]<ref>Boyce (1979), p. 26</ref> and the excessive ritual use of intoxicants, and his life was defined heavily by the settling of his people and the constant threats of raids and conflict. Zoroaster's birth and early life are little documented but speculated heavily upon in later texts. What is known is recorded in the [[Gathas]]\u2014the core of the Avesta, which contains hymns thought to be composed by Zoroaster himself. Born into the [[Spitama]] clan, he refers to himself as a poet-priest and spiritual master. He had a wife, three sons, and three daughters, the numbers of which are gathered from various texts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/zoroaster-index|title=ZOROASTER |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\nZoroaster rejected many of the gods of the [[Bronze Age]] Iranians and their oppressive [[Caste system|class structure]], in which the Karvis and Karapans (princes and priests) controlled the ordinary people. He also opposed cruel animal sacrifices and the excessive use of the [[hallucinogenic]] [[Haoma]] plant (possibly a species of [[Ephedra (genus)|ephedra]]), but did not outright condemn completely either practice in moderate forms.<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sacrifice-i|title=SACRIFICE i.

After this, Vohu Manah took him to the other six Amesha Spentas, where he received the completion of his vision.<ref>Boyce (1979), p. 19</ref> This vision radically transformed his view of the world, and he tried to teach this view to others. Zoroaster believed in one supreme creator deity and acknowledged this creator's emanations ([[Amesha Spenta]]) and other divinities which he called Ahuras ([[Yazata]]). Some of the deities of the old religion, the ''[[Daevas]]'' (''Devas'' in Sanskrit), appeared to delight in war and strife and were condemned as evil workers of Angra Mainyu by Zoroaster.\n\nZoroaster's ideas were not taken up quickly; he originally only had one convert: his cousin Maidhyoimanha.<ref>Boyce (1979), pp. 30\u201331</ref> The local religious authorities opposed his ideas, considering that their faith, power, and particularly their rituals were threatened by Zoroaster's teaching against the bad and overly-complicated ritualization of religious ceremonies. Many did not like Zoroaster's downgrading of the Daevas to evil ones not worthy of worship. After twelve years of little success, Zoroaster left his home.\n\nIn the country of King [[Vishtaspa]], the king and queen heard Zoroaster debating with the religious leaders of the land and decided to accept Zoroaster's ideas as the official religion of their kingdom after having Zoroaster prove himself by healing the king's favorite horse. Zoroaster is believed to have died in his late 70s, either by murder by a [[Turan]]ian or old age. Very little is known of the time between Zoroaster and the [[Achaemenian]] period, except that Zoroastrianism spread to Western Iran and other regions. By the time of the founding of the Achaemenid Empire, Zoroastrianism is believed to have been already a well-established religion.\n\n=== Cypress of Kashmar ===\n{{Main|Cypress of Kashmar}}\nThe Cypress of Kashmar is a mythical cypress tree of legendary beauty and gargantuan dimensions. It is said to have sprung from a branch brought by [[Zoroaster]] from Paradise and to have stood in today's Kashmar in northeastern Iran and to have been planted by Zoroaster in honor of the conversion of [[Vishtaspa|King Vishtaspa]] to Zoroastrianism. According to the Iranian physicist and historian [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] King Vishtaspa had been a patron of Zoroaster who planted the tree himself. In his ''[[\u02bfAj\u0101'ib al-makhl\u016bq\u0101t wa ghar\u0101'ib al-mawj\u016bd\u0101t]]'', he further describes how the [[Al-Mutawakkil]] in 247 AH ([[861|861 AD]]) caused the mighty cypress to be felled, and then transported it across Iran, to be used for beams in his new palace at [[Samarra]]. Before, he wanted the tree to be reconstructed before his eyes. This was done in spite of protests by the Iranians, who offered a very high sum of money to save the tree. Al-Mutawakkil never saw the cypress, because he was murdered by a [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] soldier (possibly in the employ of his son) on the night when it arrived on the banks of the Tigris.<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org23\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenassay.com/tag/cypress-of-kashmar/|title=The Destruction of Sacred Trees|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=www.goldenassay.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=6 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Climate-Data.org222\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zoroastrian.org.uk/vohuman/Library/The%20Cypress%20of%20Kashmar%20and%20Zoroaster.htm|title=The Cypress of Kashmar and Zoroaster|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=www.zoroastrian.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=6 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Principal beliefs==\nHumata, Huxta, Huvarshta (Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds), the Threefold Path of Asha, is considered the core maxim of Zoroastrianism especially by modern practitioners. In Zoroastrianism, good transpires for those who do righteous deeds for its own sake, not for the search of reward. Those who do evil are said to be attacked and confused by the druj and are responsible for aligning themselves back to Asha by following this path.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n[[File:Faravahar.svg|thumb|right|[[Faravahar]] (or Ferohar), one of the primary symbols of Zoroastrianism, believed to be the depiction of a ''[[Fravashi]]'' or the ''[[Khvarenah]].'']]\nIn Zoroastrianism, [[Ahura Mazda]] is the beginning and the end, the creator of everything that can and cannot be seen, the eternal and uncreated, the all-good and source of Asha.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the [[Gathas]], the most sacred texts of Zoroastrianism thought to have been composed by Zoroaster himself, Zoroaster acknowledged the highest devotion to Ahura Mazda, with worship and adoration also given to Ahura Mazda's manifestations ([[Amesha Spenta]]) and the other ahuras ([[Yazata]]) that support Ahura Mazda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gathas|title=GATHAS |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\n''[[Daena]]'' (''din'' in modern [[Persian language|Persian]] and meaning \"that which is seen\") is representative of the sum of one's spiritual conscience and attributes, which through one's choice Asha is either strengthened or weakened in the Daena.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/den|title=D\u0112N |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> Traditionally, the ''manthras'', spiritual prayer formulas, are believed to be of immense power and the vehicles of Asha and creation used to maintain good and fight evil.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/zoroastrian-rituals|title=ZOROASTRIAN RITUALS |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> ''Daena'' should not be confused with the fundamental principle of ''[[Asha]]'', believed to be the cosmic order which governs and permeates all existence, and the concept of which governed the life of the ancient Indo-Iranians. For these, ''asha'' was the course of everything observable\u2014the motion of the planets and astral bodies; the progression of the seasons; and the pattern of daily nomadic herdsman life, governed by regular metronomic events such as sunrise and sunset, and was strengthened through truth-telling and following the Threefold Path.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAll physical creation (''geti''g) was thus determined to run according to a master plan\u2014inherent to Ahura Mazda\u2014and violations of the order (''druj'') were violations against creation, and thus violations against Ahura Mazda.<ref name=\":14\" /> This concept of ''asha'' versus the ''druj'' should not be confused with Western and especially Abrahamic notions of good versus evil, for although both forms of opposition express moral conflict, the ''asha'' versus ''druj'' concept is more systemic and less personal, representing, for instance, chaos (that opposes order); or \"uncreation\", evident as natural decay (that opposes creation); or more simply \"the lie\" (that opposes truth and goodness).<ref name=\":5\" /> Moreover, in the role as the one uncreated creator of all, Ahura Mazda is not the creator of ''druj'', which is \"nothing\", anti-creation, and thus (likewise) uncreated and developed as the antithesis of existence through choice.<ref name=\":6\" />\n[[File:Parsee Wedding 1905.jpg|thumb|left|A ''[[Parsi people|Parsi]]'' Wedding, 1905]]\n\nIn this [[Model (abstract)|schema]] of ''asha'' versus ''druj'', mortal beings (both humans and animals) play a critical role, for they too are created. Here, in their lives, they are active participants in the conflict, and it is their spiritual duty to defend Asha, which is under constant assault and would decay in strength without counter''action''.<ref name=\":5\" /> Throughout the [[Gathas]], Zoroaster emphasizes deeds and actions within society and accordingly extreme [[asceticism]] is frowned upon in Zoroastrianism but moderate forms are allowed within.<ref name=\":15\" /> This was explained as fleeing from the experiences and joys of life, which was the very purpose that the ''urvan'' (most commonly translated as the \"soul\") was sent into the mortal world to collect. The avoidance of any aspect of life which does not bring harm to another and engage in activities that support the druj, which includes the avoidance of the pleasures of life, is a shirking of the responsibility and duty to oneself, one's ''urvan'', and one's family and social obligations.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nCentral to Zoroastrianism is the emphasis on moral choice, to choose the responsibility and duty for which one is in the mortal world, or to give up this duty and so facilitate the work of ''druj''. Similarly, [[predestination]] is rejected in Zoroastrian teaching and the absolute free will of all conscious beings is core, with even divine beings having the ability to choose. Humans bear responsibility for all situations they are in, and in the way they act toward one another. Reward, punishment, happiness, and grief all depend on how individuals live their lives.<ref name=Cavendish />\n\nIn the 19th century, through contact with Western academics and missionaries, Zoroastrianism experienced a massive theological change that still affects it today. The [[John Wilson (Scottish missionary)|Rev. John Wilson]] led various missionary campaigns in India against the Parsi community, disparaging the Parsis for their \"[[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]\" and \"polytheism\" and as having unnecessary rituals while declaring the Avesta to not be \"divinely inspired\". This caused mass dismay in the relatively uneducated Parsi community, which blamed its priests and led to some conversions towards Christianity. The arrival of the German [[oriental studies|orientalist]] and [[Philology|philologist]] [[Martin Haug]] led to a rallied defense of the faith through Haug's reinterpretation of the Avesta through Christianized and European orientalist lens. Haug postulated that Zoroastrianism was solely monotheistic with all other divinities reduced to the status of angels while Ahura Mazda became both omnipotent and the source of evil as well as good. Haug's thinking was subsequently disseminated as a Parsi interpretation, thus corroborating Haug's theory, and the idea became so popular that it is now almost universally accepted as doctrine though being reevaluated in modern Zoroastrianism and academia.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThroughout Zoroastrian history, [[shrines]] and [[Fire temple|temples]] have been the focus of worship and pilgrimage for adherents of the religion. Early Zoroastrians were recorded as worshiping in the 5th century BCE on mounds and hills where fires were lit below the open skies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=1:chapter=131|title=Herodotus, The Histories, Book 1, chapter 131|website=Perseus Digital Library|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> In the wake of Achaemenid expansion, shrines were constructed throughout the empire and particularly influenced the role of [[Mithra]], [[Aredvi Sura Anahita]], [[Verethragna]] and [[Tishtrya]], alongside other traditional Yazata who all have hymns within the Avesta and also local deities and culture-heroes. Today, enclosed and covered fire temples tend to be the focus of community worship where fires of varying grades are maintained by the clergy assigned to the temples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ataskada-new-persian-house-of-fire-mid|title=\u0100TA\u0160KADA |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\n===Cosmology: Creation of the universe===\nAccording to the Zoroastrian [[creation myth]], [[Ahura Mazda]] existed in light and goodness above, while [[Angra Mainyu]] existed in darkness and ignorance below. They have existed independently of each other for all time, and manifest contrary substances. Ahura Mazda first manifested seven divine beings called ''[[Amesha Spenta]]s'', who support him and represent beneficent aspects of personality and creation, along with numerous ''[[Yazata]]s'', divinities worthy of worship. Ahura Mazda then created the material and visible world itself in order to ensnare evil. Ahura Mazda created the floating, egg-shaped universe in two parts: first the spiritual (''menog'') and 3,000 years later, the physical (''getig''). Ahura Mazda then created [[Keyumars|Gayomard]], the archetypical perfect man, and [[Gavaevodata]], the primordial bovine.<ref name=Cavendish>{{Citation|title=Mythology: an Illustrated Encyclopedia |pages=40\u201345 |first1=Richard |last1=Cavendish |first2=Trevor Oswald |last2=Ling |publisher=Rizzoli |year=1980 |isbn=978-0847802869 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GdEnAAAAYAAJ}}</ref>\n\nWhile Ahura Mazda created the universe and humankind, Angra Mainyu, whose very nature is to destroy, miscreated demons, evil ''daevas'', and noxious creatures (''khrafstar'') such as snakes, ants, and flies. Angra Mainyu created an opposite, evil being for each good being, except for humans, which he found he could not match. Angra Mainyu invaded the universe through the base of the sky, inflicting Gayomard and the bull with suffering and death. However, the evil forces were trapped in the universe and could not retreat. The dying primordial man and bovine emitted seeds, which were protect by [[Mah]], the Moon. From the bull's seed grew all beneficial plants and animals of the world and from the man's seed grew a plant whose leaves became the [[Mashya and Mashyana|first human couple]]. Humans thus struggle in a two-fold universe of the material and spiritual trapped and in long combat with evil. The evils of this physical world are not products of an inherent weakness, but are the fault of Angra Mainyu's assault on creation. This assault turned the perfectly flat, peaceful, and ever day-lit world into a mountainous, violent place that is half night.<ref name=Cavendish />\n\n===Eschatology: Renovation and judgment===\n{{main|Frashokereti}}\nZoroastrianism also includes beliefs about the [[eschatology|renovation of the world]] ([[Frashokereti]]) and individual judgment (cf. [[general judgment|general]] and [[particular judgment]]), including the [[resurrection of the dead]], which are alluded to in the Gathas but developed in later Avestan and Middle Persian writings.\n\nIndividual judgment at death is at the [[Chinvat Bridge]] (\"bridge of judgement\" or \"bridge of choice\"), which each human must cross, facing a spiritual judgment, though modern belief is split as to whether it is representative of a mental decision during life to choose between good and evil or an afterworld location. Humans' actions under their free will through choice determine the outcome. According to tradition, the soul is judged by the Yazatas [[Mithra]], [[Sraosha]], and [[Rashnu]], where depending on the verdict one is either greeted at the bridge by a beautiful, sweet-smelling maiden or by an ugly, foul-smelling old hag representing their [[Daena]] affected by their actions in life. The maiden leads the dead safely across the bridge, which widens and becomes pleasant for the righteous, towards the House of Song. The hag leads the dead down a bridge that narrows to a razor's edge and is full of stench until the departed falls off into the abyss towards the House of Lies.<ref name=Cavendish/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cinwad-puhl-av|title=\u010cINWAD PUHL |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> Those with a balance of good and evil go to [[Hamistagan]], a neutral place of waiting where according to the [[Dadestan-i Denig]], a Middle Persian work from the 9th century, the souls of the departed can relive their lives and conduct good deeds to raise themselves towards the House of Song or await the final judgement and the mercy of Ahura Mazda.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/mp/dd.htm|title=Dadestan-i Denig ('Religious Decisions'): Chapters 1-41|website=Avesta|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\nThe House of Lies is considered temporary and reformative; punishments fit the crimes, and souls do not rest in eternal damnation.

The world will fall into winter, and Angra Mainyu's most fearsome miscreant, [[Azi Dahaka]], will break free and terrorize the world.<ref name=Cavendish />\n\nAccording to legend, the final savior of the world, known as the [[Saoshyant]], will be born to a virgin impregnated by the seed of Zoroaster while bathing in a lake. The Saoshyant will raise the dead\u2014including those in all afterworlds\u2014for final judgment, returning the wicked to hell to be purged of bodily sin. Next, all will wade through a river of molten metal in which the righteous will not burn but through which the impure will be completely purified.

When the Islamic armies, under the first caliphs, invaded Persia, those locals who were unwilling to convert to Islam sought refuge, first in the mountains of Northern Iran, then the regions of Yazd and its surrounding villages. Later, in the ninth century CE, a group sought refuge in the western coastal region of India, and also scattered to other regions of the world.\nFollowing the fall of the [[Sassanid Empire]] in 651 CE, many Zoroastrians migrated. Among them were several groups who ventured to [[Gujarat]] on the western shores of the [[Indian subcontinent]], where they finally settled. The descendants of those refugees are today known as the Parsis. The year of arrival on the subcontinent cannot be precisely established, and Parsi legend and tradition assigns various dates to the event.\n\nIn the Indian census of 2001, the Parsis numbered 69,601, representing about 0.006% of the total population of India, with a concentration in and around the city of [[Mumbai]]. Due to a low birth rate and high rate of [[emigration]], demographic trends project that by 2020 the Parsis will number only about 23,000 or 0.002% of the total population of India.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n=Squadron History=\n\n==1950s==\n\n===Roots===\n[[File:Consolidated PB4Y-2 Naval Aviation Museum.jpg|left|thumb|PB4Y-2 BuNo 66261 (marked as BuNo 66304) in the collection of the [[National Naval Aviation Museum]] at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]].]]\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified [[PB4Y-2 Privateer|PB4Y-2 Privateers]]<ref name=\"Donald\">Donald</ref> from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall]], [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden]], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig]], and [[RAF Hal Far|Malta]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=\"East\"/>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"StaHypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />. All sixteen aircrew were killed.\n# On 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

The aircraft iced up, the engines flamed out, and it stalled into a spin. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed. Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]].

The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">{{Cite web|title =Accident Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior 142670, 04 Jun 1968|url =https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670|website = aviation-safety.net|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>\n# In the summer of 1968, a rocket attack on Danang damaged the nose and cockpit of EA-3B (BUNO 144848)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />. DET BRAVO shipped the airframe to CONUS for repairs via sealift. In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===Continued Change===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nThe 1970s also saw an increase in the number of women assigned to the squadron. Through the decade, female officers and sailors provided valuable support at the squadron's homeport. As the number of women grew, the command took over an entire floor in one of the barracks on base for its enlisted women.\n\nThe host nation was also changing. In November 1975, Franco died and [[Juan Carlos I]] ascended the throne. Spain began a new era of democracy and engagement with the rest of Western Europe.\n\nThe EC-121Ms' career in the command had been a second lease on life since the airframes when acquired by VQ-2On 31 July 1971 were over ten years old<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"VQH\" />. These twenty-year plus planes were failing to meet the reconnaissance demands placed upon the squadron. On 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> These EP-3s were converted from [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3A and P-3B]] airframes. This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s, the availability of parts, and the lower flight hours on the aircraft. It would take five years until the final EP-3E arrived in Rota. By the end of 1974, enough Aries were in Rota to let VQ-2 to stop operating its EC-121Ms. \n\nIn May of 1972, VQ-2 also received a TA-3B and a UP-3A to use for crew training and logistics. These aircraft flew regularly from Rota on local flights as well as airlifts and parts runs to various detachments ashore and afloat. Of note, after 1974, the detachment at Incirlik, relocated to [[Hellenikon Air Base|Athens]]. Due to Greece's popularity with British vacationers, the squadron saw an increase in intermarriage between its sailors and British nationals as well as with host nation citizens.\n\n===Continued Crisis===\n\nIn this decade, the Cold War continued with a lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union due to the Nixon administration's police of the [[D\u00e9tente|d\u00e9tente]]. While this reduced the frequency of operations in the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Germany, the decade was frequently marked by international crises in the Mediterranean. Notable among these were the fallout from [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat| the 1969 coup in Libya]], the [[Black September|1970 Jordan Crisis]], the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]], the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|1974 crisis in Cyprus]], and the [[Lebanese Civil War|multiple flare ups]] in Lebanon. The US Sixth Fleet and its NATO allies maintained a presence offshore in response to all these crises. \n\nDespite d\u00e9tente, the Soviet Union was conducting a program of providing significant amounts of military hardware to its client states of Libya, Syria (which had intervened with troops in Lebanon as the bulk of an [[Arab Deterrent Force]]), and Egypt. At the same time, the Soviet Navy continued increasing its presence in the Mediterranean. While Egypt left the Soviet fold after the Yom Kippur War, the buildups on the levane and North Africa made the Central and Eastern Mediterranean hot spots for VQ-2's monitoring of Soviet naval units as well as activities ashore. As a result high tempo operations lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nIn the Eastern Mediterranean and Levant, Palestinian terrorist attacks into Israel from Lebanon ratcheted up the stress in Arab\u00ad/Israeli relations. As the attacks continued, the squadron increased its patrols along the Levant. The situation exploded into the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict|Israeli invasion of Lebanon.]]  After the Israeli withdrawal from the [[Litani River]], the defeated [[PLO|PLO ]] was replaced by [[Hezbollah]] as Israel's main antagonist in Lebanon. Hezbollah received significant backing from Iran as well as Syria which still had troops in the country.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. The [[Iran hostage crisis|seizing of hostages at the embassy in Tehran]] further exacerbated tensions leading to VQ-2 manning of Indian Ocean carrier and Diego Garcia detachments alongside VQ-1.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nAlthough the decade was less lethal than its predecessor, VQ-2 suffered the twelve aircrew fatalities and lost three aircraft in mishaps.\n# On 26 February 1970, EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/> \n# On 8 March 1974, EA-3B (BUNO 142257)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America '']]  in the Mediterranean. A cable parted in the [[Arresting gear]] when the tailhook caught the wire. The pilot who had begun retarding the throttles to idle as per standard procedure, slammed them forward managing to regain enough airspeed to get the plane off the angle and ditch it in the water off to the port side. This allowed the plane to avoid being run over by the ship. The America's plane guard helicopter recovered all the aircrew. The airframe continued to float and was deemed a hazard to navigation forcing the ship to have one of its [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|A-7A]]' strafe it to sink it<ref name=\"VQH\" />. \n# On 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\n===Constant Change===\nThe 1980s saw VQ-2 continue flying the EP-3E and EA-3B aircraft at a high tempo. The squadron maintained a permanent detachment in Athens, but unlike its sister squadron, VQ-1 who had a permanently assigned Officer-in-Charge (OIC) at its [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi|Atsugi]] detachment, VQ-2 rotated its OIC with the aircrews. Throughout the decade, the squadron regular had detachments at [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildenhall]], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig]], [[Naval Air Station Keflavik|Keflavik]], [[RAF Machrihanish|Machrihanish]], and [[Naval Air Station Sigonella|Sigonella]]. The squadron also manned detachments on all Sixth Fleet carriers until October 1987, when the Navy deemed the A-3 no longer capable of safe, routine carrier operations after multiple mishaps with high loss of life in the active and reserve A-3 community.\n\nWomen continued to play an ever greater and important role in squadron operations. As the decade progressed, women routinely deployed to land-based detachments. Another milestone came at the end of the decade when the authorization for women to fly in combat support aircraft was extended to the EP-3E. Female pilots, NFOs, and aircrew began arriving and deploying in the Spring of 1989. .\n\n===Eastern and Central Med Hot Spots===\n\nAt the beginning of the decade, the command had detachments covering the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the Indian Ocean, and the Persian Gulf. Over the following years, the squadron would have its most dynamic and productive period during peacetime operations. \n\nThe Soviet Union's reaction to the start of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity trade union]] in Poland created tensions which combined with the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan to effectively end d\u00e9tente. Missions into the Baltic increased as a result. With d\u00e9tente over, VQ-2 saw a buildup in the Soviet Navy's activity level and modernization, all  of which kept the squadron's assets stretched thin. Also as result of the end of d\u00e9tente, there was an increase of Soviet and Cuban activity in the Western Hemisphere. Poor relations with the new pro-Soviet [[Sandinista]] regime saw detachments run out Panama as well as Key West.\n\nThe resolution of the Hostage Crisis and the onset of the [[Iran Iraq War]] lessened Iranian focus on the US which ended the Diego Garcia detachment, but the command would still have assets in the region when an East Coast carrier relieved a Pacific Fleet carrier the Indian Ocean. The terrorist threat from Iran would continue throughout the region.\n\nIn June 1982, after repeated terrorist attacks launched from Lebanon, Israel launched [[1982 Lebanon War|another invasion of Lebanon]]. The Israeli Air Force also launched an [[Operation Mole Cricket 19|air campaign in the Bekaa]] that gored the Syrian air force and air defence system<ref name=\"East\" />. With the IDF reaching Beirut, a diplomatic solution ended the conflict by removing the PLO to [[Tunisia]]. \n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005. The relocation of VQ-2's six aircraft and 450 Sailors to the United States was in keeping with the Navy's ongoing transformation of forces in [[Europe]] and helped reduce costs and eliminate redundancies throughout its force structure worldwide. The move co-located the squadron with [[VQ-1]], already based at NAS Whidbey Island, and realized efficiency through the consolidation of personnel deployment practices, aircraft maintenance practices, and aircrew training for these unique Navy squadrons.<ref>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Scheduled for Homeport Change|url = http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=18681|website = www.navy.mil|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\n==2010s==\nThe squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012 ending 57 years of service.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall]], [[Lucius D.

At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=\"East\"/>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"StaHypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />. All sixteen aircrew were killed.\n# On 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

To observers on the ground, WV-2Q seemed explode with the tail separating from the main fuselage over [[Markt Schwaben]], 17 km south of Munich Airport. The main fuselage and tail section crashed several hundred yards apart in fields southwest of the town. The aircraft was totally destroyed killing all twenty-two Navy and four Army aircrew.

The aircraft iced up, the engines flamed out, and it stalled into a spin. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed. Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew aboard were lost at sea.\n# Returning from a mission along the East German/Czech border in the during the \"[[Prague Spring]]\" of 1968, an EA-3B was entering the landing pattern at Ramstein AFB when it had a slat malfunction pitching nose-up turn.<ref name=\"East\" />.  With the plane seeming to enter a stall, the pilot signalled for a crew bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed but at 1200 feet altitude. Again, just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the slat suddenly operated allowing a recovery at Ramstein. Although bailing out at a low altitude, the four back end crew survived.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">{{Cite web|title =Accident Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior 142670, 04 Jun 1968|url =https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670|website = aviation-safety.net|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>\n# In the summer of 1968, a rocket attack on Danang damaged the nose and cockpit of EA-3B (BUNO 144848)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />. DET BRAVO shipped the airframe to CONUS for repairs via sealift. In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===Continued Change===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nThe 1970s also saw an increase in the number of women assigned to the squadron. Through the decade, female officers and sailors provided valuable support at the squadron's homeport. As the number of women grew, the command took over an entire floor in one of the barracks on base for its enlisted women.\n\nThe host nation was also changing. In November 1975, Franco died and [[Juan Carlos I]] ascended the throne. Spain began a new era of democracy and engagement with the rest of Western Europe.\n\nThe EC-121Ms' career in the command had been a second lease on life since the airframes when acquired by VQ-2On 31 July 1971 were over ten years old<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"VQH\" />. These twenty-year plus planes were failing to meet the reconnaissance demands placed upon the squadron. On 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> These EP-3s were converted from [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3A and P-3B]] airframes. This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s, the availability of parts, and the lower flight hours on the aircraft. It would take five years until the final EP-3E arrived in Rota. By the end of 1974, enough Aries were in Rota to let VQ-2 to stop operating its EC-121Ms. \n\nIn May of 1972, VQ-2 also received a TA-3B and a UP-3A to use for crew training and logistics. These aircraft flew regularly from Rota on local flights as well as airlifts and parts runs to various detachments ashore and afloat. Of note, after 1974, the detachment at Incirlik, relocated to [[Hellenikon Air Base|Athens]]. Due to Greece's popularity with British vacationers, the squadron saw an increase in intermarriage between its sailors and British nationals as well as with host nation citizens.\n\n===Continued Crisis===\n\nIn this decade, the Cold War continued with a lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union due to the Nixon administration's police of the [[D\u00e9tente|d\u00e9tente]]. While this reduced the frequency of operations in the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Germany, the decade was frequently marked by international crises in the Mediterranean. Notable among these were the fallout from [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat| the 1969 coup in Libya]], the [[Black September|1970 Jordan Crisis]], the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]], the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|1974 crisis in Cyprus]], and the [[Lebanese Civil War|multiple flare ups]] in Lebanon. The US Sixth Fleet and its NATO allies maintained a presence offshore in response to all these crises. \n\nDespite d\u00e9tente, the Soviet Union was conducting a program of providing significant amounts of military hardware to its client states of Libya, Syria (which had intervened with troops in Lebanon as the bulk of an [[Arab Deterrent Force]]), and Egypt. At the same time, the Soviet Navy continued increasing its presence in the Mediterranean. While Egypt left the Soviet fold after the Yom Kippur War, the buildups on the levane and North Africa made the Central and Eastern Mediterranean hot spots for VQ-2's monitoring of Soviet naval units as well as activities ashore. As a result high tempo operations lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nIn the the Eastern Mediterranean and Levant, Palestinian terrorist attacks into Israel from Lebanon ratcheted up the stress in Arab\u00ad/Israeli relations. As the attacks continued, the squadron increased its patrols along the Levant. The situation exploded into the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict|Israeli invasion of Lebanon.]]  After the Israeli withdrawal from the [[Litani River]], the defeated [[PLO|PLO ]] was replaced by [[Hezbollah]] as Israel's main antagonist in Lebanon. Hezbollah received significant backing from Iran as well as Syria which still had troops in the country.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. The [[Iran hostage crisis|seizing of hostages at the embassy in Tehran]] further exacerbated tensions leading to VQ-2 manning of Indian Ocean carrier and Diego Garcia detachments alongside VQ-1.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nAlthough the decade was less lethal than its predecessor, VQ-2 suffered the twelve aircrew fatalities and lost three aircraft in mishaps.\n# On 26 February 1970, EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/> \n# On 8 March 1974, EA-3B (BUNO 142257)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America '']]  in the Mediterranean. A cable parted in the [[Arresting gear]] when the tailhook caught the wire. The pilot who had begun retarding the throttles to idle as per standard procedure, slammed them forward managing to regain enough airspeed to get the plane off the angle and ditch it in the water off to the port side. This allowed the plane to avoid being run over by the ship. The America's plane guard helicopter recovered all the aircrew. The airframe continued to float and was deemed a hazard to navigation forcing the ship to have one of its [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|A-7A]]' strafe it to sink it<ref name=\"VQH\" />. \n# On 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\n===Constant Change===\nThe 1980s saw VQ-2 continue flying the EP-3E and EA-3B aircraft at a high tempo. The squadron maintained a permanent detachment in Athens, but unlike its sister squadron, VQ-1 who had a permanently assigned Officer-in-Charge (OIC) at its [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi|Atsugi]] detachment, VQ-2 rotated its OIC with the aircrews. Throughout the decade, the squadron regular had detachments at [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildenhall]], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig]], [[Naval Air Station Keflavik|Keflavik]], [[RAF Machrihanish|Machrihanish]], and [[Naval Air Station Sigonella|Sigonella]]. The squadron also manned detachments on all Sixth Fleet carriers until October 1987, when the Navy deemed the A-3 no longer capable of safe, routine carrier operations after multiple mishaps with high loss of life in the active and reserve A-3 community.\n\nWomen continued to play an ever greater and important role in squadron operations. As the decade progressed, women routinely deployed to land-based detachments. Another milestone came at the end of the decade when the authorization for women to fly in combat support aircraft was extended to the EP-3E. Female pilots, NFOs, and aircrew began arriving and deploying in the Spring of 1989. .\n\n===Eastern and Central Med Hot Spots===\n\nAt the beginning of the decade, the command had detachments covering the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the Indian Ocean, and the Persian Gulf. Over the following years, the squadron would have its most dynamic and productive period during peacetime operations. \n\nThe Soviet Union's reaction to the start of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity trade union]] in Poland created tensions which combined with the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan to effectively end d\u00e9tente. Missions into the Baltic increased as a result. With d\u00e9tente over, VQ-2 saw a buildup in the Soviet Navy's activity level and modernization, all  of which kept the squadron's assets stretched thin. Also as result of the end of d\u00e9tente, there was an increase of Soviet and Cuban activity in the Western Hemisphere. Poor relations with the new pro-Soviet [[Sandinista]] regime saw detachments run out Panama as well as Key West.\n\nThe resolution of the Hostage Crisis and the onset of the [[Iran Iraq War]] lessened Iranian focus on the US which ended the Diego Garcia detachment, but the command would still have assets in the region when an East Coast carrier relieved a Pacific Fleet carrier the Indian Ocean. The terrorist threat from Iran would continue throughout the region.\n\nIn June 1982, after repeated terrorist attacks launched from Lebanon, Israel launched [[1982 Lebanon War|another invasion of Lebanon]]. The Israeli Air Force also launched an [[Operation Mole Cricket 19|air campaign in the Bekaa]] that gored the Syrian air force and air defence system<ref name=\"East\" />. With the IDF reaching Beirut, a diplomatic solution ended the conflict by removing the PLO to [[Tunisia]]. \n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005. The relocation of VQ-2's six aircraft and 450 Sailors to the United States was in keeping with the Navy's ongoing transformation of forces in [[Europe]] and helped reduce costs and eliminate redundancies throughout its force structure worldwide. The move co-located the squadron with [[VQ-1]], already based at NAS Whidbey Island, and realized efficiency through the consolidation of personnel deployment practices, aircraft maintenance practices, and aircrew training for these unique Navy squadrons.<ref>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Scheduled for Homeport Change|url = http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=18681|website = www.navy.mil|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\n==2010s==\nThe squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012 ending 57 years of service.

He attended [[Lake Forest College]] and [[Northwestern University]], but his interest was always in show business.

The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]] in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced [[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|a musical version]] of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars. Carr also first hired comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]] as head comedy writer of the show, a job Vilanch still held as of 2015 (Vilanch was redeemed the following year since his old friend Billy Crystal hosted for his first of many times: with Vilanch as his head writer).\n\n==Later work==\nThat same year Carr helmed the project ''Goya...A Life in Song'' with Freddie Gershon and CBS Records, a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by [[Maury Yeston]] (''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'') and featuring [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as artist [[Francisco Goya]].  Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Kennedy Center]] and Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-30-mn-51594-story.html Allan Carr; Producer of 'Grease' and 'La Cage aux Folles' - Los Angeles Times]</ref>, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-allan-carr-1105920.html Obituary: Allan Carr|The Independent]</ref>\nCarr had returned to [[Paramount Pictures]] to handle the re-release of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1998, which included producing a [[VH1]] television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood \"premiere\" screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.\n\n==Production career==\nCarr was a film producer for numerous movies, including:\n*''[[The First Time (1969 film)|The First Time]]'' (1969)\n*''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984)\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCarr died on June 29, 1999, in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Y/> At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and was working on bringing [[Ken Ludwig]]'s Tony-winning comedy ''[[Lend Me a Tenor]]'' to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, ''The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\nHis ashes were scattered at sea by Ann-Margret, Roger Smith and Martin Menard in front of his former Diamond Head estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2017 a documentary about Carr's life was released entitled ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]]''.

Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced [[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|a musical version]] of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars. Carr also first hired comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]] as head comedy writer of the show, a job Vilanch still held as of 2015 (Vilanch was redeemed the following year since his old friend Billy Crystal hosted for his first of many times: with Vilanch as his head writer).\n\n==Later work==\nThat same year Carr helmed the project ''Goya...A Life in Song'' with Freddie Gershon and CBS Records, a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by [[Maury Yeston]] (''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'') and featuring [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as artist [[Francisco Goya]].  Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Kennedy Center]] and Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-30-mn-51594-story.html Allan Carr; Producer of 'Grease' and 'La Cage aux Folles' - Los Angeles Times]</ref>, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-allan-carr-1105920.html Obituary: Allan Carr|The Independent]</ref>\nCarr had returned to [[Paramount Pictures]] to handle the re-release of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1998, which included producing a [[VH1]] television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood \"premiere\" screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.\n\n==Production career==\nCarr was a film producer for numerous movies, including:\n*''[[The First Time (1969 film)|The First Time]]'' (1969)\n*''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984)\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCarr died on June 29, 1999, in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Y/> At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and was working on bringing [[Ken Ludwig]]'s Tony-winning comedy ''[[Lend Me a Tenor]]'' to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, ''The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\nHis ashes were scattered at sea by Ann-Margret, Roger Smith and Martin Menard in front of his former Diamond Head estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2017 a documentary about Carr's life was released entitled ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]]''.  The director of ''The Fabulous Allan Carr'' [[Jeffrey Schwarz]] said, \"Although it was no secret that Allan Carr was gay, he never formally acknowledged it publicly.
