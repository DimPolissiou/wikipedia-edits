away.\" were widely quoted by his peers and by critics.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} \n\nThe electric sets were recorded during the Neil Young/Crazy Horse tour in late 1978, with [[overdub]]s

Two songs from the album were not recorded live: \"Sail Away\" was recorded without Crazy Horse during or after the ''[[Comes a Time]]'' recording sessions,<ref name=\"hrc\">{{cite web |url=http://hyperrust.org/Chronology/The70s.html |title=HyperRust chronology |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref>  and \"Pocahontas\" had been recorded solo in 1976<ref name=\"hrc\"/> (original recording without overdubs was released in 2017 on archival release ''[[Hitchhiker (album)|Hitchhiker]]'').{{cn|date=October 2019}}}\n\nAfter his final performance at the The Boarding House on May 28th, Young collaborated with the [[art punk]] band [[Devo]] on a cacophonous version of \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" at the [[Different Fur]] studio in San Francisco and, would later introduce the song to Crazy Horse.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} During the Different Fur studio session, Devo vocalist [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] added the lyrics \"Rust never sleeps\", a slogan he remembered from his graphic arts career promoting the automobile rust proofing product [[Rust-Oleum]]. Young adopted the line and used it in his Crazy Horse version of the song, as well as for the title of his album.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531}} The lyrics, \"It's better to burn out than to fade away.\" were widely quoted by his peers and by critics.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} \n\nThe electric sets were recorded during the Neil Young/Crazy Horse tour in late 1978, with [[overdub]]s added later.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp= 538}} Audience noise is removed as much as possible, although it is clearly audible at certain points, most noticeably on the opening and closing songs. \n\n==

The next year he applied for citizenship and answered questions honestly, saying he would accept non-combatant duties like loading ships with food. The fact that he had volunteered for service with the Medical Corps also helped. At the naturalisation ceremony, he found he was required to swear to defend the nation and decided to take the oath since he had already stated his objections and reservations. He became an American citizen on 8 November 1946.<ref>Bucknell (ed.), pp.40, 77\u20138</ref>\n\nHe began living with the photographer William \"Bill\" Caskey. In 1947, the two traveled to South America. Isherwood wrote the prose and Caskey took the photographs for a 1949 book about their journey entitled ''The Condor and the Cows''.\n\nOn [[Valentine's Day]] 1953, at the age of 48, he met the teenager [[Don Bachardy]] among a group of friends on the beach at [[Santa Monica]].

Isherwood also taught a course on modern English literature at Los Angeles State College (now [[California State University, Los Angeles]]) for several years during the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nThe 30-year [[age disparity in sexual relationships|age difference]] between Isherwood and Bachardy raised eyebrows at the time, with Bachardy, in his own words, \"regarded as a sort of child prostitute,\"<ref>[http://amanidreamtup.blogspot.com/2008/11/first-couple-don-bachardy-and.html \"The First Couple: Don Bachardy and Christopher Isherwood\"], by [[Armistead Maupin]], ''[[The Village Voice]],'' Volume 30, Number 16, 2 July 1985.</ref> but the two became a well-known and well-established couple in [[Southern California]]n society with many Hollywood friends.\n\n''Down There on a Visit'', a novel published in 1962, comprised four related stories that overlap the period covered in his Berlin stories. In the opinion of many reviewers, Isherwood's finest achievement was his 1964 novel ''[[A Single Man (novel)|A Single Man]]'', that depicted a day in the life of George, a middle-aged, gay Englishman who is a professor at a Los Angeles university.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/8751943/The-Britons-who-made-their-mark-on-LA.html|title=The Britons who made their mark on LA|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=11 September 2011|access-date=5 July 2018|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> The novel was adapted into the film, ''[[A Single Man]]'', in 2009.

Isherwood was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in 1981, and died of the disease on 4 January 1986 at his Santa Monica home, aged 81.

They wrote macabre, surrealistic stories about Mortmere to entertain each other, as Isherwood made legendary in his early autobiography, ''Lions and Shadows'' (1938).<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, ''Lions and Shadows'', 2013, Vintage, p. 71-82.</ref> He went up to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], as a history scholar, wrote jokes and limericks on his second year [[Tripos]] and was asked to leave without a degree in 1925.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, ''Lions and Shadows'', 2013, Vintage, p. 93-98.</ref>\n\nAt Christmas 1925, he was reintroduced to a prep school friend, [[W. H.

This was ''All the Conspirators'', published in 1928, about the struggle for self-determination between children and their parents. In October 1928, Isherwood enrolled as a medical student at [[King's College London]], but he left after six months.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, ''Lions and Shadows'', 2013, Vintage, p. 235.</ref>\n\nIn March 1929, Isherwood joined Auden in Berlin, where Auden was spending a post-graduate year.

He also continued his habit of keeping a diary.

''Goodbye to Berlin'' included stories published in the leftist magazine, ''New Writing'', and it included Isherwood's 1937 novella ''Sally Bowles'', in which he created his most famous character, based on a young Englishwoman, [[Jean Ross]],<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, ''Christopher and His Kind'', 2012, Vintage, p. 61.</ref> with whom he briefly shared a flat.\n\nIn America, the Berlin novels were published together as ''[[The Berlin Stories]]'' in 1945.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Diaries: Volume One: 1939-1960, 2011, Vintage, p. 910.</ref> In 1951, ''Goodbye to Berlin'' was adapted for the New York stage by [[John van Druten]] using the title ''[[I Am a Camera]]'', taken from Isherwood's opening paragraphs.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Diaries: Volume One: 1939-1960, 2011, Vintage, p. 912.</ref> [[Julie Harris (actress)|Julie Harris]] became a star as Sally Bowles,<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, Christopher and His Kind, 2012, Vintage, p. 63.</ref> winning the Best Actress Tony Award, and reprising her role in the 1955 film ''I Am a Camera''.<ref>Watts, Stephen, 'On Shooting a 'Camera'\u2019, New York Times, January 23, 1955.</ref> The play inspired the hit Broadway musical ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' (1966), winner of eight Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Director.<ref>Garebian, Keith, The Making of Cabaret, Oxford University Press, 2011, p. 203.</ref> [[Liza Minnelli]] starred in the film adaptation of ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' in 1972, and became an international superstar.<ref>Bucknell, Katherine, Introduction, in Christopher Isherwood, The Sixties: Diaries, Volume Two: 1960-1969, 2010, Chatto & Windus, p. xxxiv.</ref> Dressed as Sally Bowles, she was the first person ever to appear on the cover of ''Time'' and ''Newsweek'' simultaneously.<ref>Time, February 28, 1972, and Newsweek, February 28, 1972.</ref> ''Cabaret'' won eight [[Academy Awards]] including Best Actress and Best Director.<ref>Garebian, Keith, The Making of Cabaret, 2011, Oxford University Press, p. 206.</ref>\n\nIn 1932, Isherwood started a relationship with a young German, Heinz Neddermeyer.<ref>Isherwood, Christopher, ''Christopher and His Kind'', 2012, Vintage, p. 92-94.</ref> They fled [[Nazi Germany]] together in May 1933, traveling initially to Greece.

The next year he applied for citizenship and answered questions honestly, saying he would accept non-combatant duties like loading ships with food. The fact that he had volunteered for service with the Medical Corps helped as well. At the naturalisation ceremony, he found he was required to swear to defend the nation and decided to take the oath since he had already stated his objections and reservations. He became an American citizen on 8 November 1946.<ref>Bucknell (ed.), pp.40, 77\u20138</ref>\n\nHe began living with the photographer William \"Bill\" Caskey. In 1947, the two traveled to South America. Isherwood wrote the prose and Caskey took the photographs for a 1949 book about their journey entitled ''The Condor and the Cows''.\n\nOn [[Valentine's Day]] 1953, at the age of 48, he met the teenager [[Don Bachardy]] among a group of friends on the beach at [[Santa Monica]]. Reports of Bachardy's age at the time vary, but Bachardy later said, \"At the time I was probably 16.\"<ref>The biographical film ''Chris & Don: A Love Story''</ref> In fact, he was 18.<ref>Bachardy was born in May 1934, meaning that in February 1953 he was 18</ref> Despite the age difference, this meeting began a partnership that, though interrupted by affairs and separations, continued until the end of Isherwood's life.<ref>Peter Parker, ''Isherwood'', 2004</ref>\n\nDuring the early months of their affair, Isherwood finished\u2014and Bachardy typed\u2014the novel on which he had worked for some years, ''The World in the Evening'' (1954). Isherwood also taught a course on modern English literature at Los Angeles State College (now [[California State University, Los Angeles]]) for several years during the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nThe 30-year [[age disparity in sexual relationships|age difference]] between Isherwood and Bachardy raised eyebrows at the time, with Bachardy, in his own words, \"regarded as a sort of child prostitute,\"<ref>[http://amanidreamtup.blogspot.com/2008/11/first-couple-don-bachardy-and.html \"The First Couple: Don Bachardy and Christopher Isherwood\"], by [[Armistead Maupin]], ''[[The Village Voice]],'' Volume 30, Number 16, 2 July 1985.</ref> but the two became a well-known and well-established couple in [[Southern California]]n society with many Hollywood friends.\n\n''Down There on a Visit'', a novel published in 1962, comprised four related stories that overlap the period covered in his Berlin stories. In the opinion of many reviewers, Isherwood's finest achievement was his 1964 novel ''[[A Single Man (novel)|A Single Man]]'', that depicted a day in the life of George, a middle-aged, gay Englishman who is a professor at a Los Angeles university.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/8751943/The-Britons-who-made-their-mark-on-LA.html|title=The Britons who made their mark on LA|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=11 September 2011|access-date=5 July 2018|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> The novel was adapted into the film, ''[[A Single Man]]'', in 2009.

It was the first live album from the then-current line-up of the band, and the next would be ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'' from 1997. The album was certified [[gold record|gold]] (500,000 copies sold) by the [[RIAA]] in November [[1981 in music|1981]].{{Certification Cite Ref|region=United States|title=Live |artist=Fleetwood Mac|type=album}}\n\n''Live'' consists of recordings taken primarily from the 1979-1980 [[Tusk Tour|''Tusk'' Tour]], together with a few from the earlier [[Rumours Tour|''Rumours'' Tour]] of 1977. Two songs were recorded at a Paris soundcheck and three at a performance at [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] \"for an audience of friends and road crew.\"\n\nOf particular note are three new songs - Christine McVie's \"One More Night\", Stevie Nicks' \"Fireflies\", and a well-harmonized backstage rendition of [[The Beach Boys]]' \"The Farmer's Daughter\". The latter two were released as singles; \"Fireflies\" reached the top 60 in the US, while \"The Farmer's Daughter\" reached the top 10 in Austria. \"Fireflies\" was Nicks' rumination on the tumultuous recording of the \"Tusk\" album and her observance that the band stayed intact nevertheless. Her lyrics referred to band members as the \"five fireflies.\"  \"Don't Let Me Down Again\" is a song from the ''[[Buckingham Nicks]]'' album. The band covered \"Farmer's Daughter\" at the request of Buckingham, who deemed the [[Brian Wilson]] tune obscure enough to include on the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/articles/FMart72.htm|title=Lindsey Buckingham - BAM Interview (Jan 1981)|website=www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\nAlso notable are two Lindsey Buckingham guitar showcases. The first, \"I'm So Afraid\", was popular as a concert finale during this period.

It was the first live album from the then-current line-up of the band, and the next would be ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'' from 1997. The album was certified [[gold record|gold]] (500,000 copies sold) by the [[RIAA]] in November [[1981 in music|1981]].{{Certification Cite Ref|region=United States|title=Live |artist=Fleetwood Mac|type=album}}\n\n''Live'' consists of recordings taken primarily from the 1979-1980 [[Tusk Tour|''Tusk'' Tour]], together with a few from the earlier [[Rumours Tour|''Rumours'' Tour]] of 1977. Two songs were recorded at a Paris soundcheck and three at a performance at [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] \"for an audience of friends and road crew.\"\n\nOf particular note are three new songs - Christine McVie's \"One More Night\", Stevie Nicks' \"Fireflies\", and a well-harmonized backstage rendition of [[The Beach Boys]]' \"The Farmer's Daughter\". The latter two were released as singles; \"Fireflies\" reached the top 60 in the US, while \"The Farmer's Daughter\" reached the top 10 in Austria. \"Fireflies\" was Nicks' rumination on the tumultuous recording of the \"Tusk\" album and her observance that the band stayed intact nevertheless. Her lyrics referred to band members as the \"five fireflies.\"  \"Don't Let Me Down Again\" is a song from the ''[[Buckingham Nicks]]'' album. The band covered \"Farmer's Daughter\" at the request of Buckingham, who deemed the [[Brian Wilson]] tune obscure enough to include on the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com/articles/FMart72.htm|title=Lindsey Buckingham - BAM Interview (Jan 1981)|website=www.fleetwoodmac-uk.com|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\nAlso notable are two Lindsey Buckingham guitar showcases. The first, \"I'm So Afraid\", was popular as a concert finale during this period. The second was Buckingham's take on former Mac guitarist Peter Green's signature number, \"Oh Well\" (originally a 1969 single release).\n\n== Track listing ==\n;Side one\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = \n| extra_column    = Recorded:\n| title1        = [[Monday Morning (Fleetwood Mac song)|Monday Morning]]\n| length1       = 3:51\n| writer1       = [[Lindsey Buckingham|Buckingham]]\n| extra1        = [[Tokyo]]\n\n| title2        = [[Say You Love Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Say You Love Me]]\n| length2       = 4:18\n| writer2       = [[Christine McVie|C.

Another anime film was originally scheduled to premiere on April 24, 2020, but it was later delayed due to the effects of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around {{nihongo|Auto Memory Dolls|\u81ea\u52d5\u624b\u8a18\u4eba\u5f62|Jid\u014d Shuki Ningy\u014d}}: people initially employed by a scientist named Dr. Orland to assist his blind wife Mollie in writing her novels, and later hired by other people who needed their services. In the present time, the term refers to the industry of [[Ghostwriter|writing for others]]. The story follows Violet Evergarden's journey of reintegrating back into society after the war is over and her search for her life's purpose now that she is no longer a soldier in order to understand the last words her major, Gilbert, had told her: \"I love you.\"\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n;{{nihongo|Violet Evergarden|\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30aa\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3|Vaioretto Ev\u0101g\u0101den}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yui Ishikawa]]<ref name=\"Cast\"/>|[[Erika Harlacher]]<ref name=\"net1\">{{cite episode | series= Violet Evergarden  | serieslink=Violet Evergarden | number=1 | network=Netflix | time=Netflix closing credits, English Version  | year=2018 }}</ref>}}\n:Violet is a newcomer to the CH Postal Company, and works as an Auto Memory Doll\u2014a [[ghostwriter]] for people who cannot write or are looking for help expressing their emotions in letters.\n:As an abandoned and nameless child, Violet was found by navy officer Dietfried Bougainvillea on an island where he and several members of his crew were forced to land after a naval engagement. Her combat prowess became realised when she killed several soldiers who attempted to rape her before he could stop them. Violet then stalked and killed all the other crew members. For reasons he did not understand, Violet spared Dietfried and obeyed his orders. Later, Dietfried brought Violet home and \"gave\" her to his brother Gilbert in the military as a gift for his promotion to major, intending for Gilbert to use her as a \"tool\" for war while not wanting to handle Violet himself. Gilbert instead treated her as a human, taught her how to speak, read, and write, and named her Violet, wishing she could grow up to be as beautiful as the flower. During the war, she repeatedly played a vital role in battles. Trying to save Gilbert in the war's decisive battle, she lost both her arms. With the war over, her arms were replaced with advanced metallic prosthetics, and she decided to become an Auto Memory Doll in order to learn the meaning of the words {{nihongo|\"I love you\"|\u611b\u3057\u3066\u308b|Aishiteru}}\u2014Gilbert's last words to her before they became unconscious in the battlefield.\n:The light novel series (Vol. 1) explains elements of Violet's origin that have only been hinted at in the first season of the anime series. Violet's origins are entirely unknown. She is found on the island by Dietfried, but there is no indication of where she is from or how she got there and she has no memory of her life before meeting Dietfried. Dietfried shows Gilbert why Violet should only be a \"weapon\" by arranging for her to fight and kill five thieves and murderers he caught on his ship. Later, Gilbert shows the military Violet's skills by having her battle and kill ten deathrow convicts in a military \"training ground\".

However, Iris is frustrated when her mother admits she wants to use the party as a way to find a suitor for her. As Violet writes the party invitations, Iris specifically asks her not to send an invitation to a man named Emonn Snow, but Violet sends the invitation anyway. When Emonn appears at the party, Iris angrily retreats to her room. Violet then talks to Iris to figure out what's wrong, and Iris tells her that Emonn was her childhood crush, but he rejected her confession. The emotional pain caused by Emonn's rejection was what caused her to leave her hometown to become a doll. This causes Violet to realize that a love confession like Gilbert's must have required a great deal of courage. Violet then helps Iris write apology letters to all of the party guests, as well as her parents. Moved by the letter, Iris' parents allow her to continue working as a doll. On the way back to Leiden, Iris tells Violet that her parents named her after the flower of the same name, since she was born while they were in full bloom. This triggers a flashback in Violet, who remembers that Gilbert named her after the flower of the same name.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = You Write Letters That Bring People Together?\n| TranslitTitle   = Hito o Musubu Tegami o Kaku no ka?\n| NativeTitle     = \u4eba\u3092\u7d50\u3076\u624b\u7d19\u3092\u66f8\u304f\u306e\u304b?\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy      = Haruka Fujita<br>Shinpei Sawa\n| WrittenBy       = Takaaki Suzuki\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|2|8}}\n| ShortSummary    = On the request of the military, Violet is sent to the kingdom of Drossel in order to write a public love letter for its princess, Charlotte, to Damian, the prince of the neighboring kingdom of Flugel. Violet's mission is crucial since Drossel and Flugel were previously enemies in the war and are arranging the marriage to cement the terms of the peace treaty. Despite Charlotte being anxious about the wedding, Violet writes the love letter, and Damian writes a letter back in response, but Charlotte does not appear satisfied with it. Charlotte later confides in Violet that she met and grew infatuated with Damian when she first met him, since he treated her as a person and not a potential wife. However, she's unsure of whether Damian reciprocates her feelings or not, since she could tell the letter he returned contained no emotion in it. Violet then gets an idea and arranges with Damian's doll to have Charlotte and Damian write their own letters to each other. This starts a heated but passionate correspondence between the two that entrances everybody in both kingdoms. The wedding goes as planned while Violet and Cattleya, who was Damian's doll, return to Leiden, though Cattleya notices Violet smiling. Upon returning, Violet encounters Gilbert's brother Dietfried, who expresses disbelief at how she became a doll and reminding her she had killed countless people, including many of his men.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Somewhere, Under a Starry Sky\n| TranslitTitle   = Doko ka no Hoshizora no Shita de\n| NativeTitle     = \u3069\u3053\u304b\u306e\u661f\u7a7a\u306e\u4e0b\u3067\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy      = [[Yoshiji Kigami]]\n| WrittenBy       = Tatsuhiko Urahata\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|2|15}}\n| ShortSummary    = Violet, along with a number of other dolls, arrive at the Shaher Observatory in order to help the scholars make copies of a number of rare books.

He invites Violet to view Alley's Comet with him, which appears only once every two hundred years, and she accepts. While the two stargaze, Leon explains that his father was also a scholar at the observatory but disappeared on an expedition. His mother then left home to search for him and never returned either, causing Leon to resent them and the concept of love. Violet then tells Leon that she has no known blood relatives, but is completely devoted to Gilbert. It's then that Leon realizes Violet is in love with Gilbert.

As Violet accompanies Isabella, it becomes clear that she does not like attending the school since she finds it difficult to fit in and has no interest in learning any of the skills required for a debutante. She also is not in good health, as she suffers from periodic coughing fits. Isabella is initially distrustful of Violet, but becomes more accepting of her when she realizes Violet is not interested in her aristocratic status. Isabella later reveals to Violet that she was actually Amy Bartlett, an illegitimate child of the York family. She used to live in poverty and adopted an orphan, Taylor, as her younger sister. However, the York family later tracked her down and asked her to join the family, with them promising a better life for Taylor in return. Realizing she couldn't properly care for Taylor, Isabella reluctantly accepted. Isabella then has Violet write a letter for Taylor. With her job done, Violet returns to Leiden. Benedict delivers the letter to Taylor, who now lives at an orphanage.. \n\nThree years later, Taylor makes her way to Leiden to find the CH Postal Company, where she finally meets Violet and asks to work as a postman. While reluctant to hire a child, Hodgins allows Violet's request to let Taylor work at the company until he can arrange her return to her orphanage, and assigns Benedict to train her. After taking Taylor along his route, Benedict realizes that Taylor cannot read, meaning she wouldn't be able to read addresses on letters. Violet then decides to teach Taylor. The next day, Violet takes Taylor on a new delivery route. Taylor tells Violet she wants to be a postman so that she can \"deliver happiness\", just like Benedict did when he delivered Isabella's letter to her. Violet then helps Taylor write a letter to Isabella, and Benedict agrees to track her down to deliver it. Benedict obtains a new motorcycle from Hodgins and takes Taylor with him to find Isabella. Benedict delivers the letter, but Taylor decides not to meet her yet until she becomes a real postman so she can deliver her letters herself.

In the present time, the term refers to the industry of [[Ghostwriter|writing for others]]. The story follows Violet Evergarden's journey of reintegrating back into society after the war is over and her search for her life's purpose now that she is no longer a soldier in order to understand the last words her major, Gilbert, had told her: \"I love you.\"\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n;{{nihongo|Violet Evergarden|\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30aa\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3|Vaioretto Ev\u0101g\u0101den}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yui Ishikawa]]<ref name=\"Cast\"/>|[[Erika Harlacher]]<ref name=\"net1\">{{cite episode | series= Violet Evergarden  | serieslink=Violet Evergarden | number=1 | network=Netflix | time=Netflix closing credits, English Version  | year=2018 }}</ref>}}\n:Violet is a newcomer to the CH Postal Company, and works as an Auto Memory Doll\u2014a [[ghostwriter]] for people who cannot write or are looking for help expressing their emotions in letters.\n:As an abandoned and nameless child, Violet was found by navy officer Dietfried Bougainvillea on an island where he and several members of his crew were forced to land after a naval engagement. Her combat prowess became realised when she killed several soldiers who attempted to rape her before he could stop them. Violet then stalked and killed all the other crew members. For reasons he did not understand, Violet spared Dietfried and obeyed his orders. Later, Dietfried brought Violet home and \"gave\" her to his brother Gilbert in the military as a gift for his promotion to major, intending for Gilbert to use her as a \"tool\" for war while not wanting to handle Violet himself. Gilbert instead treated her as a human, taught her how to speak, read, and write, and named her Violet, wishing she could grow up to be as beautiful as the flower. During the war, she repeatedly played a vital role in battles. Trying to save Gilbert in the war's decisive battle, she lost both her arms. With the war over, her arms were replaced with advanced metallic prosthetics, and she decided to become an Auto Memory Doll in order to learn the meaning of the words {{nihongo|\"I love you\"|\u611b\u3057\u3066\u308b|Aishiteru}}\u2014Gilbert's last words to her before they became unconscious in the battlefield.\n:The light novel series (Vol. 1) explains elements of Violet's origin that have only been hinted at in the first season of the anime series. Violet's origins are entirely unknown. She is found on the island by Dietfried, but there is no indication of where she is from or how she got there and she has no memory of her life before meeting Dietfried. Dietfried shows Gilbert why Violet should only be a \"weapon\" by arranging for her to fight and kill five thieves and murderers he caught on his ship. Later, Gilbert shows the military Violet's skills by having her battle and kill ten deathrow convicts in a military \"training ground\". The anime shows flashbacks to this latter incident without explaining it. Gilbert's special forces unit is used as cover and support for Violet's military activities. The novel also strongly hints that Violet may possess superhuman strength, but it is her remarkable skills at killing that are most notable. \n;{{nihongo|Claudia Hodgins|\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30db\u30c3\u30b8\u30f3\u30ba|Kuraudia Hojjinzu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takehito Koyasu]]<ref name=\"Cast\"/>|[[Kyle McCarley]]<ref name=\"net1\"/>}}\n:A former army commander, Claudia is the president of the CH Postal Company.

It is his final words to her\u2014\"I love you\"\u2014that drive her to move forward on her new path as an Auto Memory Doll. The only memento of Gilbert that Violet has is an emerald brooch that reminds her of Gilbert's eyes. As he wanted Violet to live a life like a normal girl, instead of a tool, he told Claudia to announce that he is missing from the war and declared dead. However, he recovered from his injuries and lived in a rural place before meeting Violet several years later.\n\n===CH Postal Company===\n;{{nihongo|Cattleya Baudelaire|\u30ab\u30c8\u30ec\u30a2\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb|Katorea B\u014ddor\u0113ru}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Aya End\u014d]]<ref name=\"Cast\"/>|[[Reba Buhr]]<ref name=\"net1\" />}}\n:Cattleya is an Auto Memory Doll who works alongside Violet at the CH Postal Company as its most popular Doll.

However, Violet is injured after a mission which resulted in the loss of her arms, requiring them to be replaced with prosthesis. Colonel Hodgins, an old acquaintance of Gilbert, arrives to pick up Violet. He explains to Violet that the war they were fighting has ended and peace has come, though he is unwilling to tell Violet what happened to Gilbert. They leave for the capital city of Leiden, where Gilbert had already arranged for Violet to be adopted by the Evergarden family. However, Violet cannot adjust to civilian life due to her military indoctrination. Hodgins then decides to show Violet his business, the CH postal company which acts as a private mail and ghostwriting service and hires her as a postal worker. She then witnesses the Auto Memory Dolls of the ghostwriting department writing a letter for an illiterate man who wants to proclaim his love to someone. Violet then remembers that \"I love you\" were the last words Gilbert had told her. Wanting to know the meaning of the words, Violet asks Hodgins for her to join the ghostwriting department. Impressed that Violet has finally shown signs of acting on her own free will instead of on someone else's orders, Hodgins accepts Violet's request despite her not being an Auto Memory Doll.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Never Coming Back\n| TranslitTitle   = Modotte Konai\n| NativeTitle     = \u300c\u623b\u3063\u3066\u6765\u306a\u3044\u300d\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy      = Haruka Fujita\n| WrittenBy       = Reiko Yoshida\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|1|18}}\n| ShortSummary    = Violet joins the ghostwriting department and meets its members: the veteran Cattelya, and the two rookies Erica and Iris. Under Cattelya's direction, Violet begins her training as an Auto Memory Doll, quickly learning how to use a typewriter. However, despite her technical proficiency, Violet is still incapable of understanding emotions. This comes to a head when she offers to write a romantic letter that ends up angering both the recipient and the client. Erica then confronts Violet about her motivations to become a Doll, but relents when Violet tells her about her desire to learn the meaning of the words \"I love you.\" Iris suggests to Hodgins to fire Violet, but Erica comes to her defense, partly motivated due to her own insecurities about being a proper Doll. Hodgins decides not to fire Violet and gives her a new uniform, along with the brooch Gilbert had originally given to Violet, which Hodgins managed to recover. Violet is overjoyed at the return of the brooch, and agrees to attend a Doll training course. That night, Hodgins confides in Cattleya that he used to be friends with Gilbert, and that Gilbert is \"never coming back.\"\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = May You Be an Exemplary Auto Memory Doll\n| TranslitTitle   = Anata ga Yoki Jido Shuki Ningy\u014d ni Narimasu Y\u014d ni\n| NativeTitle     = \u300c\u3042\u306a\u305f\u304c\u3001\u826f\u304d\u81ea\u52d5\u624b\u8a18\u4eba\u5f62\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3088\u3046\u306b\u300d\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy      = Noriyuki Kitanohara\n| WrittenBy       = Tatsuhiko Urahata\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|1|25}}\n| ShortSummary    = Violet attends at the Auto Memory Doll Training School in order to become a true doll.

However, Instructor Rhodanthe is unimpressed with the way Violet ghostwrote Luculia's letter, informing her that letters are an instrument for communicating a person's feelings, and that letter she ghostwrote was unacceptable. Luculia decides to take Violet to her favorite spot atop a bell tower to show her the view, and it is revealed Luculia's brother is crippled from the war and is now a drunkard. However, Violet fails to pass the class while Luculia graduates with top marks. Luculia meets Violet again and offers to ghostwrite a letter to Gilbert, but Violet cannot find the words to say. Luculia then tells Violet how her parents died in the war and her brother feels guilty over failing to protect them. She wants to tell her brother that she's just glad he's alive and home, but likewise cannot find the words to say. Touched by Luculia's words, Violet manages to write a short and concise letter that effectively conveys Luculia's feelings to her brother.

As a result, Violet is sent along with her to assist her in writing. Upon arriving, Iris is met by her parents, and her mother reveals that she was the one who sent the request in order to get Iris to come back to celebrate her birthday. However, Iris is frustrated when her mother admits she wants to use the party as a way to find a suitor for her. As Violet writes the party invitations, Iris specifically asks her not to send an invitation to a man named Emonn Snow, but Violet sends the invitation anyway. When Emonn appears at the party, Iris angrily retreats to her room. Violet then talks to Iris to figure out what's wrong, and Iris tells her that Emonn was her childhood crush, but he rejected her confession. The emotional pain caused by Emonn's rejection was what caused her to leave her hometown to become a doll. This causes Violet to realize that a love confession like Gilbert's must have required a great deal of courage. Violet then helps Iris write apology letters to all of the party guests, as well as her parents. Moved by the letter, Iris' parents allow her to continue working as a doll. On the way back to Leiden, Iris tells Violet that her parents named her after the flower of the same name, since she was born while they were in full bloom.

Violet's mission is crucial since Drossel and Flugel were previously enemies in the war and are arranging the marriage to cement the terms of the peace treaty. Despite Charlotte being anxious about the wedding, Violet writes the love letter, and Damian writes a letter back in response, but Charlotte does not appear satisfied with it. Charlotte later confides in Violet that she met and grew infatuated with Damian when she first met him, since he treated her as a person and not a potential wife. However, she's unsure of whether Damian reciprocates her feelings or not, since she could tell the letter he returned contained no emotion in it. Violet then gets an idea and arranges with Damian's doll to have Charlotte and Damian write their own letters to each other. This starts a heated but passionate correspondence between the two that entrances everybody in both kingdoms. The wedding goes as planned while Violet and Cattleya, who was Damian's doll, return to Leiden, though Cattleya notices Violet smiling.

Upon learning that Cattleya is on the train, Violet decides to accompany them for protection. However, the anti-peace rebels have already infiltrated the train, and after it leaves the station they stage an attack.

With the envoy safe, the party continues on to the peace talks, where Leidenschaftlich and Gadariki officially sign a peace treaty to end the war. Upon returning to Leiden, a popular event called the Air Show, where planes are loaded with letters that are released in the sky to rain down all over the country, is being revived due to the peace. While Violet's coworkers are writing letters to submit, Cattleya suggests she write a letter to Gilbert. However, Violet cannot find the words to say. She is then invited by Dietfried to visit his and Gilbert's mother. She assures Violet that she does not blame her for Gilbert's death, and that he lives on inside her heart, even if the memories are painful. As Violet leaves, Dietfried notes that she's become fully independent thanks to Gilbert's teachings. Now inspired, Violet writes a letter to Gilbert for the Air Show. In it, she tells Gilbert how she's learned so much as an Auto Memory Doll, and that she plans to keep on living in the hopes that she'll meet him again so she can tell him that she now understands the words \"I love you.\" a little more. Through this, she finally comes to terms with Gilbert's loss.

However, Irma's requests for the letter are both vague and complex, making it difficult for Violet to write a letter that can satisfy her despite numerous rewrites. Irma's conductor, Ardu, then reveals that Irma is in fact trying to use Violet to write the lyrics of the song she plans to use in her next opera play. Determined to complete the job, Violet decides to follow Irma to better understand her heart. Irma reveals to Violet that her boyfriend Fugo, Ardu's son, left to fight in the war but never returned. Though she understands Irma a little better, Violet is still not confident that she can write the letter she wants. Roland then takes Violet to an old military warehouse containing letters that were unable to be sent to  soldiers that were missing or killed in action. Violet gains inspiration from reading these letters and writes a new one that moves both Irma and Ardu. Irma uses the letter as the basis for her song in her new opera play. As Irma sings, the song helps both her and Ardu move on from the loss of Fugo. The song is a great success, earning praise from the audience, and Ardu is confident that Violet will come to understand \"love\".\n}}\n|}\n\n===Film===\nA spin-off film, ''Violet Evergarden: Eternity and the Auto Memory Doll'' ({{Lang|ja|\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30aa\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30f3 \u5916\u4f1d - \u6c38\u9060\u3068\u81ea\u52d5\u624b\u8a18\u4eba\u5f62 -}}), premiered on August 3 at Germany's AnimagiC 2019 convention,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://animagic.de/animagic2019/programmheft-2019/|title=AnimagiC 2019 \u2013 Das Programmheft|publisher=AnimagiC|accessdate=August 4, 2019|language=German}}</ref> and premiered in Japan on September 6, 2019.

As Violet accompanies Isabella, it becomes clear that she does not like attending the school since she finds it difficult to fit in and has no interest in learning any of the skills required for a debutante. She also is not in good health, as she suffers from periodic coughing fits. Isabella is initially distrustful of Violet, but becomes more accepting of her when she realizes Violet is not interested in her aristocratic status. Isabella later reveals to Violet that she was actually Amy Bartlett, an illegitimate child of the York family. She used to live in poverty and adopted an orphan, Taylor, as her younger sister. However, the York family later tracked her down and asked her to join the family, with them promising a better life for Taylor in return. Realizing she couldn't properly care for Taylor, Isabella reluctantly accepted. Isabella then has Violet write a letter for Taylor. With her job done, Violet returns to Leiden. Benedict delivers the letter to Taylor, who now lives at an orphanage.. \n\nThree years later, Taylor makes her way to Leiden to find the CH Postal Company, where she finally meets Violet and asks to work as a postman. While reluctant to hire a child, Hodgins allows Violet's request to let Taylor work at the company until he can arrange her return to her orphanage, and assigns Benedict to train her. After taking Taylor along his route, Benedict realizes that Taylor cannot read, meaning she wouldn't be able to read addresses on letters. Violet then decides to teach Taylor. The next day, Violet takes Taylor on a new delivery route. Taylor tells Violet she wants to be a postman so that she can \"deliver happiness\", just like Benedict did when he delivered Isabella's letter to her. Violet then helps Taylor write a letter to Isabella, and Benedict agrees to track her down to deliver it. Benedict obtains a new motorcycle from Hodgins and takes Taylor with him to find Isabella. Benedict delivers the letter, but Taylor decides not to meet her yet until she becomes a real postman so she can deliver her letters herself. Taylor is later adopted by the Evergarden family while Violet and Benedict continue their work. \n}}\n|}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Prose|date=July 2019}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n! Award\n!
