The old buildings, dubbed by [[the New York Times]] as \"among the ancient landmarks\" of lower Broadway, were inadequate for such a rapidly expanding concern.\n\nAfter some delays due to the First World War, the 21-story [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] [[65 Broadway|American Express Co. Building]] was constructed in 1916\u201317 to the design of James L. Aspinwall, of the firm of Renwick, Aspinwall & Tucker, the successor to the architectural practice of the eminent [[James Renwick, Jr.]]. The building consolidated the two lots of the former buildings with a single address: [[65 Broadway]]. This building was part of the \"Express Row\" section of lower Broadway at the time. The building completed the continuous masonry wall of its block-front and assisted in transforming Broadway into the \"canyon\" of neo-classical masonry office towers familiar to this day.<ref name=\"AIA22\">{{cite AIA5|page=22}}</ref> American Express sold this building in 1975, but retained travel services there. The building was also the headquarters over the years of other prominent firms, including investment bankers [[J. & W. Seligman & Co.|J.& W. Seligman & Co]].

C. Fargo]] took a trip to Europe and returned frustrated and infuriated. Despite the fact that he was president of American Express and that he carried with him traditional [[letter of credit|letters of credit]], he found it difficult to obtain cash anywhere except in major cities. Fargo went to [[Marcellus Flemming Berry]] and asked him to create a better solution than the letter of credit. Berry introduced the American Express [[traveler's cheque|Traveler's Cheque]] which was launched in 1891 in denominations of $10, $20, $50, and $100.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,866900-7,00.html Host With The Most] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616020709/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,866900-7,00.html |date=June 16, 2010 }}, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', April 9, 1956 issue</ref>\n\nTraveler's cheques established American Express as a truly international company. In 1914, at the onset of [[World War I]], American Express in Europe was among the few companies to honor the letters of credit (issued by various banks) held by Americans in Europe, because other financial institutions refused to assist these stranded travelers.\n\nThe British government appointed American Express its official agent at the beginning of World War I.  They were to deliver letters, money and relief parcels to British prisoners of war.  Their employees went into camps to cash drafts for both British and French prisoners and arranged for them to receive money from home.\n\nBy the end of the war they were delivering 150 tonnes of parcels per day to prisoners in six countries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barham|first1=Peter|title=The impact of the Great War in 1916.|journal=Great Eastern Journal|date=January 2016|issue=165|page=14}}</ref>\n\n===Loss of railroad express business===\nAmerican Express became one of the monopolies that [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Theodore Roosevelt]] had the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC) investigated during his administration. The interest of the ICC was drawn to its strict control of the railroad express business. However, the solution did not come immediately to hand.<ref name=\"Citycyclopedia\" /> The solution to this problem came as a coincidence to other problems during World War I.\n\nDuring the winter of 1917, the United States suffered a severe coal shortage and on December 26 [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] commandeered the railroads on behalf of the United States government to move [[United States Armed Forces|federal troops]], their supplies, and coal. Treasury Secretary [[William Gibbs McAdoo]] was assigned the task of consolidating the railway lines for the [[war effort]]. All contracts between express companies and railroads were nullified and McAdoo proposed that all existing express companies be consolidated into a single company to serve the country's needs. This ended American Express's express business, and removed them from the ICC's interest. The result was that a new company called the [[Railway Express Agency|American Railway Express Agency]] formed in July 1918. The new entity took custody of all the pooled equipment and property of existing express companies (the largest share of which, 40%, came from American Express, who had owned the rights to the express business over {{convert|71280|mi|km}} of railroad lines, and had 10,000 offices, with over 30,000 employees).\n\n===Investment banking===\nDuring the 1980s, American Express embarked on an effort to become a financial services supercompany and made a number of acquisitions to create an investment banking arm. In mid-1981 it purchased [[Sanford I. Weill]]'s [[Shearson Loeb Rhoades]], the second largest securities firm in the United States to form [[Shearson/American Express]].\n\n[[File:Shearson Lehman Logo.png|170px|Shearson Lehman logo|thumb|right]]\n\nAfter the purchase of Shearson, Weill was given the position of president of American Express in 1983. Weill grew increasingly unhappy with responsibilities within American Express and his conflicts with American Express' CEO [[James D. Robinson III]]. Weill soon realized that he was not positioned to be named CEO and left in August 1985. In 1984, American Express acquired the [[investment banking]] and trading firm [[Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb]], and added it to the Shearson family, creating Shearson Lehman/American Express.  It was Lehman's CEO and former trader [[Lewis Glucksman]] who would next lead Shearson Lehman/American Express.\n\nIn 1984, Shearson/American Express purchased the 90-year-old [[Investors Diversified Services]], bringing with it a fleet of financial advisors and investment products. In 1988, Shearson Lehman acquired the brokerage firm [[E.F. Hutton & Co.]]. E.F. Hutton was merged with the investment banking business and the investment banking arm was renamed [[Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/03/business/shearson-reported-to-acquire-hutton-in-a-1-billion-deal.html |title=Shearson Reported To Acquire Hutton In a $1 Billion Deal |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 3, 1987 |first=Robert J. |last=Cole |access-date=February 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110012931/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/03/business/shearson-reported-to-acquire-hutton-in-a-1-billion-deal.html |archive-date=November 10, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHowever, when [[Harvey Golub]] became CEO of American Express in 1993, American Express decided to get out of the investment banking business and negotiated the sale of Shearson's retail brokerage and [[Investment management|asset management]] business to [[Primerica]].

The partnership lasted only until 1984.

The rationale was due to far lower fees as compared with American Express' fees at the time (which were about 4% for each transaction versus around 1.2% at the time for Visa and Mastercard). The revolt, known as the \"Boston Fee Party\" (alluding to the [[Boston Tea Party]]), spread to over 250 restaurants across the United States, including restaurants in other cities such as [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], and [[Los Angeles]]. Visa offered to pay the Fee Party's legal bills, and [[Discover Card]] was able to increase their acceptance among Boston restaurants by 375%. Kenneth Chenault, then head of Travel Related Services prior to becoming American Express CEO, cut fees to bring these restaurants back into the fold.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-how-amex-lost-costco/| title=How Bad Will It Get for American Express?| last1=Leonard| first1=Devin| last2=Dexheimer| first2=Elizabeth| publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]| date=October 15, 2015| access-date=March 5, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413071646/https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-how-amex-lost-costco/| archive-date=April 13, 2017| url-status=live}}</ref> American Express then shifted its focus from exclusivity to broadening acceptance, adding mainstream merchants like [[Walmart]] to the American Express network.\n\n===Conversion to bank holding company===\nOn November 10, 2008, during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], the company won [[Federal Reserve System]] approval to convert to a [[bank holding company]], making it eligible for government help under the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]].<ref name=\"American-Express-Dec-2008-8-K\">{{cite web| url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/2714/0001104659-08-078273.pdf| title=American Express, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Dec 23, 2008| publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]]| accessdate=January 6, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512070738/http://pdf.secdatabase.com/2714/0001104659-08-078273.pdf| archive-date=May 12, 2013| url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"lanman\">{{cite news |title=American Express Gets Fed Approval to Convert to Bank |network=[[NPR]] |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96844962 |air-date=November 11, 2008 |series=[[Morning Edition]] |first=Ari |last=Shapiro |author-link=Ari Shapiro |accessdate=February 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205130124/https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96844962 |archive-date=February 5, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> At that time, American Express had total consolidated assets of about $127{{nbsp}}billion.<ref name=\"lanman\"/> In June 2009, $3.39{{nbsp}}billion in TARP funds were repaid plus $74.4{{nbsp}}million in dividend payments.

In mid-1981, it purchased [[Sanford I. Weill]]'s [[Shearson Loeb Rhoades]], the second largest securities firm in the United States to form Shearson/American Express. Shearson Loeb Rhoades, itself was the culmination of several mergers in the 1970s as Weill's [[Hayden, Stone & Co.]] merged with [[Shearson, Hammill & Co.]] in 1974, to form [[Shearson Hayden Stone]]. Shearson Hayden Stone then merged with [[Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co.]] (formerly [[Loeb, Rhoades & Co.]]) to form Shearson Loeb Rhoades in 1979. With capital totalling $250&nbsp;million at the time of its acquisition, Shearson Loeb Rhoades trailed only [[Merrill Lynch]] as the securities industry's largest [[brokerage firm]]. After its acquisition by American Express, the firm was renamed Shearson/American Express.\n\nIn 1984, Shearson/American Express purchased the 90-year-old [[Investors Diversified Services]], bringing with it a fleet of financial advisors and investment products. Also in 1984, American Express acquired the [[investment banking]] and trading firm, [[Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb]], and added it to the Shearson family, creating Shearson Lehman/American Express. In 1988, the firm acquired [[E. F. Hutton & Co.]], forming [[Shearson Lehman Hutton]] until 1990, when the firm's name became Shearson Lehman Brothers. When Harvey Golub took the reins in 1993, he negotiated the sale of Shearson's retail brokerage and [[Investment management|asset management]] business to [[Primerica]] and in following year, spun off of the remaining investment banking and institutional businesses as [[Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc]].\n\n===Financial advisors===\nOn September 30, 2005, American Express spun-off its American Express Financial Advisors unit, [[Ameriprise Financial]], to its shareholders.

The old buildings, dubbed by [[the New York Times]] as \"among the ancient landmarks\" of lower Broadway, were inadequate for such a rapidly expanding concern.\n\nAfter some delays due to the First World War, the 21-story [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] [[65 Broadway|American Express Co. Building]] was constructed in 1916\u201317 to the design of James L. Aspinwall, of the firm of Renwick, Aspinwall & Tucker, the successor to the architectural practice of the eminent [[James Renwick, Jr.]]. The building consolidated the two lots of the former buildings with a single address: [[65 Broadway]]. This building was part of the \"Express Row\" section of lower Broadway at the time. The building completed the continuous masonry wall of its block-front and assisted in transforming Broadway into the \"canyon\" of neo-classical masonry office towers familiar to this day.<ref name=\"AIA22\">{{cite AIA5|page=22}}</ref> American Express sold this building in 1975, but retained travel services there.

C. Fargo]] took a trip to Europe and returned frustrated and infuriated. Despite the fact that he was president of American Express and that he carried with him traditional [[letter of credit|letters of credit]], he found it difficult to obtain cash anywhere except in major cities. Fargo went to [[Marcellus Flemming Berry]] and asked him to create a better solution than the letter of credit. Berry introduced the American Express [[traveler's cheque|Traveler's Cheque]] which was launched in 1891 in denominations of $10, $20, $50, and $100.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,866900-7,00.html Host With The Most] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616020709/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,866900-7,00.html |date=June 16, 2010 }}, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', April 9, 1956 issue</ref>\n\nTraveler's cheques established American Express as a truly international company. In 1914, at the onset of [[World War I]], American Express in Europe was among the few companies to honor the letters of credit (issued by various banks) held by Americans in Europe, because other financial institutions refused to assist these stranded travelers.\n\nThe British government appointed American Express its official agent at the beginning of World War I.  They were to deliver letters, money and relief parcels to British prisoners of war.  Their employees went into camps to cash drafts for both British and French prisoners and arranged for them to receive money from home.\n\nBy the end of the war they were delivering 150 tonnes of parcels per day to prisoners in six countries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barham|first1=Peter|title=The impact of the Great War in 1916.|journal=Great Eastern Journal|date=January 2016|issue=165|page=14}}</ref>\n\n===Loss of railroad express business===\nAmerican Express became one of the monopolies that [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Theodore Roosevelt]] had the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC) investigated during his administration. The interest of the ICC was drawn to its strict control of the railroad express business. However, the solution did not come immediately to hand.<ref name=\"Citycyclopedia\" /> The solution to this problem came as a coincidence to other problems during World War I.\n\nDuring the winter of 1917, the United States suffered a severe coal shortage and on December 26 [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] commandeered the railroads on behalf of the United States government to move [[United States Armed Forces|federal troops]], their supplies, and coal. Treasury Secretary [[William Gibbs McAdoo]] was assigned the task of consolidating the railway lines for the [[war effort]]. All contracts between express companies and railroads were nullified and McAdoo proposed that all existing express companies be consolidated into a single company to serve the country's needs. This ended American Express's express business, and removed them from the ICC's interest. The result was that a new company called the [[Railway Express Agency|American Railway Express Agency]] formed in July 1918. The new entity took custody of all the pooled equipment and property of existing express companies (the largest share of which, 40%, came from American Express, who had owned the rights to the express business over {{convert|71280|mi|km}} of railroad lines, and had 10,000 offices, with over 30,000 employees).\n\n===Investment banking===\nDuring the 1980s, American Express embarked on an effort to become a financial services supercompany and made a number of acquisitions to create an investment banking arm. In mid-1981 it purchased [[Sanford I. Weill]]'s [[Shearson Loeb Rhoades]], the second largest securities firm in the United States to form [[Shearson/American Express]].\n\n[[File:Shearson Lehman Logo.png|170px|Shearson Lehman logo|thumb|right]]\n\nAfter the purchase of Shearson, Weill was given the position of president of American Express in 1983. Weill grew increasingly unhappy with responsibilities within American Express and his conflicts with American Express' CEO [[James D. Robinson III]]. Weill soon realized that he was not positioned to be named CEO and left in August 1985. In 1984, American Express acquired the [[investment banking]] and trading firm [[Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb]], and added it to the Shearson family, creating Shearson Lehman/American Express.  It was Lehman's CEO and former trader [[Lewis Glucksman]] who would next lead Shearson Lehman/American Express.\n\nIn 1984, Shearson/American Express purchased the 90-year-old [[Investors Diversified Services]], bringing with it a fleet of financial advisors and investment products. In 1988, Shearson Lehman acquired the brokerage firm [[E.F. Hutton & Co.]]. E.F. Hutton was merged with the investment banking business and the investment banking arm was renamed [[Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/03/business/shearson-reported-to-acquire-hutton-in-a-1-billion-deal.html |title=Shearson Reported To Acquire Hutton In a $1 Billion Deal |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 3, 1987 |first=Robert J. |last=Cole |access-date=February 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110012931/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/03/business/shearson-reported-to-acquire-hutton-in-a-1-billion-deal.html |archive-date=November 10, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHowever, when [[Harvey Golub]] became CEO of American Express in 1993, American Express decided to get out of the investment banking business and negotiated the sale of Shearson's retail brokerage and [[Investment management|asset management]] business to [[Primerica]].

The partnership lasted only until 1984. The properties were sold to [[Viacom (1971\u20132005)|Viacom]] soon after.\n\nIn April 1992, American Express spun off its former subsidiary, [[First Data Corp.]], in an [[initial public offering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.firstdata.com/en_us/about-first-data/media/first-data-history.html|website=First Data|title=First Data History|access-date=April 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317144814/https://www.firstdata.com/en_us/about-first-data/media/first-data-history.html|archive-date=March 17, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, the Optima True Grace card was introduced.

This prompted competitors such as [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[Mastercard]] to cry foul for a while as the tactics \"locked\" restaurants into American Express. Capitalizing on this elitist image, American Express frequently mentioned such exclusive partnerships in its advertising.<ref>{{cite video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=American Express Super Bowl XXV ad feat.

A group of restaurants in [[Boston]] stopped accepting American Express while accepting and encouraging the use of Visa and Mastercard, including some that were exclusive to American Express. The rationale was due to far lower fees as compared with American Express' fees at the time (which were about 4% for each transaction versus around 1.2% at the time for Visa and Mastercard). The revolt, known as the \"Boston Fee Party\" (alluding to the [[Boston Tea Party]]), spread to over 250 restaurants across the United States, including restaurants in other cities such as [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], and [[Los Angeles]]. Visa offered to pay the Fee Party's legal bills, and [[Discover Card]] was able to increase their acceptance among Boston restaurants by 375%.

In mid-1981, it purchased [[Sanford I. Weill]]'s [[Shearson Loeb Rhoades]], the second largest securities firm in the United States to form Shearson/American Express. Shearson Loeb Rhoades, itself was the culmination of several mergers in the 1970s as Weill's [[Hayden, Stone & Co.]] merged with [[Shearson, Hammill & Co.]] in 1974, to form [[Shearson Hayden Stone]]. Shearson Hayden Stone then merged with [[Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co.]] (formerly [[Loeb, Rhoades & Co.]]) to form Shearson Loeb Rhoades in 1979. With capital totalling $250&nbsp;million at the time of its acquisition, Shearson Loeb Rhoades trailed only [[Merrill Lynch]] as the securities industry's largest [[brokerage firm]]. After its acquisition by American Express, the firm was renamed Shearson/American Express.\n\nIn 1984, Shearson/American Express purchased the 90-year-old [[Investors Diversified Services]], bringing with it a fleet of financial advisors and investment products. Also in 1984, American Express acquired the [[investment banking]] and trading firm, [[Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb]], and added it to the Shearson family, creating Shearson Lehman/American Express.

The company began operations as a bank on July 1, 1990, following an [[order-in-council]] made by the [[Brian Mulroney]] government on November 21, 1988. This decision was not without controversy as federal banking policy at the time would not ordinarily have permitted American Express to operate as a bank.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Newman| first=Peter C.| date=July 30, 1990| title=The brash new kid on the block| journal=[[Maclean's]]| volume=103| number=31| page=33}}</ref>  It is a member of the [[Canadian Bankers Association]] (CBA) and a registered member of the [[Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (CDIC), the federal agency insuring deposits at all of Canada's chartered banks.\n\nAmerican Express has several offices in the UK, including a European Service Center in the [[Carlton Hill, Brighton|Carlton Hill]] area of [[Brighton]], England.

The breed was created by Budyonny, a well-known horse breeder himself, in the early 1920s in the [[Rostov-on-Don|Rostov]] region of Russia with the intent of producing cavalry horses to replace those lost during and after [[World War I]].  The resulting horses were used in Russian cavalry divisions during World War II and after.\n\nBudyonnys were bred from a cross of local [[Russian Don|Don]] and Chernomor mares and Thoroughbred stallions.  The Chernomor (also known as the Tchernomor or the Cherkassky) is a type of Cossack horse similar to the Don, although smaller.  They are descendants of the horses raised by [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], and were first bred around Krasnodar, north of the [[Caucasus Mountains]].  During the first round of breeding for the Budyonny horse, blood from Kirghiz and Kazakh horses was also used, but the progeny was found to be not as hardy or conformationally sound, and later the Budyonny was used to improve these two breeds.\n\nThe first Budyonny horses were known as Anglo-Dons, and the best were inter-bred, with the foundation stock for the Budyonny selected from their offspring.  The foundation stock consisted of 657 mares of Anglo-Don, Anglo-Chernomor, and Anglo-Don/Chernomor crosses.  These mares were crossed with Anglo-Don and Thoroughbred stallions.  The broodmares were given the best of care with feed and management.  The young stock, when between two and four years old, were tested for performance on the racecourse and in cavalry equitation courses.  In 1949 the breed was officially recognized.<ref name=\"Budenny\"/>\n\nIn the 1950s an experiment was performed to gauge the ability of the Budyonny breed to adapt to harsh conditions without human help.  A number of horses were turned loose on a large island in Manych Lake in the Rostov district.
