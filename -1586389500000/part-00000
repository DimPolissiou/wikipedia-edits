The word ''steganography'' comes from New Latin ''steganographia'', which combines the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''stegan\u00f3s'' ({{wiktell|\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2}}), meaning \"covered or concealed\", and ''-graphia'' ({{wiktell|\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae}}) meaning \"writing\".<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/steganography ]</ref>\n\nThe first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by [[Johannes Trithemius]] in his ''[[Steganographia]]'', a treatise on cryptography and steganography, disguised as a book on magic. Generally, the hidden messages appear to be (or to be part of) something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may be in [[invisible ink]] between the visible lines of a private letter. Some implementations of steganography that lack a [[shared secret]] are forms of [[security through obscurity]], and key-dependent steganographic schemes adhere to [[Kerckhoffs's principle]].<ref name=stegokey>{{cite journal|last=Fridrich|first=Jessica|author2=M.

Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which [[encryption]] is illegal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/11986/|title=Confounding Carnivore: How to Protect Your Online Privacy|publisher=[[AlterNet]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716093719/http://www.alternet.org/story/11986/|archivedate=2007-07-16|accessdate=2008-09-02|last=Pahati|first=OJ|date=2001-11-29}}</ref>\n\nWhereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned both with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent and its contents.\n\nSteganography includes the concealment of information within computer files. In digital steganography, electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document file, image file, program or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size. For example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every hundredth [[pixel]] to correspond to a letter in the alphabet. The change is so subtle that someone who is not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice the change.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Chart in the hand of Dr John Dee.

[[Wax tablet]]s were in common use then as reusable writing surfaces, sometimes used for shorthand.\n\nIn his work ''Polygraphiae,'' [[Johannes Trithemius]] developed his so-called \"[[Ave Maria Cipher|Ave-Maria-Cipher]]\" that can hide information in a Latin praise of God. \"''Auctor Sapientissimus Conseruans Angelica Deferat Nobis Charitas Potentissimi Creatoris''\" for example contains the concealed word ''VICIPEDIA''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0002/bsb00026190/images/index.html?seite=71|title=Polygraphiae (cf. p. 71f) |publisher = Digitale Sammlungen |language = German |accessdate=2015-05-27}}</ref>\n\n==Techniques==\n\n[[File:Steganography in the hand of John Dee.png|thumb|Deciphering the code.

This particular form of steganography is called a [[null cipher]].\n* Messages written in [[Morse code]] on [[yarn]] and then knitted into a piece of clothing worn by a courier.\n* Messages written on envelopes in the area covered by [[postage stamp]]s.\n* In the early days of the printing press, it was common to mix different typefaces on a printed page because the printer did not have enough copies of some letters in one typeface. Thus, a message could be hidden by using two or more different typefaces, such as normal or italic.\n*[[File:Microdot camera markiv.jpg|thumb|A [[microdot]] camera]]During and after World War II, [[espionage]] agents used photographically-produced [[microdot]]s to send information back and forth. Microdots were typically minute (less than the size of the [[full stop|period]] produced by a [[typewriter]]). World War II microdots were embedded in the paper and covered with an adhesive, such as [[collodion]] that was reflective and so was detectable by viewing against glancing light. Alternative techniques included inserting microdots into slits cut into the edge of postcards.\n* During World War II, [[Velvalee Dickinson]], a spy for [[Japan]] in [[New York City]], sent information to accommodation addresses in neutral [[South America]]. She was a dealer in [[doll]]s, and her letters discussed the quantity and type of doll to ship. The stegotext was the doll orders, and the concealed \"plaintext\" was itself encoded and gave information about ship movements, etc. Her case became somewhat famous and she became known as the Doll Woman.\n* During World War II, [[photosensitive glass]] was declared secret{{By whom|date=September 2019}}, and used for transmitting information to Allied armies.\n* [[Jeremiah Denton]] repeatedly blinked his eyes in [[Morse code]] during the 1966 televised press conference that he was forced into as an American [[prisoner-of-war]] by his North Vietnamese captors, spelling out \"T-O-R-T-U-R-E\". That confirmed for the first time to the [[US Naval Intelligence]] and other Americans that the North Vietnamese were torturing American prisoners-of-war.\n*In 1968, crew members of the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS ''Pueblo'']] intelligence ship, held as prisoners by [[North Korea]], communicated in sign language during staged photo opportunities, to inform the United States that they were not defectors but captives of the North Koreans. In other photos presented to the US, crew members gave \"[[the finger]]\" to the unsuspecting North Koreans, in an attempt to discredit photos that showed them smiling and comfortable.\n\n=== Digital messages ===\n[[Image:Steganography original.png|frame|Image of a tree with a steganographically hidden image.

For example, the letter size, spacing, [[typeface]], or other characteristics of a covertext can be manipulated to carry the hidden message. Only a recipient who knows the technique used can recover the message and then decrypt it. [[Francis Bacon]] developed [[Bacon's cipher]] as such a technique.\n\nThe ciphertext produced by most digital steganography methods, however, is not printable.  Traditional digital methods rely on perturbing noise in the channel file to hide the message, and as such, the channel file must be transmitted to the recipient with no additional noise from the transmission.  Printing introduces much noise in the ciphertext, generally rendering the message unrecoverable.  There are techniques that address this limitation, one notable example being ASCII Art Steganography.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pictureworthsthousandwords.appspot.com/|title=ASCII Art Steganography|author=Vincent Chu}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HP Color Laserjet 3700 schutz g.jpg|thumb|Yellow dots from a laser printer]]\nAlthough not classic steganography, some types of modern color laser printers integrate the model, serial number and timestamps on each printout for traceability reasons using a dot-matrix code made of small, yellow dots not recognizable to the naked eye\u200a\u2014\u200asee [[printer steganography]] for details.\n\n=== Using puzzles ===\nThe art of concealing data in a puzzle can take advantage of the degrees of freedom in stating the puzzle, using the starting information to encode a key within the puzzle / puzzle image.\n\nFor instance, steganography using [[sudoku]] puzzles has as many keys as there are possible solutions of a sudoku puzzle, which is {{val|6.71|e=21}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing|last1=B.r.|first1=Roshan Shetty|last2=J.|first2=Rohith|last3=V.|first3=Mukund|last4=Honwade|first4=Rohan|last5=Rangaswamy|first5=Shanta|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4244-5104-3|pages=623\u2013626|chapter=Steganography Using Sudoku Puzzle|doi=10.1109/ARTCom.2009.116}}</ref>\n\n=== Network ===\n\nIn 1977, '''''Kent''''' concisely described the potential for covert channel signaling in general network communication protocols, even if the traffic is encrypted (in a footnote) in \"Encryption-Based Protection for Interactive User/Computer Communication,\" Proceedings of the Fifth Data Communications Symposium, September 1977.\n\nIn 1987, '''Girling''' first studied covert channels on a local area network (LAN), identified and realised three obvious covert channels (two storage channels and one timing channel), and his research paper entitled \u201cCovert channels in LAN\u2019s\u201d published in ''IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering'', vol.

However, some terms appear specifically in software and are easily confused. These are the most relevant ones to digital steganographic systems:\n\nThe ''payload'' is the data covertly communicated. The ''carrier'' is the signal, stream, or data file that hides the payload, which differs from the ''channel'', which typically means the type of input, such as a JPEG image. The resulting signal, stream, or data file with the encoded payload is sometimes called the ''package'', ''stego file'', or ''covert message''. The proportion of bytes, samples, or other signal elements modified to encode the payload is called the ''encoding density'' and is typically expressed as a number between 0 and 1.\n\nIn a set of files, the files that are considered likely to contain a payload are ''suspects''. A ''suspect'' identified through some type of statistical analysis can be referred to as a ''candidate''.\n\n==Countermeasures and detection==\nDetecting physical steganography requires careful physical examination, including the use of magnification, developer chemicals and [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]]. It is a time-consuming process with obvious resource implications, even in countries that employ many people to spy on their fellow nationals. However, it is feasible to screen mail of certain suspected individuals or institutions, such as prisons or prisoner-of-war (POW) camps.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], prisoner of war camps gave prisoners specially-treated [[paper]] that would reveal [[invisible ink]]. An article in the 24 June 1948 issue of ''Paper Trade Journal'' by the Technical Director of the [[United States Government Printing Office]] had Morris S. Kantrowitz describe in general terms the development of this paper. Three prototype papers (''Sensicoat'', ''Anilith'', and ''Coatalith'') were used to manufacture postcards and stationery provided to German prisoners of war in the US and Canada. If POWs tried to write a hidden message, the special paper rendered it visible. The US granted at least two [[patent]]s related to the technology, one to Kantrowitz, {{US Patent|2515232}}, \"Water-Detecting paper and Water-Detecting Coating Composition Therefor,\" patented 18 July 1950, and an earlier one, \"Moisture-Sensitive Paper and the Manufacture Thereof,\" {{US Patent|2445586}}, patented 20 July 1948. A similar strategy issues prisoners with writing paper ruled with a water-soluble ink that runs in contact with water-based invisible ink.\n\nIn computing, steganographically encoded package detection is called [[steganalysis]]. The simplest method to detect modified files, however, is to compare them to known originals. For example, to detect information being moved through the graphics on a website, an analyst can maintain known clean copies of the materials and then compare them against the current contents of the site. The differences, if the carrier is the same, comprise the payload. In general, using extremely high compression rates makes steganography difficult but not impossible. Compression errors provide a hiding place for data, but high compression reduces the amount of data available to hold the payload, raising the encoding density, which facilitates easier detection (in extreme cases, even by casual observation).\n\nThere are a variety of basic tests that can be done to identify whether or not a secret message exists. This process is not concerned with the extraction of the message, which is a different process and a separate step. The most basic approaches of [[steganalysis]] are visual or aural attacks, structural attacks, and statistical attacks. These approaches attempt to detect the steganographic algorithms that were used.<ref name=Wanyer2009>Wayner, Peter (2009). ''Disappearing Cryptography: Information Hiding : Steganography & Watermarking'', . Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Amsterdam;Boston.</ref> These algorithms range from unsophisticated to very sophisticated, with early algorithms being much easier to detect due to statistical anomalies that were present. The size of the message that is being hidden is a factor in how difficult it is to detect. The overall size of the cover object also plays a factor as well. If the cover object is small and the message is large, this can distort the statistics and make it easier to detect. A larger cover object with a small message decreases the statistics and gives it a better chance of going unnoticed.\n\nSteganalysis that targets a particular algorithm has much better success as it is able to key in on the anomalies that are left behind. This is because the analysis can perform a targeted search to discover known tendencies since it is aware of the behaviors that it commonly exhibits. When analyzing an image the least significant bits of many images are actually not random. The camera sensor, especially lower end sensors are not the best quality and can introduce some random bits. This can also be affected by the file compression done on the image. Secret messages can be introduced into the least significant bits in an image and then hidden.  A steganography tool can be used to camouflage the secret message in the least significant bits but it can introduce a random area that is too perfect. This area of perfect randomization stands out and can be detected by comparing the least significant bits to the next-to-least significant bits on image that hasn't been compressed.<ref name=Wanyer2009 />\n\nGenerally though, there are many techniques known to be able to hide messages in data using steganographic techniques. None are, by definition, obvious when users employ standard applications, but some can be detected by specialist tools. Others, however, are resistant to detection - or rather it is not possible to reliably distinguish data containing a hidden message from data containing just noise - even when the most sophisticated analysis is performed. Steganography is being used to hide cyber attacks, referred to as ''Stegware'', and detection is therefore not an adequate defence. The only way of defeating the threat is to transform data in a way that destroys any hidden messages,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319943090|title=Defenders Guide to Steganography|year=2017|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.21608.98561|last1=Wiseman|first1=Simon}}</ref> a process called [[Content Threat Removal]].\n\n==Applications==\n===Use in modern printers===\n{{Main|Printer steganography}}\nSome modern computer printers use steganography, including [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Xerox]] brand color laser printers. The printers add tiny yellow dots to each page. The barely-visible dots contain encoded printer serial numbers and date and time stamps.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2005/10/16 |title=Secret Code in Color Printers Lets Government Track You; Tiny Dots Show Where and When You Made Your Print |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=16 October 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Example from modern practice===\nThe larger the cover message (in binary data, the number of [[bit]]s) relative to the hidden message, the easier it is to hide the hidden message (as an analogy, the larger the \"haystack\", the easier it is to hide a \"needle\"). So [[digital image|digital picture]]s, which contain much data, are sometimes used to hide messages on the [[Internet]] and on other digital communication media. It is not clear how common this practice actually is.\n\nFor example, a 24-bit [[bitmap]] uses 8 bits to represent each of the three color values (red, green, and blue) of each [[pixel]]. The blue alone has 2<sup>8</sup> different levels of blue intensity. The difference between 11111111 and 11111110 in the value for blue intensity is likely to be undetectable by the human eye. Therefore, the [[least significant bit]] can be used more or less undetectably for something else other than color information. If that is repeated for the green and the red elements of each pixel as well, it is possible to encode one letter of [[ASCII]] text for every three [[pixel]]s.\n\nStated somewhat more formally, the objective for making steganographic encoding difficult to detect is to ensure that the changes to the carrier (the original signal) because of the injection of the payload (the signal to covertly embed) are visually (and ideally, statistically) negligible. The changes are indistinguishable from the [[noise floor]] of the carrier. All media can be a carrier, but media with a large amount of redundant or compressible information is better suited.\n\nFrom an [[information theory|information theoretical]] point of view, that means that the [[Communication channel|channel]] must have more [[channel capacity|capacity]] than the \"surface\" [[signal (information theory)|signal]] requires. There must be [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]]. For a digital image, it may be [[noise]] from the imaging element; for [[digital audio]], it may be noise from recording techniques or [[amplifier|amplification]] equipment. In general, electronics that digitize an [[analog (signal)|analog signal]] suffer from several noise sources, such as [[Johnson-Nyquist noise|thermal noise]], [[flicker noise]], and [[shot noise]]. The noise provides enough variation in the captured digital information that it can be exploited as a noise cover for hidden data. In addition, [[lossy compression]] schemes (such as [[JPEG]]) always introduce some error to the decompressed data, and it is possible to exploit that for steganographic use, as well.\n\nAlthough steganography and digital watermarking seem similar, they are not. In steganography, the hidden message should remain intact until it reaches its destination. Steganography can be used for [[digital watermark]]ing in which a message (being simply an identifier) is hidden in an image so that its source can be tracked or verified (for example, [[Coded Anti-Piracy]]) or even just to identify an image (as in the [[EURion constellation]]). In such a case, the technique of hiding the message (here, the watermark) must be robust to prevent tampering. However, digital watermarking sometimes requires a brittle watermark, which can be modified easily, to check whether the image has been tampered with. That is the key difference between steganography and digital watermarking.\n\n===Alleged use by intelligence services===\nIn 2010, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] alleged that the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Russian foreign intelligence service]] uses customized steganography software for embedding encrypted text messages inside image files for certain communications with \"illegal agents\" (agents without diplomatic cover) stationed abroad.<ref>{{cite web|title=Criminal complaint by Special Agent Ricci against alleged Russian agents|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/062810complaint2.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Justice}}</ref>\n\n===Distributed steganography===\nThere are distributed steganography methods,<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Distributed Steganography |publisher=[[IEEE]] |date=October 2011|doi=10.1109/IIHMSP.2011.20 |isbn=978-1-4577-1397-2 |title=2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing |last1=Liao |first1=Xin |last2=Wen |first2=Qiao-yan |last3=Shi |first3=Sha |pages=153\u2013156 }}</ref> including methodologies that distribute the payload through multiple carrier files in diverse locations to make detection more difficult.

Generally, the hidden messages appear to be (or to be part of) something else: images, articles, shopping lists, or some other cover text. For example, the hidden message may be in [[invisible ink]] between the visible lines of a private letter. Some implementations of steganography that lack a [[shared secret]] are forms of [[security through obscurity]], and key-dependent steganographic schemes adhere to [[Kerckhoffs's principle]].<ref name=stegokey>{{cite journal|last=Fridrich|first=Jessica|author2=M.

Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which [[encryption]] is illegal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/11986/|title=Confounding Carnivore: How to Protect Your Online Privacy|publisher=[[AlterNet]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716093719/http://www.alternet.org/story/11986/|archivedate=2007-07-16|accessdate=2008-09-02|last=Pahati|first=OJ|date=2001-11-29}}</ref>\n\nWhereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned both with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent and its contents.\n\nSteganography includes the concealment of information within computer files. In digital steganography, electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document file, image file, program or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size. For example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every hundredth [[pixel]] to correspond to a letter in the alphabet. The change is so subtle that someone who is not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice the change.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Chart in the hand of Dr John Dee.

[[Wax tablet]]s were in common use then as reusable writing surfaces, sometimes used for shorthand.\n\nIn his work ''Polygraphiae,'' [[Johannes Trithemius]] developed his so-called \"[[Ave Maria Cipher|Ave-Maria-Cipher]]\" that can hide information in a Latin praise of God. \"''Auctor Sapientissimus Conseruans Angelica Deferat Nobis Charitas Potentissimi Creatoris''\" for example contains the concealed word ''VICIPEDIA''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/0002/bsb00026190/images/index.html?seite=71|title=Polygraphiae (cf. p. 71f) |publisher = Digitale Sammlungen |language = German |accessdate=2015-05-27}}</ref>\n\n==Techniques==\n\n[[File:Steganography in the hand of John Dee.png|thumb|Deciphering the code.

This particular form of steganography is called a [[null cipher]].\n* Messages written in [[Morse code]] on [[yarn]] and then knitted into a piece of clothing worn by a courier.\n* Messages written on envelopes in the area covered by [[postage stamp]]s.\n* In the early days of the printing press, it was common to mix different typefaces on a printed page because the printer did not have enough copies of some letters in one typeface. Thus, a message could be hidden by using two or more different typefaces, such as normal or italic.\n*[[File:Microdot camera markiv.jpg|thumb|A [[microdot]] camera]]During and after World War II, [[espionage]] agents used photographically-produced [[microdot]]s to send information back and forth. Microdots were typically minute (less than the size of the [[full stop|period]] produced by a [[typewriter]]). World War II microdots were embedded in the paper and covered with an adhesive, such as [[collodion]] that was reflective and so was detectable by viewing against glancing light. Alternative techniques included inserting microdots into slits cut into the edge of postcards.\n* During World War II, [[Velvalee Dickinson]], a spy for [[Japan]] in [[New York City]], sent information to accommodation addresses in neutral [[South America]]. She was a dealer in [[doll]]s, and her letters discussed the quantity and type of doll to ship. The stegotext was the doll orders, and the concealed \"plaintext\" was itself encoded and gave information about ship movements, etc. Her case became somewhat famous and she became known as the Doll Woman.\n* During World War II, [[photosensitive glass]] was declared secret{{By whom|date=September 2019}}, and used for transmitting information to Allied armies.\n* [[Jeremiah Denton]] repeatedly blinked his eyes in [[Morse code]] during the 1966 televised press conference that he was forced into as an American [[prisoner-of-war]] by his North Vietnamese captors, spelling out \"T-O-R-T-U-R-E\". That confirmed for the first time to the [[US Naval Intelligence]] and other Americans that the North Vietnamese were torturing American prisoners-of-war.\n*In 1968, crew members of the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS ''Pueblo'']] intelligence ship, held as prisoners by [[North Korea]], communicated in sign language during staged photo opportunities, to inform the United States that they were not defectors but captives of the North Koreans. In other photos presented to the US, crew members gave \"[[the finger]]\" to the unsuspecting North Koreans, in an attempt to discredit photos that showed them smiling and comfortable.\n\n=== Digital messages ===\n[[Image:Steganography original.png|frame|Image of a tree with a steganographically hidden image.

Some techniques of CPS/IoT steganography overlap with network steganography, i.e. hiding data in communication protocols used in CPS/the IoT. However, specific techniques hide data in CPS components. For instance, data can be stored in unused registers of IoT/CPS components and in the states of IoT/CPS actuators.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wendzel|first1=Steffen|last2=Mazurczyk|first2=Wojciech|last3=Haas|first3=Georg|title=Don't You Touch My Nuts: Information Hiding In Cyber Physical Systems Using Smart Buildings|journal=Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE Security & Privacy Workshops|language=English|publisher=IEEE}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tuptuk|first1=Nilufer|last2=Hailes|first2=Stephen|title=Covert channel attacks in pervasive computing|journal=Proceedings 2015 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom)}}</ref>\n\n===Printed===\nDigital steganography output may be in the form of printed documents. A message, the ''[[plaintext]]'', may be first encrypted by traditional means, producing a ''[[ciphertext]]''. Then, an innocuous ''covertext'' is modified in some way so as to contain the ciphertext, resulting in the ''stegotext''. For example, the letter size, spacing, [[typeface]], or other characteristics of a covertext can be manipulated to carry the hidden message. Only a recipient who knows the technique used can recover the message and then decrypt it. [[Francis Bacon]] developed [[Bacon's cipher]] as such a technique.\n\nThe ciphertext produced by most digital steganography methods, however, is not printable.  Traditional digital methods rely on perturbing noise in the channel file to hide the message, and as such, the channel file must be transmitted to the recipient with no additional noise from the transmission.  Printing introduces much noise in the ciphertext, generally rendering the message unrecoverable.  There are techniques that address this limitation, one notable example being ASCII Art Steganography.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pictureworthsthousandwords.appspot.com/|title=ASCII Art Steganography|author=Vincent Chu}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HP Color Laserjet 3700 schutz g.jpg|thumb|Yellow dots from a laser printer]]\nAlthough not classic steganography, some types of modern color laser printers integrate the model, serial number and timestamps on each printout for traceability reasons using a dot-matrix code made of small, yellow dots not recognizable to the naked eye\u200a\u2014\u200asee [[printer steganography]] for details.\n\n=== Using puzzles ===\nThe art of concealing data in a puzzle can take advantage of the degrees of freedom in stating the puzzle, using the starting information to encode a key within the puzzle / puzzle image.\n\nFor instance, steganography using [[sudoku]] puzzles has as many keys as there are possible solutions of a sudoku puzzle, which is {{val|6.71|e=21}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=2009 International Conference on Advances in Recent Technologies in Communication and Computing|last1=B.r.|first1=Roshan Shetty|last2=J.|first2=Rohith|last3=V.|first3=Mukund|last4=Honwade|first4=Rohan|last5=Rangaswamy|first5=Shanta|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4244-5104-3|pages=623\u2013626|chapter=Steganography Using Sudoku Puzzle|doi=10.1109/ARTCom.2009.116}}</ref>\n\n=== Network ===\n\nIn 1977, '''''Kent''''' concisely described the potential for covert channel signaling in general network communication protocols, even if the traffic is encrypted (in a footnote) in \"Encryption-Based Protection for Interactive User/Computer Communication,\" Proceedings of the Fifth Data Communications Symposium, September 1977.\n\nIn 1987, '''Girling''' first studied covert channels on a local area network (LAN), identified and realised three obvious covert channels (two storage channels and one timing channel), and his research paper entitled \u201cCovert channels in LAN\u2019s\u201d published in ''IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering'', vol.

However, some terms appear specifically in software and are easily confused. These are the most relevant ones to digital steganographic systems:\n\nThe ''payload'' is the data covertly communicated. The ''carrier'' is the signal, stream, or data file that hides the payload, which differs from the ''channel'', which typically means the type of input, such as a JPEG image. The resulting signal, stream, or data file with the encoded payload is sometimes called the ''package'', ''stego file'', or ''covert message''. The proportion of bytes, samples, or other signal elements modified to encode the payload is called the ''encoding density'' and is typically expressed as a number between 0 and 1.\n\nIn a set of files, the files that are considered likely to contain a payload are ''suspects''. A ''suspect'' identified through some type of statistical analysis can be referred to as a ''candidate''.\n\n==Countermeasures and detection==\nDetecting physical steganography requires careful physical examination, including the use of magnification, developer chemicals and [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]]. It is a time-consuming process with obvious resource implications, even in countries that employ many people to spy on their fellow nationals. However, it is feasible to screen mail of certain suspected individuals or institutions, such as prisons or prisoner-of-war (POW) camps.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], prisoner of war camps gave prisoners specially-treated [[paper]] that would reveal [[invisible ink]]. An article in the 24 June 1948 issue of ''Paper Trade Journal'' by the Technical Director of the [[United States Government Printing Office]] had Morris S. Kantrowitz describe in general terms the development of this paper. Three prototype papers (''Sensicoat'', ''Anilith'', and ''Coatalith'') were used to manufacture postcards and stationery provided to German prisoners of war in the US and Canada. If POWs tried to write a hidden message, the special paper rendered it visible. The US granted at least two [[patent]]s related to the technology, one to Kantrowitz, {{US Patent|2515232}}, \"Water-Detecting paper and Water-Detecting Coating Composition Therefor,\" patented 18 July 1950, and an earlier one, \"Moisture-Sensitive Paper and the Manufacture Thereof,\" {{US Patent|2445586}}, patented 20 July 1948. A similar strategy issues prisoners with writing paper ruled with a water-soluble ink that runs in contact with water-based invisible ink.\n\nIn computing, steganographically encoded package detection is called [[steganalysis]]. The simplest method to detect modified files, however, is to compare them to known originals. For example, to detect information being moved through the graphics on a website, an analyst can maintain known clean copies of the materials and then compare them against the current contents of the site. The differences, if the carrier is the same, comprise the payload. In general, using extremely high compression rates makes steganography difficult but not impossible. Compression errors provide a hiding place for data, but high compression reduces the amount of data available to hold the payload, raising the encoding density, which facilitates easier detection (in extreme cases, even by casual observation).\n\nThere are a variety of basic tests that can be done to identify whether or not a secret message exists. This process is not concerned with the extraction of the message, which is a different process and a separate step. The most basic approaches of [[steganalysis]] are visual or aural attacks, structural attacks, and statistical attacks. These approaches attempt to detect the steganographic algorithms that were used.<ref name=Wanyer2009>Wayner, Peter (2009). ''Disappearing Cryptography: Information Hiding : Steganography & Watermarking'', . Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Amsterdam;Boston.</ref> These algorithms range from unsophisticated to very sophisticated, with early algorithms being much easier to detect due to statistical anomalies that were present. The size of the message that is being hidden is a factor in how difficult it is to detect. The overall size of the cover object also plays a factor as well. If the cover object is small and the message is large, this can distort the statistics and make it easier to detect. A larger cover object with a small message decreases the statistics and gives it a better chance of going unnoticed.\n\nSteganalysis that targets a particular algorithm has much better success as it is able to key in on the anomalies that are left behind. This is because the analysis can perform a targeted search to discover known tendencies since it is aware of the behaviors that it commonly exhibits. When analyzing an image the least significant bits of many images are actually not random. The camera sensor, especially lower end sensors are not the best quality and can introduce some random bits. This can also be affected by the file compression done on the image. Secret messages can be introduced into the least significant bits in an image and then hidden.  A steganography tool can be used to camouflage the secret message in the least significant bits but it can introduce a random area that is too perfect. This area of perfect randomization stands out and can be detected by comparing the least significant bits to the next-to-least significant bits on image that hasn't been compressed.<ref name=Wanyer2009 />\n\nGenerally though, there are many techniques known to be able to hide messages in data using steganographic techniques. None are, by definition, obvious when users employ standard applications, but some can be detected by specialist tools. Others, however, are resistant to detection - or rather it is not possible to reliably distinguish data containing a hidden message from data containing just noise - even when the most sophisticated analysis is performed. Steganography is being used to hide cyber attacks, referred to as ''Stegware'', and detection is therefore not an adequate defence. The only way of defeating the threat is to transform data in a way that destroys any hidden messages,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319943090|title=Defenders Guide to Steganography|year=2017|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.21608.98561|last1=Wiseman|first1=Simon}}</ref> a process called [[Content Threat Removal]].\n\n==Applications==\n===Use in modern printers===\n{{Main|Printer steganography}}\nSome modern computer printers use steganography, including [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Xerox]] brand color laser printers. The printers add tiny yellow dots to each page. The barely-visible dots contain encoded printer serial numbers and date and time stamps.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2005/10/16 |title=Secret Code in Color Printers Lets Government Track You; Tiny Dots Show Where and When You Made Your Print |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=16 October 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Example from modern practice===\nThe larger the cover message (in binary data, the number of [[bit]]s) relative to the hidden message, the easier it is to hide the hidden message (as an analogy, the larger the \"haystack\", the easier it is to hide a \"needle\"). So [[digital image|digital picture]]s, which contain much data, are sometimes used to hide messages on the [[Internet]] and on other digital communication media. It is not clear how common this practice actually is.\n\nFor example, a 24-bit [[bitmap]] uses 8 bits to represent each of the three color values (red, green, and blue) of each [[pixel]]. The blue alone has 2<sup>8</sup> different levels of blue intensity. The difference between 11111111 and 11111110 in the value for blue intensity is likely to be undetectable by the human eye. Therefore, the [[least significant bit]] can be used more or less undetectably for something else other than color information. If that is repeated for the green and the red elements of each pixel as well, it is possible to encode one letter of [[ASCII]] text for every three [[pixel]]s.\n\nStated somewhat more formally, the objective for making steganographic encoding difficult to detect is to ensure that the changes to the carrier (the original signal) because of the injection of the payload (the signal to covertly embed) are visually (and ideally, statistically) negligible. The changes are indistinguishable from the [[noise floor]] of the carrier. All media can be a carrier, but media with a large amount of redundant or compressible information is better suited.\n\nFrom an [[information theory|information theoretical]] point of view, that means that the [[Communication channel|channel]] must have more [[channel capacity|capacity]] than the \"surface\" [[signal (information theory)|signal]] requires. There must be [[redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]]. For a digital image, it may be [[noise]] from the imaging element; for [[digital audio]], it may be noise from recording techniques or [[amplifier|amplification]] equipment. In general, electronics that digitize an [[analog (signal)|analog signal]] suffer from several noise sources, such as [[Johnson-Nyquist noise|thermal noise]], [[flicker noise]], and [[shot noise]]. The noise provides enough variation in the captured digital information that it can be exploited as a noise cover for hidden data. In addition, [[lossy compression]] schemes (such as [[JPEG]]) always introduce some error to the decompressed data, and it is possible to exploit that for steganographic use, as well.\n\nAlthough steganography and digital watermarking seem similar, they are not. In steganography, the hidden message should remain intact until it reaches its destination. Steganography can be used for [[digital watermark]]ing in which a message (being simply an identifier) is hidden in an image so that its source can be tracked or verified (for example, [[Coded Anti-Piracy]]) or even just to identify an image (as in the [[EURion constellation]]). In such a case, the technique of hiding the message (here, the watermark) must be robust to prevent tampering. However, digital watermarking sometimes requires a brittle watermark, which can be modified easily, to check whether the image has been tampered with. That is the key difference between steganography and digital watermarking.\n\n===Alleged use by intelligence services===\nIn 2010, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] alleged that the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Russian foreign intelligence service]] uses customized steganography software for embedding encrypted text messages inside image files for certain communications with \"illegal agents\" (agents without diplomatic cover) stationed abroad.<ref>{{cite web|title=Criminal complaint by Special Agent Ricci against alleged Russian agents|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/062810complaint2.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Justice}}</ref>\n\n===Distributed steganography===\nThere are distributed steganography methods,<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Distributed Steganography |publisher=[[IEEE]] |date=October 2011|doi=10.1109/IIHMSP.2011.20 |isbn=978-1-4577-1397-2 |title=2011 Seventh International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing |last1=Liao |first1=Xin |last2=Wen |first2=Qiao-yan |last3=Shi |first3=Sha |pages=153\u2013156 }}</ref> including methodologies that distribute the payload through multiple carrier files in diverse locations to make detection more difficult.

In 1999, he resigned from office over the allegations of certificate forgery. He was later convicted of certificate forgery and sentenced to two years in prison with an option of fine. He paid the fine and was later pardoned by President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]].\n\n==Political Career==\n\nIn 1999, Buhari had been a businessman and was the speaker of the [[House of Representatives (Nigeria)|Nigeria House of Representatives]], which placed him in the 4th highest office in Nigeria. However, this only lasted for six weeks before his University of Toronto scandal  and the beginning of what was known as the University of Toronto Saga. The scandal ultimately led to his resignation and prosecution.\n\n==Controversies==\n\nThe news of his age and certificate forgery first broke out on 16 February 1999 by an investigative news publication, [[TheNews magazine]]. Their investigation concluded that Buhari was born in 1970 and not 1963 as he claimed, and also that he did not graduate from the University of Toronto. The article published about the speaker dispelled that the speaker did not attended the university, not to talk of graduating. Section 65(1) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria disqualifies anyone below the age of 30 from running for membership of the House of Representatives.\n\nBuhari had also claimed that he completed his [[National Youth Service Corps|National Youth Service]] at Standard Construction in [[Kano]] which was also not true, as his name could not be found on any record in the list of those who completed the scheme. When Buhari was confronted with multiple allegations about his declaration and falsification, he promptly responded accusing the publications as an attack on him and proclaims his innocence and threatened to file a lawsuit against the publisher for libel. His confidence and response to the allegations were very assertive in nature and quite convincing that he was a victim of a witch-hunt. The magazine had written to the University of Toronto, requesting confirmation that Buhari was an alumnus. In response, Carlo Villanueva, an official of the Institution wrote, \u201c''Regarding your request for confirmation of degree for Mr Ibrahim Salisu Buhari. We have searched our records and could not find anybody with the name you are inquiring with.''\u201d\n\nHe had been found guilty in the court of public opinion and among in the halls where policies are made and sentences are meted out, the tension had reached a fever pitch.\n\nOn 23 July 1999, disgraced and cornered, Buhari faced [[Nigerians]] and admitted to falsifying his age and forging certificates as well as other contents of the NEWS report.\n\n\u201c''I apologize to you.
