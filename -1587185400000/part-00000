It is the seventeenth season in the ''[[Pretty Cure]]'' franchise, featuring the fifteenth generation of Cures. It is directed by Yoko Ikeda and written by Junko Komura. The series began airing on all [[All-Nippon News Network|ANN]] stations in Japan on February 2, 2020, succeeding ''[[Star Twinkle PreCure]]'' in its initial time slot. It is the second series in the franchise to have nature as its main topic after ''[[Pretty Cure Splash Star]]'', with elements and medicine used for the Cure's main motifs.\n\n==Story==\n13-year old Nodoka Hanadera just recently moved to the town of Sukoyaka with her family in hopes that it can give her a fresh start from her life in the city. Meanwhile, in a place deep inside the Earth known as the \"Healing Garden\", everything is in ruins after an attack from an antagonistic group called the Byougens, whose goal is to infect the garden and slowly poison the planet. Its ruler, Teatine, entrusted the care of her daughter Latte to the \"medical trainee\" Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran, on a mission to go to the surface world and find three people whose hearts can resonate with their paws and can partner with them. While on Earth, the fairies witness an attack from the Byougens. In a sudden twist of fate, Rabirin meets up with Nodoka who, despite her somewhat frail condition, is determined to protect others. This determination resonated with Rabirin and resulted in Nodoka becoming the Pretty Cure foretold in legend, Cure Grace. Joined in by Chiyu/Cure Fontaine and Hinata/Cure Sparkle, they all form the Healin' Good Pretty Cure team in order to fight against the threat of the Byougens and protect all life on Earth and the Healing Garden.\n\n==Characters==\n===Pretty Cures===\n;{{nihongo|Nodoka Hanadera|\u82b1\u5bfa\u306e\u3069\u304b|Hanadera Nodoka}} / {{nihongo|Cure Grace|\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9|Kyua Gur\u0113su}}<ref name=HPR>{{cite news|date=26 December 2019|url=https://www.cinematoday.jp/news/N0113206|work=Cinematoday|language=Japanese|accessdate=25 December 2019|title=\u300c\u30d2\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3063\u3069\u3000\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u300d\u58f0\u512a\u306b\u60a0\u6728\u78a7\uff01\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u767a\u8868}}</ref>\n:{{anime voice|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]]}}<ref name=HPR/>\n:A girl who is the pink-colored Pretty Cure of Flowers, her fairy partner is Rabirin<ref name=HPR/> and has moved to Sukoyaka City.

It is the seventeenth season in the ''[[Pretty Cure]]'' franchise, featuring the fifteenth generation of Cures. It is directed by Yoko Ikeda and written by Junko Komura. The series began airing on all [[All-Nippon News Network|ANN]] stations in Japan on February 2, 2020, succeeding ''[[Star Twinkle PreCure]]'' in its initial time slot. It is the second series in the franchise to have nature as its main topic after ''[[Pretty Cure Splash Star]]'', with elements and medicine used for the Cure's main motifs.\n\n==Story==\n13-year old Nodoka Hanadera just recently moved to the town of Sukoyaka with her family in hopes that it can give her a fresh start from her life in the city. Meanwhile, in a place deep inside the Earth known as the \"Healing Garden\", everything is in ruins after an attack from an antagonistic group called the Byougens, whose goal is to infect the garden and slowly poison the planet. Its ruler, Teatine, entrusted the care of her daughter Latte to the \"medical trainee\" Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran, on a mission to go to the surface world and find three people whose hearts can resonate with their paws and can partner with them. While on Earth, the fairies witness an attack from the Byougens. In a sudden twist of fate, Rabirin meets up with Nodoka who, despite her somewhat frail condition, is determined to protect others. This determination resonated with Rabirin and resulted in Nodoka becoming the Pretty Cure foretold in legend, Cure Grace. Joined in by Chiyu/Cure Fontaine and Hinata/Cure Sparkle, they all form the Healin' Good Pretty Cure team in order to fight against the threat of the Byougens and protect all life on Earth and the Healing Garden.\n\n==Characters==\n===Pretty Cures===\n;{{nihongo|Nodoka Hanadera|\u82b1\u5bfa\u306e\u3069\u304b|Hanadera Nodoka}} / {{nihongo|Cure Grace|\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9|Kyua Gur\u0113su}}<ref name=HPR>{{cite news|date=26 December 2019|url=https://www.cinematoday.jp/news/N0113206|work=Cinematoday|language=Japanese|accessdate=25 December 2019|title=\u300c\u30d2\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3063\u3069\u3000\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u300d\u58f0\u512a\u306b\u60a0\u6728\u78a7\uff01\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u767a\u8868}}</ref>\n:{{anime voice|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]]}}<ref name=HPR/>\n:A girl who is the pink-colored Pretty Cure of Flowers, her fairy partner is Rabirin<ref name=HPR/> and has moved to Sukoyaka City.

He founded [[Mount St Bernard Abbey]], a [[Trappist]] abbey in [[Leicestershire]], and worked for the reconversion or reconciliation of Britain to Catholicism.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was the son of [[Charles March-Phillipps]] of [[Garendon Hall]], Leicestershire, and Harriet Ducarel, daughter of [[Gerald Gustavus Ducarel ]] of [[Walford, Somerset]].<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=7457|first=Margaret|last=Pawley|title=Lisle, Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps de}}</ref> The de Lisle family of Leicestershire were originally the Phillippses from London. The Garendon estate, near Loughborough, was inherited by Thomas March who adopted the name Phillipps, and married Susan de Lisles. Their son, Charles, adopted the de Lisle crest and arms. Steady accumulation of landed property made him one of the \u2018wealthiest commoners\u2019 in England. When Charles March-Phillipps died in 1862, Ambrose took the additional name of Lisle, becoming Ambrose Charles Lisle March Phillipps de Lisle.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/member/march-phillipps-charles-1779-1862 \"March Phillipps, Charles (1779-1862), of Garendon Park\", The History of Parliament]</ref>\n\nHe spent his earliest years at his birthplace and was brought up as a member of the [[Church of England]], receiving his first religious instruction from his uncle, William March Phillipps, a [[High Church]] clergyman. In 1818 Ambrose was sent to a private school in [[South Croxton]], whence he was removed in 1820 to [[Maisemore]] Court School, near [[Gloucester]], kept by the Rev. [[George Hodson (priest)|George Hodson]]. The [[Bishop of Gloucester]], [[Henry Ryder]], having married Sophia March Phillipps, was his uncle by marriage, and so the boy spent Sundays and holidays at the bishop's palace.<ref name=Burton>{{cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps De Lisle|volume=4}}</ref>\n\nAt school he met for the first time a Catholic, the Abb\u00e9 Giraud, a French \u00e9migr\u00e9 priest. A visit to Paris in 1823 gave him his first acquaintance with Catholic liturgy. The effect on his mind was shown on his return home when he persuaded the Anglican rector to place a cross<!--crucifix?--> on the communion table, but this first effort to restore the cross to English churches was stopped by [[Herbert Marsh|the Bishop of Peterborough]].  He converted to Catholicism, and immediately removed from Rev. Hodson's school, and returned home with his father, who arranged for him to continue his preparation for the university under the private tuition of the Rev. William Wilkinson. He was obliged every Sunday to attend the Anglican church, but did not join in the service.<ref name=Burton/>\n\nAmbrose Phillipps was admitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in November 1825,<ref>{{acad|id=D825AL|name=De Lisle (formerly Phillipps), Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps}}</ref> though he did not go into residence there until 16 October 1826. At the university he found a congenial friend in [[Kenelm Henry Digby|Kenelm Digby]], author of ''Mores Catholici'' and ''The Broadstone of Honour'', who was, like himself, a member of a long-established family of the [[gentry]] and a recent convert. There was no Catholic chapel then at Cambridge, and every Sunday for two years these two young Catholics used to ride, fasting, over to [[St Edmund's College, Ware]], a distance of twenty-five miles, for [[Catholic Mass]] and Communion. It was on one of these visits to St Edmund's, in April 1828, that Phillipps was seized with a serious illness, having broken a blood-vessel in his lung. The doctors recommended his father to take him to Italy for the winter, and this necessarily cut short his Cambridge career, so that he had to leave the university without taking his degree.(He could not have received it anyway, before [[Catholic Emancipation]].) On his return to England in 1829, he became acquainted with the [[Ignatius Spencer|Hon. George Spencer]], then an Anglican clergyman, and his conversation was largely instrumental in leading to Spencer's conversion, as the latter admits in his ''Account of my Conversion'' \u2013 \"I passed many hours daily in conversation with Phillipps and was satisfied beyond all expectations with the answers he gave me to the different questions I proposed about the principal tenets and practices of Catholics.\" The following winter (1830\u20131831) he again spent in Italy, on which occasion he met [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati]], who made a great impression on him.<ref name=Burton/>\n\nOn 25 July 1833, Ambrose Phillipps married Laura Mary, eldest daughter of the Hon. Thomas Clifford, son of Hugh, fourth [[Baron Clifford of Chudleigh]], in the Church of St James, Spanish Place, London.<ref name=Grace>[http://gracedieu.com/history-manor-house/ \"The History of the Manor House\", Grace Dieu Manor School]</ref> Charles March Phillipps gave his son possession of the second family estate, the manor of Grace-Dieu in Leicestershire, which before the [[Protestant Reformation]] had been the [[Augustinian]] [[Grace Dieu Priory]]. Here Ambrose Phillipps built a new manor-house [[Grace Dieu Manor]], 1833\u201334,<ref>His architect was [[William Railton]] (1801\u20131877), a man of modest reputation soon to be appointed architect to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and designer of [[Nelson's Column]], [[Trafalgar Square]]; the Roman Catholic chapel at Grace-Dieu was enriched by [[A.W.N.

Writing a few years before his death<ref>Letter to the Rev. W. R. Brownlow, 10 December 1869, ''Life'', I, p. 349</ref> he thus summed up the chief aims of his own life: <blockquote>There were three great objects to which I felt after my own conversion as a boy of fifteen specially drawn by internal feeling for the whole space of forty-five years which have since elapsed. The first was to restore to England the primitive monastic contemplative observance, which God enabled me to do in the foundation of the Trappist monastery of Mount St Bernard. The second was the restoration of the primitive ecclesiastical chant, my edition of which is now recommended by the Archbishop of Westminster for the use of churches and chapels. The third was the restoration of the Anglican Church to Catholic Unity.</blockquote>\n\n==Catholic revival==\n[[File:Mount St Bernards Abbey.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Mount St Bernard Abbey]]\nAccording to Purcell, \"In that early day no one did more for the Catholic revival in England, almost single-handed, than Phillipps de Lisle\".<ref name=Purcell>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092447600#page/n9/mode/2up Purcell, Edmund Sheridan. ''Life and Letters of Ambrose Phillipps de Lisle'', p.66, Macmillan and Co., Ltd., London, 1900]</ref>\n\nIn the foundation of the [[Cistercian]] [[Mount St Bernard Abbey]] in Leicestershire he received generous support from his friend John, [[Earl of Shrewsbury]], but it was he himself who conceived the idea, believing it necessary that the ascetic aspect of Catholic life should be presented to the English people. Mount St Bernard Abbey was the first monastery built in England since the Reformation.<ref name=Purcell/> He gave both land and money, severely depleting his own resources in providing the necessary buildings. This work was begun in 1835 and completed in 1844, while, during the same period, he founded missions at [[Grace-Dieu|Grace Dieu]] and [[Whitwick]]. His disappointment was great when he found that the [[Trappist]]s were prevented by their rule from undertaking active missionary work, because he attached the greatest importance to a supply of zealous missionary priests who would labour in English villages; he said, \"I would have them go about and preach everywhere on the foreign plan, in the fields or in the high roads even\".<ref>Letter to Lord Shrewsbury, 1839; ''Life'', I, p. 105</ref>\n\nIn 1838 he joined his friend Rev. George Spencer in establishing and propagating the Association of Universal Prayer for the Conversion of England. In a continental tour he and Spencer made together, accompanied by Mrs Phillipps and two of her children, in 1844, they passed through Belgium, Germany, and North Italy, meeting many distinguished Catholics and enlisting the sympathy of [[prelate]]s and clergy in the cause. [[Nicholas Wiseman]] was co-operating in Rome, and soon the movement spread widely through the Catholic world. He was for some time the only Catholic who was in confidential correspondence with the leaders of the [[Oxford Movement]], including [[John Henry Newman]], receiving them at Grace-Dieu.  He saw the Movement as a step towards his desire of reconciling the Anglican Church with Rome. As his son stated:<ref>''Life and Letters'', I, 254, note</ref> <blockquote>National Conversion by means of Corporate Reunion he likened unto the Apostolic practice of fishing with a net \"gathering in multitudes of all kinds of fishes\". And this he considered to be his own special call from on High, to prepare the way and hasten the time when the Divine Word should again be spoken to Peter, 'Cast your nets into the deep\".</blockquote>\n\n==Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom==\nHe welcomed the [[restoration of the English Catholic hierarchy]] in 1850, and tried to reconcile to it some of the Catholic laymen who thought it inexpedient. During the debates that ensued throughout the country he wrote two pamphlets: ''A Letter to Lord Shrewsbury on the Re-establishment of the Hierarchy and the Present Position of Catholic Affairs'', and ''A few words on Lord John Russell's Letter to the Bishop of Durham''. The progress of events raised his hopes so high that he regarded the reconciliation of the Anglican Church to the [[Holy See]] as imminent, and to hasten its fulfilment entered on a new crusade of prayer, in which the co-operation of non-Catholics was desired. The [[Association for Promoting the Unity of Christendom]] (A.P.U.C.) was founded on 8 September 1857, by fourteen people including Father Lockhart, Fr. Collins, O. Cist., and de Lisle; the rest were Anglicans, with one exception, a Russo-Greek priest.\n\nThe only obligation incumbent on members, who might be Catholics, Anglicans, or Greeks, was to pray to God for the unity of the baptised body. At first the association progressed rapidly. De Lisle wrote to [[John Manners, 7th Duke of Rutland|Lord John Manners]] (''Life'', I, 415) saying, \"We soon counted among our ranks many Catholic Bishops and Archbishops and Dignitaries of all descriptions from Cardinals downwards; the Patriarch of Constantinople and other great Eastern prelates, the Primate of the Russlart Church. ...I do not think any Anglican Bishops joined us, but a large number of clergy of the second order.\" He gave the number of members as nine thousand. The formation of this association was, however, regarded with distrust by Dr. (later Cardinal) [[Henry Edward Manning|Manning]] and other Catholics, who also took exception to de Lisle's treatise ''On the Future Unity of Christendom''. The matter was referred to Rome and was finally settled by a papal rescript addressed ''Ad omnes episcopos Angli\u00e6'', dated 16 September 1864, which condemned the association and directed the bishops to take steps to prevent Catholics from joining it.\n\nThis was a great blow to de Lisle, who considered that \"the authorities had been deceived by a false relation of facts\".<ref>Letter to Editor of Union Review, 20 December 1864; ''Life'', I, 400</ref> He however withdrew his name from the A.P.U.C. \"under protest, as an act of submission to the Holy See\". The ground on which the association was condemned was that it subverted the Divine constitution of the Church, inasmuch as its aim rested on the supposition that the true Church consists partly of the Catholic Church in communion with Rome, \"partly also of the [[Photian Schism]] and the Anglican heresy, to which equally with the Roman Church belong the one Lord, the one faith and one baptism\" (Rescript, in ''Life'', I, 388). His own pamphlet was not censured, but the condemnation of the A.P.U.C. was regarded by him as the death-blow of his hopes for the reunion of Christendom during his own lifetime. However, his own belief in it persevered and influenced his views in other Catholic affairs. Thus he warmly supported the attendance of Catholics at the English universities, and he even approved of the abortive project of a Uniate English Church.\n\nThe rest of his life passed without any very special incident, though he continued ever to take an interest in public affairs as affecting the fortunes of the Church, and in the same connection he carried on intimate and cordial correspondence with men as different as Newman, [[William Ewart Gladstone]], and [[Charles Forbes Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert|Count de Montalembert]]. He counted among his friends [[John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury|John, Earl of Shrewsbury]], Cardinal Wiseman, [[A. W. N. Pugin]], who provided designs for Grace-Dieu, [[Frederick William Faber]], and many other well-known Catholics, and though he differed on many points from Cardinal Manning and Dr. [[William George Ward|W.G. Ward]] he remained on friendly terms with both. He died at [[Garendon Hall|Garendon]], survived by his wife and eleven of his sixteen children.\n\nBesides the pamphlets that have been mentioned, his other published works include ''Mahometanism in its relation to Prophecy; or an Inquiry into the prophecies concerning Anti-Christ, with some reference to their bearing on the events of the present day'' (1855). He also translated [[Dominic Barberi]]'s ''Lamentations of England'' (1831); Manzoni's ''Vindication of Catholic Morality'' (1836); Montalembert's ''St Elizabeth of Hungary'' (1839); Rio's ''La petite Chouannerie'' (1842); ''Maxims and Examples of the Saints'' (1844); and he compiled: ''Manual of Devotion for the Confraternity of the Living Rosary'' (1843); ''Catholic Christian's Complete Manual'' (1847); ''The Little Gradual'' (1847); ''Thesaurus anim\u00e6 Christian\u00e6'' (1847); ''Sequenti\u00e6 de Festis per Annum'' (1862).\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092447600#page/n9/mode/2up Purcell, Edmund Sheridan.

The matter was referred to Rome and was finally settled by a papal rescript addressed ''Ad omnes episcopos Angli\u00e6'', dated 16 September 1864, which condemned the association and directed the bishops to take steps to prevent Catholics from joining it.\n\nThis was a great blow to de Lisle, who considered that \"the authorities had been deceived by a false relation of facts\".<ref>Letter to Editor of Union Review, 20 December 1864; ''Life'', I, 400</ref> He however withdrew his name from the A.P.U.C. \"under protest, as an act of submission to the Holy See\". The ground on which the association was condemned was that it subverted the Divine constitution of the Church, inasmuch as its aim rested on the supposition that the true Church consists partly of the Catholic Church in communion with Rome, \"partly also of the [[Photian Schism]] and the Anglican heresy, to which equally with the Roman Church belong the one Lord, the one faith and one baptism\" (Rescript, in ''Life'', I, 388). His own pamphlet was not censured, but the condemnation of the A.P.U.C. was regarded by him as the death-blow of his hopes for the reunion of Christendom during his own lifetime. But his own belief in it persevered and influenced his views in other Catholic affairs. Thus he warmly supported the attendance of Catholics at the English universities, and he even approved of the abortive project of a Uniate English Church.\n\nThe rest of his life passed without any very special incident, though he continued ever to take an interest in public affairs as affecting the fortunes of the Church, and in the same connection he carried on intimate and cordial correspondence with men as different as Newman, [[William Ewart Gladstone]], and [[Charles Forbes Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert|Count de Montalembert]]. He counted among his friends [[John Talbot, 16th Earl of Shrewsbury|John, Earl of Shrewsbury]], Cardinal Wiseman, [[A. W. N. Pugin]], who provided designs for Grace-Dieu, [[Frederick William Faber]], and many other well-known Catholics, and though he differed on many points from Cardinal Manning and Dr. [[William George Ward|W.G. Ward]] he remained on friendly terms with both. He died at [[Garendon Hall|Garendon]], survived by his wife and eleven of his sixteen children.\n\nBesides the pamphlets that have been mentioned, his other published works include ''Mahometanism in its relation to Prophecy; or an Inquiry into the prophecies concerning Anti-Christ, with some reference to their bearing on the events of the present day'' (1855). He also translated [[Dominic Barberi]]'s ''Lamentations of England'' (1831); Manzoni's ''Vindication of Catholic Morality'' (1836); Montalembert's ''St Elizabeth of Hungary'' (1839); Rio's ''La petite Chouannerie'' (1842); ''Maxims and Examples of the Saints'' (1844); and he compiled: ''Manual of Devotion for the Confraternity of the Living Rosary'' (1843); ''Catholic Christian's Complete Manual'' (1847); ''The Little Gradual'' (1847); ''Thesaurus anim\u00e6 Christian\u00e6'' (1847); ''Sequenti\u00e6 de Festis per Annum'' (1862).\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092447600#page/n9/mode/2up Purcell, Edmund Sheridan.

Paul won the [[2015 French Open \u2013 Boys' Singles|2015 French Open boys' singles]] title by defeating fellow American [[Taylor Fritz]] in the final in three sets. He also reached the boys' singles final at the [[2015 US Open (tennis)|2015 US Open]], this time losing to Fritz in three sets. Paul was a quarterfinalist at the  [[2017 Citi Open - Men's Singles|2017 Citi Open]], an ATP 500 tournament, before losing to [[Kei Nishikori]].\n\n== Junior career ==\nTommy Paul has always been one of the highest ranked juniors of his class. Paul reached a career-high ITF junior rank of No. 3 on December 9, 2015.\n\nPaul reached two junior Grand Slam finals in 2015, winning against [[Taylor Fritz]] at the [[2015 French Open \u2013 Boys' Singles|French Open]], and losing to him at the [[2015 US Open \u2013 Boys' Singles|U.S. Open]].\n\n==Professional==\nPaul turned pro in 2015. He has a career-high [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] singles ranking of No. 57 achieved on March 2, 2020. Unusually for an American, Paul has shown a preference for playing on clay, having won the Junior French Open and his first four [[International Tennis Federation|ITF Futures]] singles titles on clay. He qualified for the main draw of a Grand Slam for the first time at the [[2015 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|2015 US Open]], losing to [[Andreas Seppi]] in the first round.\n\nIn March 2016, Paul cracked the Top 200 for the first time by qualifying for the [[2016 Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Masters]]. In April, Paul was awarded a wild card into the [[2016 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships]] at Houston, and defeated 53rd-ranked [[Paolo Lorenzi]] in the 1st round for his first career ATP level win.\n\nPaul would then mainly compete on the ATP Challenger circuit and ITF circuit for the remainder of 2016 and early 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, after going through qualifying at the [[Atlanta Open (tennis)|Atlanta Open]], he defeated seventh seed and 53rd-ranked [[Chung Hyeon]] in three sets. He then went on to defeat [[Malek Jaziri]] in three sets to advance to his first ATP tour-level quarterfinal. Then he was defeated by third seed [[Gilles M\u00fcller]].  Following his performance in Atlanta, Tommy was awarded a wildcard into the ATP 500 [[Washington Open (tennis)|Washington Open]]. Paul defeated [[Casper Ruud]] to advance to the second round. He then played [[Lucas Pouille]] and achieved the biggest win of his career, defeating the Frenchman in straight sets. In the next round, he faced [[Gilles M\u00fcller]] again, but this time came out on top in three sets to reach his first ATP 500 quarterfinal. There he faced [[Kei Nishikori]] and lost in three sets.\n\nIn September 2019, Paul broke into the [[ATP Rankings|top 100]] for the first time in his career having won his second ATP Challenger title of the year in [[2019 Oracle Challenger Series \u2013 New Haven|New Haven]], after winning in [[2019 Sarasota Open \u2013 Singles|Sarasota]] earlier in the season.\n\n== Playing style ==\nPaul possesses a strong attacking forehand and solid footwork along the baseline and speed coming into net, attributes that have allowed him success on clay surfaces.<ref>{{Cite web |

Jersey]]) is an [[United States|American]] professional [[tennis]] player. Paul won the [[2015 French Open \u2013 Boys' Singles|2015 French Open boys' singles]] title by defeating fellow American [[Taylor Fritz]] in the final in three sets. He also reached the boys' singles final at the [[2015 US Open (tennis)|2015 US Open]], this time losing to Fritz in three sets. Paul was a quarterfinalist at the  [[2017 Citi Open - Men's Singles|2017 Citi Open]], an ATP 500 tournament, before losing to [[Kei Nishikori]].\n\n== Junior career ==\nTommy Paul has always been one of the highest ranked juniors of his class. Paul reached a career-high ITF junior rank of No. 3 on December 9, 2015.\n\nPaul reached two junior Grand Slam finals in 2015, winning against [[Taylor Fritz]] at the [[2015 French Open \u2013 Boys' Singles|French Open]], and losing to him at the [[2015 US Open \u2013 Boys' Singles|U.S. Open]].\n\n==Professional==\nPaul turned pro in 2015. He has a career-high [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] singles ranking of No. 191 achieved on April 11, 2016. Unusually for an American, Paul has shown a preference for playing on clay, having won the Junior French Open and his first four [[International Tennis Federation|ITF Futures]] singles titles on clay. He qualified for the main draw of a Grand Slam for the first time at the [[2015 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|2015 US Open]], losing to [[Andreas Seppi]] in the first round.\n\nIn March 2016, Paul cracked the Top 200 for the first time by qualifying for the [[2016 Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Masters]]. In April, Paul was awarded a wild card into the [[2016 U.S. Men's Clay Court Championships]] at Houston, and defeated 53rd-ranked [[Paolo Lorenzi]] in the 1st round for his first career ATP level win.\n\nPaul would then mainly compete on the ATP Challenger circuit and ITF circuit for the remainder of 2016 and early 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, after going through qualifying at the [[Atlanta Open (tennis)|Atlanta Open]], he defeated seventh seed and 53rd-ranked [[Chung Hyeon]] in three sets. He then went on to defeat [[Malek Jaziri]] in three sets to advance to his first ATP tour level quarterfinal. Then he was defeated by third seed [[Gilles M\u00fcller]].  Following his performance in Atlanta, Tommy was awarded a wildcard into the ATP 500 [[Washington Open (tennis)|Washington Open]]. Paul defeated [[Casper Ruud]] to advance to the second round. He then played [[Lucas Pouille]] and achieved the biggest win of his career, defeating the Frenchman in straight sets. In the next round, he faced [[Gilles M\u00fcller]] again, but this time came out on top in three sets to reach his first ATP 500 quarterfinal. There he faced [[Kei Nishikori]] and lost in three sets.\n\nIn September 2019, Paul broke into the [[ATP Rankings|top 100]] for the first time in his career having won his second ATP Challenger title of the year in [[2019 Oracle Challenger Series \u2013 New Haven|New Haven]], after winning in [[2019 Sarasota Open \u2013 Singles|Sarasota]] earlier on in the season.\n\n== Playing style ==\nPaul possesses a strong attacking forehand and solid footwork along the baseline and speed coming into net, attributes that have allowed him success on clay surfaces.<ref>{{Cite web |
