Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation (significantly increasing time to confirm diagnosis). By mid-February, the U.S. is still only testing about 100 samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow. This contributed to the inability to establish effective surveillance and contact tracing programs essential to containing the spread of the virus. Researchers concluded in late February that \"the virus had probably been [[Transmission (medicine)|spreading]] for weeks\" person-to-person. Sometime after February 24, the CDC directs states to use a workaround, using just two of the three probes and evaluate them locally.<ref name=\"NYT_Test1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html|title=The Lost Month:How a Failure to Test Blinded the U.S. to Covid-19|date=March 28, 2020|via=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nOn January 20, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] and [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier]] [[Li Keqiang]] issue the first public warning about the coronavirus to Chinese citizens.

Testing is essential to conducting [[Public health surveillance|community surveillance]] and [[contact tracing]] to measure the spread of the virus and establish local quarantines, preventing further spread. As it typically does, the CDC developed its own test. The CDC test used three genetic sequences or \"probes\", rather than using a German-developed, two-sequence test that the WHO was distributing. However, the CDC test is soon found to be defective, with the third probe giving inconclusive results. The CDC directed state health department labs to send all samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta for evaluation (significantly increasing time to confirm diagnosis). By mid-February, the U.S. is still only testing about 100 samples per day, versus thousands per day in other countries. With limited testing capacity, the scope of testing remained extremely narrow. This contributed to the inability to establish effective surveillance and contact tracing programs essential to containing the spread of the virus. Researchers concluded in late February that \"the virus had probably been [[Transmission (medicine)|spreading]] for weeks\" person-to-person. Sometime after February 24, the CDC directs states to use a workaround, using just two of the three probes and evaluate them locally.<ref name=\"NYT_Test1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html|title=The Lost Month:How a Failure to Test Blinded the U.S. to Covid-19|date=March 28, 2020|via=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nOn January 20, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] and [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|premier]] [[Li Keqiang]] issue the first public warning about the coronavirus to Chinese citizens.

By the third week of February, the group had \"effectively concluded that the United States had already lost the fight to contain the virus, and that it needed to switch to mitigation\" such as NPI's.

Trump still had not directed NPI's as of March 11. As late as March 13, the CDC was still questioning the benefit of closing schools.

Fossils are known from the [[Arenig]] to the [[Quaternary]] (age range: from 478.6 to 0.0 million years ago). Fossils are found in the marine strata all over the world.<ref name=AA/>\n[[File: Nuculidae - Nucula piacentina.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Fossil valves of ''Nucula piacentina'' from Pliocene of Italy]]\n\n==Description==\nShells of species within this genus can reach a size of about {{convert|30|mm}}. They are equivalve, symmetrical, approximately triangular. The surface has fine concentric growth lines. These clams live in the muddy sand close to the sediment surface at a depth of 20 to 200 meters.<ref>[http://www.genustraithandbook.org.uk/genus/nucula/ Marine Microfauna Genus Trait Handbook]</ref>\n\n==Species==\nNowadays there are still many species of this genus, which have had virtually no change in the course of time.

Fossils are known from the [[Arenig]] to the [[Quaternary]] (age range: from 478.6 to 0.0 million years ago). Fossils are found in the marine strata all over the world.<ref name=AA/>\n[[File: Nuculidae - Nucula piacentina.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Fossil valves of ''Nucula piacentina'' from Pliocene of Italy]]\n\n==Description==\nShells of species within this genus can reach a size of about {{convert|30|mm}}. They are equivalve, symmetrical, approximately triangular. The surface has fine concentric growth lines. These clams live in the muddy sand close to the sediment surface at a depth of 20 to 200 meters.<ref>[http://www.genustraithandbook.org.uk/genus/nucula/ Marine Microfauna Genus Trait Handbook]</ref>\n\n==Species==\nNowadays there are still many species of this genus, which have had virtually no change in the course of time.

He has been accused by numerous women of [[rape]], [[drug-facilitated sexual assault]], [[sexual battery]], [[child sexual abuse]], and [[sexual misconduct]]. Assault allegations against Cosby became more public after a stand-up routine by comedian [[Hannibal Buress]] became popular in October 2014, alluding to Cosby's covert sexual misbehavior; thereafter, many additional claims were made. The dates of the alleged incidents have spanned from 1965 to 2008 in 10 U.S. states and in one Canadian province.<ref name=DailyBeastListofAccusersNov2014/><ref name=ETOnlineListOfAccusersFeb2015>{{cite web|last1=Seemayer|first1=Zach|title=Bill Cosby's Accusers: A Timeline of Alleged rape Claims (Updated)|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/154160_timeline_of_bill_cosby_sexual_assault_allegations|publisher=ET Online|access-date=April 24, 2015|date=February 26, 2015}}</ref><ref name=SlateListofAccusersNov2014>{{cite web|first1=Filipa|last1=Ioannou|first2=Ben|last2=Mathis-Lilley|first3=Elliot|last3=Hannon|title=A Complete List of the Women Who Have Accused Bill Cosby of Sexual Assault|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/11/21/bill_cosby_accusers_list_sexual_assault_rape_drugs_feature_in_women_s_stories.html|publisher=Slate|access-date=April 24, 2015|date=November 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nCosby has maintained his innocence and repeatedly denied the allegations made against him.

The fact they are being repeated does not make them true. Mr. Cosby does not intend to dignify these allegations with any comment.\" This statement was also posted to the front page of Cosby's official website.

But the insurer has also filed lawsuits related to both cases, aiming for [[declaratory relief]] that it is not responsible.\n\nCosby's homeowners insurance does cover him for \"personal injury\", which is defined in his policy as including \"bodily injury\"; \"shock, emotional distress, mental injury\"; \"invasion of privacy\"; and \"defamation, libel, or slander\". However, the policy contains an exclusion for \"sexual, physical or mental abuse\", setting the stage for a potentially novel legal battle over whether a defamation claim about the denial of sexual abuse is covered.<ref name=\"AIG_Lawsuit\"/>\n\nIn September 2015, Cosby filed a motion to either dismiss AIG's lawsuit or put it on hold.

In her opinion, O'Connell looked at the \"arising out of\" exclusion noted above and declares the meaning is ambiguous. \"The Court finds that both Plaintiff's broad interpretation and Defendant's narrow interpretation of 'arising out of' are reasonable{{nbsp}}... The sexual misconduct exclusion could reasonably be read to require that Dickinson's claims merely relate to sexual misconduct, or that Dickinson's claims be proximately caused by the sexual misconduct\", she wrote.\n\nSince ambiguous terms are interpreted in favor of finding coverage, Cosby prevailed. O'Connell gave a second independent reason for finding in Cosby's favor. She looked at the Dickinson complaint and concluded that there are allegations independent of sexual misconduct. \"For example, allegations that Defendant 'intentionally drugged' Dickinson 'even though he knew that she had been in a rehab center for addiction a few months before' could reasonably be interpreted as independent of sexual misconduct, and therefore, within the Policies' coverage{{nbsp}}... Similarly, the Dickinson Complaint alleges that Defendant's statements contain numerous implications about Dickinson, including the implication that 'Dickinson has copied the claims made publicly by other women against Defendant' and 'the implication that Ms. Dickinson's rape disclosure is a lie and that therefore she is a liar'\", she wrote. As courts impose coverage in a \"mixed\" action, Cosby prevailed here as well but this ruling does not apply to the Massachusetts case, where AIG and Cosby are still fighting to determine who is liable.<ref name=Cosby_Dismisses_AIG_Dickinson>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/bill-cosby-scores-victory-against-insurance-company-203210562.html;_ylt=A0LEV7rmh0dWcyEATL0PxQt.;_ylu=X3oDMTByMjB0aG5zBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--|title=Bill Cosby Scores Victory Against Insurance Company|date=November 13, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}</ref> AIG plans to appeal this ruling.<ref name=Cosby_AIG_Appeal_Dickinson>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-aig-s-home-insurance-is-covering-bill-cosby-s-legal-costs-200246340.html;_ylt=A0LEVjs5KOhWhwIAEi0PxQt.;_ylu=X3oDMTByMjB0aG5zBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--|title=Why AIG is paying Bill Cosby's legal costs|date=March 14, 2016|access-date=March 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA Massachusetts federal judge, Mark G.

The fact they are being repeated does not make them true.

But the insurer has also filed lawsuits related to both cases, aiming for [[declaratory relief]] that it is not responsible.\n\nCosby's homeowners insurance does cover him for \"personal injury\", which is defined in his policy as including \"bodily injury\"; \"shock, emotional distress, mental injury\"; \"invasion of privacy\"; and \"defamation, libel, or slander\".

In her opinion, O'Connell looked at the \"arising out of\" exclusion noted above and declares the meaning is ambiguous. \"The Court finds that both Plaintiff's broad interpretation and Defendant's narrow interpretation of 'arising out of' are reasonable{{nbsp}}... The sexual misconduct exclusion could reasonably be read to require that Dickinson's claims merely relate to sexual misconduct, or that Dickinson's claims be proximately caused by the sexual misconduct\", she wrote.\n\nSince ambiguous terms are interpreted in favor of finding coverage, Cosby prevailed. O'Connell gave a second independent reason for finding in Cosby's favor. She looked at the Dickinson complaint and concluded that there are allegations independent of sexual misconduct. \"For example, allegations that Defendant 'intentionally drugged' Dickinson 'even though he knew that she had been in a rehab center for addiction a few months before' could reasonably be interpreted as independent of sexual misconduct, and therefore, within the Policies' coverage{{nbsp}}... Similarly, the Dickinson Complaint alleges that Defendant's statements contain numerous implications about Dickinson, including the implication that 'Dickinson has copied the claims made publicly by other women against Defendant' and 'the implication that Ms. Dickinson's rape disclosure is a lie and that therefore she is a liar'\", she wrote. As courts impose coverage in a \"mixed\" action, Cosby prevailed here as well but this ruling does not apply to the Massachusetts case, where AIG and Cosby are still fighting to determine who is liable.<ref name=Cosby_Dismisses_AIG_Dickinson>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/bill-cosby-scores-victory-against-insurance-company-203210562.html;_ylt=A0LEV7rmh0dWcyEATL0PxQt.;_ylu=X3oDMTByMjB0aG5zBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--|title=Bill Cosby Scores Victory Against Insurance Company|date=November 13, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}</ref> AIG plans to appeal this ruling.<ref name=Cosby_AIG_Appeal_Dickinson>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-aig-s-home-insurance-is-covering-bill-cosby-s-legal-costs-200246340.html;_ylt=A0LEVjs5KOhWhwIAEi0PxQt.;_ylu=X3oDMTByMjB0aG5zBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--|title=Why AIG is paying Bill Cosby's legal costs|date=March 14, 2016|access-date=March 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA Massachusetts federal judge, Mark G.

There they discussed lengthening the current ten-year statute of limitations in Colorado for sexual assault. Gloria Allred, who represents most of the nearly 60 alleged victims, spoke to the gathering via Skype: \"I have been to New Jersey, and I'm not aware of any down side since they eliminated the statute (of limitations) for rape and sex assault.\" Brauchler said he does not want any victim denied a fair hearing because of Colorado's statute, but \"I don't have a magic number.\" Any change would have to be done carefully, he said, because the more time that passes between an alleged sex assault and prosecution, the harder it is for the accused to defend themselves.

The legislation would further impose criminal penalties on anyone who publicly displays a Medal of Freedom revoked by the president, including up to a year in prison. \"To continue honoring Bill Cosby with this prestigious accolade would be an affront to women nationwide, particularly those who were victims of his horrific acts\", Gosar wrote in a letter to fellow lawmakers asking them to co-sponsor his bill.<ref name=\"Revoke_Medal_of_Freedom ?\">{{cite news |last=Morcos|first=Christina|date=January 6, 2016 |title=Republican pushing to revoke Bill Cosby's presidential medal| publisher=The Hill blogs |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/264869-gop-lawmaker-plans-measure-to-urge-revoking-bill-cosbys-presidential|accessdate=January 6, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Oregon sex assault bill===\nA bill in the Oregon Senate would create an exception to the 12-year statute of limitations for the most serious sex crimes\u2014including rape, sodomy and child abuse\u2014allowing prosecutors to bring charges if new concrete evidence emerges.
