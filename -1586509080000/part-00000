The earlier standard had been the number of words per minute. One baud was equal to one pulse per second, a more robust measure as word length can vary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.linfo.org/baud.html|title=Baud definition by The Linux Information Project (LINFO)|website=www.linfo.org|access-date=2018-01-18}}</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nThe '''symbol duration time''', also known as [[Unit interval (data transmission)|unit interval]], can be directly measured as the time between transitions by looking at an [[eye diagram]] of the signal on an [[oscilloscope]]. The symbol duration time ''T''<sub>s</sub> can be calculated as:\n\n:<math> T_\\text{s}  =  {1 \\over f_\\text{s}}, </math>\n\nwhere ''f''<sub>s</sub> is the symbol rate.\nThere is also a chance of miscommunication which leads to ambiguity.\n\n:Example: Communication at the baud rate ''1000&nbsp;Bd'' means communication by means of sending ''1000&nbsp;symbols per second''. In the case of a [[modem]], this corresponds to ''1000&nbsp;tones per second''; similarly, in the case of a line code, this corresponds to ''1000&nbsp;pulses per second''. The symbol duration time is ''{{sfrac|1|1000}}&nbsp;second'' (that&nbsp;is, ''1&nbsp;millisecond'').\n\nIn [[Digital data|digital]] systems (i.e., using discrete/discontinuous values) with [[binary code]], 1&nbsp;Bd = 1&nbsp;bit/s. By contrast, non-digital (or [[Analog signal|analog]]) systems use a continuous range of values to represent information and in these systems the exact informational size of 1&nbsp;Bd varies.\n\nThe baud is scaled using standard [[metric prefix]]es, so that for example\n*1 kBd (kilobaud) = 1000 Bd\n*1 MBd (megabaud) = 1000 kBd\n*1 GBd (gigabaud) = 1000 MBd.\n\n==Relationship to gross bit rate==\nThe symbol rate is related to [[gross bit rate]] expressed in bit/s.\nThe term baud has sometimes incorrectly been used to mean bit rate,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.textfiles.com/apple/bitsbaud.txt |title=BITS, BAUD RATE, AND BPS Taking the Mystery Out of Modem Speeds |last1=Banks |first1=Michael A. |date=1990 |publisher=Brady Books/Simon & Schuster |accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref> since these rates are the same in old [[modem]]s as well as in the simplest digital communication links using only one bit per symbol, such that binary digit \"0\" is represented by one symbol, and binary digit \"1\" by another symbol. In more advanced modems and data transmission techniques, a symbol may have more than two states, so it may represent more than one [[bit]]. A bit (binary digit) always represents one of two states.\n\nIf ''N'' bits are conveyed per symbol, and the gross bit rate is ''R'', inclusive of channel coding overhead, the symbol rate ''f''<sub>s</sub> can be calculated as\n\n:<math>  f_\\text{s}  =   {R \\over N}. </math>\n\nBy taking information per pulse ''N'' in bit/pulse to be the base-2-[[logarithm]] of the number of distinct messages ''M'' that could be sent, [[Ralph Hartley|Hartley]]<ref>{{cite book | title = Information Theory and its Engineering Applications | author = D. A. Bell | edition = 3rd | year = 1962 | publisher = Pitman | location = New York |oclc=1626214}}</ref> constructed a measure of the [[gross bitrate]] ''R'' as\n\n:<math>  R  =   f_\\text{s} N\\quad  </math>  where <math>\\quad N = \\log_2(M).</math>\n\nIn that case {{math|1=''M'' = 2<sup>''N''</sup>}}, different symbols are used. In a modem, these may be time-limited sinewave tones with unique combinations of amplitude, phase and/or frequency. For example, in a [[64QAM]] modem, {{math|1=''M'' = 64}}, and so the bit rate is {{math|1=''N'' = log<sub>2</sub>(64) = 6}} times the baud rate. In a line code, these may be ''M'' different voltage levels.\n\nThe ratio is not necessarily even an integer; in [[4B3T]] coding, the bit rate is {{sfrac|4|3}} of the baud rate.  (A typical [[basic rate interface]] with a 160&nbsp;kbit/s raw data rate operates at 120&nbsp;kBd.) \n\nCodes with many symbols, and thus a bit rate higher than the symbol rate, are most useful on channels such as telephone lines with a limited bandwidth but a high [[signal-to-noise ratio]] within that bandwidth.  In other applications, the bit rate is less than the symbol rate.    [[Eight-to-fourteen modulation]] as used on audio CDs has bit rate {{sfrac|8|14}} of the baud rate.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bandwidth (computing)|Bandwidth]]\n* [[Baudot code]]\n* [[Bitrate]]\n* [[Constellation diagram]], which shows (on a graph or 2D oscilloscope image) how a given signal state (a symbol) can represent three or more bits at once\n* [[Glossary of industrial scales and weighing]]\n* [[List of device bandwidths]]\n* [[Modem]]\n* [[Modulation]]\n* [[Nyquist rate]]\n* [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]]\n* [[Symbol rate]]\n* [[8-N-1]]\n* [[Serial_port#Settings|Commonly used baud rates]], like 9,600 and 115,200\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite journal\n| title=On the origins of serial communications and data encoding\n| url=http://www.dbase.com/Knowledgebase/dbulletin/bu07sh.htm\n| first=Nicolas | last=Martin\n| journal=dBulletin, the dBASE Developers Bulletin |issue=7 |date=January 2000\n| accessdate=January 4, 2007\n}}\n* {{cite journal |title=What\u2019s The Difference Between Bit Rate And baud?\n| first=Lou | last=Frenzel\n| journal=Electronic Design Magazine |date=April 27, 2012\n| url=http://electronicdesign.com/communications/what-s-difference-between-bit-rate-and-baud-rate\n}}\n[[Category:Data transmission]]\n[[Category:Units of frequency]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n\nIn [[telecommunication]] and [[electronics]], '''baud''' ({{IPAc-en|b|\u0254\u02d0|d}}; symbol: '''Bd''') is a common measure of [[symbol rate]], which is one of the components that determine the speed of communication over a data channel.\n\nIt is the unit for [[symbol rate]] or modulation rate in ''symbols per second'' or ''pulses per second''.

By contrast, non-digital (or [[Analog signal|analog]]) systems use a continuous range of values to represent information and in these systems the exact informational size of 1&nbsp;Bd varies.\n\nThe baud is scaled using standard [[metric prefix]]es, so that for example\n*1 kBd (kilobaud) = 1000 Bd\n*1 MBd (megabaud) = 1000 kBd\n*1 GBd (gigabaud) = 1000 MBd.\n\n==Relationship to gross bit rate==\nThe symbol rate is related to [[gross bit rate]] expressed in bit/s.\nThe term baud has sometimes incorrectly been used to mean bit rate,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.textfiles.com/apple/bitsbaud.txt |title=BITS, BAUD RATE, AND BPS Taking the Mystery Out of Modem Speeds |last1=Banks |first1=Michael A. |date=1990 |publisher=Brady Books/Simon & Schuster |accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref> since these rates are the same in old [[modem]]s as well as in the simplest digital communication links using only one bit per symbol, such that binary digit \"0\" is represented by one symbol, and binary digit \"1\" by another symbol. In more advanced modems and data transmission techniques, a symbol may have more than two states, so it may represent more than one [[bit]]. A bit (binary digit) always represents one of two states.\n\nIf ''N'' bits are conveyed per symbol, and the gross bit rate is ''R'', inclusive of channel coding overhead, the symbol rate ''f''<sub>s</sub> can be calculated as\n\n:<math>  f_\\text{s}  =   {R \\over N}. </math>\n\nBy taking information per pulse ''N'' in bit/pulse to be the base-2-[[logarithm]] of the number of distinct messages ''M'' that could be sent, [[Ralph Hartley|Hartley]]<ref>{{cite book | title = Information Theory and its Engineering Applications | author = D.

In a modem, these may be time-limited sinewave tones with unique combinations of amplitude, phase and/or frequency. For example, in a [[64QAM]] modem, {{math|1=''M'' = 64}}, and so the bit rate is {{math|1=''N'' = log<sub>2</sub>(64) = 6}} times the baud rate. In a line code, these may be ''M'' different voltage levels.\n\nThe ratio is not necessarily even an integer; in [[4B3T]] coding, the bit rate is {{sfrac|4|3}} of the baud rate.  (A typical [[basic rate interface]] with a 160&nbsp;kbit/s raw data rate operates at 120&nbsp;kBd.) \n\nCodes with many symbols, and thus a bit rate higher than the symbol rate, are most useful on channels such as telephone lines with a limited bandwidth but a high [[signal-to-noise ratio]] within that bandwidth.  In other applications, the bit rate is less than the symbol rate.

Which aqueous minerals are present on Mars therefore provides important clues to understanding past environments.

The second, rich in several different kinds of phyllosilicates, instead occurs rocks of [[Noachian]] age (older than about 3.7 billion years). The different ages and mineral chemistries suggest an early water-rich environment in which phyllosilicates formed, followed by a dryer, more saline and acidic environment in which sulfates formed. The [[Opportunity (rover)|MER Opportunity]] rover spent years exploring sedimentary rocks formed in the latter environment, full of sulfates, salts, and oxidized iron minerals.\n\nSoil forms from parent rocks through physical disintegration of rocks and by chemical alteration of the rock fragments. The types of soil minerals can reveal if the environment was cool or warm, wet or dry, or whether the water was fresh or salty.

Delta.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The delta in Eberswalde crater, as imaged by MOC]]\n\nLake and marine environments on Earth are favorable for fossil preservation, especially where the sediments they left behind are rich in carbonates or clays. Hundreds of highland craters on Mars have horizontally layered, sedimentary rocks that may have formed in lakes. CRISM has taken many targeted observations of these rocks to measure their mineralogy and how the minerals vary between layers. Variation between layers helps us to understand the sequence of events that formed the sedimentary rocks. The [[Mars Orbiter Camera]] found that where valley networks empty into craters, commonly the craters contain fan-shaped deposits. However it was not completely clear if the fans formed by sediment deposition on dry crater floors ([[alluvial fans]]) or in crater lakes ([[River delta|deltas]]). CRISM discovered that in the fans' lowermost layers, there are concentrated deposits of clay.<ref>Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.)  2012.  Sedimentary Geology of Mars.  SEPM</ref><ref>Milliken, R. and T. Bish.  2010.  Sources and sinks of clay minerals on Mars.  [[Philosophical Magazine]]: 90. 2293-2308</ref> More clay occurs beyond the end of the fans on the crater floors, and in some cases there is also opal. On Earth, the lowermost layers of deltas are called bottom set beds, and they are made of clays that settled out of inflowing river water in quiet, deep parts of the lakes. This discovery supports the idea that many fans formed in crater lakes where, potentially, evidence for habitable environments could be preserved.\n\nNot all ancient Martian lakes were fed by inflowing valley networks. CRISM discovered several craters on the western slope of Tharsis that contain \"bathtub rings\" of sulfate minerals and a kind of phyllosilicate called kaolinite. Both minerals can form together by precipitating out of acidic, saline water. These craters lack inflowing valley networks, showing that they were not fed by rivers - instead, they must have been fed by inflowing groundwater.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035986 | doi=10.1029/2010JE003694| title=Columbus crater and other possible groundwater-fed paleolakes of Terra Sirenum, Mars| journal=Journal of Geophysical Research| volume=116| year=2011| last1=Wray| first1=J.

Elsewhere, in the westernmost parts of Valles Marineris, near the core of the Tharsis volcanic province, there are sulfate and clay deposits suggestive of \"warm\" springs.

Carbon dioxide ice in today's polar caps is too limited in volume to hold that ancient atmosphere. If a thick atmosphere ever existed, it was either blown into space by solar wind or impacts, or reacted with silicate rocks to become trapped as carbonates in Mars' crust. One of the goals that drove CRISM's design was to find carbonates, to try to solve this question about what happened to Mars' atmosphere. And one of CRISM's most important discoveries was the identification of carbonate bedrock in [[Nili Fossae]] in 2008.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |year=2008\n |title=Orbital identification of carbonate-bearing rocks on Mars\n |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]\n |volume=322 |pages=1828\u20131832\n |doi=10.1126/science.1164759\n |pmid=19095939\n |last2=Mustard\n |first2=JF\n |last3=Murchie\n |first3=SL\n |last4=Poulet\n |first4=F\n |last5=Bishop\n |first5=JL\n |last6=Brown\n |first6=AJ\n |last7=Calvin\n |first7=WM\n |last8=Clark\n |first8=RN\n |last9=Marais\n |first9=DJ\n |last10=Milliken\n |first10=R.

Remote and landed measurements prior to CRISM, and analysis of Martian meteorites, all suggest that the Martian crust is made mostly of basaltic igneous rock composed mostly of [[feldspar]] and [[pyroxene]]. Images from the [[Mars Orbiter Camera]] on MGS showed that in some places the upper few kilometers of the crust is composed of hundreds of thin volcanic lava flows. TES and THEMIS both found mostly basaltic igneous rock, with scattered olivine-rich and even some quartz-rich rocks.\n\nThe first recognition of widespread sedimentary rock on Mars came from the Mars Orbiter Camera which found that several areas of the planet - including Valles Marineris and Terra Arabia - have horizontally layered, light-toned rocks. Follow-up observations of those rocks' mineralogy by OMEGA found that some are rich in sulfate minerals, and that other layered rocks around Mawrth Vallis are rich in phyllosilicates.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bibring | first1 = JP | last2 = Langevin | first2 = Y | last3 = Mustard | first3 = JF | last4 = Poulet | first4 = F | last5 = Arvidson | first5 = R | last6 = Gendrin | first6 = A | last7 = Gondet | first7 = B | last8 = Mangold | first8 = N | last9 = Pinet | first9 = P | last10 = Forget | first10 = F | year = 2006 | title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars express data | url = | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5772| pages = 400\u2013404 | doi = 10.1126/science.1122659 | pmid = 16627738 | bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}</ref> Both class of minerals are signatures of sedimentary rocks. CRISM has used its improved spatial resolution to look for other deposits of sedimentary rock on Mars' surface, and for layers of sedimentary rock buried between layers of volcanic rock in Mars' crust.\n\n===Modern climates===\nTo understand Mars' ancient climate, and whether it might have created environments habitable for life, first we need to understand Mars' climate today. Each mission to Mars has made new advances in understanding its climate. Mars has seasonal variations in the abundances of water vapor, water ice clouds and hazes, and atmospheric dust. During southern summer, when Mars is closest to the Sun (at perihelion), solar heating can raise massive dust storms. Regional dust storms - ones having a 1000-kilometer scale - show surprising repeatability Mars-year to Mars-year. Once every decade or so, they grow into global-scale events. In contrast, during northern summer when Mars is furthest from the Sun (at aphelion), there is an equatorial water-ice cloud belt and very little dust in the atmosphere. Atmospheric water vapor varies in abundance seasonally, with the greatest abundances in each hemisphere's summer after the seasonal polar caps have sublimated into the atmosphere. During winter, both water and carbon dioxide frost and ices form on Mars' surface. These ices form the seasonal and residual polar caps. The seasonal caps - which form each autumn and sublimate each spring - are dominated by carbon dioxide ice. The residual caps - which persist year after year - consist mostly of water ice at the north pole and water ice with a thin veneer (a few 10's of meters thick) of carbon dioxide ice at the south pole.\n\nMars' atmosphere is so thin and wispy that solar heating of dust and ice in the atmosphere - not heating of the atmospheric gases - is more important in driving weather. Small, suspended particles of dust and water ice - aerosols - intercept 20\u201330% of incoming sunlight, even under relatively clear conditions. So variations in the amounts of these aerosols have a huge influence on climate. CRISM has taken three major kinds of measurements of dust and ice in the atmosphere: targeted observations whose repeated views of the surface provide a sensitive estimate of aerosol abundance; special global grids of targeted observations every couple of months designed especially to track spatial and seasonal variations; and scans across the planet's limb to show how dust and ice vary with height above the surface.\n\nThe south polar seasonal cap has a bizarre variety of bright and dark streaks and spots that appear during spring, as carbon dioxide ice sublimates. Prior to MRO there were various ideas for processes that could form these strange features, a leading model being [[Geyser (Mars)|carbon dioxide geysers]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Piqueux | first1 = Sylvain | last2 = Byrne | first2 = Shane | last3 = Richardson | first3 = Mark I. | year = 2003 | title = Sublimation of Mars's southern seasonal CO2 ice cap formation of spiders | url = | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 180 | issue = | page = 5084 | doi = 10.1029/2002JE002007 | bibcode = 2003JGRE..108.5084P}}</ref><ref>Manrubia, S.

In the untargeted mode, CRISM reconnoiters Mars, recording approximately 50 of its 544 measurable wavelengths at a resolution of 100 to 200 meters per pixel.  In this mode CRISM will map half of Mars within a few months after aerobraking and most of the planet after one year.<ref name=science>{{cite web|url=http://crism.jhuapl.edu/science.html |title=Disappearing with a Trace |website=APL CRISM website |accessdate=2006-06-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430200256/http://crism.jhuapl.edu/science.html |archivedate=2006-04-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  The objective of this mode is to identify new scientifically interesting locations that could be further investigated.<ref name=science/> In targeted mode, the spectrometer measures energy in all 544 wavelengths.

The second, rich in several different kinds of phyllosilicates, instead occurs rocks of [[Noachian]] age (older than about 3.7 billion years). The different ages and mineral chemistries suggest an early water-rich environment in which phyllosilicates formed, followed by a dryer, more saline and acidic environment in which sulfates formed. The [[Opportunity (rover)|MER Opportunity]] rover spent years exploring sedimentary rocks formed in the latter environment, full of sulfates, salts, and oxidized iron minerals.\n\nSoil forms from parent rocks through physical disintegration of rocks and by chemical alteration of the rock fragments. The types of soil minerals can reveal if the environment was cool or warm, wet or dry, or whether the water was fresh or salty. Because CRISM is able to detect many minerals in the soil or regolith, the instrument is being used to help decipher ancient Martian environments.

The global distribution of layered clays suggests a global process. Layered clays are late Noachian in age, dating from the same time as water-carved valley networks. The layered clay composition is similar to what is expected for [[Pedogenesis|soil formation]] on Earth - a weathered upper layer leached of soluble iron and magnesium, leaving an insoluble aluminum-rich residue, with a lower layer that still retains its iron and magnesium. Some researchers have suggested that the Martian clay \"layer cake\" was created by soil-forming processes, including rainfall, at the time that valley networks formed.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Noe Dobrea | first1 = E.

Delta.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The delta in Eberswalde crater, as imaged by MOC]]\n\nLake and marine environments on Earth are favorable for fossil preservation, especially where the sediments they left behind are rich in carbonates or clays. Hundreds of highland craters on Mars have horizontally layered, sedimentary rocks that may have formed in lakes. CRISM has taken many targeted observations of these rocks to measure their mineralogy and how the minerals vary between layers. Variation between layers helps us to understand the sequence of events that formed the sedimentary rocks. The [[Mars Orbiter Camera]] found that where valley networks empty into craters, commonly the craters contain fan-shaped deposits. However it was not completely clear if the fans formed by sediment deposition on dry crater floors ([[alluvial fans]]) or in crater lakes ([[River delta|deltas]]). CRISM discovered that in the fans' lowermost layers, there are concentrated deposits of clay.<ref>Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.)  2012.  Sedimentary Geology of Mars.  SEPM</ref><ref>Milliken, R. and T. Bish.  2010.  Sources and sinks of clay minerals on Mars.  [[Philosophical Magazine]]: 90. 2293-2308</ref> More clay occurs beyond the end of the fans on the crater floors, and in some cases there is also opal. On Earth, the lowermost layers of deltas are called bottom set beds, and they are made of clays that settled out of inflowing river water in quiet, deep parts of the lakes. This discovery supports the idea that many fans formed in crater lakes where, potentially, evidence for habitable environments could be preserved.\n\nNot all ancient Martian lakes were fed by inflowing valley networks. CRISM discovered several craters on the western slope of Tharsis that contain \"bathtub rings\" of sulfate minerals and a kind of phyllosilicate called kaolinite. Both minerals can form together by precipitating out of acidic, saline water. These craters lack inflowing valley networks, showing that they were not fed by rivers - instead, they must have been fed by inflowing groundwater.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035986 | doi=10.1029/2010JE003694| title=Columbus crater and other possible groundwater-fed paleolakes of Terra Sirenum, Mars| journal=Journal of Geophysical Research| volume=116| year=2011| last1=Wray| first1=J.

One of the signatures of hot springs on Earth is deposits of silica. The [[Spirit (rover)|MER Spirit]] rover explored a silica-rich deposit called \"Home Plate\" that is thought to have formed in a hot spring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070521.html|title=Mars Rover Spirit Unearths Surprise Evidence of Wetter Past|accessdate=May 30, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Science|volume=320|pages=1063\u20131067|author=Squyres|display-authors=8|title=Detection of Silica-Rich Deposits on Mars|doi=10.1126/science.1155429|date=2008|pmid=18497295|issue=5879|last2=Arvidson|first2=RE|last3=Ruff|first3=S|last4=Gellert|first4=R|last5=Morris|first5=RV|last6=Ming|first6=DW|last7=Crumpler|first7=L|last8=Farmer|first8=JD|last9=Marais|first9=DJ|last10=Yen|first10=A.|last11=McLennan|first11=S.

Some are associated with central peaks of impact craters, which are sites of heating driven by meteor impact. Silica has also been identified on the flanks of volcanic inside the caldera of the [[Syrtis Major Planum|Syrtis Major]] shield volcano, forming light-colored mounds that look like scaled-up versions of [[Home Plate (Mars)|Home Plate]]. Elsewhere, in the westernmost parts of Valles Marineris, near the core of the Tharsis volcanic province, there are sulfate and clay deposits suggestive of \"warm\" springs. Hot spring deposits are one of the most promising areas on Mars to search for evidence for past life.[[Image:PIA19817-Mars-NiliFossae-CarbonateRichDeposit-20150902.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Nili Fossae on Mars - largest known carbonate deposit.]]\n\nOne of the leading hypotheses for why ancient Mars was wetter than today is that a thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere created a global greenhouse, that warmed the surface enough for liquid water to occur in large amounts. Carbon dioxide ice in today's polar caps is too limited in volume to hold that ancient atmosphere. If a thick atmosphere ever existed, it was either blown into space by solar wind or impacts, or reacted with silicate rocks to become trapped as carbonates in Mars' crust. One of the goals that drove CRISM's design was to find carbonates, to try to solve this question about what happened to Mars' atmosphere. And one of CRISM's most important discoveries was the identification of carbonate bedrock in [[Nili Fossae]] in 2008.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |year=2008\n |title=Orbital identification of carbonate-bearing rocks on Mars\n |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]\n |volume=322 |pages=1828\u20131832\n |doi=10.1126/science.1164759\n |pmid=19095939\n |last2=Mustard\n |first2=JF\n |last3=Murchie\n |first3=SL\n |last4=Poulet\n |first4=F\n |last5=Bishop\n |first5=JL\n |last6=Brown\n |first6=AJ\n |last7=Calvin\n |first7=WM\n |last8=Clark\n |first8=RN\n |last9=Marais\n |first9=DJ\n |last10=Milliken\n |first10=R.

Remote and landed measurements prior to CRISM, and analysis of Martian meteorites, all suggest that the Martian crust is made mostly of basaltic igneous rock composed mostly of [[feldspar]] and [[pyroxene]]. Images from the [[Mars Orbiter Camera]] on MGS showed that in some places the upper few kilometers of the crust is composed of hundreds of thin volcanic lava flows. TES and THEMIS both found mostly basaltic igneous rock, with scattered olivine-rich and even some quartz-rich rocks.\n\nThe first recognition of widespread sedimentary rock on Mars came from the Mars Orbiter Camera which found that several areas of the planet - including Valles Marineris and Terra Arabia - have horizontally layered, light-toned rocks. Follow-up observations of those rocks' mineralogy by OMEGA found that some are rich in sulfate minerals, and that other layered rocks around Mawrth Vallis are rich in phyllosilicates.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bibring | first1 = JP | last2 = Langevin | first2 = Y | last3 = Mustard | first3 = JF | last4 = Poulet | first4 = F | last5 = Arvidson | first5 = R | last6 = Gendrin | first6 = A | last7 = Gondet | first7 = B | last8 = Mangold | first8 = N | last9 = Pinet | first9 = P | last10 = Forget | first10 = F | year = 2006 | title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars express data | url = | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5772| pages = 400\u2013404 | doi = 10.1126/science.1122659 | pmid = 16627738 | bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}</ref> Both class of minerals are signatures of sedimentary rocks. CRISM has used its improved spatial resolution to look for other deposits of sedimentary rock on Mars' surface, and for layers of sedimentary rock buried between layers of volcanic rock in Mars' crust.\n\n===Modern climates===\nTo understand Mars' ancient climate, and whether it might have created environments habitable for life, first we need to understand Mars' climate today. Each mission to Mars has made new advances in understanding its climate. Mars has seasonal variations in the abundances of water vapor, water ice clouds and hazes, and atmospheric dust. During southern summer, when Mars is closest to the Sun (at perihelion), solar heating can raise massive dust storms. Regional dust storms - ones having a 1000-kilometer scale - show surprising repeatability Mars-year to Mars-year. Once every decade or so, they grow into global-scale events. In contrast, during northern summer when Mars is furthest from the Sun (at aphelion), there is an equatorial water-ice cloud belt and very little dust in the atmosphere. Atmospheric water vapor varies in abundance seasonally, with the greatest abundances in each hemisphere's summer after the seasonal polar caps have sublimated into the atmosphere. During winter, both water and carbon dioxide frost and ices form on Mars' surface. These ices form the seasonal and residual polar caps. The seasonal caps - which form each autumn and sublimate each spring - are dominated by carbon dioxide ice. The residual caps - which persist year after year - consist mostly of water ice at the north pole and water ice with a thin veneer (a few 10's of meters thick) of carbon dioxide ice at the south pole.\n\nMars' atmosphere is so thin and wispy that solar heating of dust and ice in the atmosphere - not heating of the atmospheric gases - is more important in driving weather. Small, suspended particles of dust and water ice - aerosols - intercept 20\u201330% of incoming sunlight, even under relatively clear conditions. So variations in the amounts of these aerosols have a huge influence on climate. CRISM has taken three major kinds of measurements of dust and ice in the atmosphere: targeted observations whose repeated views of the surface provide a sensitive estimate of aerosol abundance; special global grids of targeted observations every couple of months designed especially to track spatial and seasonal variations; and scans across the planet's limb to show how dust and ice vary with height above the surface.\n\nThe south polar seasonal cap has a bizarre variety of bright and dark streaks and spots that appear during spring, as carbon dioxide ice sublimates. Prior to MRO there were various ideas for processes that could form these strange features, a leading model being [[Geyser (Mars)|carbon dioxide geysers]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Piqueux | first1 = Sylvain | last2 = Byrne | first2 = Shane | last3 = Richardson | first3 = Mark I. | year = 2003 | title = Sublimation of Mars's southern seasonal CO2 ice cap formation of spiders | url = | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 180 | issue = | page = 5084 | doi = 10.1029/2002JE002007 | bibcode = 2003JGRE..108.5084P}}</ref><ref>Manrubia, S.

In Russia, the Evenks are recognised as one of the [[indigenous peoples of the Russian North]], with a population of  38,396 ([[Russian Census (2010)|2010 census]]). In China, the Evenki form one of the [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognised by the [[People's Republic of China]], with a population of 30,875 ([[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2010 census]]).<ref name=\"auto\"/> There are 537 Evenks in Mongolia (2015 census) called ''Khamnigan'' in [[Mongolian language]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Evenks or Ewenki are sometimes conjectured to be connected to the [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]] people who inhabited the [[Greater Khingan]] Range in the 5th to 9th centuries, although the native land of the majority of Evenki people is in the vast regions of [[Siberia]] between [[Lake Baikal]] and the [[Amur River]]. The Ewenki language forms the northern branch of the Manchu-Tungusic language group and is closely related to [[Even language|Even]] and [[Negidal language|Negidal]] in [[Siberia]]. By 1600 the Evenks or Ewenki of the Lena and Yenisey river valleys were successful reindeer herders. By contrast the [[Solon people|Solons]] (ancestors of the Evenkis in China) and the Khamnigans (Ewenkis of [[Transbaikalia]]) had picked up horse breeding and the Mongolian [[Deel (clothing)|deel]] from the [[Mongols]]. The Solons nomadized along the [[Amur River]]. They were closely related to the [[Daur people]]. To the west the Khamnigan were another group of horse-breeding Evenks in the Transbaikalia area. Also in the Amur valley a body of Siberian Evenki-speaking people were called [[Oroqen people|Orochen]] by the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s.\n\n=== Historical distribution ===\nThe ancestors of the south-eastern Evenks have most likely been in the Baikal region of Southern Siberia (near the modern-day Mongolian border) since the [[Neolithic]] era. \n\nConsidering the north-western Evenks Vasilevich claims: \"The origin of the Evenks is the result of complex processes, different in time, involving the mixing of different ancient aboriginal tribes from the north of Siberia with tribes related in language to the Turks and Mongols. The language of these tribes took precedence over the languages of the aboriginal population\". Elements of more modern Evenk culture, including conical tent dwellings, bone fish-lures, and birch-bark boats, were all present in sites that are believed to be Neolithic. From Lake Baikal, \u201cthey spread to the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Sea of Okhotsk|Okhotsk Sea]]\u2026the [[Lena River#Basin|Lena Basin]]\u2026and the [[Yenisei river|Yenisey]] Basin\u201d.<ref>Vasilevich (623)</ref>\n\n=== Contact with Russians ===\nIn the 17th century, the [[Russian empire]] made contact with the Evenks. [[Cossacks]], who served as a kind of \u201cborder-guard\u201d for the tsarist government, imposed a fur tax on the Siberian tribes. The Cossacks exploited the Evenk clan hierarchy and took hostages from the highest members in order to ensure payment of the tax. Although there was some rebellion against local officials, the Evenks generally recognized the need for peaceful cultural relations with the Russians (Vasilevich, 624).  Contact with the Russians and constant demand for fur taxes pushed the Evenks east all the way to [[Sakhalin]] island, where some still live today (Cassells). In the 19th century some groups migrated south and east into Mongolia and Manchuria (Vasilevich, 625). Today there are still Evenk populations in Sakhalin, Mongolia, and Manchuria (Ethnologue), and to a lesser extent, their traditional Baikal region (Janhunen). \nRussian invasion of the Evenks (and other indigenous peoples) resulted in language erosion, traditional decline, identity loss, among others, of thereof. This was especially the case during the Soviet regime. Soviet policies of collectivization, forced sedentarization (or sometimes refer to as [[Sedentism]]), \"unpromising villages\", and [[Russification]] of the education system compromised social, cultural, and mental well-being of the Evenks.<ref>Klokov, K.B., Khrushchev, S.A. (2010). Demographic dynamics of the indigenous small-numbered peoples of the Russian North, 1897-2002. Sibirica, 9, 41-65</ref><ref>Vakhtin, N. (1992). Native peoples of the Russian Far North. London</ref> Today, few people can speak the [[Evenki language]], reindeer herding is in significant decline, the suicide rate is extremely high, and alcoholism is a serious issue.\n\n== Traditional life ==\n[[File:Orochen postcard.jpg|thumb|Evenks in 1912]]\nTraditionally they were a mixture of pastoralists and hunter-gatherers\u2014they relied on their domesticated reindeer for milk and transport and hunted other large game for meat (Vasilevich, 620-1). Today \u201c[t]he Evenks are divided into two large groups\u2026engaging in different types of economy. These are the hunting and reindeer-breeding Evenks\u2026and the horse and cattle pastoral Evenks as well as some farming Evenks\u201d (620).\nThe Evenks lived mostly in areas of what is called a taiga, or boreal forest. They lived in conical tents made from birch bark or reindeer skin tied to birch poles. When they moved camp, the Evenks would leave these frameworks and carry only the more portable coverings. During winter, the hunting season, most camps consisted of one or two tents while the spring encampments had up to 10 households (Vasilevich, 637).\n\nTheir skill of riding the domesticated reindeer allowed the Evenks to \u201ccolonize vast areas of the eastern [[taiga]] which had previously been impenetrable\u201d (Vitebsky, 31). The Evenks used a saddle unique to their culture which is placed on the shoulders of the reindeer so as to lessen the strain on the animal, and used not stirrups but a stick to balance (31-32). Evenks did not develop reindeer sledges until comparatively recent times (32). They instead used their reindeer as pack animals and often traversed great distances on foot, using snowshoes or skis (Vasilevich, 627). The Evenki people did not eat their domesticated reindeer (although they did hunt and eat wild reindeer) but kept them for milk. (Forsyth, 49-50).\n\n[[File:Evenks1862.jpg|thumb|180px|Evenks in 1862]]\nLarge herds of reindeer were very uncommon. Most Evenks had around 25 head of reindeer because they were generally bred for transportation. Unlike in several other neighboring tribes Evenk reindeer-breeding did not include \u201cherding of reindeer by dogs nor any other specific features\u201d (Vasilevich, 629). Very early in the spring season, the winter camps broke up and moved to places suitable for calving. Several households pastured their animals together throughout the summer, being careful to keep \u201c[s]pecial areas\u2026fenced off\u2026to guard the newborn calves against being trampled on in a large herd\u201d (629).\n\n=== Clothing ===\nThe Evenks wore a characteristic garb \u201cadapted to the cold but rather dry climate of Central Siberia and to a life of mobility\u2026they wore brief garments of soft reindeer or elk skin around their hips, along with leggings and moccasins, or else long supple boots reaching to the thigh\u201d (49). They also wore a deerskin coat that did not close in front but was instead covered with an apron-like cloth. Some Evenkis decorated their clothing with fringes or embroidery (50).  The Evenki traditional costume always consisted of these elements: the loincloth made of animal hide, leggings, and boots of varying lengths (Vasilevich, 641). Facial tattooing was also very common.\n\n=== Hunting ===\nThe traditional Evenk economy was a mix of pastoralism (of horses or reindeer), fishing, and hunting. The Evenk who lived near the Okhotsk Sea hunted seal, but for most of the taiga-dwellers, elk, wild reindeer, and fowl were the most important game animals. Other animals included \u201croe deer, bear, wolverine, lynx, wolf, Siberian marmot, fox, and sable\u201d (Vasilevich, 626). Trapping did not become important until the imposition of the fur tax by the tsarist government. Before acquiring guns in the 18th century, Evenks used steel bows and arrows. Along with their main hunting implements, hunters always carried a \u201cpike\u201d\u2014\u201cwhich was a large knife on a long handle used instead of an axe when passing through the thick taiga or as a spear when hunting bear\u201d (626). The Evenks have deep respect for animals and all elements of nature: \"It is forbidden to torment an animal, bird, or insect, and a wounded animal must be finished off immediately. It is forbidden to spill the blood of a killed animal or defile it. It is forbidden to kill animals or birds that were saved from pursuit by predators or came to a person for help in a natural disaster.\" (Sirina, 24).\n\n==Evenks of Russia==\n[[Image:Evenkshome.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Evenks domicile''', [[Chum (tent)|chum]]&nbsp;\u2013 Evenks' home in ethnographic museum in [[Ulan Ude]], Russia]]\nThe Evenks were formerly known as ''tungus''. This designation was spread by the [[Russians]], who acquired it from the [[Yakuts]] and the [[Siberian Tatars]] (in the Yakut language ''tongus'') in the 17th century. The Evenks have several self-designations, of which the best known is ''evenk''. This became the official designation for the people in 1931.  Some groups call themselves ''orochen'' ('an inhabitant of the River Oro'), ''orochon'' ('a rearer of [[reindeer]]'), ''ile'' ('a human being'), etc. At one time or another tribal designations and place names have also been used as self-designations, for instance ''manjagir'', ''birachen'', ''solon'', etc. Several of these have even been taken for separate ethnic entities.\n\nThere is also a similarly named Siberian group called the [[Evens]] (formerly known as ''Lamuts''). Although related to the Evenks, the Evens are now considered to be a separate ethnic group.\n\n[[File:Discussion Media vs Natives 06.JPG|thumb|250px|Evenks in Sakha Republic]]\nThe Evenks are spread over a huge territory of the [[Siberia]]n [[taiga]] from the [[Ob River|River Ob]] in the west to the [[Okhotsk Sea]] in the east, and from the [[Arctic Ocean]] in the north to [[Manchuria]] and [[Sakhalin]] in the south. The total area of their habitat is about 2,500,000&nbsp;km\u00b2. In all of [[Russia]] only the Russians inhabit a larger territory. According to the administrative structure, the Evenks live, from west to east, in [[Tyumen Oblast|Tyumen]] and [[Tomsk Oblast]]s, [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]] with [[Evenk Autonomous Okrug]], [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]], [[Chita Oblast|Chita]], and [[Amur Oblast]]s, the [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryat]] and the [[Sakha Republic]]s, [[Khabarovsk Krai]], and [[Sakhalin Oblast]]. However, the territory where they are a [[titular nation]] is confined solely to Evenk Autonomous Okrug, where 3,802 of the 35,527 Evenks live (according to the 2002 Census). More than 18,200 Evenks live in the [[Sakha Republic]].\n\n[[Evenki language|Evenki]] is the largest of the northern group of the [[Manchu-Tungus languages]], a group which also includes Even and [[Negidal]].\n\nMany Evenks in Russia still engage in a traditional lifestyle of raising reindeer, fishing, and hunting.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Human: The Definitive Visual Guide|last=|first=|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2004|isbn=0-7566-0520-2|editor-last=Winston|editor-first=Robert|location=New York|pages=428}}</ref>\n\n=== Russian Federation ===\nAccording to the 2002 census 35,527 Evenki lived in Russia.\n[[File:\u0420\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432 2010.png|right|thumb|400px|Evenk settlement in Russia by municipal areas and urban districts in percents of the total number of this nation in the Russian Federation.

The [[Evenk Autonomous Banner]] is also located near Hulunbuir. There are also around 3,000 Evenks in neighbouring [[Heilongjiang]] Province.\n\nThe Manchu Emperor [[Hong Taiji]] conquered the Evenks in 1640, and executed their leader [[Bombogor (Evenk chief)|Bombogor]]. After the Manchu conquest, the Evenks were incorporated into the [[Eight Banners]].\n\nIn 1763, the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government moved 500 Solon Evenk and 500 [[Daur people|Daur]] families to the [[Tacheng]] and [[Ghulja]] areas of [[Xinjiang]], in order to strengthen the empire's western border. 1020 [[Xibe people|Xibe]] families (some 4000 persons) followed the next year.

The majority (35) stated that their native language was [[Russian language|Russian]]; four indicated [[Evenki language|Evenk]] as their native language, and three that it was [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].<ref>[http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/results/nationality_population/nationality_popul1/select_5/?botton=cens_db&box=5.1W&k_t=00&p=25&rz=1_1&rz_b=2_1%20&n_page=2 State statistics committee of Ukraine - National composition of population, 2001 census] (Ukrainian)</ref>\n\n==Religion==\nPrior to contact with the Russians, the belief system of the Evenks was [[animistic]]. Many have adopted [[Tibetan Buddhism]].<ref name=\"solon\" /><ref name=\"tonggusi\" /><ref name=\"zabaykal\" />\n\nThe Evenki, like most nomadic, pastoral, and subsistence agrarian peoples, spend most of their lives in very close contact with nature. Because of this, they develop what A.&nbsp;A. Sirina calls an \"ecological ethic\". By this she means \"a system of responsibility of people to nature and her spirit masters, and of nature to people\"(9). Sirina interviewed many Evenks who until very recently spent much of their time as reindeer herders in the taiga, just like their ancestors. The Evenki people also spoke along the same lines: their respect for nature and their belief that nature is a living being.\n\nThis idea, \"[t]he embodiment, animation, and personification of nature\u2014what is still called the animistic worldview\u2014is the key component of the traditional worldview of hunter-gatherers\" (Sirina, 13). Although most of the Evenkis have been \"sedentarized\"\u2014that is, made to live in settled communities instead of following their traditional nomadic way of life (Fondahl, 5)\u2014\"[m]any scholars think that the worldview characteristic of hunter-gatherer societies is preserved, even if they make the transition to new economic models (Sirina, 30, quoting Barnard 1998, Lee 1999, Peterson 1999).\n\nAlthough nominally Christianized in the 18th century, the Evenki people maintain many of their historical beliefs\u2014especially shamanism (Vasilevich, 624). The Christian traditions were \"confined to the formal performance of Orthodox rites which were usually timed for the arrival of the priest in the taiga\" (647).\n\nThe religious beliefs and practices of the Evenks are of great historical interest since these retain some archaic forms of belief. Among the most ancient ideas are spiritualization and personification of all natural phenomena, belief in an upper, middle, and lower world, belief in the soul (''omi'') and certain totemistic concepts. There were also various magical rituals associated with hunting and guarding herds. Later on, these rituals were conducted by shamans. Shamanism brought about the development of the views of spirit-masters (Vasilevich 647).\n\nThere are few sources on the shamanism of the Evenki peoples below the Amur/Helongkiang river in Northern China. There is a brief report of fieldwork conducted by [[Richard Noll]] and Kun Shi in 1994 of the life of the shamaness Dula'r (Evenki name), also known as Ao Yun Hua (her Han Chinese name).<ref>Richard Noll and Kun Shi, A Solon Evenki shaman and her Abgaldi Shaman mask. ''Shaman,'' 2007, 15 (1-2):167-174</ref> She was born in 1920 and was living in the village of Yiming Gatsa in the Evenki Banner (county) of the Hulunbuir Prefecture, in the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. While not a particularly good informant, she described her initiatory illness, her multiyear apprenticeship with a Mongol shaman before being allowed to heal at the age of 25 or 26, and the torments she experienced during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s when most of her shamanic paraphernalia was destroyed. Mongol and Buddhist Lamaist influences on her indigenous practice of shamansim were evident. She hid her prize possession\u2014an Abagaldi (bear spirit) shaman mask, which has also been documented among the Mongols and Dauer peoples in the region. The field report and color photographs of this shaman are available online.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/6422575/_A_Solon_Ewenki_shaman_and_her_Abagaldai_mask_Shaman_2007_15_1-2_|title=&quot;A Solon Ewenki shaman and her Abagaldai mask,&quot; Shaman (2007), 15 (1-2)|first=Richard |last=Noll|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Olga Kudrina]] (c. 1890\u20131944) was a shaman among the Reindeer Evenki of northern [[Inner Mongolia]] along the [[Amur River]]'s Great Bend (today under the jurisdiction of [[Genhe]], [[Hulunbuir]]).<ref>{{citation|first=F.

In Russia, the Evenks are recognised as one of the [[indigenous peoples of the Russian North]], with a population of  38,396 ([[Russian Census (2010)|2010 census]]). In China, the Evenki form one of the [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognised by the [[People's Republic of China]], with a population of 30,875 ([[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|2010 census]]).<ref name=\"auto\"/> There are 537 Evenks in Mongolia (2015 census) called ''Khamnigan'' in [[Mongolian language]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Evenks or Ewenki are sometimes conjectured to be connected to the [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]] people who inhabited the [[Greater Khingan]] Range in the 5th to 9th centuries, although the native land of the majority of Evenki people is in the vast regions of [[Siberia]] between [[Lake Baikal]] and the [[Amur River]]. The Ewenki language forms the northern branch of the Manchu-Tungusic language group and is closely related to [[Even language|Even]] and [[Negidal language|Negidal]] in [[Siberia]]. By 1600 the Evenks or Ewenki of the Lena and Yenisey river valleys were successful reindeer herders. By contrast the [[Solon people|Solons]] (ancestors of the Evenkis in China) and the Khamnigans (Ewenkis of [[Transbaikalia]]) had picked up horse breeding and the Mongolian [[Deel (clothing)|deel]] from the [[Mongols]]. The Solons nomadized along the [[Amur River]]. They were closely related to the [[Daur people]]. To the west the Khamnigan were another group of horse-breeding Evenks in the Transbaikalia area. Also in the Amur valley a body of Siberian Evenki-speaking people were called [[Oroqen people|Orochen]] by the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]s.\n\n=== Historical distribution ===\nThe ancestors of the south-eastern Evenks have most likely been in the Baikal region of Southern Siberia (near the modern-day Mongolian border) since the [[Neolithic]] era. \n\nConsidering the north-western Evenks Vasilevich claims: \"The origin of the Evenks is the result of complex processes, different in time, involving the mixing of different ancient aboriginal tribes from the north of Siberia with tribes related in language to the Turks and Mongols. The language of these tribes took precedence over the languages of the aboriginal population\". Elements of more modern Evenk culture, including conical tent dwellings, bone fish-lures, and birch-bark boats, were all present in sites that are believed to be Neolithic. From Lake Baikal, \u201cthey spread to the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Sea of Okhotsk|Okhotsk Sea]]\u2026the [[Lena River#Basin|Lena Basin]]\u2026and the [[Yenisei river|Yenisey]] Basin\u201d.<ref>Vasilevich (623)</ref>\n\n=== Contact with Russians ===\nIn the 17th century, the [[Russian empire]] made contact with the Evenks. [[Cossacks]], who served as a kind of \u201cborder-guard\u201d for the tsarist government, imposed a fur tax on the Siberian tribes. The Cossacks exploited the Evenk clan hierarchy and took hostages from the highest members in order to ensure payment of the tax. Although there was some rebellion against local officials, the Evenks generally recognized the need for peaceful cultural relations with the Russians (Vasilevich, 624).  Contact with the Russians and constant demand for fur taxes pushed the Evenks east all the way to [[Sakhalin]] island, where some still live today (Cassells). In the 19th century some groups migrated south and east into Mongolia and Manchuria (Vasilevich, 625). Today there are still Evenk populations in Sakhalin, Mongolia, and Manchuria (Ethnologue), and to a lesser extent, their traditional Baikal region (Janhunen). \nRussian invasion of the Evenks (and other indigenous peoples) resulted in language erosion, traditional decline, identity loss, among others, of thereof. This was especially the case during the Soviet regime. Soviet policies of collectivization, forced sedentarization (or sometimes refer to as [[Sedentism]]), \"unpromising villages\", and [[Russification]] of the education system compromised social, cultural, and mental well-being of the Evenks.<ref>Klokov, K.B., Khrushchev, S.A. (2010). Demographic dynamics of the indigenous small-numbered peoples of the Russian North, 1897-2002. Sibirica, 9, 41-65</ref><ref>Vakhtin, N. (1992). Native peoples of the Russian Far North. London</ref> Today, few people can speak the [[Evenki language]], reindeer herding is in significant decline, the suicide rate is extremely high, and alcoholism is a serious issue.\n\n== Traditional life ==\n[[File:Orochen postcard.jpg|thumb|Evenks in 1912]]\nTraditionally they were a mixture of pastoralists and hunter-gatherers\u2014they relied on their domesticated reindeer for milk and transport and hunted other large game for meat (Vasilevich, 620-1). Today \u201c[t]he Evenks are divided into two large groups\u2026engaging in different types of economy. These are the hunting and reindeer-breeding Evenks\u2026and the horse and cattle pastoral Evenks as well as some farming Evenks\u201d (620).\nThe Evenks lived mostly in areas of what is called a taiga, or boreal forest. They lived in conical tents made from birch bark or reindeer skin tied to birch poles. When they moved camp, the Evenks would leave these frameworks and carry only the more portable coverings. During winter, the hunting season, most camps consisted of one or two tents while the spring encampments had up to 10 households (Vasilevich, 637).\n\nTheir skill of riding the domesticated reindeer allowed the Evenks to \u201ccolonize vast areas of the eastern [[taiga]] which had previously been impenetrable\u201d (Vitebsky, 31). The Evenks used a saddle unique to their culture which is placed on the shoulders of the reindeer so as to lessen the strain on the animal, and used not stirrups but a stick to balance (31-32). Evenks did not develop reindeer sledges until comparatively recent times (32). They instead used their reindeer as pack animals and often traversed great distances on foot, using snowshoes or skis (Vasilevich, 627). The Evenki people did not eat their domesticated reindeer (although they did hunt and eat wild reindeer) but kept them for milk. (Forsyth, 49-50).\n\n[[File:Evenks1862.jpg|thumb|180px|Evenks in 1862]]\nLarge herds of reindeer were very uncommon. Most Evenks had around 25 head of reindeer because they were generally bred for transportation. Unlike in several other neighboring tribes Evenk reindeer-breeding did not include \u201cherding of reindeer by dogs nor any other specific features\u201d (Vasilevich, 629). Very early in the spring season, the winter camps broke up and moved to places suitable for calving. Several households pastured their animals together throughout the summer, being careful to keep \u201c[s]pecial areas\u2026fenced off\u2026to guard the newborn calves against being trampled on in a large herd\u201d (629).\n\n=== Clothing ===\nThe Evenks wore a characteristic garb \u201cadapted to the cold but rather dry climate of Central Siberia and to a life of mobility\u2026they wore brief garments of soft reindeer or elk skin around their hips, along with leggings and moccasins, or else long supple boots reaching to the thigh\u201d (49). They also wore a deerskin coat that did not close in front but was instead covered with an apron-like cloth. Some Evenkis decorated their clothing with fringes or embroidery (50).  The Evenki traditional costume always consisted of these elements: the loincloth made of animal hide, leggings, and boots of varying lengths (Vasilevich, 641). Facial tattooing was also very common.\n\n=== Hunting ===\nThe traditional Evenk economy was a mix of pastoralism (of horses or reindeer), fishing, and hunting. The Evenk who lived near the Okhotsk Sea hunted seal, but for most of the taiga-dwellers, elk, wild reindeer, and fowl were the most important game animals. Other animals included \u201croe deer, bear, wolverine, lynx, wolf, Siberian marmot, fox, and sable\u201d (Vasilevich, 626). Trapping did not become important until the imposition of the fur tax by the tsarist government. Before acquiring guns in the 18th century, Evenks used steel bows and arrows. Along with their main hunting implements, hunters always carried a \u201cpike\u201d\u2014\u201cwhich was a large knife on a long handle used instead of an axe when passing through the thick taiga or as a spear when hunting bear\u201d (626). The Evenks have deep respect for animals and all elements of nature: \"It is forbidden to torment an animal, bird, or insect, and a wounded animal must be finished off immediately. It is forbidden to spill the blood of a killed animal or defile it. It is forbidden to kill animals or birds that were saved from pursuit by predators or came to a person for help in a natural disaster.\" (Sirina, 24).\n\n==Evenks of Russia==\n[[Image:Evenkshome.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Evenks domicile''', [[Chum (tent)|chum]]&nbsp;\u2013 Evenks' home in ethnographic museum in [[Ulan Ude]], Russia]]\nThe Evenks were formerly known as ''tungus''. This designation was spread by the [[Russians]], who acquired it from the [[Yakuts]] and the [[Siberian Tatars]] (in the Yakut language ''tongus'') in the 17th century. The Evenks have several self-designations, of which the best known is ''evenk''. This became the official designation for the people in 1931.  Some groups call themselves ''orochen'' ('an inhabitant of the River Oro'), ''orochon'' ('a rearer of [[reindeer]]'), ''ile'' ('a human being'), etc. At one time or another tribal designations and place names have also been used as self-designations, for instance ''manjagir'', ''birachen'', ''solon'', etc. Several of these have even been taken for separate ethnic entities.\n\nThere is also a similarly named Siberian group called the [[Evens]] (formerly known as ''Lamuts''). Although related to the Evenks, the Evens are now considered to be a separate ethnic group.\n\n[[File:Discussion Media vs Natives 06.JPG|thumb|250px|Evenks in Sakha Republic]]\nThe Evenks are spread over a huge territory of the [[Siberia]]n [[taiga]] from the [[Ob River|River Ob]] in the west to the [[Okhotsk Sea]] in the east, and from the [[Arctic Ocean]] in the north to [[Manchuria]] and [[Sakhalin]] in the south. The total area of their habitat is about 2,500,000&nbsp;km\u00b2. In all of [[Russia]] only the Russians inhabit a larger territory. According to the administrative structure, the Evenks live, from west to east, in [[Tyumen Oblast|Tyumen]] and [[Tomsk Oblast]]s, [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]] with [[Evenk Autonomous Okrug]], [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]], [[Chita Oblast|Chita]], and [[Amur Oblast]]s, the [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryat]] and the [[Sakha Republic]]s, [[Khabarovsk Krai]], and [[Sakhalin Oblast]]. However, the territory where they are a [[titular nation]] is confined solely to Evenk Autonomous Okrug, where 3,802 of the 35,527 Evenks live (according to the 2002 Census). More than 18,200 Evenks live in the [[Sakha Republic]].\n\n[[Evenki language|Evenki]] is the largest of the northern group of the [[Manchu-Tungus languages]], a group which also includes Even and [[Negidal]].\n\nMany Evenks in Russia still engage in a traditional lifestyle of raising reindeer, fishing, and hunting.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Human: The Definitive Visual Guide|last=|first=|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2004|isbn=0-7566-0520-2|editor-last=Winston|editor-first=Robert|location=New York|pages=428}}</ref>\n\n=== Russian Federation ===\nAccording to the 2002 census 35,527 Evenki lived in Russia.\n[[File:\u0420\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u044d\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432 2010.png|right|thumb|400px|Evenk settlement in Russia by municipal areas and urban districts in percents of the total number of this nation in the Russian Federation.

The [[Evenk Autonomous Banner]] is also located near Hulunbuir. There are also around 3,000 Evenks in neighbouring [[Heilongjiang]] Province.\n\nThe Manchu Emperor [[Hong Taiji]] conquered the Evenks in 1640, and executed their leader [[Bombogor (Evenk chief)|Bombogor]]. After the Manchu conquest, the Evenks were incorporated into the [[Eight Banners]].\n\nIn 1763, the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government moved 500 Solon Evenk and 500 [[Daur people|Daur]] families to the [[Tacheng]] and [[Ghulja]] areas of [[Xinjiang]], in order to strengthen the empire's western border. 1020 [[Xibe people|Xibe]] families (some 4000 persons) followed the next year.

The majority (35) stated that their native language was [[Russian language|Russian]]; four indicated [[Evenki language|Evenk]] as their native language, and three that it was [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].<ref>[http://2001.ukrcensus.gov.ua/results/nationality_population/nationality_popul1/select_5/?botton=cens_db&box=5.1W&k_t=00&p=25&rz=1_1&rz_b=2_1%20&n_page=2 State statistics committee of Ukraine - National composition of population, 2001 census] (Ukrainian)</ref>\n\n==Religion==\nPrior to contact with the Russians, the belief system of the Evenks was [[animistic]]. Many have adopted [[Tibetan Buddhism]].<ref name=\"solon\" /><ref name=\"tonggusi\" /><ref name=\"zabaykal\" />\n\nThe Evenki, like most nomadic, pastoral, and subsistence agrarian peoples, spend most of their lives in very close contact with nature. Because of this, they develop what A.&nbsp;A. Sirina calls an \"ecological ethic\". By this she means \"a system of responsibility of people to nature and her spirit masters, and of nature to people\"(9). Sirina interviewed many Evenks who until very recently spent much of their time as reindeer herders in the taiga, just like their ancestors. The Evenki people also spoke along the same lines: their respect for nature and their belief that nature is a living being.\n\nThis idea, \"[t]he embodiment, animation, and personification of nature\u2014what is still called the animistic worldview\u2014is the key component of the traditional worldview of hunter-gatherers\" (Sirina, 13). Although most of the Evenkis have been \"sedentarized\"\u2014that is, made to live in settled communities instead of following their traditional nomadic way of life (Fondahl, 5)\u2014\"[m]any scholars think that the worldview characteristic of hunter-gatherer societies is preserved, even if they make the transition to new economic models (Sirina, 30, quoting Barnard 1998, Lee 1999, Peterson 1999).\n\nAlthough nominally Christianized in the 18th century, the Evenki people maintain many of their historical beliefs\u2014especially shamanism (Vasilevich, 624). The Christian traditions were \"confined to the formal performance of Orthodox rites which were usually timed for the arrival of the priest in the taiga\" (647).\n\nThe religious beliefs and practices of the Evenks are of great historical interest since these retain some archaic forms of belief. Among the most ancient ideas are spiritualization and personification of all natural phenomena, belief in an upper, middle, and lower world, belief in the soul (''omi'') and certain totemistic concepts. There were also various magical rituals associated with hunting and guarding herds. Later on, these rituals were conducted by shamans. Shamanism brought about the development of the views of spirit-masters (Vasilevich 647).\n\nThere are few sources on the shamanism of the Evenki peoples below the Amur/Helongkiang river in Northern China. There is a brief report of fieldwork conducted by [[Richard Noll]] and Kun Shi in 1994 of the life of the shamaness Dula'r (Evenki name), also known as Ao Yun Hua (her Han Chinese name).<ref>Richard Noll and Kun Shi, A Solon Evenki shaman and her Abgaldi Shaman mask. ''Shaman,'' 2007, 15 (1-2):167-174</ref> She was born in 1920 and was living in the village of Yiming Gatsa in the Evenki Banner (county) of the Hulunbuir Prefecture, in the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. While not a particularly good informant, she described her initiatory illness, her multiyear apprenticeship with a Mongol shaman before being allowed to heal at the age of 25 or 26, and the torments she experienced during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s when most of her shamanic paraphernalia was destroyed. Mongol and Buddhist Lamaist influences on her indigenous practice of shamansim were evident. She hid her prize possession\u2014an Abagaldi (bear spirit) shaman mask, which has also been documented among the Mongols and Dauer peoples in the region. The field report and color photographs of this shaman are available online.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/6422575/_A_Solon_Ewenki_shaman_and_her_Abagaldai_mask_Shaman_2007_15_1-2_|title=&quot;A Solon Ewenki shaman and her Abagaldai mask,&quot; Shaman (2007), 15 (1-2)|first=Richard |last=Noll|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Olga Kudrina]] (c. 1890\u20131944) was a shaman among the Reindeer Evenki of northern [[Inner Mongolia]] along the [[Amur River]]'s Great Bend (today under the jurisdiction of [[Genhe]], [[Hulunbuir]]).<ref>{{citation|first=F.

This functions as an on/off switch for many cellular processes, including metabolism, transcription, cell cycle progression, cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell movement, apoptosis, and differentiation. They also function in embryonic development, physiological responses, and in the nervous and immune system. Abnormal phosphorylation causes many human diseases, including cancer, and drugs that affect phosphorylation can treat those diseases.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;298/5600/1912 G.

Thus, ions cycle around the inner electrode on elliptical trajectories. In addition, the ions also move back and forth along the axis of the central electrode so that their trajectories in space resemble helices. Due to the properties of the quadro-logarithmic potential,<ref name=\"Mak1\" /> their axial motion is [[harmonic]], i.e. it is completely independent not only of motion around the inner electrode but also of all initial parameters of the ions except their [[mass-to-charge ratios]] m/z.

As ion packets are injected tangentially into the field, the electric field is increased by ramping the voltage on the inner electrode. Ions get squeezed towards the inner electrode until they reach the desired orbit inside the trap. At that moment ramping is stopped, the field becomes static, and detection can start. \nEach packet contains a multitude of ions of different velocities spread over a certain volume.

By rapidly ramping down trapping RF voltages and applying DC gradients across the C-trap, ions can be bunched into short packets similar to those from the laser ion source. The C-trap is tightly integrated with the analyzer, injection optics and differential pumping.\n\n=== Excitation ===\nIn principle, coherent axial oscillations of ion rings could be excited by applying RF waveforms to the outer electrode as demonstrated in<ref name=\"Perry\">{{cite journal | last1 = Perry | first1 = R. | last2 = Cooks | first2 = G. | last3 = Noll | first3 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Orbitrap mass spectrometry: Instrumentation, ion motion and applications | url = | journal = Mass Spectrometry Reviews | volume = 27 | issue = 6| pages = 661\u2013699 | doi = 10.1002/mas.20186 | pmid = 18683895 | bibcode = 2008MSRv...27..661P }}</ref> and references therein. \nHowever, if ion packets are injected away from the minimum of the axial potential (which corresponds to the thickest part of either electrode), this automatically initiates their axial oscillations, eliminating the need for any additional excitation.
