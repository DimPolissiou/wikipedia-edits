Both stations are operated by [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]]. Canterbury West station, on the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] from [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford]], was opened on 6 February 1846, and on 13 April the line to [[Ramsgate railway station|Ramsgate]] was completed.

Canterbury East, the more central of the two stations, was opened by the [[London, Chatham & Dover Railway]] on 9 July 1860. Services from [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]] stop at Canterbury East and continue to [[Dover Priory railway station|Dover]].\n\nCanterbury used to be served by two other stations. [[Canterbury North Lane railway station|North Lane station]] was the southern terminus of the Canterbury & Whitstable Railway between 1830 and 1846.

The City Council has invested heavily in [[Canterbury Park and Ride|Park and Ride]] systems around the City's outskirts and there are three sites: at Wincheap, New Dover Road and Sturry Road. There are plans to build direct access sliproads to and from the London directions of the A2 where it meets the congested Wincheap (at present there are only slips from the A28 to and from the direction of Dover) to allow more direct access to Canterbury from the A2, but these are currently subject to local discussion. In 2011 a third junction was constructed, linking the A28 to the northbound A2; this leaves just the A2 southbound exit missing, but since this would cut across the Park & Ride car park and meet the A28 at an already complicated junction, it is not expected to be added in the near term.<ref name=\"canterburybyroad\">[http://www.canterbury.co.uk/thedms.asp?dms=11&catid=68&easi=true&msg=Browsing$$Travel$Travel$$%20in%20Canterbury How to Get Here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816013413/http://www.canterbury.co.uk/thedms.asp?dms=11&catid=68&easi=true&msg=Browsing$$Travel$Travel$$%20in%20Canterbury |date=16 August 2008 }}. www.canterbury.co.uk.

The river divides south east of the city, one branch flowing through the city, the other around the position of the former walls. The two branches rejoin or are linked several times, but finally recombine around the town of [[Fordwich]], on the edge of the marshland north east of the city. The Stour is navigable on the tidal section to Fordwich, although above this point canoes and other small craft can be used.

Neville introduced instrumentalists into the cathedral's music who played [[cornett]] and [[sackbut]], probably members of the city's band of waits.

There are records of payments to the Waits starting from 1402, though they probably existed earlier than this. The Waits were disbanded by the city authorities in 1641 for 'misdemeanors' but were reinstated in 1660 when they played for the visit of King Charles II on his return from exile.<ref>James M.

Also Kokak Naga and Akyaung Ari Naga are included tribally within Tangkhul Naga tribe but their language are quite distinct. The Tangkhul (Somra/Hogo) language in Myanmar is very different from Tangkhul (Ukhrul) spoken in India. The villages in the north like Jessami, Soraphung and Chingjaroi (Swimai) have quite a different culture than the main Tangkhul group but have more cultural ties with that of the [[Chakhesang Naga|Chakhesang]] (Jessami and Soraphung)  and [[Poumai Naga|Poumai]] (Chingjaroi) tribes.\n\n==History==\nThe Tangkhuls, as with other tribes on the hills, came to [[Manipur]], [[Nagaland]], [[Assam]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] from [[Myanmar]] entering their present habitats in successive waves of immigration. The Tangkhuls came together with the [[Angami Naga|Angamis]], [[Chakhesang Naga|Chakhesangs]], [[Zeliangrong|Zeliangrongs]], [[Mao Naga|Maos]], [[Poumai Naga|Poumais]], [[Maram Naga|Marams]] and [[Thangal Naga |Thangals]] because all of them have references to their dispersal from Makhel, a Mao village in [[Senapati district]]. They had also erected megaliths at Makhel in memory of their having dispersed from there to various directions. \n\nThe Tangkhuls point to the association of their forefathers with the seashore. Most of the ornaments of the Tangkhuls such as kongsang, huishon, etc. were made of sea shells, cowrie and conch shells a prominent feature of the people who live on the shore.\n\nThe Tangkhuls as also other tribes who travelled from [[Myanmar]] and from there finally they came into their present land traversing through innumerable snow-covered landscapes, mountains and wild forests confronting wild beasts and wild tribes may be grouped collectively as Naga on the basis of ethnicity. The exodus of the Tangkhuls from [[China]] to [[Myanmar]] and finally to [[India]] is indeed a story of heroism of human courage and endurance in the face of great famine in China during those days.\n\nIn course of time every Tangkhul village became a small republic like the [[Greek city states]]. Every village had an unwritten constitution made up of age-old conventions and traditions. The Tangkhul villages were self-sufficient except for salt, and self-governing units ruled by hereditary or elected chief assisted by a Council of Elders. The chief was a judge, administrator and commander rolled into one.\n\nHunphun was the headquarters of the Tangkhul Long (Tangkhul Assembly). The Tangkhul annual fair locally known as \"Leih Khangapha\" used to be held at Somsai in Ukhrul.\n\nThe boundary of [[Manipur]] and [[Burma (Myanmar)]]<nowiki/>was laid down by an agreement signed between the British authorities ([[East India Company]]) and Burma on 9 January 1834 on the river bank of Nighthee ([[Chindwin River|Chindwin]]). The Article No.4 (iii) of this agreement relates to the Tangkhul country. \"Fourth (iii) - On the north, the line of boundary will begin at the foot of the same hills at the northern extremity of the [[Kabaw Valley]] and pass due north up to the first range of hills, east of that upon which stand the villages of Chortor (Choithar), Noongbee (Nungbi), Nonghar (Lunghar), of the tribe called by the Munepooriis (Manipuris) Loohooppa (Tangkhul), and by the Burmahs Lagwensoung, now tributary of Manipoor.\" As a result of this boundary demarcation without the knowledge let alone consent of the Tangkhuls, many Tangkhul villages situated in the Somrah hills, [[Lay Shi Township|Layshi township,]] [[Tamu Township|Tamu township]] and [[Homalin Township|Homalin township]] are included under [[Burma]]. Later, when India and Burma attained national independence, the Tangkhuls found themselves belonging to two different countries.\n\n[[File:Partial View of North-Eastern Ukhrul Town 01.JPG|thumbnail|Ukhrul Town|466x466px]]\n\n==Language==\n{{main|Tangkhul language}}\nThe Tangkhul tribe has hundreds of regional dialects. Each village has its own dialect including Khangoi, Khunggoi, Kupome, Phadang, Roudei and Ukhrul. Tangkhul is the principal dialect. Although the Tangkhul Naga tribe speaks more than a hundred dialects, the lingua franca is the Hunphun dialect. Also Hogo Naga or Eastern Tangkhul or Somra Tangkhul in Burma speak the [[Somra language|Somra dialect]].\n\nA slightly modified [[English alphabet]] is used. Tangkhul Language is included in the [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] syllabus and is the first Tribal language from [[North East India]] to be included in the [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] syllabus.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n===Literacy rate in first language===\nBecause of the diversity in dialects and lack of a [[standardized language]], it is difficult to gauge the literacy level. However, if the knowledge of Tangkhul is taken as an indicator, most young Tangkhuls are losing their grasp of the language, often preferring to use the [[English language]] to describe more complex ideas. There are some important factors that contribute to the standardization of [[English language]] as the primary medium of learning and communication. Firstly, there are various concrete and abstracts objects and ideas which cannot be termed in Tangkhul language, simply because unlike the English language it does not have a rich vocabulary. Secondly, the emergence of western education, which rapidly change and uplift the live and standard of Tangkhuls led the people to neglect learning the language and hence became a secondary subject. Thirdly, the idea of globalization captures the attention of the people to neglect their own language and culture.\n\n===Literacy rate in other languages===\n[[English language|English]] is taught in primary schools, and the number of people able to read the [[Roman Script|Roman script]] is high. Almost all young people can read and write the Roman script; older people are less proficient.  The literacy rate is 79%.<ref>2001 census in {{cite web|title=Naga, Tangkhul|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/nmf|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref> There are English and bi-lingual publications, such as the magazine ''The Legacy'' and the English newspaper ''The Aja Daily''. Aja is edited by Mrs Valley Rose Hungyo, the only lady editor of the state. A new bi-lingual daily newspaper ''The Shirui Lily Times'' was started in [[Ukhrul district]] headquarters from 16 August 2010. Owned and published by Shimreingam A.Shatsang, ''The Shirui Lily Times'' is jointly edited by the publisher himself and another dynamic editor Ngakuini A Shatsang. With this new edition-Ukhrul now has two local dailies published in Tangkhul.<ref>'New daily launched in Ukhrul', ''Hueiyen Lanpao'', 2 September 2010.</ref>\n\n===Tangkhul Villages===\n\nAccording to the latest research there are approximately 380 Tangkhul villages in [[India]] and [[Tangkhul Naga (Myanmar)|50 Tangkhul villages in Myanmar]]. \nThe villages in the west include Hongman, Aheng, Champhung, Changta, Hoome, Kachai, Lamlang, Leisan, Maichon, Ngainga, Phalee, Ringui, Roudei (TM Kasom), Seikhor, Shokvao, Sinakeithei, Sirarakhong, Somdal, Taloi, Tanrui, Teinem, Theiva, Tora, Zingshong etc. And villages in the north include Pui, Halang, Chingai, Chingjaroi, Kalhang, Khamasom, Kharasom, Kuirei, Longpi, Lunghar, Ngahui, Marem, Phungcham, Paorei, Peh, Sihai, New Tusom, Varangai, Razai, etc. And villages in the middle frontier are Choithar (Ruithar), Hatha, Hungpung, Hunphun, Khangkhui, Langdang, Lungshang,  Nungshong, Pharung, Phungcham, Ramva, Shangshak, Shangzing, Shirui, Tashar. Villages in the east includes  Alang, Apong, Bungpa, Chahong, Chamu, Chatric, Chungka, Grihang, Godah, Hangao, Kachouphung, Kanpat, Kalhang, Kuirei, Khambi, Khayang, Khamasom, Khunthak, Koso, Kumram, Langkhe, Langli, Leishi, Longpi, Loushing,  Maileng, Maku, Mapum, Ningchao, Ningthi, Nongman, Khonglo, Nungou, Patbung, Pheishat, Phungtha, Phange, Pushing, Ramphoi, Ramsophung, Roni, Ronshak, Sampui,Sehai, Shakok, Shingcha, Siyang, Skipe, Sorathen, Sorde, Sorpung, Yedah, Zingsui, Hangou Kaphung (H.kaphung)  etc. Villages in the south include Bohoram, Chadong, Island, Irong Kongleiram, Joyland (Muirei), Kankoi, Keihao, Kaprang, Kashung, Kasom, Laikoiching( Bongso), Lairam, Lamlai, Leingaching, Leiyaram, Lishamlok, Lambakhul, Litan, Lungpha, Lungtoram, Manthouram, Mapao, Maryland, Mawai, [[Nambashi]], New Canaan, Ngarumphung, Nongdam, Nungthar, Poirou, Riha, Saman, Sailent, Sharkaphung, Marou, Shingta, Shingkap, Tamaram, Tangkhul Hungdung, Itham, Thoyee, Wunghon, Zingshao,Yeasom, Irong, etc.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe culture of Tangkhul revolves around traditional beliefs and custom exercises being passed down, and ancient tools and materials, like spears, swords, shields, bows, axes and spades. Culturally, the Tangkhuls share close affinities with the [[Meitei people|Meiteis]] of the Imphal Valley. \n\nThe Tangkhuls are fond of singing, dancing and festivities. For every season, there is a festival that lasts almost a week. Luira phanit, the seed sowing festival is the major festival.The Tangkhuls are an egalitarian society. There is no caste or classes in the society. Every person is equal in the society and the society follows patriarchal system.\n\nThe life and art of the Tangkhul are attractive and captivating. Their different clothing, utensils, architecture, monumental erections and memorial set-ups depict their dexterity in art, which also speak of their sense of beauty and fitnesse. Though there are common articles of unisex clothing, there are also some articles of clothing exclusively meant for men or women.\nSome of the traditional clothing Clothes/Shawls \tMan's \tWomen's\n1.

One of the unique feature that beautify the dress of Tangkhul man is \"Mayong Pasi\".It is a headband/headgear worn by Tangkhul men during important festivals/events of Tangkhul Naga tribe. The indigenous headband is  originated from Mapum Village in the eastern part of [[Ukhrul district|Ukhrul District]] and has now spread across all the Tangkhul villages.\n\n==Music and dance==\nTangkhuls are music lovers and their songs are soft and melodious. Apart from encoding into the music the varied seasonal and cultural ideas and philosophies, music is a medium wherein historical events are also related in the lyrics. In as much as religious fervor is incorporated and composed in the songs, the romantic nature of the people also finds its expressions in the music. There are various varieties of songs, some are mood special, some are festival/seasonal specials. These folk songs and folklores can be taught and sung by anybody, anytime, but there are also some specific musical expressive melodies of every region or area. People are restricted from singing certain songs outside of particular seasons or occasions{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Some festivals have ceased since the introduction of [[Christianity]] to the region.\n \nThese folk songs and folklores can be played or accompanied by musical instruments. Some of the musical instruments are tingteila ([[violin]]), tala ([[trumpet]]), pung ([[drum]]), mazo (woman's mouth-piece), sipa ([[flute]]), and kaha ngashingkhon (bamboo [[Pipe organ|pipe]]).\n\nCorresponding to the rhythmic composition of the songs, the dances of the Tangkhuls are also rhythmic and these are eventful and vigorous. There are also some special occasional dances, like the Kathi Mahon, a dance for the dead; Laa Khanganui, a virgin dance during Luira Festival; and Rai Pheichak, a war dance. [[Rewben Mashangva]], a member of the Tangkhul community, is instrumental in popularising the music of the community to the world. The majority of the youth know how to play the guitar and other musical instruments. However, Western culture has been blamed for the declining popularity of some ancestral songs.\n\n==History of Christianity among Tangkhuls==\n[[Christianity]] is the major religion of the Tangkhul Nagas. Tangkhuls were the first community in [[Manipur]] to become [[Christians]]. Christianity was first brought to the Tangkhul people by Rev. [[William Pettigrew (missionary)|William Pettigrew]] in 1896. The first christian church of Manipur, [[Phungyo Baptist Church]] was set up among the Tangkhuls in [[Ukhrul]]. The story goes that the chief of Hunphun, Raihao, had stories about his great grandfather dreaming that a white missionary would come to Ukhrul. Because of this, when Rev. Pettigrew showed up, Raihao allowed him to live among them and work as a missionary. When the chief was converted, the whole villagers converted as well, and Christianity has remained a prominent religion among Tangkhul Nagas to this day. Also Tangkhuls (Hogo/[[Somra language|Somra]]) in [[Burma]] follow the religion of [[Animism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of Northeast India]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Akhui, Z.

One of the unique feature that beautify the dress of Tangkhul man is \"Mayong Pasi\".It is a headband/headgear worn by Tangkhul men during important festivals/events of Tangkhul Naga tribe. The indigenous headband is  originated from Mapum Village in the eastern part of [[Ukhrul district|Ukhrul District]] and has now spread across all the Tangkhul villages.\n\n==Music and dance==\nTangkhuls are music lovers and their songs are soft and melodious. Apart from encoding into the music the varied seasonal and cultural ideas and philosophies, music is a medium wherein historical events are also related in the lyrics. In as much as religious fervor is incorporated and composed in the songs, the romantic nature of the people also finds its expressions in the music. There are various varieties of songs, some are mood special, some are festival/seasonal specials. These folk songs and folklores can be taught and sung by anybody, anytime, but there are also some specific musical expressive melodies of every region or area. People are restricted from singing certain songs outside of particular seasons or occasions{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Some festivals have ceased since the introduction of [[Christianity]] to the region.\n \nThese folk songs and folklores can be played or accompanied by musical instruments. Some of the musical instruments are tingteila ([[violin]]), tala ([[trumpet]]), pung ([[drum]]), mazo (woman's mouth-piece), sipa ([[flute]]), and kaha ngashingkhon (bamboo [[Pipe organ|pipe]]).\n\nCorresponding to the rhythmic composition of the songs, the dances of the Tangkhuls are also rhythmic and these are eventful and vigorous. There are also some special occasional dances, like the Kathi Mahon, a dance for the dead; Laa Khanganui, a virgin dance during Luira Festival; and Rai Pheichak, a war dance. [[Rewben Mashangva]], a member of the Tangkhul community, is instrumental in popularising the music of the community to the world. The majority of the youth know how to play the guitar and other musical instruments. However, Western culture has been blamed for the declining popularity of some ancestral songs.\n\n==History of Christianity among Tangkhuls==\n[[Christianity]] is the major religion of the Tangkhul Nagas. Tangkhuls were the first community in [[Manipur]] to become [[Christians]]. Christianity was first brought to the Tangkhul people by Rev. [[William Pettigrew (missionary)|William Pettigrew]] in 1896. The first christian church of Manipur, [[Phungyo Baptist Church]] was set up among the Tangkhuls in [[Ukhrul]]. The story goes that the chief of Hunphun, Raihao, had stories about his great grandfather dreaming that a white missionary would come to Ukhrul. Because of this, when Rev. Pettigrew showed up, Raihao allowed him to live among them and work as a missionary. When the chief was converted, the whole villagers converted as well, and Christianity has remained a prominent religion among Tangkhul Nagas to this day. Also Tangkhuls (Hogo/[[Somra language|Somra]]) in [[Burma]] follow the religion of [[Animism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of Northeast India]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Akhui, Z.
