The CASC was modelled directly off the British Army Service Corps to provide all transportation and supply services to the Army.  Initially, the CASC consisted of four companies to support the Active Militia units. The Corps grew quickly, doubling the number of units by 1903, and growing by another three companies by 1905. By the summer of 1914 the CASC had a strength of 3000 personnel in eighteen companies.<ref name=\"wftw\">Arnold Warren, Wait for the Waggon. The Story of the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps. McClelland and Steward Limited, 1961.</ref>\n\nDuring World War I, the CASC provided a support element for each Canadian Division, and later on, for the [[Canadian Corps]].  With the introduction of motorized vehicles, the CASC carried commodities of a greater range and of greater weights.  Motorized transportation also resulted in expanded responsibilities such as driving ambulances and engineer pontoon vehicles, carrying all natures of ammunition, and mobile repair and recovery.  In recognition of the services rendered during the [[Great War]], His Majesty [[King George V]] authorized the designator \u201cRoyal\u201d in 1919.<ref name=\"wftw\" />\n\nThe RCASC, along with the rest of the Army, underwent a rapid expansion as Canada mobilized for the [[Second World War]].  In addition to maintaining transport for the army on land, the RCASC also commanded and maintained a ship-borne freight and patrol company, the [[Pacific Command Water Transport Company, R.C.A.S.C.|Pacific Command Water Transport Company]], during [[World War II]]. The RCASC provided support to Canadian Soldiers wherever they went; training in Canada and Great Britain, the campaign in north-west Europe[[British logistics in the Normandy Campaign]], and in the campaign in Italy.  The RCASC moved supplies from the rear areas to the front-lines.  They delivered all rations, ammunition, petroleum products, and all other essentials.  They did so with a variety of vehicles ranging from three to ten ton trucks, and forty ton tank transporters.<ref name=\"wftw\" />\n\nDuring the 1950s, the RCASC committed No. 1 and No. 2 Movement Control Groups, 54 Canadian Transport Company, 28 Motorized Ambulance Company, and 58 General Transport Company to the [[Korean War]].  In 1952, 23 Transport Company relieved 54 Transport Company, which was in-turn relieved by 56 Transport Company.  3 Transport Company was the last to serve in Korea in 1954.  4 Transport Company (previously known as 56 Transport Company and then 5 Transport Company) moved from Winnipeg to Calgary in August 1967.  In June 1968, 4 Transport Company combined with elements of the static 13 Transport Company.

The CASC was modelled directly off the British Army Service Corps to provide all transportation and supply services to the Army.  Initially, the CASC consisted of four companies to support the Active Militia units. The Corps grew quickly, doubling the number of units by 1903, and growing by another three companies by 1905. By the summer of 1914 the CASC had a strength of 3000 personnel in eighteen companies.<ref name=\"wftw\">Arnold Warren, Wait for the Waggon. The Story of the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps. McClelland and Steward Limited, 1961.</ref>\n\nDuring World War I, the CASC provided a support element for each Canadian Division, and later on, for the [[Canadian Corps]].  With the introduction of motorized vehicles, the CASC carried commodities of a greater range and of greater weights.  Motorized transportation also resulted in expanded responsibilities such as driving ambulances and engineer pontoon vehicles, carrying all natures of ammunition, and mobile repair and recovery.  In recognition of the services rendered during the [[Great War]], His Majesty [[King George V]] authorized the designator \u201cRoyal\u201d in 1919.<ref name=\"wftw\" />\n\nThe RCASC, along with the rest of the Army, underwent a rapid expansion as Canada mobilized for the [[Second World War]].  In addition to maintaining transport for the army on land, the RCASC also commanded and maintained a ship-borne freight and patrol company, the [[Pacific Command Water Transport Company, R.C.A.S.C.|Pacific Command Water Transport Company]], during [[World War II]]. The RCASC provided support to Canadian Soldiers wherever they went; training in Canada and Great Britain, the campaign in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_logistics_in_the_Normandy_Campaign|north-west Europe]], and in the campaign in Italy.  The RCASC moved supplies from the rear areas to the front-lines.  They delivered all rations, ammunition, petroleum products, and all other essentials.  They did so with a variety of vehicles ranging from three to ten ton trucks, and forty ton tank transporters.<ref name=\"wftw\" />\n\nDuring the 1950s, the RCASC committed No. 1 and No. 2 Movement Control Groups, 54 Canadian Transport Company, 28 Motorized Ambulance Company, and 58 General Transport Company to the [[Korean War]].  In 1952, 23 Transport Company relieved 54 Transport Company, which was in-turn relieved by 56 Transport Company.  3 Transport Company was the last to serve in Korea in 1954.  4 Transport Company (previously known as 56 Transport Company and then 5 Transport Company) moved from Winnipeg to Calgary in August 1967.  In June 1968, 4 Transport Company combined with elements of the static 13 Transport Company.  Three months later that organization became the Transport Company of 1st Service Battalion.<ref name=\"wftw\" />\n\n==Unification==\n{{CanWars20thC}}\nWhen the Army, [[Royal Canadian Navy]], and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] were [[unification of the Canadian Forces|merged in 1968]] to form the [[Canadian Forces]], the administrative Corps of the Army were deactivated and merged with their Naval and Air Force counterparts to form the Canadian Forces' [[personnel branch]]es.<ref>http://rcasc.org/ Royal Canadian Army Service Corps</ref>\n* The RCASC's transport and supply elements were combined with the [[Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps]] to form the [[Logistics Branch (Canadian Forces)|Logistics Branch]]\n* The RCASC's clerical trades were merged with the [[Royal Canadian Army Pay Corps]] and the [[Royal Canadian Postal Corps]] to form the Administration Branch (later merged with the Logistics Branch) <ref>Sutton, Brigadier John, ed.,\" Wait For The Waggon\".

{"title_page": "Sticheron", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Sticharion}}\n{{Eastern Orthodox sidebar|expanded=worship}}\nA '''sticheron''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c7\u03b7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd}} \"set in verses\"; plural: '''stichera'''; [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c7\u03b7\u03c1\u03ac}}) is a [[hymn]] of a particular genre that has to be sung during the morning ([[Orthros]]) and evening service (Hesperinos) of the [[Orthodox Church]] and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]].\n\n''Stichera'' are usually sung in alternation with or immediately after [[psalm]] or other scriptural verses. These verses are known as ''stichoi'' (sing: ''stichos''), but ''sticheraric'' poetry usually follows the hexameter and is collected in an own book called '''sticherarion''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c7\u03b7\u03c1\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}}). A sticherarion is a book containing the stichera for the morning and evening services throughout the year, but chant compositions in the ''sticheraric melos'' can also found in other [[liturgical book]]s like the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] or the ''Anastasimatarion'', or in the Anthology for the [[Divine Liturgy]].\n\n== The sticheraric melos and the troparion ==\n\nIn the current traditions of Orthodox Chant, the ''sticherarion'' as a hymn book was also used to call a chant genre ''sticheraric melos'', which is defined by its tempo and its [[melodic formula]]s according to the eight modes of the [[Neobyzantine Octoechos#Debates about the sticheraric melos|Octoechos]]. Although the hymns of the ''sticherarion'' have to be sung in the same melos, there is no direct relation with the poetic hymn genre, because its musical definition rather follows the practice of psalmody. Today the ''sticheraric melos'' as opposed to the ''troparic melos'' are two different cycles of the Octoechos.\n\nIn the past they had been closer related by the practice of psalmody, and a [[troparion]] which is nothing else than a refrain sung with psalmody, might become a more elaborated chant from a musical point of view, so that it is sung thrice without the psalm verses, but with the [[Gloria Patri|small doxology]]. The ''troparion'' in its melodic form tends to move towards the ''sticheraric'' or even ''papadic melos'', and this way, it becomes an own chant genre by itself.<ref>Sticheraric [[troparia]] which are sung during the [[Divine Liturgy]], are for instance all genres of the [[trisagion]]. The trisagion alternates with its substitutes like the baptism hymn or the troparion for Good Friday (\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u1f78\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Also other genres like [[cherubikon]] and [[koinonikon]] were originally troparia used during psalm recitation.</ref>\n\n==The sticheron and its musical settings==\n\nChristian Troelsg\u00e5rd described the ''sticheron'' quite similar to the ''troparion'' and regarded the ''sticheron'' as a subcategory, only that a ''sticheron'' as an intercalation of psalmody, has been longer as a poem than a ''troparion'', thus it had been chanted without repetitions of its text, but in sections. There had been a lot of ''stichera'', but the book ''sticherarion'' was a rather dislocated collection of ''stichera'' from different local traditions and their singer-poets. It was obviously not used on a pulpit during celebrations, but rather an exercise book with various examples which could be studied for own compositions with similar accentuation patterns.<ref>Christian Troelsg\u00e5rd ([[#Tro01|2001]]).</ref>\n\nConcerning this paradigmatic use of notation the musical setting of a ''sticheron'', the ''sticherarion'' had been mainly a collection of ''[[Idiomelon|idiomela]]'' which had to be understood as individual compositions for a certain ''sticheron'' poem,<ref>The ''stichera prosomoia'' created over the model of an existing ''sticheron avtomelon,'' were later added to the books of the sticherarion ([[#Hus1972|Husmann 1972]]). The composition of the book Triodion by the generation of [[Theodore the Studite]] was basically a prosomoia collection, composed over the melodies of avtomela, but also of idiomela.</ref> although the melodic patterns could be rather classified according to one of the eight or ten modes  (''echos'' or ''glas'') of the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos]].<ref>Christian Troelsg\u00e5rd regarded this collection as not locally focussed, because the collections in different sticheraria have so much in common, that he identified in the footsteps of Oliver Strunk and Bjarne Schartau these ''idiomela'' with numbers of the standard abridged version ([[#Tro03|SAV]]).</ref> The reference to it is given by the modal signatures, especially the medial signatures written within notation, so the book ''sticherarion'' constituted the synthetic role of its notation (Byzantine round notation), which integrated signs taken from different chant books during the 13th century.<ref>About the modal signatures in Byzantine round notation, see Raasted ([[#Raa66|1966]]).</ref>\n\nBut there was as well the practice of using certain ''stichera'' as models (''avtomela'') to compose other poems (''prosomoia''), similar to the ''[[heirmos]]''. This classification became even more complex by the translation of the hymn books into Slavonic, which forced the ''kanonarches'', responsible for the preparation of the services, to adapt the music of a certain ''avtomelon'' to the translated ''prosomoia'' and the prosody of the Slavonic language, in certain cases the adaptation needed a musical recomposition of the prosomoion. In practice, the ''avtomela'' as well as the ''prosomeia ''are often omitted in the books of the ''sticherarion,'' they rather belonged to an oral tradition, since the ''avtomela'' were known by heart. Often the ''prosomoia'' had been written apart before the ''[[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]]'' part of Sticherarion, which was usually not organised according to the eight modes unlike the Great Oktoechos.<ref>H.J.W. Tillyard ([[Sticheron#Til1940-49|1940]], XII) argued that this custom to omit the prosomoia can be explained that they were later added to the book, since they had been created later than the rest of the hymn repertoire. On the other hand, Irina Shkolnik ([[#Shk1998|1998]]) argued that the oral tradition of prosomoia and their avtomela was closer to the local tradition of a monastery, so there was for a long period no need to write it down unlike the more complex idiomela.</ref>\n\nSince [[John Koukouzeles]] and other contemporary scribes who revised the ''sticheraria'', there was development from the traditional ''sticheron'', sung by a whole congregation or community,<ref>Nina-Maria Wanek ([[#Wan2013|2013]]) discussed in her systematic analysis of the August part of the Menaion, what was really Koukouzeles' role concerning the contemporary redaction of the sticheraria. Maria Alexandru ([[#Ale2000|2000]], [[#Ale2007|2007]]) made a comparative analysis of the musical settings of a few selected ''stichera'' as they had been created during the centuries.</ref> to a rather representative and elaborated performance by a soloist.<ref>Maria Alexandru ([[#Ale2011|2011]]).</ref> [[Manuel Chrysaphes]] regarded [[John Koukouzeles]] as the inventor of the \"embellished sticheron\" (''sticheron kalophonikon''), but he emphasized that he always followed step by step the model, as it has been written down in ''sticherarion''. Especially in the kalophonic genre, a systematic collection of compositions by Constantinopolitan maistores, made after the ''menaion'' of ''sticherarion'', could already grow, as one part of the ''sticherarion kalophonikon'' (see also [[British Library|GB-Lbl]] Ms. [[#Menaionkalophon|Add. 28821]]), to a volume about 1900 pages, an expansion in chant which could be hardly performed during celebrations of any cathedral of the Empire.<ref>For instance a ''Sticherarion kalophonikon'' or ''Menaion kalophonikon'' by Gabriel of Yenik\u00f6y (Berlin, State Library, Mus. ms. 25059). The kalophonic composition of ''sticheron'' for St. Peter \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 by Nikolaos Kampanes and [[John Koukouzeles]] has been analysed by Oliver Gerlach ([[#Ger09|2009]]).</ref>\n\n== History of the notated chant book ''Sticherarion'' ==\n\nDuring the reform of the 17th century the book ''Sticherarion'' had been replaced by the ''Doxastarion'', called after the main genre of the former book, the [[doxastikon]]: the ''sticheron'' which was introduced by both or one of the two stichoi of [[Papadic Octoechos#Models of simple psalmody|\u0394\u03cc\u03be\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u1f76]], but it followed the same compositions written down in the old Sticherarion. During the 18th century the repertoire was created which had been printed as ''Doxastarion'' since 1820. It was based on transcriptions of the hyphos, short versions created by the generation of Ioannes Trapezountios and Daniel the Protopsaltes who had recomposed the traditional melodies. The hyphos was supposed to abridge the traditional melos in the school of [[Manuel Chrysaphes]], as it had been delivered by 17th-century composers like [[Panagiotes the New Chrysaphes]] and Germanos of New Patras.<ref>Nina-Maria Wanek ([[#Wan2013|2013]]).</ref> They had grown very long, obviously under influence of the kalophonic method to do the thesis of the sticheraric melos, but also by a hybridisation of the great signs during the traditional thesis of the sticheric melos.<ref>For a catalogue which shows, how the great signs themselves added something to the stichera during the 16th century, see Flora Kritikou ([[Sticheron#Kri2013|2013]]).</ref> Between the 1820 and 1841, the abridged ''Doxastarion'' had been published in 3 versions: the \"Doxastarion syntomon\" of Petros Peloponnesios ([[#Dox1820|1820]]), the \"Doxastarion argon\" of Iakovos the Protoposaltes ([[#Iak1836|1836]]), and the \"Doxastarion argosyntomon\" of Konstantinos the Protopsaltes ([[#Kon1841|1841]]).\n\nThe medieval ''Sticherarion'' had been divided into four books, which also existed as separated books of their own: the [[Menaion]], the [[Pentekostarion]], the [[Triodion]], and the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]].<ref>The sticherarion of the Great Lavra ([[Great Lavra|GR-AOml]] Ms. [[#GR-AOmlGamma12|\u03b3 12]]) shows the oldest layer of notation (theta notation) in its second part of the mobile cycle: the pentekostarion (ff. 49v-80r), while the first part the letters \u03b8 (\u201cthema\u201c) which indicated a melisma over the marked syllable, became elaborated in the Athonite Chartres notation with the triodion (ff. 1r-49v).</ref> These books of the ''Sticherarion'' were created during the Studites reform between the 9th and the 10th centuries, its repertoire was completed until the 11th century, but until the 14th century the whole repertoire had been reduced among scribes who changed and unified the numerous redactions. The 10th-century reform already defined the gospel lectures and the doxastika connected with them.<ref>Svetlana Poliakova ([[#Pol09|2009]]).</ref> The oldest copies can be dated back to the 10th and 11th centuries, and like the ''[[Heirmologion]]'' the ''Sticherarion'' was the one of the first hymn books, which was entirely provided with musical notation ([[#Palaeobyzantine notation .2810th.E2.80.9313th century.29|Palaeo Byzantine neumes]]).<ref>Christian Troelsg\u00e5rd ([[#Tro01|2001]]).</ref> But the complete form still appeared in the time of the 14th-century reform, which had been notated in [[#Middle Byzantine notation .2813th.E2.80.9319th century.29|Middle Byzantine neumes]].<ref>The manuscript [[#NkS4960|NkS 4960]] of the Royal Library at Copenhagen as well as manuscript A139 supp. of the Ambrosian Library of Milan, written by Athanasios of Constantinople in 1341, are ''sticheraria'' according to the revision of \"[[John Koukouzeles]]\" ([[#Raa95|Raasted 1995]]) and they both contain all four books.</ref>\n\nThe genre ''sticheron'' already existed since centuries, it can be traced back to ''Tropologia'' written during the 6th century, but the repertoire as it can be reconstructed by Georgian Iadgari ''Tropologion'' seems to be different from the Byzantine redaction which was based on the Tropologion of Antioch and later expanded by the hymnographers of [[Mar Saba]] (Jerusalem).<ref>See Fr\u00f8yshov ([[#FrGe2000|2000]], [[#Fro2012|2012]]) and Nikiforova ([[Sticheron#Nik2013|2013]]).</ref> The book ''Tropologion'' was still used until the 12th century and it also contains the [[Canon (hymnography)|canons]] of the ''[[Heirmologion]]''. Originally the ''Heirmologion'' and ''Sticherarion'' were created as notated chant books during the 10th century.<ref>According to Gerda Wolfram ([[Sticheron#WolframNGr|New Grove]]) the oldest ''Sticheraria'' were notated collections of ''Idiomela ''and discovered in the library of the [[Great Lavra (Athos)|Great Lavra]] on the Mount Athos and can be dated back to the 10th (Ms. \u03b3.12, \u03b3.67 is the only with an octoechos) and 11th century (\u03b3.72, \u03b3.74). The oldest notation used was theta notation, later replaced by Chartres and Coislin notation. The oldest Slavonic ''sticherarion'' dates back to the 12th century and has adiastematic sematic notation. It was discovered in the library of the [[Hilandar]] Monastery (Ms. 307).</ref>\n\n==The parts and cycles of the book sticherarion==\nThe [[Idiomelon|stichera idiomela]] are commonly written in two [[liturgy|liturgical]] year cycles, the immobile one or sanctoral, and the mobile one between [[Great Lent]] and Pentecost. Usually this collection of idiomela consists of three books, the menaion for the immobile cycle and two books called triodion and pentecostarion for the mobile cycle:\n*[[Menaion]] (\"book of the months\") contains all hymns of the immobile monthly cycle beginning with September end ending with August. These are hymns dedicated to particular [[saint]]s commemorated according to the calendar day of the year.\n*[[Triodion]] contains hymns chanted during Great Lent, beginning with the Sunday of [[Pharisee and the Publican]] ten weeks before Easter and ending with the Holy week preceding Easter or with Palm Sunday. It has a huge collection of stichera prosomoia as well.<ref>The early Prosomoia composed by [[Theodore the Studite]]s for the evening service during Lenten period which belong to the book Triodion ([[Sticheron#Hus1972|Husmann 1972]], 216-231). These prosomoia are not composed over stichera avtomela, but over stichera ideomela, especially compositions dedicated to martyres.</ref> \n*[[Pentecostarion]] contains hymns chanted during the [[Paschal Cycle|Paschal Season]], beginning with the hesperinos of the Resurrection feast or Monday of the Holy Week until All Saints' Sunday which follows the Sunday of Pentecost.\n\nThe old sticherarion had even a fourth book which contained the hymns of a third regularly repeated cycle. It was usually the abridged form which only contained the hymns of Saturday hesperinos preceding the orthros and divine liturgy on Sunday. In most of the Orthodox rites the octoechos meant a cycle of eight weeks which opened with the four kyrioi echoi (each echos per week) and continued with the plagioi echoi. Sometimes the sticherarion also had a separated collection of notated [[Idiomelon|stichera prosomoia]] preceding the book Octoechos,<ref>See the collection of prosomoia in the Sticherarion of the [[Pantokratoros monastery]] ([[Trinity College, Cambridge|GB-Ctc]] Ms. [[#StixCam|B.11.17]], ff. 282\u2013294).</ref> while the Octoechos contained the best known hymns called stichera avtomela which also served as model for the prosomoia. Originally many of them were even notated quite late, since the singers knew them by heart. The early form was quite short and not yet divided into eight parts according to the eight echoi of the weekly cycle.<ref>See for instance the octoechos part of the [[#NkS4960|sticherarion of Copenhagen]]: stichera anastasima (f. 254r), alphabetika (f. 254v), anavathmoi and stichera anatolika (f. 255v), stichera heothina (f. 277v), dogmatika (f. 281v) and staurotheotikia (f. 289r).</ref>\n* [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] contains either the hymns for each Saturday or those for each day of the week (Great Octoechos), set to the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos|eight echoi]]. Using one echos or glas for each week, the entire cycle takes eight weeks to complete. This part of the ''sticherarion'' became soon an own book, in certain traditions this separated book also included the odes of the canon\u2014the hymns of the book [[Heirmologion]].\n\n== Cycles of the book Octoechos ==\nExamples of different liturgical contexts where stichera are commonly used include:\n*[[Vespers|Hesperinos]] (the evening office of the [[Canonical Hours]])\n** Vesper psalm

\"Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit\" is called a [[doxastichon]].\n*A sticheron that is dedicated to the [[Theotokos]] is called \"sticheron dogmatikon\" or \"[[theotokion]].\"\n**Theotokia normally follow the last words of the small doxology \"Both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages amen.\"\n**Those theotokia that come by the end of \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5 \u1f10\u03ba\u03ad\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03b1 or \u0413\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438, \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0445\u044a

their texts deal with the dogma of the [[Incarnation]].\n*The [[aposticha]] are a type of stichera which differ from the norm with respect, that they precede their stichos (psalm verse) rather than they follow it.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aposticha]]\n*[[Idiomelon|Avtomelon, Prosomoia]]\n*[[Neobyzantine Octoechos#Debates about the sticheraric melos|Debates about the Sticheraric

These verses are known as ''stichoi'' (sing: ''stichos''), but ''sticheraric'' poetry usually follows the hexameter and is collected in an own book called '''sticherarion''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c7\u03b7\u03c1\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}}). A sticherarion is a book containing the stichera for the morning and evening services throughout the year, but chant compositions in the ''sticheraric melos'' can also found in other [[liturgical book]]s like the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] or the ''Anastasimatarion'', or in the Anthology for the [[Divine Liturgy]].\n\n== The sticheraric melos and the troparion ==\n\nIn the current traditions of Orthodox Chant, the ''sticherarion'' as a hymn book was also used to call a chant genre ''sticheraric melos'', which is defined by its tempo and its [[melodic formula]]s according to the eight modes of the [[Neobyzantine Octoechos#Debates about the sticheraric melos|Octoechos]]. Although the hymns of the ''sticherarion'' have to be sung in the same melos, there is no direct relation with the poetic hymn genre, because its musical definition rather follows the practice of psalmody. Today the ''sticheraric melos'' as opposed to the ''troparic melos'' are two different cycles of the Octoechos.\n\nIn the past they had been closer related by the practice of psalmody, and a [[troparion]] which is nothing else than a refrain sung with psalmody, might become a more elaborated chant from a musical point of view, so that it is sung thrice without the psalm verses, but with the [[Gloria Patri|small doxology]]. The ''troparion'' in its melodic form tends to move towards the ''sticheraric'' or even ''papadic melos'', and this way, it becomes an own chant genre by itself.<ref>Sticheraric [[troparia]] which are sung during the [[Divine Liturgy]], are for instance all genres of the [[trisagion]]. The trisagion alternates with its substitutes like the baptism hymn or the troparion for Good Friday (\u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u1f78\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6). Also other genres like [[cherubikon]] and [[koinonikon]] were originally troparia used during psalm recitation.</ref>\n\n==The sticheron and its musical settings==\n\nChristian Troelsg\u00e5rd described the ''sticheron'' quite similar to the ''troparion'' and regarded the ''sticheron'' as a subcategory, only that a ''sticheron'' as an intercalation of psalmody, has been longer as a poem than a ''troparion'', thus it had been chanted without repetitions of its text, but in sections. There had been a lot of ''stichera'', but the book ''sticherarion'' was a rather dislocated collection of ''stichera'' from different local traditions and their singer-poets. It was obviously not used on a pulpit during celebrations, but rather an exercise book with various examples which could be studied for own compositions with similar accentuation patterns.<ref>Christian Troelsg\u00e5rd ([[#Tro01|2001]]).</ref>\n\nConcerning this paradigmatic use of notation the musical setting of a ''sticheron'', the ''sticherarion'' had been mainly a collection of ''[[Idiomelon|idiomela]]'' which had to be understood as individual compositions for a certain ''sticheron'' poem,<ref>The ''stichera prosomoia'' created over the model of an existing ''sticheron avtomelon,'' were later added to the books of the sticherarion ([[#Hus1972|Husmann 1972]]). The composition of the book Triodion by the generation of [[Theodore the Studite]] was basically a prosomoia collection, composed over the melodies of avtomela, but also of idiomela.</ref> although the melodic patterns could be rather classified according to one of the eight or ten modes  (''echos'' or ''glas'') of the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos]].<ref>Christian Troelsg\u00e5rd regarded this collection as not locally focussed, because the collections in different sticheraria have so much in common, that he identified in the footsteps of Oliver Strunk and Bjarne Schartau these ''idiomela'' with numbers of the standard abridged version ([[#Tro03|SAV]]).</ref> The reference to it is given by the modal signatures, especially the medial signatures written within notation, so the book ''sticherarion'' constituted the synthetic role of its notation (Byzantine round notation), which integrated signs taken from different chant books during the 13th century.<ref>About the modal signatures in Byzantine round notation, see Raasted ([[#Raa66|1966]]).</ref>\n\nBut there was as well the practice of using certain ''stichera'' as models (''avtomela'') to compose other poems (''prosomoia''), similar to the ''[[heirmos]]''. This classification became even more complex by the translation of the hymn books into Slavonic, which forced the ''kanonarches'', responsible for the preparation of the services, to adapt the music of a certain ''avtomelon'' to the translated ''prosomoia'' and the prosody of the Slavonic language, in certain cases the adaptation needed a musical recomposition of the prosomoion. In practice, the ''avtomela'' as well as the ''prosomeia ''are often omitted in the books of the ''sticherarion,'' they rather belonged to an oral tradition, since the ''avtomela'' were known by heart. Often the ''prosomoia'' had been written apart before the ''[[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]]'' part of Sticherarion, which was usually not organised according to the eight modes unlike the Great Oktoechos.<ref>H.J.W. Tillyard ([[Sticheron#Til1940-49|1940]], XII) argued that this custom to omit the prosomoia can be explained that they were later added to the book, since they had been created later than the rest of the hymn repertoire. On the other hand, Irina Shkolnik ([[#Shk1998|1998]]) argued that the oral tradition of prosomoia and their avtomela was closer to the local tradition of a monastery, so there was for a long period no need to write it down unlike the more complex idiomela.</ref>\n\nSince [[John Koukouzeles]] and other contemporary scribes who revised the ''sticheraria'', there was development from the traditional ''sticheron'', sung by a whole congregation or community,<ref>Nina-Maria Wanek ([[#Wan2013|2013]]) discussed in her systematic analysis of the August part of the Menaion, what was really Koukouzeles' role concerning the contemporary redaction of the sticheraria. Maria Alexandru ([[#Ale2000|2000]], [[#Ale2007|2007]]) made a comparative analysis of the musical settings of a few selected ''stichera'' as they had been created during the centuries.</ref> to a rather representative and elaborated performance by a soloist.<ref>Maria Alexandru ([[#Ale2011|2011]]).</ref> [[Manuel Chrysaphes]] regarded [[John Koukouzeles]] as the inventor of the \"embellished sticheron\" (''sticheron kalophonikon''), but he emphasized that he always followed step by step the model, as it has been written down in ''sticherarion''. Especially in the kalophonic genre, a systematic collection of compositions by Constantinopolitan maistores, made after the ''menaion'' of ''sticherarion'', could already grow, as one part of the ''sticherarion kalophonikon'' (see also [[British Library|GB-Lbl]] Ms. [[#Menaionkalophon|Add. 28821]]), to a volume about 1900 pages, an expansion in chant which could be hardly performed during celebrations of any cathedral of the Empire.<ref>For instance a ''Sticherarion kalophonikon'' or ''Menaion kalophonikon'' by Gabriel of Yenik\u00f6y (Berlin, State Library, Mus. ms. 25059). The kalophonic composition of ''sticheron'' for St. Peter \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 by Nikolaos Kampanes and [[John Koukouzeles]] has been analysed by Oliver Gerlach ([[#Ger09|2009]]).</ref>\n\n== History of the notated chant book ''Sticherarion'' ==\n\nDuring the reform of the 17th century the book ''Sticherarion'' had been replaced by the ''Doxastarion'', called after the main genre of the former book, the [[doxastikon]]: the ''sticheron'' which was introduced by both or one of the two stichoi of [[Papadic Octoechos#Models of simple psalmody|\u0394\u03cc\u03be\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u1f76]], but it followed the same compositions written down in the old Sticherarion. During the 18th century the repertoire was created which had been printed as ''Doxastarion'' since 1820. It was based on transcriptions of the hyphos, short versions created by the generation of Ioannes Trapezountios and Daniel the Protopsaltes who had recomposed the traditional melodies. The hyphos was supposed to abridge the traditional melos in the school of [[Manuel Chrysaphes]], as it had been delivered by 17th-century composers like [[Panagiotes the New Chrysaphes]] and Germanos of New Patras.<ref>Nina-Maria Wanek ([[#Wan2013|2013]]).</ref> They had grown very long, obviously under influence of the kalophonic method to do the thesis of the sticheraric melos, but also by a hybridisation of the great signs during the traditional thesis of the sticheric melos.<ref>For a catalogue which shows, how the great signs themselves added something to the stichera during the 16th century, see Flora Kritikou ([[Sticheron#Kri2013|2013]]).</ref> Between the 1820 and 1841, the abridged ''Doxastarion'' had been published in 3 versions: the \"Doxastarion syntomon\" of Petros Peloponnesios ([[#Dox1820|1820]]), the \"Doxastarion argon\" of Iakovos the Protoposaltes ([[#Iak1836|1836]]), and the \"Doxastarion argosyntomon\" of Konstantinos the Protopsaltes ([[#Kon1841|1841]]).\n\nThe medieval ''Sticherarion'' had been divided into four books, which also existed as separated books of their own: the [[Menaion]], the [[Pentekostarion]], the [[Triodion]], and the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]].<ref>The sticherarion of the Great Lavra ([[Great Lavra|GR-AOml]] Ms. [[#GR-AOmlGamma12|\u03b3 12]]) shows the oldest layer of notation (theta notation) in its second part of the mobile cycle: the pentekostarion (ff. 49v-80r), while the first part the letters \u03b8 (\u201cthema\u201c) which indicated a melisma over the marked syllable, became elaborated in the Athonite Chartres notation with the triodion (ff. 1r-49v).</ref> These books of the ''Sticherarion'' were created during the Studites reform between the 9th and the 10th centuries, its repertoire was completed until the 11th century, but until the 14th century the whole repertoire had been reduced among scribes who changed and unified the numerous redactions. The 10th-century reform already defined the gospel lectures and the doxastika connected with them.<ref>Svetlana Poliakova ([[#Pol09|2009]]).</ref> The oldest copies can be dated back to the 10th and 11th centuries, and like the ''[[Heirmologion]]'' the ''Sticherarion'' was the one of the first hymn books, which was entirely provided with musical notation ([[#Palaeobyzantine notation .2810th.E2.80.9313th century.29|Palaeo Byzantine neumes]]).<ref>Christian Troelsg\u00e5rd ([[#Tro01|2001]]).</ref> But the complete form still appeared in the time of the 14th-century reform, which had been notated in [[#Middle Byzantine notation .2813th.E2.80.9319th century.29|Middle Byzantine neumes]].<ref>The manuscript [[#NkS4960|NkS 4960]] of the Royal Library at Copenhagen as well as manuscript A139 supp. of the Ambrosian Library of Milan, written by Athanasios of Constantinople in 1341, are ''sticheraria'' according to the revision of \"[[John Koukouzeles]]\" ([[#Raa95|Raasted 1995]]) and they both contain all four books.</ref>\n\nThe genre ''sticheron'' already existed since centuries, it can be traced back to ''Tropologia'' written during the 6th century, but the repertoire as it can be reconstructed by Georgian Iadgari ''Tropologion'' seems to be different from the Byzantine redaction which was based on the Tropologion of Antioch and later expanded by the hymnographers of [[Mar Saba]] (Jerusalem).<ref>See Fr\u00f8yshov ([[#FrGe2000|2000]], [[#Fro2012|2012]]) and Nikiforova ([[Sticheron#Nik2013|2013]]).</ref> The book ''Tropologion'' was still used until the 12th century and it also contains the [[Canon (hymnography)|canons]] of the ''[[Heirmologion]]''. Originally the ''Heirmologion'' and ''Sticherarion'' were created as notated chant books during the 10th century.<ref>According to Gerda Wolfram ([[Sticheron#WolframNGr|New Grove]]) the oldest ''Sticheraria'' were notated collections of ''Idiomela ''and discovered in the library of the [[Great Lavra (Athos)|Great Lavra]] on the Mount Athos and can be dated back to the 10th (Ms. \u03b3.12, \u03b3.67 is the only with an octoechos) and 11th century (\u03b3.72, \u03b3.74). The oldest notation used was theta notation, later replaced by Chartres and Coislin notation. The oldest Slavonic ''sticherarion'' dates back to the 12th century and has adiastematic sematic notation. It was discovered in the library of the [[Hilandar]] Monastery (Ms. 307).</ref>\n\n==The parts and cycles of the book sticherarion==\nThe [[Idiomelon|stichera idiomela]] are commonly written in two [[liturgy|liturgical]] year cycles, the immobile one or sanctoral, and the mobile one between [[Great Lent]] and Pentecost. Usually this collection of idiomela consists of three books, the menaion for the immobile cycle and two books called triodion and pentecostarion for the mobile cycle:\n*[[Menaion]] (\"book of the months\") contains all hymns of the immobile monthly cycle beginning with September end ending with August. These are hymns dedicated to particular [[saint]]s commemorated according to the calendar day of the year.\n*[[Triodion]] contains hymns chanted during Great Lent, beginning with the Sunday of [[Pharisee and the Publican]] ten weeks before Easter and ending with the Holy week preceding Easter or with Palm Sunday. It has a huge collection of stichera prosomoia as well.<ref>The early Prosomoia composed by [[Theodore the Studite]]s for the evening service during Lenten period which belong to the book Triodion ([[Sticheron#Hus1972|Husmann 1972]], 216-231). These prosomoia are not composed over stichera avtomela, but over stichera ideomela, especially compositions dedicated to martyres.</ref> \n*[[Pentecostarion]] contains hymns chanted during the [[Paschal Cycle|Paschal Season]], beginning with the hesperinos of the Resurrection feast or Monday of the Holy Week until All Saints' Sunday which follows the Sunday of Pentecost.\n\nThe old sticherarion had even a fourth book which contained the hymns of a third regularly repeated cycle. It was usually the abridged form which only contained the hymns of Saturday hesperinos preceding the orthros and divine liturgy on Sunday. In most of the Orthodox rites the octoechos meant a cycle of eight weeks which opened with the four kyrioi echoi (each echos per week) and continued with the plagioi echoi. Sometimes the sticherarion also had a separated collection of notated [[Idiomelon|stichera prosomoia]] preceding the book Octoechos,<ref>See the collection of prosomoia in the Sticherarion of the [[Pantokratoros monastery]] ([[Trinity College, Cambridge|GB-Ctc]] Ms. [[#StixCam|B.11.17]], ff. 282\u2013294).</ref> while the Octoechos contained the best known hymns called stichera avtomela which also served as model for the prosomoia. Originally many of them were even notated quite late, since the singers knew them by heart. The early form was quite short and not yet divided into eight parts according to the eight echoi of the weekly cycle.<ref>See for instance the octoechos part of the [[#NkS4960|sticherarion of Copenhagen]]: stichera anastasima (f. 254r), alphabetika (f. 254v), anavathmoi and stichera anatolika (f. 255v), stichera heothina (f. 277v), dogmatika (f. 281v) and staurotheotikia (f. 289r).</ref>\n* [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] contains either the hymns for each Saturday or those for each day of the week (Great Octoechos), set to the [[Hagiopolitan Octoechos|eight echoi]]. Using one echos or glas for each week, the entire cycle takes eight weeks to complete. This part of the ''sticherarion'' became soon an own book, in certain traditions this separated book also included the odes of the canon\u2014the hymns of the book [[Heirmologion]].\n\n== Cycles of the book Octoechos ==\nExamples of different liturgical contexts where stichera are commonly used include:\n*[[Vespers|Hesperinos]] (the evening office of the [[Canonical Hours]])\n** Vesper psalm \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5 \u1f10\u03ba\u03ad\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03b1, \u0413\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0445\u044a \u043a'\u0442\u0435\u0431\u0463 (\"Lord, I Have Cried\", Ps. 140.1)\n**The [[Lity (Orthodox Vespers)|Litiy]] (procession on Sundays and feast days)\n**The [[aposticha]]\n*[[Matins|Orthros]] (the morning office)\n**The [[Lauds#Eastern Christianity|Praises]] (on Sundays and Feast Days)\n**The [[aposticha]] (on simple weekdays)\n\n==Types of stichera==\n\n*A sticheron that follows the words, \"Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit\" is called a [[doxastichon]].\n*A sticheron that is dedicated to the [[Theotokos]] is called \"sticheron dogmatikon\" or \"[[theotokion]].\"\n**Theotokia normally follow the last words of the small doxology \"Both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages amen.\"\n**Those theotokia that come by the end of \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5 \u1f10\u03ba\u03ad\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u03b1 or \u0413\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438, \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0437\u0432\u0430\u0445\u044a \u043a'\u0442\u0454\u0431\u0463 (\"Lord, I Have Cried\", Ps 140.1) during [[Vespers]] on Saturday night, Friday night and the eves of most Feast Days are called \"[[dogmatikon|dogmatika]], because their texts deal with the dogma of the [[Incarnation]].\n*The [[aposticha]] are a type of stichera which differ from the norm with respect, that they precede their stichos (psalm verse) rather than they follow it.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aposticha]]\n*[[Idiomelon|Avtomelon, Prosomoia]]\n*[[Neobyzantine Octoechos#Debates about the sticheraric melos|Debates about the Sticheraric
