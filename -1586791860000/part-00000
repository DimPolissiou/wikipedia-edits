President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] was in [[Baguio]] recuperating from a recurrence of an old illness, and immediately traveled by road the 160 miles to Manila to take charge of the Filipino resistance. In meetings following his arrival, U.S. [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]] informed him that MacArthur would be transferring his headquarters to [[Corregidor|Corregidor island]], and requested the President to join him. President Quezon initially objected, but agreed when his [[Cabinet of the Philippines|Cabinet]] endorsed MacArthur's suggestion by unanimous decision. On December 24, the President relocated there, accompanied by his family, Vice President [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a|Vice President Osme\u00f1a]], Chief Justice Santos, Major.

By the middle of February the lack of food on Corregidor had become acute, and it was decided chat the President could be of more help by going to the unoccupied provinces to organize some plan of bringing in food for the soldiers at Bataan and Corregidor and to keep up the morale of the civilian population.

These activities were very successful in sustaining American interest in the Philippine Commonwealth, and had immense impact on the Japanese-occupied Philippines through shortwave news broadcasts which the Japanese were unable to stop. The government in exile also published a news magazine in the United States called ''Philippines''.

President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] was in [[Baguio]] recuperating from a recurrence of an old illness, and immediately traveled by road the 160 miles to Manila to take charge of the Filipino resistance. In meetings following his arrival, U.S. [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur]] informed him that MacArthur would be transferring his headquarters to [[Corregidor|Corregidor island]], and requested the President to join him.

Most scholars generally identify him with [[Xerxes I]] of Persia, as did 19th-century Bible commentaries.<ref>\"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1454354 The Religious Policy of Xerxes and the 'Book of Esther']\", Littman, Robert J., ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'', 65.3, January 1975, p.145\u2013148.</ref> Three factors, among others, contribute to this identification:\n\n# It is agreed the Hebrew 'Ahasuerus' descended from the Persian names for Xerxes I. Additionally, the form of the king's name written in Esther 10:1, ''\u2019a\u1e25a\u0161\u0113r\u014d\u0161'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b2\u05d7\u05b7\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e8\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1}}) bears much more resemblance to the original old Persian ''X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161a'' than the standard Hebrew form which does not omit the word\u2019s [[waw (letter)|vavim]].\n# Historian [[Herodotus]] records Xerxes I having penchants for women and wine, as well as mentioning the king ruled from India to Ethiopia in a magnificent palace in Shusan ([[Susa]]), all of which the Book of Esther corroborates. Herodotus also mentions that Xerxes I sought comfort in his [[harem]] following his [[Battle of Salamis|defeat at Salamis]] in the tenth month of his seventh year as king,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} which is strikingly similar to the date of Ahasuerus choosing beautiful women from his harem in the tenth month of his seventh year as king (Esther 2:16).\n# Annals from the reign of Xerxes I mention an otherwise unattested official by the name of \"Marduka\", which some have proposed refers to Mordecai, as both are mentioned serving in the king's court.\n\nHowever, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, the [[Midrash]] of ''Esther Rabbah, I, 3'' and the [[Josippon]] identify the king as [[Artaxerxes I]], and the historian [[Josephus]] relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=967&letter=A Ahasuerus] at the JewishEncyclopedia.com</ref> The [[Ethiopia|Ethiopic]] text calls him ''Ar\u0165eksis'', usually the Ethiopic equivalent of ''Artaxerxes''.\n\n{{Original research section|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[John of Ephesus]] and [[Bar-Hebraeus]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://syri.ac/bhchronicles|title=Chronicles of Bar Hebraeus {{!}} syri.ac|website=syri.ac|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> identified him as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]], a view strongly supported by the 20th century scholar [[Jacob Hoschander]].<ref name=\"Hosch\">Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923</ref>{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} [[Masudi]] recorded the Persian view of events which affirms the identification and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] similarly placed the events during the time of Artaxerxes II despite being confused by the Hebrew name for the king. ''Esther Rabba'' and the Vulgate present \"Ahasuerus\" as a different name for the king to \"Artaxerxes\" rather than an equivalent in different languages, and the Septuagint distinguished between the two names using a Greek transliteration of Ahasuerus for occurrences outside the Book of Esther. Indeed, an inscription from the time of Artaxerxes II records that he was also known as ''Arshu'' understood to be a shortening of the Babylonian form ''Achshiyarshu'' derived from the Persian ''Khshayarsha'' (Xerxes). The Greek historians [[Ctesias]] and [[Deinon]] noted that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Arsicas'' or ''Oarses'' respectively similarly understood to be derived from ''Khshayarsha'', the former as the shortened form together with the Persian suffix ''-ke'' applied to such shortened names;<ref name=\"Hosch\" />{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} whereas in reality the Greek ''Artaxerxes'' is for the [[Old Persian]] ''Artax\u0161a\u00e7a'' (with /''\u00e7''/ for non-Persian /''\u03b8r''/, that is, ''Artax\u0161a\u03b8ra'', [[New Persian]] ''Ardashir'' \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631) < ''arta-'' 'justice' and ''x\u0161a\u00e7a-'' 'kingdom,' 'Having a kingdom of justice.' As is evident, the two names have different etymologies.\nIn his ''Historia Scholastica'' [[Petrus Comestor]] similarly identified Ahasuerus of Esther as the predecessor of a king called Artaxerxes (usually translated into English as Ahasuerus) who was also called Ochus i.e. [[Artaxerxes III]] thus also identifying the former Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II. Comestor notes that Ochus had reconquered Egypt after the Ahasuerus of the book of Esther had lost it to pharaoh [[Amyrtaeus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Historia_Scholastica/Esther#De_Ocho_seu_Artaxerxe.|title=Historia Scholastica/Esther - Wikisource|author=|date=|website=la.wikisource.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Book of Ezra===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Ahasuerus, Haman and Esther - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Ahasuerus and [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] at [[Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther|Esther's Feast]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]\nAhasuerus is also given as the name of a [[King of Persia]] in the [[Book of Ezra]].<ref>{{bibleref|Ezra|4:5-7}}</ref>\n\nMany modern commentators and even translators have come to associate him with [[Xerxes I]], taking a lead from the [[Book of Esther]].\n\nBut others have come to question this and make an identification with [[Cambyses II]]<ref>Gill's Exposition of the Whole Bible, as quoted by Bible.cc/ezra/4-7.htm</ref> or with [[Bardiya|False Smerdis / Bardiya / Gomoates]] who reigned for seven months between [[Cambyses II]] and [[Darius I]].<ref>Clarke's Commentary on the Bible, as quoted by Bible.cc/ezra/4-7.htm</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, others argue that Ezra's usage can ''only'' be [[Cambyses II]]: forced by \"Ahasuerus\" appearing between the very identifiable kings of [[Cyrus]] and [[Darius I|Darius the Persian]].<ref>Jones, A.T., Great Empires of Prophecy, 5.10, footnote</ref> arguing that: 1.

Most scholars generally identify him with [[Xerxes I]] of Persia, as did 19th-century Bible commentaries.<ref>\"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1454354 The Religious Policy of Xerxes and the 'Book of Esther']\", Littman, Robert J., ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'', 65.3, January 1975, p.145\u2013148.</ref> Three factors, among others, contribute to this identification:\n\n# It is agreed the Hebrew 'Ahasuerus' descended from the Persian names for Xerxes I. Additionally, the form of the king's name written in Esther 10:1, ''\u2019a\u1e25a\u0161\u0113r\u014d\u0161'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b2\u05d7\u05b7\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e8\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1}}) bears much more resemblance to the original old Persian ''X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161a'' than the standard Hebrew form which does not omit the word\u2019s [[waw (letter)|vavim]].\n# Historian [[Herodotus]] records Xerxes I having penchants for women and wine, as well as mentioning the king ruled from India to Ethiopia in a magnificent palace in Shusan ([[Susa]]), all of which the Book of Esther corroborates. Herodotus also mentions that Xerxes I sought comfort in his [[harem]] following his [[Battle of Salamis|defeat at Salamis]] in the tenth month of his seventh year as king,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} which is strikingly similar to the date of Ahasuerus choosing beautiful women from his harem in the tenth month of his seventh year as king (Esther 2:16).\n# Annals from the reign of Xerxes I mention an otherwise unattested official by the name of \"Marduka\", which some have proposed refers to Mordecai, as both are mentioned serving in the king's court.\n\nHowever, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, the [[Midrash]] of ''Esther Rabbah, I, 3'' and the [[Josippon]] identify the king as [[Artaxerxes I]], and the historian [[Josephus]] relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=967&letter=A Ahasuerus] at the JewishEncyclopedia.com</ref> The [[Ethiopia|Ethiopic]] text calls him ''Ar\u0165eksis'', usually the Ethiopic equivalent of ''Artaxerxes''.\n\n{{Original research section|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[John of Ephesus]] and [[Bar-Hebraeus]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://syri.ac/bhchronicles|title=Chronicles of Bar Hebraeus {{!}} syri.ac|website=syri.ac|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> identified him as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]], a view strongly supported by the 20th century scholar [[Jacob Hoschander]].<ref name=\"Hosch\">Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923</ref>{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} [[Masudi]] recorded the Persian view of events which affirms the identification and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] similarly placed the events during the time of Artaxerxes II despite being confused by the Hebrew name for the king. ''Esther Rabba'' and the Vulgate present \"Ahasuerus\" as a different name for the king to \"Artaxerxes\" rather than an equivalent in different languages, and the Septuagint distinguished between the two names using a Greek transliteration of Ahasuerus for occurrences outside the Book of Esther. Indeed, an inscription from the time of Artaxerxes II records that he was also known as ''Arshu'' understood to be a shortening of the Babylonian form ''Achshiyarshu'' derived from the Persian ''Khshayarsha'' (Xerxes). The Greek historians [[Ctesias]] and [[Deinon]] noted that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Arsicas'' or ''Oarses'' respectively similarly understood to be derived from ''Khshayarsha'', the former as the shortened form together with the Persian suffix ''-ke'' applied to such shortened names;<ref name=\"Hosch\" />{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} whereas in reality the Greek ''Artaxerxes'' is for the [[Old Persian]] ''Artax\u0161a\u00e7a'' (with /''\u00e7''/ for non-Persian /''\u03b8r''/, that is, ''Artax\u0161a\u03b8ra'', [[New Persian]] ''Ardashir'' \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631) < ''arta-'' 'justice' and ''x\u0161a\u00e7a-'' 'kingdom,' 'Having a kingdom of justice.' As is evident, the two names have different etymologies.\nIn his ''Historia Scholastica'' [[Petrus Comestor]] similarly identified Ahasuerus of Esther as the predecessor of a king called Artaxerxes (usually translated into English as Ahasuerus) who was also called Ochus i.e. [[Artaxerxes III]] thus also identifying the former Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II. Comestor notes that Ochus had reconquered Egypt after the Ahasuerus of the book of Esther had lost it to pharaoh [[Amyrtaeus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Historia_Scholastica/Esther#De_Ocho_seu_Artaxerxe.|title=Historia Scholastica/Esther - Wikisource|author=|date=|website=la.wikisource.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Book of Ezra===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Ahasuerus, Haman and Esther - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Ahasuerus and [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] at [[Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther|Esther's Feast]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]\nAhasuerus is also given as the name of a [[King of Persia]] in the [[Book of Ezra]].<ref>{{bibleref|Ezra|4:5-7}}</ref>\n\nMany modern commentators and even translators have come to associate him with [[Xerxes I]], taking a lead from the [[Book of Esther]].\n\nBut others have come to question this and make an identification with [[Cambyses II]]<ref>Gill's Exposition of the Whole Bible, as quoted by Bible.cc/ezra/4-7.htm</ref> or with [[Bardiya|False Smerdis / Bardiya / Gomoates]] who reigned for seven months between [[Cambyses II]] and [[Darius I]].<ref>Clarke's Commentary on the Bible, as quoted by Bible.cc/ezra/4-7.htm</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, others argue that Ezra's usage can ''only'' be [[Cambyses II]]: forced by \"Ahasuerus\" appearing between the very identifiable kings of [[Cyrus]] and [[Darius I|Darius the Persian]].<ref>Jones, A.T., Great Empires of Prophecy, 5.10, footnote</ref> arguing that: 1.

Stiletto heels are a common [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] item. As a fashion item, their popularity has changed over time. After an initial wave of popularity in the 1950s, they reached their most refined shape in the early 1960s, when the toes of the shoes which bore them became as slender and elongated as the stiletto heels themselves. As a result of the overall sharpness of outline, it was customary for women to refer to the whole shoe as a \"stiletto\", not just the heel, via [[synecdoche]] (''[[pars pro toto]]''). Although they faded from the scene after the [[The Beatles|Beatle]] era began, their popularity continued at street level, and women stubbornly refused to give them up even after they could no longer readily find them in the mainstream shops. A version of the stiletto heel was reintroduced in 1974 by [[Manolo Blahnik]], who dubbed his \"new\" heel the \"Needle\". Similar heels were stocked at the big [[Biba]] store in London, by [[Russell & Bromley]] and by smaller boutiques. Old, unsold stocks of pointed-toe stilettos and contemporary efforts to replicate them (lacking the true stiletto heel because of changes in the way heels were by then being mass-produced) were sold in street fashion markets and became popular with [[Punk subculture|punks]] and with other fashion \"tribes\" of the late 1970s until supplies of the inspirational original styles dwindled in the early 1980s. Subsequently, round-toe shoes with slightly thicker (sometimes cone-shaped) semi-stiletto heels, often very high in an attempt to convey slenderness were frequently worn at the office with wide-shouldered [[Suit (clothing)|power suits]]. The style survived through much of the 1980s but almost completely disappeared during the 1990s, when professional and college-age women took to wearing shoes with thick, block heels.

The actors who portrayed Mr. Freeze were [[George Sanders]], [[Otto Preminger]], and [[Eli Wallach]].

As a child, he was fascinated with cryonic preservation, so he begins freezing animals. His parents are horrified by his \"hobby\" and send him to a strict boarding school, where he is miserable and feels detached from humanity. In college, he meets a woman named [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he ultimately marries.<ref name=\"UGO - Freeze\"/>\n\nNora contracts a fatal illness 1\u00bd years after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, so Fries begins developing a freeze ray for [[List of locations of the DC Universe|GothCorp]] in order to preserve her in suspended animation until a cure can be found. Fries' boss Ferris Boyle decides to tell the mob about the gun, leading Batman to create a team of specialists to help him do his job better. As Fries puts Nora in suspended animation, Boyle interrupts and tampers with the experiment, resulting in an explosion that kills Nora. Fries survives, but the chemicals in the freeze ray lower his body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. He swears revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife (whom he talks to often), and becomes Mr. Freeze, the first superpowered villain whom Batman faces in this continuity. Eventually, Batman's operatives find Freeze, who shoots one of them with his freeze gun, but Batman eventually apprehends him.<ref name=\"UGO - Freeze\"/> Initially locked in [[Arkham Asylum]], Freeze was eventually transferred to the Gotham State Penitentiary, from where he escaped and attempted to steal technology from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] until he was stopped and returned to prison by Batman.<ref>''Detective Comic'' #595</ref>\n\nFreeze's crimes tend to involve freezing everyone and everything that he encounters<ref name=\"UGO - Freeze\"/> so he never forges alliances with the other criminals in Gotham, preferring to work alone. On rare occasions, he has worked with another member of Batman's rogues gallery, usually as an enforcer for Gotham's mob bosses, such as the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] during his [[Batman: City of Crime|reign]] <ref>''Detective comics'' #804-806</ref> or [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]] during the [[Batman: Under the Hood|return]] of [[Jason Todd]].<ref>''Batman'' #635</ref><ref>''Batman'' #836</ref> In one of his notable team-ups, Freeze constructs a cryogenic machine for [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] so that Hush might take revenge on Batman, Freeze's equipment allowing Hush to preserve [[Catwoman]]'s surgically removed heart to use as a means of threatening her life.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #850</ref>\n\nAfter Batman's [[Batman RIP|death]], most of the Arkham inmates were [[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|freed]] by a [[Jeremiah Arkham|new Black Mask]]. Freeze was among them and he started working on a project called Ice-X Protocol when the GCPD tried to capture him. He stunned them with his gun and captured Gordon, taking him to his secret lair. Gordon managed to break free and defeat Freeze by causing an explosion that weakened Freeze. After his capture, Freeze was taken to [[Iron Heights]] prison.<ref>''Battle for the Cowl: Commissioner Gordon'' #1</ref>\n\nDuring his time with the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], he fashions a sub-zero machine for [[Nyssa Raatko|Nyssa al Ghul]] in exchange for the use of her [[Lazarus Pit]]. He attempts to restore Nora to life without waiting for the adjusting needed in the pool chemicals; she returns to life as the twisted Lazara and escapes.

Here, Victor Fries' fascination with cryonics began when he was a boy and his mother fell through the ice of a frozen lake. The ice was able to keep her preserved long enough for help to arrive, thus sparking his lifelong obsession with the cold. It is later revealed that the accident left Fries' mother in constant pain, and Fries ended her suffering by pushing her into the same frozen lake. In this new origin, Nora was never Fries' wife. Her name was Nora Fields, a woman born in 1943. When Nora was 23, she was diagnosed with incurable heart disease, so her family placed her in cryogenic stasis hoping that a cure would be found in the future. Fries, having written his doctoral thesis on Nora, took on a position as a cryogenic researcher and technician at Wayne Enterprises, the facility that housed Nora's body.\n\nEventually, he fell in love with Nora and became dedicated to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, as he began to feel uncomfortable with Fries' obsession with Nora. Furious, Fries hurled a chair at Wayne, who dodged the attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Fries and transformed him into Mr. Freeze.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]|penciller=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|inker=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|colorist=[[Peter Steigerwald|Steigerwald, Peter]]|letterer=[[Sal Cipriano|Cipriano, Sal]]|editor=[[Mike Marts|Marts, Mike]]|story=Night of the Owls: First Snow|title=[[Batman Annual]]|volume=2|issue=#1|date=July 2012|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Court of Owls uses Freeze's cryogenic-thaw formula to revive their Talons, and then they try to kill him. Freeze survives but is captured by the Red Hood and sent to [[Arkham Asylum]]. He escapes shortly afterward and rearms himself with the Penguin's help. Freeze decides to kill Bruce Wayne and takes Nora, whom he believes to be his wife so that they can leave [[Gotham City]] behind forever. Infiltrating [[Wayne Enterprises]], Freeze has a brief fight with [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] and [[Damian Wayne|Robin]], but he subdues them. Then, Freeze goes to the penthouse, where he finds Batman and the frozen Nora.

Transferring his mind into a [[Cloning|clone]] built from his own baseline [[DNA]], Victor Fries sees this as a second chance. Fries initially tries to right some of the wrongs he has committed by creating a charitable organization with all his legitimate earnings from before he was imprisoned, which impresses Terry. However, Victor's new body soon begins to revert to his original body's same sub-zero [[biology]]. Although Lake and Powers betray him when he returns to Wayne-Powers for help, Fries escapes. After recovering an advanced suit of sub-zero armor that fires ice blasts directly out of gauntlets equipped onto his hands, Mister Freeze seeks revenge by freezing Lake and Powers and attempting to blow up Wayne-Powers' complex to commit suicide.

In the film, Dr. Victor Fries was in an accident in a cryogenics lab he was using to find a cure for his wife Nora Fries suffering from the (fictional) [[terminal illness]] MacGregor's Syndrome and is now dependent on a [[diamond]]-powered sub-zero suit to keep cold or he would die.

Mister Freeze is captured by Batman and detained at Arkham Asylum, but flees with the help of [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] and Bane. Ivy cuts off Nora's [[life support]] and deceives Mister Freeze into thinking that Batman was responsible for the deed as part of a plan to use him to freeze up Gotham City. With the use of a gigantic ray gun stationed in an observatory, he freezes over the entirety of Gotham. In a subsequent fight with Batman, Mr. Freeze destroys the observatory with a set of bombs (planted by Bane) in an unsuccessful attempt to take Batman with him. Batman shows Mr. Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl in which she brags about killing Nora, revealing her real colours to him. Batman tells Mr. Freeze that his wife is not dead; she was restored and moved to Arkham, where he can complete his research. Batman asks him for the cure he created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for [[Alfred Pennyworth]]; Mr. Freeze atones for his past actions by giving Batman the medicine he had developed. Freeze is then detained at Arkham where he exacts his revenge on Ivy for her deception and treachery.

In it his design is based mainly on the animated series and he uses his freeze gun to freeze enemies and water. The strength granted to him by his suit allows him to pick up objects others cannot. His suit also protects him from toxins. The Riddler assigns him to get a freeze cannon in his old factory. It is shown in the story that, while he aids the Riddler in his pursuit for Gotham City's gold reserves, he is shown to be formulating plans of his own, which involve raising an army of Freeze Maids, which he uses in his boss fight. The player has to be quick and attack him right after he shuts down his freeze gun. After he is defeated, he attempts to run away, but Batman throws a Batarang at him, causing his pack to backfire and make him bounce across the room and then land on the floor in front of Batman and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. In the ending cutscene, he is seen in [[Arkham Asylum]] playing with dolls of him and a Freeze Maid.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]]. He appears as a cameo in the fourth level \"Asylum Assignment\", where he is seen in a cell constantly tapping on the glass. In Free-play mode, the player can actually kill him once s/he sends one of the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin's]] bombs inside and attacks him. Outside of the story, he appears as a boss fight and an unlockable character found at the observatory. His intro catchphrase is, \"Is it just me, or is it really cold in here?\"\n* Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]] doing a terrible [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] impression. He first appears as a boss in the story, on which the player helps [[Plastic Man]] defeat him in the Watchtower so that they can proceed to defeat [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. The player as Batman in his Sensor-suit must attack Mr. Freeze while the character is in stealth mode. Mr. Freeze is later found in [[Qward]] in a side-quest where he requests the player to find another fuel cell for his freezer after the other was damaged by [[Killer Moth]]. The ''Batman Beyond'' version of Mr. Freeze is also playable via downloadable content.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', voiced again by [[Eric Bauza]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/sdcc18-lego-dc-super-villains-cast-and-devs-dish-on-funever-evil/ | title=Syndicated Comics| date=2018-07-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://mailchi.mp/mi5communications/lego-dc-super-villains-reveals-darkseids-villainy-in-action-in-new-clip-890165?e=49aaf48973 | title=Lego\u00ae DC Super-Villains Reveals Darkseid's Villainy in Action in New Clip}}</ref>\n\n====''Batman: Arkham''====\n* Mr. Freeze appears in the ''Batman Arkham'' series where he is voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]].\n** In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', Mr. Freeze's frost and icicle covered cell can be seen in the Penitentiary area which can be scanned to unlock his bio. According to the game's writer [[Paul Dini]], Freeze was originally planned to be featured in the game, but his inclusion was dropped as he did not fit as part of the game.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/6126146/Batman-Arkham-Asylum-interview-with-Paul-Dini.html | title=Batman: Arkham Asylum interview with Paul Dini| date=2009-09-02| last1=Cowen| first1=Nick}}</ref>\n** In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', he appears as both an ally to Batman and a [[boss battle]]. After the Joker poisons Batman, the Dark Knight has to find Mr. Freeze. Batman searches for him in the GCPD building (literally the coldest place in Arkham City), only to find his lab swarmed by the Penguin's men, who reveal that Penguin is holding Mr. Freeze hostage in the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute. It is revealed that Penguin stole Mr. Freeze's gun and is holding GCPD officers hostage. Batman saves the hostages and Mr. Freeze from Penguin's men in the museum and asks Mr. Freeze for the cure to his ailment, only for Mr. Freeze to reveal he needs his suit, which Penguin possesses. He tells Batman that his suit has a disruptor that can be used to turn off his freeze gun so that he can defeat Penguin. After Penguin is apprehended and Mr. Freeze recovers his suit, he gets revenge by locking Penguin in a display case. Mr. Freeze then tells Batman that the cure he made for Joker degenerates too quickly and needs a restorative enzyme that has been bonded to human DNA, something that would take decades, only for Batman to reveal he knows [[Ra's al Ghul|someone]] who has been exposed to that enzyme for centuries. Mr. Freeze tells Batman he only needs a sample of this person's DNA to complete the cure and Batman proceeds to track down one of the warriors of the [[League of Assassins]] Penguin had captured. When Batman returns to the GCPD with the blood sample, Mr. Freeze creates two vials of the cure before locking one in a safe and destroying the other, demanding Batman save [[Nora Fries]] from Joker. Batman fights Mr. Freeze to unlock the safe, which proves difficult as Mr. Freeze is much too powerful to be confronted directly. Batman is forced to hide and find ways to stun Mr. Freeze, such as using grates in the floor to surprise him as he passes by. Each time Mr. Freeze is incapacitated, he counteracts his weaknesses. After he is beaten, Batman opens the safe only to find that the wall behind the safe was broken into and in the place of the cure there is only a note saying: \"Get well soon!\" and some joker cards. Batman realizes that [[Harley Quinn]] had stolen the cure while the Dark Knight was distracted fighting Mr. Freeze. Mr. Freeze gives Batman freeze grenades to help him retrieve the cure and begs him to find Nora, which becomes a side mission in the game. After Nora is saved, Batman finds Mr. Freeze with his wife and tells him to end his life of crime for Nora's sake. Mr. Freeze's boss battle was widely praised as a step up from the repetitive titan thug bosses from the previous game.\n** In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', his origin and first encounter with Batman is featured in the DLC story \"Cold, Cold Heart\" which is based on the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode \"Heart of Ice\". Mr. Freeze also has a new design for the downloadable content (DLC), featuring cleated boots and a larger freeze gun built into the right arm of his suit. In the DLC, Mr. Freeze is in collaboration with the Penguin's gang in order to crash a party at Wayne Manor in order to capture Ferris Boyle. When Batman arrives at GothCorp, he finds Penguin trying to force Mr. Freeze to give him what Freeze is after (thinking it to be weapons) until Mr. Freeze uses his freeze gun to create a chain reaction that traps Penguin in a wall of ice. Upon getting the X-E suit to withstand the cold and acquiring a cryogenic drill to penetrate the ice wall, Batman finds residual evidence that Boyle was behind the accident that turned Victor Fries into Mr. Freeze and that Boyle is in possession of Mr. Freeze's cryogenically frozen wife. Batman later confronts and defeats Mr. Freeze. Boyle then takes a piece of machinery and attacks Mr. Freeze, only for Batman to knock out Boyle. During the DLC's credits, a news voiceover states that Mr. Freeze, Penguin, and Boyle have been all arrested by the police.\n** Mr. Freeze is featured in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''. Mr. Freeze's freeze gun can be found in the evidence room at the [[Gotham City Police Department]]. According to Aaron Cash, Mr. Freeze has not been seen or heard since ''Arkham City'' and implies that he possibly gave up his criminal life to continue his work on finding a cure for Nora Fries. There was also a mentioning that the freeze gun was used by some members of the Gotham City Police Department to make ice cream until it was confiscated from them by James Gordon. Mr. Freeze appears in the December \"Season of Infamy\" downloadable content (DLC) pack in the side mission \"In From The Cold\". Batman discovers a frozen vessel just off the coast of Gotham and investigates, finding Mr. Freeze at his wife's old cryogenic chamber. He says that the Arkham Knight's Militia took Nora after he refused to help Scarecrow and Arkham Knight with their plans to take down Batman. Freeze entrusts Batman to rescue his wife from the soldiers. After fighting through a barrage of Militia henchmen, Batman finds Nora and breaks her out of her damaged cryo-chamber. Much to both Batman and Freeze's surprise, she no longer wants to be frozen in ice and simply wants to spend time with Victor. It is also revealed that she could hear every word he said, despite being in suspended animation. After taking down a Militia force trying to destroy Fries' vessel, Nora and Victor meet face-to-face and Victor removes his protective helmet. As they look off at Gotham, Nora asks how long they will live, to which Victor replies \"merely days\". They then depart Gotham City; when Batman analyses Freeze's equipment in the GCPD lockup, a recording made by Cash ponders whether this turn of events is a happy or sad outcome for the Frieses.\n** Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in the mobile game ''Batman: Arkham Underworld''. He is unlocked after the player completes a mission for him, after which he becomes playable, wielding his freeze gun with different firing modes.\n\n===Web series===\n* In the third season of the [[Flash animation|Flash]] series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', a new villain is introduced: '''Dora Smithy''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]), Mr. Freeze's sister-in-law. She blames Freeze for Nora's death and dons his freezing equipment in a quest for revenge. As a result, there is an emphasis on Mr. Freeze himself throughout the season, and he is discussed several times, although he never actually makes an appearance.\n* In the ''[[Batman Unlimited]]'' shorts, Mr. Freeze appears on a rampage in a giant robot suit. Batman manages to destroy the suit and Freeze ejects. Freeze then attacks Batman, only for Batman to shatter his helmet. Batman puts a gas mask on him and handcuffs him, comforting Mr. Freeze until the cops arrive.\n* In ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'', Mr. Freeze (voiced by [[Alfred Molina]]) is first mentioned in season one, before making his first full appearance in the season two premiere, \"New Gotham\", as a member of the [[Injustice League]]. This version is depicted with a mohawk reminiscent of his New 52 counterpart and speaks with a [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]. Following the Joker's destruction Gotham in the season one finale, Mr. Freeze joined forces with Bane, Riddler, Penguin, and Two-Face to form the Injustice League and seize control. When Harley interferes with their plans, they attempt to make peace with her, but she refuses. In response, Freeze has her frozen and put on display in Penguin's Iceberg Lounge. Over the course of the following two months, Freeze and his allies divide Gotham's ruins between them and dub it \"New New Gotham\".\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* Mr. Freeze appears in the direct-to-video original animation ''[[DC Super Friends]]: The Joker's Playhouse'' (2010), voiced by [[Eric Bauza]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Batman Family adversaries]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Batman (comics)#Mr. Freeze|Mr. Freeze}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080512015349/http://batman.ugo.com/roguesgallery/mrfreeze/default.asp Mr. Freeze UGO profile]\n*{{gcdb|type=character|search=Mr.+Freeze|title=Mr. Freeze}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=1584|title=Mr. Freeze}}\n*{{DCdatabase|Mister Freeze}}\n\n{{Batman characters}}\n{{Batgirl}}\n{{Outsiders (comics)}}\n{{Robin}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Freeze, Mr.}}\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Batman characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Bob Kane]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1959]]\n[[Category:DC Comics metahumans]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:DC Comics television characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with ice or cold abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with slowed aging]]\n[[Category:Fictional chemical engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional cryonically preserved characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional life scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional matricides]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Male characters in film]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]]\n[[Category:Action film villains]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the comic book character|the ''Gotham'' episode|Mr. Freeze (Gotham episode)|the roller coaster|Mr. Freeze (roller coaster)}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|Fictional character throughout the DC Universe}}\n{{Infobox comics character\n| character_name = Mr. Freeze\n| image          = Mr. Freeze Batman Annual Vol 2 1.png\n| caption        = Mr. Freeze in ''Batman Annual'' #1 (July 2012).<br>Art by Jason Fabok.\n| real_name      = Victor Fries\n| publisher      = [[DC Comics]]\n| first_comic    = '''As Mr. Zero:'''<br/>''Batman'' #121 (February 1959)<br>'''As Mr. Freeze:'''<br>''[[Detective Comics]]'' #373 (March 1968)\n| first_series   = '''As Mr. Freeze:'''<br/>[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]<br/>\"[[Instant Freeze]]\"/\"[[Rats Like Cheese]]\"<br/>'''As Victor Fries:'''<br/>[[Batman: The Animated Series]]<br/>\"[[Heart of Ice (Batman: The Animated Series episode)|Heart of Ice]]\"\n| first_episode  = \n| creators       = '''As Mr. Zero''':<br/>Dave Wood (writer)<br/>[[Sheldon Moldoff]] (artist)<br/>[[Bob Kane]] (concept)<br/>'''As Victor Fries''':<br/>[[Paul Dini]] (writer)<br/>[[Bruce Timm]] (artist)\n| alliances      = [[Injustice League]]<br>[[Secret Society of Super Villains]]<br>GothCorp\n| aliases        = Mr. Zero<br>Dr. Schivel<br>Crown Prince of Chilblains<br>King of Cold\n| powers         = \n* Genius-level intellect\n* Sub-zero physiology allows survival at extremely low temperatures\n* Refrigerated [[Powered exoskeleton|exo-skeletal battle suit]] grants superhuman strength and durability\n* Utilizes [[cryogenic]] weaponry\n| cat            = super\n| subcat         = DC Comics\n| hero           = n\n| villain        = y\n}}\n\n'''Mr. Freeze''' ('''Dr. Victor Fries''') is a [[character (arts)|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book|American]] [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]].

Years later, his origin story was revamped to match the one conceived by writer [[Paul Dini]] for ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. Dr. Victor Fries was a [[cryogenics]] expert in [[Gotham City]] who was caught in a laboratory mishap while attempting to cure his terminally ill wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]]; the accident drastically lowered his body temperature to sub-zero levels, forcing him to wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive.

In college, he meets a woman named [[Nora Fries|Nora]], whom he ultimately marries.<ref name=\"UGO - Freeze\"/>\n\nNora contracts a fatal illness 1\u00bd years after Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, so Fries begins developing a freeze ray for [[List of locations of the DC Universe|GothCorp]] in order to preserve her in suspended animation until a cure can be found. Fries' boss Ferris Boyle decides to tell the mob about the gun, leading Batman to create a team of specialists to help him do his job better. As Fries puts Nora in suspended animation, Boyle interrupts and tampers with the experiment, resulting in an explosion that kills Nora. Fries survives, but the chemicals in the freeze ray lower his body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. He swears revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife (whom he talks to often), and becomes Mr. Freeze, the first superpowered villain whom Batman faces in this continuity. Eventually, Batman's operatives find Freeze, who shoots one of them with his freeze gun, but Batman eventually apprehends him.<ref name=\"UGO - Freeze\"/> Initially locked in [[Arkham Asylum]], Freeze was eventually transferred to the Gotham State Penitentiary, from where he escaped and attempted to steal technology from [[S.T.A.R.

Here, Victor Fries' fascination with cryonics began when he was a boy and his mother fell through the ice of a frozen lake. The ice was able to keep her preserved long enough for help to arrive, thus sparking his lifelong obsession with the cold. It is later revealed that the accident left Fries' mother in constant pain, and Fries ended her suffering by pushing her into the same frozen lake. In this new origin, Nora was never Fries' wife. Her name was Nora Fields, a woman born in 1943. When Nora was 23, she was diagnosed with incurable heart disease, so her family placed her in cryogenic stasis hoping that a cure would be found in the future. Fries, having written his doctoral thesis on Nora, took on a position as a cryogenic researcher and technician at Wayne Enterprises, the facility that housed Nora's body.\n\nEventually, he fell in love with Nora and became dedicated to finding a reliable method for slowly thawing cryogenic subjects. However, Bruce Wayne ordered the project to be shut down, as he began to feel uncomfortable with Fries' obsession with Nora. Furious, Fries hurled a chair at Wayne, who dodged the attack; the chair smashed into an array of cryonic chemical tanks, the contents of which sprayed onto Fries and transformed him into Mr. Freeze.<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Scott Snyder|Snyder, Scott]]|penciller=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|inker=[[Jason Fabok|Fabok, Jason]]|colorist=[[Peter Steigerwald|Steigerwald, Peter]]|letterer=[[Sal Cipriano|Cipriano, Sal]]|editor=[[Mike Marts|Marts, Mike]]|story=Night of the Owls: First Snow|title=[[Batman Annual]]|volume=2|issue=#1|date=July 2012|publisher=[[DC Comics]]|location=[[New York City]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Court of Owls uses Freeze's cryogenic-thaw formula to revive their Talons, and then they try to kill him.

In the film, Dr. Victor Fries was in an accident in a cryogenics lab he was using to find a cure for his wife Nora Fries suffering from the (fictional) [[terminal illness]] MacGregor's Syndrome and is now dependent on a [[diamond]]-powered sub-zero suit to keep cold or he would die. Mister Freeze crashes a charity event held by Wayne Enterprises and steals a diamond from the event. Mister Freeze is captured by Batman and detained at Arkham Asylum, but flees with the help of [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] and Bane. Ivy cuts off Nora's [[life support]] and deceives Mister Freeze into thinking that Batman was responsible for the deed as part of a plan to use him to freeze up Gotham City. With the use of a gigantic ray gun stationed in an observatory, he freezes over the entirety of Gotham. In a subsequent fight with Batman, Mr. Freeze destroys the observatory with a set of bombs (planted by Bane) in an unsuccessful attempt to take Batman with him. Batman shows Mr. Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl in which she brags about killing Nora, revealing her real colours to him. Batman tells Mr. Freeze that his wife is not dead; she was restored and moved to Arkham, where he can complete his research. Batman asks him for the cure he created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for [[Alfred Pennyworth]]; Mr. Freeze atones for his past actions by giving Batman the medicine he had developed. Freeze is then detained at Arkham where he exacts his revenge on Ivy for her deception and treachery. The character's penchant for cold- and ice-related puns was noted by critics.<ref>{{cite news |first=Janet |last=Maslin |authorlink=Janet Maslin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/batman-film-review.html |title=Batman and Robin |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=June 20, 1997|accessdate=May 23, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970620/REVIEWS/706200301 |title=Batman & Robin |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=June 20, 1997|accessdate=March 8, 2013}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] of ReelViews commented that \"Schwarzenegger, aside from looking like a cross between the [[Michelin Man]] and [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]], appears totally confused about what he's doing.

He was a Nobel prize-winning thermal expert who was part of [[Lex Luthor]]'s \"Project Fair Play\", a weapons program contingency that would be used to destroy the Justice League if necessary. Fries was measuring atmospheric carbon levels near the Arctic Circle before being murdered by a [[Metal Men|Metal Man]] designed by [[Will Magnus]] to frame [[Man-Bat|Batman]] for the crime.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman Unlimited: Mechs vs. Mutants]]'', voiced by [[Oded Fehr]]. His origin is above the same, except this version has banished himself to the Arctic because he believes that \"he's not fit for humanity.\" until he is employed by Penguin to mutate Killer Croc and Chemo into giant monsters and freeze Gotham for revenge. With their plan almost complete, Penguin betrays him by secretly giving Bane and Clayface the same formula without knowing. Now filled with guilt for what he's done, Freeze decided to help Batman and his team to stop Penguin.\n* Mr. Freeze made a cameo appearance in the 2016 animated film ''[[Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders]]'' (which is a continuation of the 1966 ''Batman'' TV series). This version resembles an orange-haired version of Eli Wallach's depiction of Mr. Freeze. He along with other supervillains team up with Robin and Catwoman in order to stop a group of clone rogue Batmen.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'', voiced by David Burrows. This version of Mr. Freeze resembles the one from ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and uses a robotic mech equipped with a freeze gun. He is among the Batman villains that assist Joker in his attack on Gotham City. At the time when Joker was planning to set off a bomb, Mr. Freeze was present during this plot where he fights Batman and retreats. Later on, during the ceremony where Barbara Gordon is being sworn in as the new police commissioner, Joker assigns Mr. Freeze and Clayface to capture her. Though Barbara Gordon does a trick that causes Mr. Freeze to accidentally freeze Clayface. During the fight against the Phantom Zone inmates, Mr. Freeze and Clayface defeat the [[Kraken]] from ''[[Clash of the Titans (franchise)|Clash of the Titans]]''.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', voiced by [[John DiMaggio]].

It is suggested that Mr. Freeze tortures the Riddler in Arkham as revenge for his treachery.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Robert Kraft]].{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} Freeze appears when the player, using a Villain character, is attempting to steal some diamonds from a Wayne Enterprises warehouse. Joker orders the player via communicator to give the diamonds to Freeze, only to later command him or her to go inside Freeze's base in Gotham Mercy Hospital and steal the diamonds back, right when Freeze is once again trying to bring back Nora and thus sabotaging the procedure. The villain player must then confront Mr. Freeze, who is enraged and willing to kill the player. Freeze also appears in the Arkham Asylum alert, where he has allied with Scarecrow and Poison Ivy to spread chaos in the Asylum, under doctor Jeremiah Arkham's orders. Freeze has taken over one of the wings in the asylum, covering the whole area with ice and snow.

Unlike most iterations of the character, his condition does not confine him entirely to the suit and he uses a specialized glove that freezes anything it touches, as opposed to the traditional freeze gun. Mr. Freeze is a member of the Pact, alongside [[Joker (character)|\"John Doe\"]], [[Riddler]], [[Bane (comics)|Bane]], and [[Harley Quinn]]. He joins the group to retrieve the LOTUS virus, hoping to use it to cure Nora. However, during the raid at the lab where it is kept, he is betrayed by Quinn and infected with the virus. In return for information about her whereabouts, Freeze asks Bruce Wayne/Batman to lower his confinement's temperature, hoping to combat his infection. Regardless of the decision, his fate is left ambiguous.\n\n====Lego====\n* Mr. Freeze appears ''[[Lego Batman: The Video Game]]'', with his vocal effects provided by [[Ogie Banks]].

In it his design is based mainly on the animated series and he uses his freeze gun to freeze enemies and water. The strength granted to him by his suit allows him to pick up objects others cannot. His suit also protects him from toxins. The Riddler assigns him to get a freeze cannon in his old factory. It is shown in the story that, while he aids the Riddler in his pursuit for Gotham City's gold reserves, he is shown to be formulating plans of his own, which involve raising an army of Freeze Maids, which he uses in his boss fight. The player has to be quick and attack him right after he shuts down his freeze gun. After he is defeated, he attempts to run away, but Batman throws a Batarang at him, causing his pack to backfire and make him bounce across the room and then land on the floor in front of Batman and [[Robin (character)|Robin]]. In the ending cutscene, he is seen in [[Arkham Asylum]] playing with dolls of him and a Freeze Maid.\n* Mr. Freeze appears in ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]]. He appears as a cameo in the fourth level \"Asylum Assignment\", where he is seen in a cell constantly tapping on the glass. In Free-play mode, the player can actually kill him once s/he sends one of the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin's]] bombs inside and attacks him. Outside of the story, he appears as a boss fight and an unlockable character found at the observatory. His intro catchphrase is, \"Is it just me, or is it really cold in here?\"\n* Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Liam O'Brien]] doing a terrible [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] impression. He first appears as a boss in the story, on which the player helps [[Plastic Man]] defeat him in the Watchtower so that they can proceed to defeat [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. The player as Batman in his Sensor-suit must attack Mr. Freeze while the character is in stealth mode. Mr. Freeze is later found in [[Qward]] in a side-quest where he requests the player to find another fuel cell for his freezer after the other was damaged by [[Killer Moth]].

According to the game's writer [[Paul Dini]], Freeze was originally planned to be featured in the game, but his inclusion was dropped as he did not fit as part of the game.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/6126146/Batman-Arkham-Asylum-interview-with-Paul-Dini.html | title=Batman: Arkham Asylum interview with Paul Dini| date=2009-09-02| last1=Cowen| first1=Nick}}</ref>\n** In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', he appears as both an ally to Batman and a [[boss battle]]. After the Joker poisons Batman, the Dark Knight has to find Mr. Freeze. Batman searches for him in the GCPD building (literally the coldest place in Arkham City), only to find his lab swarmed by the Penguin's men, who reveal that Penguin is holding Mr. Freeze hostage in the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute. It is revealed that Penguin stole Mr. Freeze's gun and is holding GCPD officers hostage. Batman saves the hostages and Mr. Freeze from Penguin's men in the museum and asks Mr. Freeze for the cure to his ailment, only for Mr. Freeze to reveal he needs his suit, which Penguin possesses. He tells Batman that his suit has a disruptor that can be used to turn off his freeze gun so that he can defeat Penguin. After Penguin is apprehended and Mr. Freeze recovers his suit, he gets revenge by locking Penguin in a display case. Mr. Freeze then tells Batman that the cure he made for Joker degenerates too quickly and needs a restorative enzyme that has been bonded to human DNA, something that would take decades, only for Batman to reveal he knows [[Ra's al Ghul|someone]] who has been exposed to that enzyme for centuries. Mr. Freeze tells Batman he only needs a sample of this person's DNA to complete the cure and Batman proceeds to track down one of the warriors of the [[League of Assassins]] Penguin had captured. When Batman returns to the GCPD with the blood sample, Mr. Freeze creates two vials of the cure before locking one in a safe and destroying the other, demanding Batman save [[Nora Fries]] from Joker. Batman fights Mr. Freeze to unlock the safe, which proves difficult as Mr. Freeze is much too powerful to be confronted directly. Batman is forced to hide and find ways to stun Mr. Freeze, such as using grates in the floor to surprise him as he passes by. Each time Mr. Freeze is incapacitated, he counteracts his weaknesses. After he is beaten, Batman opens the safe only to find that the wall behind the safe was broken into and in the place of the cure there is only a note saying: \"Get well soon!\" and some joker cards. Batman realizes that [[Harley Quinn]] had stolen the cure while the Dark Knight was distracted fighting Mr. Freeze. Mr. Freeze gives Batman freeze grenades to help him retrieve the cure and begs him to find Nora, which becomes a side mission in the game. After Nora is saved, Batman finds Mr. Freeze with his wife and tells him to end his life of crime for Nora's sake. Mr. Freeze's boss battle was widely praised as a step up from the repetitive titan thug bosses from the previous game.\n** In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', his origin and first encounter with Batman is featured in the DLC story \"Cold, Cold Heart\" which is based on the ''Batman: The Animated Series'' episode \"Heart of Ice\". Mr. Freeze also has a new design for the downloadable content (DLC), featuring cleated boots and a larger freeze gun built into the right arm of his suit. In the DLC, Mr. Freeze is in collaboration with the Penguin's gang in order to crash a party at Wayne Manor in order to capture Ferris Boyle. When Batman arrives at GothCorp, he finds Penguin trying to force Mr. Freeze to give him what Freeze is after (thinking it to be weapons) until Mr. Freeze uses his freeze gun to create a chain reaction that traps Penguin in a wall of ice. Upon getting the X-E suit to withstand the cold and acquiring a cryogenic drill to penetrate the ice wall, Batman finds residual evidence that Boyle was behind the accident that turned Victor Fries into Mr. Freeze and that Boyle is in possession of Mr. Freeze's cryogenically frozen wife. Batman later confronts and defeats Mr. Freeze. Boyle then takes a piece of machinery and attacks Mr. Freeze, only for Batman to knock out Boyle. During the DLC's credits, a news voiceover states that Mr. Freeze, Penguin, and Boyle have been all arrested by the police.\n** Mr. Freeze is featured in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]''. Mr. Freeze's freeze gun can be found in the evidence room at the [[Gotham City Police Department]]. According to Aaron Cash, Mr. Freeze has not been seen or heard since ''Arkham City'' and implies that he possibly gave up his criminal life to continue his work on finding a cure for Nora Fries. There was also a mentioning that the freeze gun was used by some members of the Gotham City Police Department to make ice cream until it was confiscated from them by James Gordon. Mr. Freeze appears in the December \"Season of Infamy\" downloadable content (DLC) pack in the side mission \"In From The Cold\". Batman discovers a frozen vessel just off the coast of Gotham and investigates, finding Mr. Freeze at his wife's old cryogenic chamber. He says that the Arkham Knight's Militia took Nora after he refused to help Scarecrow and Arkham Knight with their plans to take down Batman. Freeze entrusts Batman to rescue his wife from the soldiers. After fighting through a barrage of Militia henchmen, Batman finds Nora and breaks her out of her damaged cryo-chamber. Much to both Batman and Freeze's surprise, she no longer wants to be frozen in ice and simply wants to spend time with Victor. It is also revealed that she could hear every word he said, despite being in suspended animation. After taking down a Militia force trying to destroy Fries' vessel, Nora and Victor meet face-to-face and Victor removes his protective helmet. As they look off at Gotham, Nora asks how long they will live, to which Victor replies \"merely days\". They then depart Gotham City; when Batman analyses Freeze's equipment in the GCPD lockup, a recording made by Cash ponders whether this turn of events is a happy or sad outcome for the Frieses.\n** Mr. Freeze appears as a playable character in the mobile game ''Batman: Arkham Underworld''. He is unlocked after the player completes a mission for him, after which he becomes playable, wielding his freeze gun with different firing modes.\n\n===Web series===\n* In the third season of the [[Flash animation|Flash]] series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', a new villain is introduced: '''Dora Smithy''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]), Mr. Freeze's sister-in-law. She blames Freeze for Nora's death and dons his freezing equipment in a quest for revenge. As a result, there is an emphasis on Mr. Freeze himself throughout the season, and he is discussed several times, although he never actually makes an appearance.\n* In the ''[[Batman Unlimited]]'' shorts, Mr. Freeze appears on a rampage in a giant robot suit. Batman manages to destroy the suit and Freeze ejects. Freeze then attacks Batman, only for Batman to shatter his helmet. Batman puts a gas mask on him and handcuffs him, comforting Mr. Freeze until the cops arrive.\n* In ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'', Mr. Freeze (voiced by [[Alfred Molina]]) is first mentioned in season one, before making his first full appearance in the season two premiere, \"New Gotham\", as a member of the [[Injustice League]].
