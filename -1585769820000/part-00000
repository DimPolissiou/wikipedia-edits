There is an emotional and semantic difference between the verbs ''died'' and ''killed,'' and similarly between ''kill'' and ''murder''; ''murder'' evokes stronger negative emotions and connotes intent. In the context of the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]], various terminological issues arise. The terms \"disputed territories\" versus \"occupied territories\" reflect different positions on the legal status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The terms \"security fence\" and \"apartheid wall,\" \"neighbourhood\" and \"settlement,\" and \"militant,\" \"freedom fighter,\" and \"terrorist,\" while used to describe the same entities, present them in a different light and suggest a different narrative. Similarly, describing an attack or bombing as a \"response\" or \"retaliation\" again places the events in a different light.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the [[Six-Day War]] Israeli usage initially adopted the standard terminology of referring to the West Bank and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] as \"occupied territories\" (''ha-\u0161e\u1e6da\u1e25im ha-kevu\u0161im''). This was soon replaced by \"administered territories\" (''ha-\u0161e\u1e6da\u1e25im ha-mu\u1e25zaqim''). Finally, the West Bank area, excluding [[East Jerusalem]], was renamed \"[[Judea and Samaria Area|Judea and Samaria]]\" (''Yehudah we-\u0160omron'').{{sfn|Esposito|2014|p=539}} Over subsequent decades, U.S. media coverage, which initially described Israel's presence in either of the [[Palestinian territories]] as an \"occupation\", gradually dropped the word{{sfn|Tiripelli|2016|p=24}} and by 2001 it had become \"almost taboo\" in, and \"ethereal in its absence\" from, American reportage.{{efn|\"more than 90 percent of network TV reporting on the occupied territories has failed to report that the territories are occupied.\"{{sfn|Ackerman|2001|pp=61\u201362}}}} A poll of British newsreaders that same year found that only 9% were aware that Israel was the occupying power of Palestinian territories.{{sfn|Bishara|2008|p=496}} Israeli academic surveys at the time of [[Operation Defensive Shield]] (2002) also found that the Israeli public thought the West Bank revolt was evidence that Palestinians were trying, murderously, to wrest control of territories within Israel itself.{{sfn|Bar|Ben-Ari|2005|p=143}}\n\nSeveral studies have concluded that \"terminology bias\" has been a recurrent feature of coverage of the conflict,{{sfn|Tiripelli|2016|p=24}} and scholars and commentators like [[Yasir Suleiman]]{{efn|\"One of the most important aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict is the manipulation of terminology to create a ''linguistic map'' that conditions people's perceptions of the facts on the ground,\"{{sfn|Suleiman|2004|p=138}}}} and [[Peter Beinart]] argue that language manipulation plays an important role in endeavours to win over the international public, with some concluding that Israel has proven more adept in this battle.{{sfn|Suleiman|2004|p=138}}{{sfn|Whitaker|2001}} So too Greg Myre wrote of the rise of a \"verbal arms race\" where \"(m)uch of the Mideast conflict is about winning international support\", one which escalated with the onset of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]].{{sfn|Myre|2002}} [[Brian Whitaker]], reviewing 1,659 articles covering events in the [[The Guardian|Guardian]] and [[Evening Standard]] for this period (2000\u20132001), observed the same effects, adding that omission of important adjectives was notable: 66% failed to mention that the incidents took place in an occupied territory. [[Hebron]] was described as a divided city, though 99% of its inhabitants are Palestinian, whereas Israel describes Jerusalem as \"undivided\" though a third of its inhabitants are Palestinian. Likewise, Jews live in \"communities\", Palestinians in \"areas\".  In his view Israel had won the verbal war.{{sfn|Whitaker|2001}} East Jerusalem is not \"occupied\" or a cultural and spiritual centre for Muslims and Arabs for 14 centuries, but \"the eternal, indivisible capital of Israel\" and \"reunited\".{{sfn|Khalidi|2013|p=119}} In reporting the capture of [[Gilad Shalit]] on Israeli soil and his removal to the [[Gaza Strip]], and Israel's response of detaining 60 [[Hamas]] members, half [[Palestinian Legislative Council|Palestinian West Bank parliamentarians]], the former was said to have been ''kidnapped'' while the latter, seized from their beds in night raids and removed to Israeli prisons, were ''arrested''.{{sfn|Mendel|2008|p=30}} Beinart's article suggested there was a pattern of [[Orwellian]] \"linguistic fraud and a culture of euphemism\" in the way [[AIPAC]], for one, describes what takes place in the West Bank.{{efn|'To use the language of democracy to defend Israeli policy in the West Bank is linguistic fraud. Such fraud is necessary because to honestly defend the denial of democratic rights, for 46 years, to millions of people because they happen to be Palestinians and not Jews, would require language too coarse for the Upper West Side. It's an old story. \"Things like the continuance of British rule in India,\" Orwell wrote almost seventy years ago, \"can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.\"{{sfn|Beinart|2014}}}}\n\nIn Israeli newspaper reportage of violence, the IDF ''confirms'', or ''says'', while the Palestinians ''claim''.{{sfn|Mendel|2008|p=30}} The word \"violence\" itself connotes, according to Gershon Shafir, different events in Israeli and non-Israeli discourse: In the former, it is essentially dissociated from the 50 year long practice of occupying Palestinian lands and used to refer only to an intermittent recourse to military methods to contain episodic upsurges of hostile Palestinian resistance, a means employed when the security of an otherwise peaceful state is said to be at stake.{{efn|The Palestinian view is that Israel's insistence on negotiating a solution to its security concerns, extending to its settlements, is always formulated at the expense of Palestinian rights.{{sfn|Falk|1997|p=1}}}}  Thus, Israeli violence is restricted to responses to specific events like putting down the [[First Intifada|First]] and [[Second Intifada]]s, Israel's wars in Gaza and the [[2015\u20132016 wave of violence in Israeli-Palestinian conflict|Palestinian knifing attacks in 2015\u20132016]],{{efn|\"No name has yet been determined for this series of incidents. Options range from 'the silent intifada', the 'individual intifada', the 'children's intifada', the 'knives intifada', the 'Jerusalem intifada', and the 'third intifada'.\"{{sfn|Thrall|2017|p=155}}}} which were mainly the work of [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolves]].{{efn|\"While identifying the agents as lone wolves, Chorev argues that Palestinian social media were responsible for creating the climate from which they emerged.\"{{sfn|Chorev|2017|p=155}}}}\nShafir argues to the contrary that the occupation \"is best understood as ongoing, day-in and day-out coercion, and its injuries include material, psychological, social, and bodily harm\". And, he further claims, it is the coercive techniques of the institutions of occupation deployed to enforce submission that produce the occasional eruptions of \"military operations\" and wars. Violence is omnipresent reality for Palestinians, on the other hand, and found in all facets of the occupation. Consequently, he concludes, the most intense suppression of uprisings and wars cannot be considered in isolation from the occupation regime as an everyday experience.{{sfn|Shafir|2017|p=35}}\n\nSuch omissions and alterations in the terms used are cited as an example of the pervasive use of [[euphemism]]s or [[Loaded language|loaded terminology]] in reportage on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a problem which the [[International Press Institute]] thought sufficiently important by 2013 to issue a handbook to guide journalists through the semantic minefield.{{sfn|Hunt|2013}} What Palestinians call \"assassinations\" \u2013 the shooting of people suspected of terrorism \u2013 Israel first called \"pre-emptive strikes\", then \"pinpoint preventive operations\",{{efn|\"A long-time focus on pinpoint warfare against the PLO and its leaders had concealed the swelling rage of the Palestinian people from Israel's intelligence community and its politicians. The Israelis' tactical achievements and ability to locate and eliminate PLO leaders and militants nearly anywhere in the world had given them the sense that Israel could forever impose its rule over the millions of Palestinians in the occupied territories without consequence.\"{{sfn|Bergman|2018|p=309}}}} and also \"extrajudicial punishments\" or \"long-range hot pursuit\"{{sfn|Luft|2003}} until \"focused prevention\" was finally settled on.{{sfn|Myre|2002}}{{sfn|Bar|Ben-Ari|2005|p=143}} Offers to return \"occupied territory\" are \"(painful) concessions\"{{sfn|Perugini|2014|pp=54\u201355}} rather than a compliance with international law.{{sfn|Suleiman|2004|p=139}} For decades, Israeli announcements, speaking of arrests of children, never used the word \"child\". Even a 10-year-old shot by the IDF could be referred to as \"a young man of ten.\"{{sfn|Hajjar|2005|p=191}} The use of the term \"colonialism\" by [[New Historians]] to describe Zionist settlement, a term likening the process to the [[French conquest of Algeria|French colonization of Algeria]]{{efn|When the film [[The Battle of Algiers]] was played in Israel, one reviewer remarked:\"Any viewer who has served in the army in the West Bank will recognize the barb-wire barricades, the sullen Arab faces, the body searches, the frantic chases after shadowy suspects in narrow bazaar alleys and the officers telling reporters that with just a little more time and force the unrest will be quelled\". Ariel Sharon told [[Jacques Chirac]], \"Mr President. You must understand that for us here it is like Algeria. We have no other place to go and, besides, we have no intention of leaving.\"{{sfn|Daulatzai|2016|p=58}}}}  and the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Dutch settlement of South Africa]], has likewise been challenged,{{sfn|Aaronsohn|1996|pp=214\u2013229,215}} with some asserting that this is a [[Criticism of the Israeli government|demonizing term]] used in Palestinian textbooks.{{sfn|Groiss|Shaked|2017|pp=2,18\u201321}}\n\n[[Robert Fisk]] argues that the descriptive language used by major political players and the press to describe the occupation is one of \"[[Semantics|desemanticization]]\": occupied lands become \"disputed territories\"; colonies are described as \"settlements\", \"neighbourhoods\"{{efn|'Settlement conjures the idea of a virgin, unpopulated territory: an image of building log cabins in the wilderness...  \"Settlement\" also has a useful secondary sense \"agreement\", but Israeli settlements were deemed illegal by the UN Security Council and the International Court of justice...In 2002 attempts were made in the Israeli and US media to delete the shop-soiled euphemism \"settlements\" from the lexicon entirely and replace it with the even more euphemistic \"neighbourhoods\", where you indeed might expect to see white picket fences',{{sfn|Poole|2007|p=85}}}} \"suburbs\", \"population centres\"; dispossession and exile are referred to as \"dislocation\"/\"displacement\"; Israelis are shot by \"terrorists\" but when Palestinians are shot dead they die in \"clashes\"; the Wall becomes a \"fence\" or \"security barrier\". Suicide bombers for Palestinians are \"martyrs\" (''[[shahid]]'');{{sfn|Fisk|2018}}{{efn|\"Palestinians have called suicide bombers 'martyrs', or 'F-11s', a nickname that plays off the Palestinians' view that they don't have high-tech firepower like Israel's [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] warplanes.

In the latter regard, organizations like [[Campus Watch]] closely report and denounce what they consider \"anti-Israeli\" attitudes. In addition to Israel's [[Public diplomacy of Israel|hasbara organization]], intent on countering negative press images, there are also many private pro-Israeli organizations, among them [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America|CAMERA]], [[Facts and Logic About the Middle East|FLAME]], [[HonestReporting]],{{sfn|Beeson|2010|pp=184\u2013186}} [[Palestinian Media Watch]] and the [[Anti-Defamation League]]{{sfn|Gerstenfeld|Green|2004|pp=40\u201345}} which subject reportage to scrutiny in the belief news on Israel has systematically distorted reality to privilege Palestinian versions. In [[Ehud Barak]]'s view Palestinians are \"products of a culture in which to tell a lie..creates no dissonance\".{{sfn|Bishara|2008|p=492}}{{efn|The statement is contextualized within a general tradition, visible in the writings of many journalists and scholars, of [[Orientalism|orientalist put-downs of Arabs]] by Krishna, who quotes the full text.\"They (Palestinians) are products of a culture.. in which to tell a lie creates no dissonance. They don't suffer from the problem of telling lies that exists in Judeo-Christian culture.

Everything is based on appearances. Both parties, but in particular the Arabs, lie the whole day. You have to check their statements there on the spot.\"{{sfn|Gerstenfeld|Green|2004|p=34}}}}  The term [[Pallywood]] was coined to suggest that Palestinian coverage of their plight, in a genre called \"traumatic realism\", is marked by a diffuse intent to fraudulently manipulate the media, beginning with the killing of [[Muhammad al-Durrah incident|Mohammad Durrah]], and, it has been argued, still being evoked as late as 2014 to dismiss Israeli responsibility for the [[Beitunia killings]].{{sfn|Stein|2017b|p=562}} The idea has been dismissed as bearing the hallmarks of a \"[[conspiracy theory]]\".{{sfn|Lionis|2016|pp=89,211}} On the other hand, book-length studies have been devoted to testing the theory that the world's understanding of the conflict, though \"mediated by Israeli newspapers to a domestic audience\", is \"anti-Israel\".{{efn|M\u00fcller found the assumption attributed to Israeli media reportage that \"the whole world is against Israel\" was born out by a comprehensive methodological examination of Israeli sources: \"The reality mediated in Israeli newspapers indeed portrays an image of the world that is in large parts critical or even hostile towards the state of Israel, its actions and policies. Regardless of whether these portrayals correspond with a truth, media representations contribute to the perpetuation of such popular beliefs and sentiments, and in doing so may affect the conflict realities themselves\".{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2017|pp=18,240\u2013241}}}}Attempts have been made to silence several high-profile critics of Israeli policies in the territories, among them [[Tony Judt]], [[Norman Finkelstein]], [[Joseph Massad]], [[Nadia Abu El-Haj]] and [[William I.

The organization must monitor Western media coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Organizations which monitor Middle Eastern coverage of the conflict have been excluded, for the purposes of limiting the length of this list.\n2. The organization must monitor news for the purpose of revealing biases, with the intent of effecting change in reporting. Palestinian Media Watch and Middle East Media Research Institute which monitor for the purpose of revealing incitement to Western audiences have, thus, been excluded.\n3. The organization may focus on the Arab-Israeli conflict or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, specifically; however, the organization may monitor media coverage of a wide variety of topics, so long as the Arab-Israeli conflict is one such topic.\n4.

There is an emotional and semantic difference between the verbs ''died'' and ''killed,'' and similarly between ''kill'' and ''murder''; ''murder'' evokes stronger negative emotions and connotes intent. In the context of the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]], various terminological issues arise. The terms \"disputed territories\" versus \"occupied territories\" reflect different positions on the legal status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The terms \"security fence\" and \"apartheid wall,\" \"neighbourhood\" and \"settlement,\" and \"militant,\" \"freedom fighter,\" and \"terrorist,\" while used to describe the same entities, present them in a different light and suggest a different narrative. Similarly, describing an attack or bombing as a \"response\" or \"retaliation\" again places the events in a different light.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the [[Six-Day War]] Israeli usage initially adopted the standard terminology of referring to the West Bank and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] as \"occupied territories\" (''ha-\u0161e\u1e6da\u1e25im ha-kevu\u0161im''). This was soon replaced by \"administered territories\" (''ha-\u0161e\u1e6da\u1e25im ha-mu\u1e25zaqim''). Finally, the West Bank area, excluding [[East Jerusalem]], was renamed \"[[Judea and Samaria Area|Judea and Samaria]]\" (''Yehudah we-\u0160omron'').{{sfn|Esposito|2014|p=539}} Over subsequent decades, U.S. media coverage, which initially described Israel's presence in either of the [[Palestinian territories]] as an \"occupation\", gradually dropped the word{{sfn|Tiripelli|2016|p=24}} and by 2001 it had become \"almost taboo\" in, and \"ethereal in its absence\" from, American reportage.{{efn|\"more than 90 percent of network TV reporting on the occupied territories has failed to report that the territories are occupied.\"{{sfn|Ackerman|2001|pp=61\u201362}}}} A poll of British newsreaders that same year found that only 9% were aware that Israel was the occupying power of Palestinian territories.{{sfn|Bishara|2008|p=496}} Israeli academic surveys at the time of [[Operation Defensive Shield]] (2002) also found that the Israeli public thought the West Bank revolt was evidence that Palestinians were trying, murderously, to wrest control of territories within Israel itself.{{sfn|Bar|Ben-Ari|2005|p=143}}\n\nSeveral studies have concluded that \"terminology bias\" has been a recurrent feature of coverage of the conflict,{{sfn|Tiripelli|2016|p=24}} and scholars and commentators like [[Yasir Suleiman]]{{efn|\"One of the most important aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict is the manipulation of terminology to create a ''linguistic map'' that conditions people's perceptions of the facts on the ground,\"{{sfn|Suleiman|2004|p=138}}}} and [[Peter Beinart]] argue that language manipulation plays an important role in endeavours to win over the international public, with some concluding that Israel has proven more adept in this battle.{{sfn|Suleiman|2004|p=138}}{{sfn|Whitaker|2001}} So too Greg Myre wrote of the rise of a \"verbal arms race\" where \"(m)uch of the Mideast conflict is about winning international support\", one which escalated with the onset of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]].{{sfn|Myre|2002}} [[Brian Whitaker]], reviewing 1,659 articles covering events in the [[The Guardian|Guardian]] and [[Evening Standard]] for this period (2000\u20132001), observed the same effects, adding that omission of important adjectives was notable: 66% failed to mention that the incidents took place in an occupied territory. [[Hebron]] was described as a divided city, though 99% of its inhabitants are Palestinian, whereas Israel describes Jerusalem as \"undivided\" though a third of its inhabitants are Palestinian. Likewise, Jews live in \"communities\", Palestinians in \"areas\".  In his view Israel had won the verbal war.{{sfn|Whitaker|2001}} East Jerusalem is not \"occupied\" or a cultural and spiritual centre for Muslims and Arabs for 14 centuries, but \"the eternal, indivisible capital of Israel\" and \"reunited\".{{sfn|Khalidi|2013|p=119}} In reporting the capture of [[Gilad Shalit]] on Israeli soil and his removal to the [[Gaza Strip]], and Israel's response of detaining 60 [[Hamas]] members, half [[Palestinian Legislative Council|Palestinian West Bank parliamentarians]], the former was said to have been ''kidnapped'' while the latter, seized from their beds in night raids and removed to Israeli prisons, were ''arrested''.{{sfn|Mendel|2008|p=30}} Beinart's article suggested there was a pattern of [[Orwellian]] \"linguistic fraud and a culture of euphemism\" in the way [[AIPAC]], for one, describes what takes place in the West Bank.{{efn|'To use the language of democracy to defend Israeli policy in the West Bank is linguistic fraud. Such fraud is necessary because to honestly defend the denial of democratic rights, for 46 years, to millions of people because they happen to be Palestinians and not Jews, would require language too coarse for the Upper West Side. It's an old story. \"Things like the continuance of British rule in India,\" Orwell wrote almost seventy years ago, \"can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of the political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.\"{{sfn|Beinart|2014}}}}\n\nIn Israeli newspaper reportage of violence, the IDF ''confirms'', or ''says'', while the Palestinians ''claim''.{{sfn|Mendel|2008|p=30}} The word \"violence\" itself connotes, according to Gershon Shafir, different events in Israeli and non-Israeli discourse: In the former, it is essentially dissociated from the 50 year long practice of occupying Palestinian lands and used to refer only to an intermittent recourse to military methods to contain episodic upsurges of hostile Palestinian resistance, a means employed when the security of an otherwise peaceful state is said to be at stake.{{efn|The Palestinian view is that Israel's insistence on negotiating a solution to its security concerns, extending to its settlements, is always formulated at the expense of Palestinian rights.{{sfn|Falk|1997|p=1}}}}  Thus, Israeli violence is restricted to responses to specific events like putting down the [[First Intifada|First]] and [[Second Intifada]]s, Israel's wars in Gaza and the [[2015\u20132016 wave of violence in Israeli-Palestinian conflict|Palestinian knifing attacks in 2015\u20132016]],{{efn|\"No name has yet been determined for this series of incidents. Options range from 'the silent intifada', the 'individual intifada', the 'children's intifada', the 'knives intifada', the 'Jerusalem intifada', and the 'third intifada'.\"{{sfn|Thrall|2017|p=155}}}} which were mainly the work of [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolves]].{{efn|\"While identifying the agents as lone wolves, Chorev argues that Palestinian social media were responsible for creating the climate from which they emerged.\"{{sfn|Chorev|2017|p=155}}}}\nShafir argues to the contrary that the occupation \"is best understood as ongoing, day-in and day-out coercion, and its injuries include material, psychological, social, and bodily harm\". And, he further claims, it is the coercive techniques of the institutions of occupation deployed to enforce submission that produce the occasional eruptions of \"military operations\" and wars. Violence is omnipresent reality for Palestinians, on the other hand, and found in all facets of the occupation. Consequently, he concludes, the most intense suppression of uprisings and wars cannot be considered in isolation from the occupation regime as an everyday experience.{{sfn|Shafir|2017|p=35}}\n\nSuch omissions and alterations in the terms used are cited as an example of the pervasive use of [[euphemism]]s or [[Loaded language|loaded terminology]] in reportage on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a problem which the [[International Press Institute]] thought sufficiently important by 2013 to issue a handbook to guide journalists through the semantic minefield.{{sfn|Hunt|2013}} What Palestinians call \"assassinations\" \u2013 the shooting of people suspected of terrorism \u2013 Israel first called \"pre-emptive strikes\", then \"pinpoint preventive operations\",{{efn|\"A long-time focus on pinpoint warfare against the PLO and its leaders had concealed the swelling rage of the Palestinian people from Israel's intelligence community and its politicians. The Israelis' tactical achievements and ability to locate and eliminate PLO leaders and militants nearly anywhere in the world had given them the sense that Israel could forever impose its rule over the millions of Palestinians in the occupied territories without consequence.\"{{sfn|Bergman|2018|p=309}}}} and also \"extrajudicial punishments\" or \"long-range hot pursuit\"{{sfn|Luft|2003}} until \"focused prevention\" was finally settled on.{{sfn|Myre|2002}}{{sfn|Bar|Ben-Ari|2005|p=143}} Offers to return \"occupied territory\" are \"(painful) concessions\"{{sfn|Perugini|2014|pp=54\u201355}} rather than a compliance with international law.{{sfn|Suleiman|2004|p=139}} For decades, Israeli announcements, speaking of arrests of children, never used the word \"child\". Even a 10-year-old shot by the IDF could be referred to as \"a young man of ten.\"{{sfn|Hajjar|2005|p=191}} The use of the term \"colonialism\" by [[New Historians]] to describe Zionist settlement, a term likening the process to the [[French conquest of Algeria|French colonization of Algeria]]{{efn|When the film [[The Battle of Algiers]] was played in Israel, one reviewer remarked:\"Any viewer who has served in the army in the West Bank will recognize the barb-wire barricades, the sullen Arab faces, the body searches, the frantic chases after shadowy suspects in narrow bazaar alleys and the officers telling reporters that with just a little more time and force the unrest will be quelled\". Ariel Sharon told [[Jacques Chirac]], \"Mr President. You must understand that for us here it is like Algeria. We have no other place to go and, besides, we have no intention of leaving.\"{{sfn|Daulatzai|2016|p=58}}}}  and the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Dutch settlement of South Africa]], has likewise been challenged,{{sfn|Aaronsohn|1996|pp=214\u2013229,215}} with some asserting that this is a [[Criticism of the Israeli government|demonizing term]] used in Palestinian textbooks.{{sfn|Groiss|Shaked|2017|pp=2,18\u201321}}\n\n[[Robert Fisk]] argues that the descriptive language used by major political players and the press to describe the occupation is one of \"[[Semantics|desemanticization]]\": occupied lands become \"disputed territories\"; colonies are described as \"settlements\", \"neighbourhoods\"{{efn|'Settlement conjures the idea of a virgin, unpopulated territory: an image of building log cabins in the wilderness...  \"Settlement\" also has a useful secondary sense \"agreement\", but Israeli settlements were deemed illegal by the UN Security Council and the International Court of justice...In 2002 attempts were made in the Israeli and US media to delete the shop-soiled euphemism \"settlements\" from the lexicon entirely and replace it with the even more euphemistic \"neighbourhoods\", where you indeed might expect to see white picket fences',{{sfn|Poole|2007|p=85}}}} \"suburbs\", \"population centres\"; dispossession and exile are referred to as \"dislocation\"/\"displacement\"; Israelis are shot by \"terrorists\" but when Palestinians are shot dead they die in \"clashes\"; the Wall becomes a \"fence\" or \"security barrier\". Suicide bombers for Palestinians are \"martyrs\" (''[[shahid]]'');{{sfn|Fisk|2018}}{{efn|\"Palestinians have called suicide bombers 'martyrs', or 'F-11s', a nickname that plays off the Palestinians' view that they don't have high-tech firepower like Israel's [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] warplanes. 'We have F-11s', they say, wiggling their index and middle fingers simultaneously to approximate the legs of a suicide bomber walking toward a target.\"{{sfn|Myre|2002}}}} Israel prefers \"homicide bombers\".   Israel calls one of its uses of Palestinians as [[human shields]] a \"neighbour procedure\".{{sfn|Myre|2002}}{{efn|\"wherein the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) has forced Palestinians in the West Bank to enter houses that were thought to be booby-trapped or to approach houses where wanted men were thought to be hiding, in advance of the soldiers who sought to arrest them.\"{{sfn|Hoffnung|Weinshall\u2013Margel|2010|p=160}}}} If children are killed by Israeli fire, these events are often contextualized by the \"shop-worn euphemism\" (Fisk) of their being \"caught in the crossfire\".{{sfn|Ackerman|2001|p=65}} Deporting West Bankers to Gaza as collective punishment for families who have siblings that participated in terror incidents is known as an \"order limiting the place of residency\".{{sfn|Myre|2002}} Israeli military actions are customarily referred to as \"responses\" or \"retaliations\" to a Palestinian attack, even if it is Israel that strikes first.{{sfn|Whitaker|2001}}{{sfn|Tiripelli|2016|p=24}}\n\n===Media and academic coverage===\n{{main|Media coverage of the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict}}\nThe quality of both Media coverage of the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict and research and debates on university campuses have been the object of extensive monitoring and research. In the latter regard, organizations like [[Campus Watch]] closely report and denounce what they consider \"anti-Israeli\" attitudes. In addition to Israel's [[Public diplomacy of Israel|hasbara organization]], intent on countering negative press images, there are also many private pro-Israeli organizations, among them [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America|CAMERA]], [[Facts and Logic About the Middle East|FLAME]], [[HonestReporting]],{{sfn|Beeson|2010|pp=184\u2013186}} [[Palestinian Media Watch]] and the [[Anti-Defamation League]]{{sfn|Gerstenfeld|Green|2004|pp=40\u201345}} which subject reportage to scrutiny in the belief news on Israel has systematically distorted reality to privilege Palestinian versions. In [[Ehud Barak]]'s view Palestinians are \"products of a culture in which to tell a lie..creates no dissonance\".{{sfn|Bishara|2008|p=492}}{{efn|The statement is contextualized within a general tradition, visible in the writings of many journalists and scholars, of [[Orientalism|orientalist put-downs of Arabs]] by Krishna, who quotes the full text.\"They (Palestinians) are products of a culture.. in which to tell a lie creates no dissonance. They don't suffer from the problem of telling lies that exists in Judeo-Christian culture. Truth is seen as an irrelevant category\"{{sfn|Krishna|2009|p=135}}}}  Others allow that both sides lie, but \"Arabs\" are better at it.{{efn|\"The Arab countries are often dictatorships which exist thanks to lack of transparency. Everything is based on appearances. Both parties, but in particular the Arabs, lie the whole day.

The 140 kilometre long lake is formed by a dam on the [[Ili River]] which flows from the mountains in the east towards [[Lake Balkhash]] to the northwest. It is named after the town of [[Kapchagay]], which is located on its western bank. During the summer months the lake attracts a number of tourists from [[Almaty]], who frequent its beachy shores on the weekends.\n\nIn some parts of the Kapshagay reservoir, a coastal zone was created , which is now known as Kapshagay lake (* because of its impressive size (length 180 km, width 22 km, depth up to 50 m). It was created about 15 years (1965-1980) and is almost the largest artificial lake in [[Kazakhstan]].\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1967, an extension of irrigated areas began, and in 1970, the Kapchagay Reservoir, the largest reservoir in the region, began to fill. The lake is located some 80 km north of the old capital of Almaty. \n\nThe reservoir was created with the aim of regulating river flow and meeting growing economic demands. A dam and hydroelectric power plant were erected on the River Ili, creating the Kapchagay reservoir. However, the project took years to complete on account of the inadequacy of the water sources.\n\nIt was expected that the reservoir would be a major benefit to the arid soil in the region; however, the complete filling of the Kapchagay reservoir started to affect the water level in lake Balkhash. Filling of the reservoir discontinued in 1982. By 1986, Kapchagay reservoir was still only half full, this improved by 1988. Nevertheless, in 1991, the volume of Kapchagay reservoir was only 36% of the capacity originally projected.<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Patrick  |date=2007 |title=The Lakes Handbook: Lake Restoration and Rehabilitation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bibY60NWOlEC&pg=PA195&lpg=PA195&dq=Kapchagay+Lake&source=bl&ots=c75invglNT&sig=00hJw4y3-ZURdjpK7b2MecCkaXc&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_rZLOrqDYAhWnJcAKHUHkCqY4ChDoAQhNMAc#v=onepage&q=Kapchagay%20Lake&f=false |location= |publisher=Wiley |page= |isbn=0787689653\n}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the area has become one of the best-known resort destinations in Kazakhstan. This is largely due the area\u2019s scenery, which includes the Trans-Ili Alatau mountains (part of the northern Tien Shan mountain system), and the Almaty Nature Reserve on the reservoir\u2019s East coast. The Kapchagay lake has also become a popular resort on account of the area\u2019s good weather conditions, as well as its recreation spaces that include boating, catamarans, boats, jet skis, yachts, entertainment centers, and casinos. Kapchagay reservoir is currently one of the most visited places in the Almaty region.\n\nThe reservoir presently has multipurpose functions, serving for hydroelectricity production, irrigation storage, transport, fisheries, urban and industrial water supplies, regulation of water discharges to maintain water quality, for nature conservation and recreation. \n[[File:KZKapchagay1.JPG|thumb|center|900px]]\n\n==Environmental concerns==\n\n[[File:Lakebalkhashbasinmap.png|thumb|left|Map of the Lake Balkash basin.

Originally a nine-piece group, [[Jessica Jung|Jessica]] departed from the group in September 2014. One of the prominent figures of the [[Korean Wave]], the group has earned [[List of awards and nominations received by Girls' Generation|numerous accolades]] and the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|honorific nickname]] \"The Nation's Girl Group\" in their home country.\n\nGirls' Generation debuted in August 2007 with their [[Girls' Generation (2007 album)|eponymous Korean album]] and the single \"[[Into the New World (song)|Into the New World]]\". The group rose to fame in 2009 with the single \"[[Gee (Girls' Generation song)|Gee]]\", which claimed the top spot on [[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]]'s ''[[Music Bank (TV series)|Music Bank]]'' for a record-breaking nine consecutive weeks and was [[Melon (online music service)|Melon]]'s most popular song of the 2000s decade. Girls' Generation consolidated their popularity in South Korea with follow-up singles \"[[Tell Me Your Wish (Genie) (song)|Genie]]\", \"[[Oh! (Girls' Generation song)|Oh!]]\", and \"[[Run Devil Run (Girls' Generation song)|Run Devil Run]]\", which were released between mid-2009 and early 2010. Their second Korean studio album, ''[[Oh! (Girls' Generation album)|Oh!]]'' (2010), won the [[Golden Disc Awards|Golden Disc]] award for Album of the Year, making the group the only female act to win the grand prize so far.\n\nThe group ventured into the Japanese music scene in 2011 with their [[Girls' Generation (2011 album)|eponymous Japanese album]], which became the first album by a non-Japanese girl group to be certified [[List of music recording certifications|million]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan|RIAJ]]. The group's third Korean studio album, ''[[The Boys (Girls' Generation album)|The Boys]]'', was the best-selling album of 2011 in South Korea. An English version of the single \"[[The Boys (Girls' Generation song)|The Boys]]\" was released in an attempt to expand the group's endeavor to the global music scene. The group's fourth Korean studio album, ''[[I Got a Boy]]'' (2013), was supported by the [[I Got a Boy (song)|title track]], which won Video of the Year at the inaugural [[YouTube Music Awards]]. Girls' Generation released their fifth Korean studio album, ''[[Lion Heart (album)|Lion Heart]]'' in 2015, followed by ''[[Holiday Night]]'' in 2017.\n\nThe group's signature musical styles are characterized as [[electropop]] and [[bubblegum pop]], though their sounds have varied widely, incorporating various genres including [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]], and [[electronic dance music|EDM]]. In 2017, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] honoured Girls' Generation as the \"Top K-pop Girl Group of the Past Decade\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/7865168/best-k-pop-girl-groups-decade|accessdate=January 8, 2020|author=Tamar Herman |website=Billboard |date=July 12, 2017| title=10 Best K-Pop Girl Groups of the Past Decade: Critic's Picks}}</ref> They are the first Asian girl group to achieve five music videos with over 100 million views on [[YouTube]] with \"Gee\", \"I Got a Boy\", \"The Boys\", \"[[Mr. Taxi]]\", and \"Oh!\".

The group's third Korean studio album, ''[[The Boys (Girls' Generation album)|The Boys]]'', was the best-selling album of 2011 in South Korea.
