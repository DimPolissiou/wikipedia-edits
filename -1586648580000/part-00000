By tying thousands of balloons to his house, Carl, a convicted wife beater sets out to fulfill his dream to see the wilds of [[South America]] and complete a promise made to his late wife, Ellie. The film was directed by [[Pete Docter]] and co-directed by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]], who also wrote the film's screenplay, as well as the story with [[Tom McCarthy (director)|Tom McCarthy]], with music composed by [[Michael Giacchino]].\n\nDocter began working on the story in 2004, which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in [[Venezuela]] gathering research and inspiration.

Muntz. When Muntz is accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant exotic bird he says he discovered at Paradise Falls, he vows not to return until he captures one alive. One day, Carl befriends an extroverted girl named Ellie, also a Muntz fan. She shares her scrapbook with him and confides to Carl her desire to move her \"clubhouse\"&nbsp;\u2014 an abandoned house in the neighborhood&nbsp;\u2014 to a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls.\n\nCarl and Ellie grow up, marry, and live in the restored \"clubhouse\". After Ellie suffers a [[miscarriage]]<ref name=\"miscarriage\">{{cite web | first = John | last = Horn | url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/07/entertainment/ca-upmontage7 | title=A heartfelt film within a film in 'Up' |work=Los Angeles Times| date=June 7, 2009 | access-date=August 10, 2015 }}</ref> and they are told they cannot have a child, the couple remembers their childhood dream of visiting Paradise Falls. They save for the trip, but repeatedly have to spend the money on more pressing day-to-day needs. They nonetheless live a happy life. After retiring from their jobs at the local zoo, Carl buys plane tickets to Paradise Falls, but Ellie suddenly falls ill and dies.\n\nYears later in the present day, Carl still lives in the house by stubbornly [[holdout (real estate)|holding out]] while the neighborhood around him is being replaced by [[skyscraper]]s. When he accidentally injures a construction worker, the court deems him a public menace and orders him to move to a [[retirement home]]. However, Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie by turning his house into a makeshift [[airship]], using thousands of helium balloons saved from his old job as a balloon salesman. Russell, a young \"Wilderness Explorer\" who visits Carl so he can earn his final [[scout badge|merit badge]] for \"Assisting the Elderly\", becomes an accidental stowaway.\n\nThe flying house encounters a [[Cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]] storm and ends up high above South America. The house lands on a [[tepui]] opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. Russell encounters a tall colorful bird whom he names \"Kevin\", who is trying to gather food for her chicks. They then meet a [[Golden Retriever]] named Dug, who wears a special collar that allows him to speak, and who vows to take the bird to his master. The next day, they encounter a [[pack (canine)|pack]] of aggressive dogs led by Alpha, a [[Dobermann|Doberman Pinscher]], and are taken to their master, who turns out to be an elderly Charles Muntz. \n\nMuntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his [[Airship|dirigible]], where he explains to them that he is still desperately searching for the giant bird he promised to bring back, which is revealed to be of Kevin's species. Russell notes the bird's similarity to Kevin and Muntz becomes hostile, thinking they are attempting to capture the bird for themselves\u2014like many other visitors he implies to have killed. Realizing that Muntz has become insane, Carl and Russell flee with Kevin and Dug, but Muntz eventually captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath Carl's house. Carl saves the house, allowing Muntz to leave with Kevin, and Russell becomes upset at Carl's selfishness. The group finally arrive at Paradise Falls and park the house, where Carl sadly looks through Ellie's childhood scrapbook, only to find that she has filled in the supposedly blank pages with photos of their happy marriage, along with a final note thanking Carl for their \"adventure\" and encouraging him to move on from her death. \n\nReinvigorated, Carl goes outside to see Russell sailing off with some balloons and a [[leaf blower]] to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl lightens the house enough for him and Dug to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl and Dug manage to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug saddles Alpha with the [[Elizabethan collar|\"cone of shame\"]] and unexpectedly becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz furiously pursues them around the airship and further cripples the flying house, cornering Kevin, Dug, and Russell inside. When the three leap back onto the dirigible, Muntz leaps after them and inadvertently gets caught on some balloon lines, causing him to fall to his death. The house, having lost too many balloons to fly, descends out of sight through the clouds.\n\nCarl and Russell reunite Kevin with her chicks and fly the dirigible back home. Russell receives his \"Assisting the Elderly\" badge, and Carl presents Russell with the \"Ellie Badge\"&nbsp;\u2014 a grape soda bottle cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met. Carl, Russell, and Dug later sit together, eating ice cream and counting approaching cars like Russell used to do with his dad. Unbeknownst to Carl, the house has landed on the cliff beside Paradise Falls exactly where Ellie had pictured it, fulfilling Carl's promise.

The initial version featured a floating city on an alien planet populated with muppet-like creatures,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iml_slMLBUs#t=39m25s|title=PETE DOCTER - In Conversation With... - TIFF 2015|publisher=TIFF Originals|via=YouTube|date=June 19, 2015}}</ref> with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other. But the story just didn't seem to work properly, and Docter and Peterson realized that the most intriguing element was the isolation of the floating city. Yet the people living there would consist of a whole community, and were therefore not really isolated. So the whole city was stripped down to a single flying house with just a single occupant, where balloons replaced the magic which kept the floating city up. After that they got the idea to use an old person, and found the contrast between the elderly grumpy man and the happy balloons in Docter's drawing appealing, inspiring them to work out his backstory. The next concept introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but they decided this subplot was too distracting, and people would forgive the minor inconsistency.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Catmull|first1=Ed|last2=Wallace|first2=Amy|author-link1=Ed Catmull|author-link2=Amy Wallace|url=https://archive.org/details/creativityincove0000catm|url-access=registration|quote=Our tenth movie, Up.|title=Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration|date=April 8, 2014|publisher=[[Random House]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/creativityincove0000catm/page/148 148]\u201350|isbn=978-0812993011}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=bYJZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=%22Two+brothers+who+lived+in+a+mythical,+Muppet-like+world%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfhdixhZbmAhXqlosKHa_UDm0Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22Two%20brothers%20who%20lived%20in%20a%20mythical%2C%20Muppet-like%20world%22&f=false The Art of Up]</ref> Also, the biggest single influence on Up early on was [[The Station Agent]], by Tom McCarthy.<ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=Dny9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA120&dq=%22Muppety,+made-up+creatures+that+lived+on+a+made-up+planet%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimoLKG2vfmAhVM4KYKHYt4C8IQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22Muppety%2C%20made-up%20creatures%20that%20lived%20on%20a%20made-up%20planet%22&f=false On Animation: The Director's Perspective, Volum 2]</ref>\n\nDocter noted the film reflects his friendships with Disney veterans [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], [[Ollie Johnston]], and [[Joe Grant]] (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them).

However, they also wanted him to grow more flexible near the end of the film, transforming into an \"action hero\".\n\nA technical director worked out that to make Carl's house fly, he would require 23&nbsp;million balloons, but Docter realized that number made the balloons look like small dots. Instead, the balloons created were made to be twice Carl's size.

What Pete Docter wanted most importantly out of the music was the emotion, so Giacchino wrote a character theme-based score that producer Jonas Rivera thought enhanced the story. At the beginning of the movie, when young Carl is in the movie theater watching a newsreel about Muntz, the first piece of music heard is \"Muntz's Theme\", which starts out as a celebratory theme, and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears 70&nbsp;years later. \"Ellie's Theme\" is first heard when she is introduced as a little kid and plays several times during the film in different versions; for instance, during the sequence where Carl lifts his house with the balloons, the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement. Giacchino has compared the film to opera since each character has a unique theme that [[Thematic transformation|changes]] during a particular moment in the story.<ref name=\"allm\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r1590147 |title=Up <nowiki>[Original Score]</nowiki>|publisher=Allmusic.

The film centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen ([[Ed Asner]]) and an earnest boy named Russell ([[Jordan Nagai]]). By tying thousands of balloons to his house, Carl sets out to fulfill his dream to see the wilds of [[South America]] and complete a promise made to his late wife, Ellie. The film was directed by [[Pete Docter]] and co-directed by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]], who also wrote the film's screenplay, as well as the story with [[Tom McCarthy (director)|Tom McCarthy]], with music composed by [[Michael Giacchino]].\n\nDocter began working on the story in 2004, which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in [[Venezuela]] gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth.\n\n''Up'' was Pixar's first film to be presented in [[Disney Digital 3-D]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|title=Pixar moves on 'Up!' with its 10th movie|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-05-21-pixar-main_N.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=May 21, 2009|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}</ref> It was released on May 29, 2009, and opened the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]], becoming the first animated and 3-D film to do so.<ref>{{cite news|last=Horn|first=John|title=Pixar's 'Up!' to open Cannes Film Festival|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/awards/2009/03/pixars-up-to-op.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 19, 2009|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}</ref> The film grossed over $735 million, and received universal acclaim, with critics calling it one of the best animated films of all time.<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/06/12/100-best-animated-movies-all-time/696107002/</ref> Asner's vocal performance and Michael Giacchino's score were praised, as was the montage of Carl and his wife Ellie growing old together. The film won two [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], and was nominated for three more, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], making it the second animated film in history to receive such a nomination, following ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991).<ref name=\"oscar\">{{cite news|last=Hazlett|first=Courtney|title=Things looking 'Up' for best picture race|url=http://www.today.com/id/35196951|publisher=Today.com|date=February 2, 2010|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature film articles should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn the 1930s, shy eight-year-old Carl Fredricksen idolizes famous explorer Charles F. Muntz. When Muntz is accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant exotic bird he says he discovered at Paradise Falls, he vows not to return until he captures one alive. One day, Carl befriends an extroverted girl named Ellie, also a Muntz fan. She shares her scrapbook with him and confides to Carl her desire to move her \"clubhouse\"&nbsp;\u2014 an abandoned house in the neighborhood&nbsp;\u2014 to a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls.\n\nCarl and Ellie grow up, marry, and live in the restored \"clubhouse\". After Ellie suffers a [[miscarriage]]<ref name=\"miscarriage\">{{cite web | first = John | last = Horn | url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/07/entertainment/ca-upmontage7 | title=A heartfelt film within a film in 'Up' |work=Los Angeles Times| date=June 7, 2009 | access-date=August 10, 2015 }}</ref> and they are told they cannot have a child, the couple remembers their childhood dream of visiting Paradise Falls. They save for the trip, but repeatedly have to spend the money on more pressing day-to-day needs. They nonetheless live a happy life. After retiring from their jobs at the local zoo, Carl buys plane tickets to Paradise Falls, but Ellie suddenly falls ill and dies.\n\nYears later in the present day, Carl still lives in the house by stubbornly [[holdout (real estate)|holding out]] while the neighborhood around him is being replaced by [[skyscraper]]s. When he accidentally injures a construction worker, the court deems him a public menace and orders him to move to a [[retirement home]]. However, Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie by turning his house into a makeshift [[airship]], using thousands of helium balloons saved from his old job as a balloon salesman. Russell, a young \"Wilderness Explorer\" who visits Carl so he can earn his final [[scout badge|merit badge]] for \"Assisting the Elderly\", becomes an accidental stowaway.\n\nThe flying house encounters a [[Cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]] storm and ends up high above South America. The house lands on a [[tepui]] opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. Russell encounters a tall colorful bird whom he names \"Kevin\", who is trying to gather food for her chicks. They then meet a [[Golden Retriever]] named Dug, who wears a special collar that allows him to speak, and who vows to take the bird to his master. The next day, they encounter a [[pack (canine)|pack]] of aggressive dogs led by Alpha, a [[Dobermann|Doberman Pinscher]], and are taken to their master, who turns out to be an elderly Charles Muntz. \n\nMuntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his [[Airship|dirigible]], where he explains to them that he is still desperately searching for the giant bird he promised to bring back, which is revealed to be of Kevin's species. Russell notes the bird's similarity to Kevin and Muntz becomes hostile, thinking they are attempting to capture the bird for themselves\u2014like many other visitors he implies to have killed. Realizing that Muntz has become insane, Carl and Russell flee with Kevin and Dug, but Muntz eventually captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath Carl's house. Carl saves the house, allowing Muntz to leave with Kevin, and Russell becomes upset at Carl's selfishness. The group finally arrive at Paradise Falls and park the house, where Carl sadly looks through Ellie's childhood scrapbook, only to find that she has filled in the supposedly blank pages with photos of their happy marriage, along with a final note thanking Carl for their \"adventure\" and encouraging him to move on from her death. \n\nReinvigorated, Carl goes outside to see Russell sailing off with some balloons and a [[leaf blower]] to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl lightens the house enough for him and Dug to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl and Dug manage to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug saddles Alpha with the [[Elizabethan collar|\"cone of shame\"]] and unexpectedly becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz furiously pursues them around the airship and further cripples the flying house, cornering Kevin, Dug, and Russell inside. When the three leap back onto the dirigible, Muntz leaps after them and inadvertently gets caught on some balloon lines, causing him to fall to his death. The house, having lost too many balloons to fly, descends out of sight through the clouds.\n\nCarl and Russell reunite Kevin with her chicks and fly the dirigible back home. Russell receives his \"Assisting the Elderly\" badge, and Carl presents Russell with the \"Ellie Badge\"&nbsp;\u2014 a grape soda bottle cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met. Carl, Russell, and Dug later sit together, eating ice cream and counting approaching cars like Russell used to do with his dad. Unbeknownst to Carl, the house has landed on the cliff beside Paradise Falls exactly where Ellie had pictured it, fulfilling Carl's promise. The end credits show snapshots of Carl, Russell, and Dug happily enjoying life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Ed Asner]] as Carl Fredricksen: Docter and Rivera noted Asner's television alter ego, [[Lou Grant]], had been helpful in writing for Carl because it guided them in balancing likable and unlikable aspects of the curmudgeonly character.<ref name=\"slashvid\"/> When they met Asner and presented him with a model of his character, he joked, \"I don't look anything like that.\" (The appearance of Carl is meant to resemble [[Spencer Tracy]] as he appeared in his final film, ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]''.<ref name=\"exclaim\">{{cite news|last=Keast|first=James|title=Pixar Reveals Early Look At Up|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/pixar_reveals_early_look_at_up|accessdate=November 22, 2013|newspaper=Exclaim!|date=February 6, 2009}}</ref>) They tailored his dialogue for him, with short sentences and more [[consonant]]s, which \"cemented the notion that Carl, post-Ellie, is a disgruntled bear that's been poked awake during hibernation\".<ref name=time>{{cite news|last=Corliss|first=Richard|title=Up, Up and Away: Another New High for Pixar|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1896737,00.html|accessdate=November 22, 2013|newspaper=Time|date=May 28, 2009|authorlink=Richard Corliss}}</ref> In Colombia, unexpected publicity for the film was generated due to the uncanny similarity of Carl with Colombian ex-president [[Julio C\u00e9sar Turbay Ayala]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=\u00bfA qui\u00e9n se parece? |trans-title=Who does he look like? |work=Revista Semana |language= Spanish |date=May 23, 2009 |url= http://www.semana.com/gente/articulo/a-quien-parece/103378-3 |accessdate= June 14, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Cal (''sic'') Fredericksen y Julio C\u00e9sar Turbay |trans-title=Cal Fredricksen and Julio C\u00e9sar Turbay |work=La Silla Vac\u00eda |date=June 13, 2009 |url=http://galerias.lasillavacia.com/2397/pages/Julio-C%E9sar-Turbay-%96-Cal-Fredricksen.htm |accessdate=June 14, 2009 |language=Spanish }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n** Jeremy Leary as young Carl Fredricksen\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Charles F.

The initial version featured a floating city on an alien planet populated with muppet-like creatures,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iml_slMLBUs#t=39m25s|title=PETE DOCTER - In Conversation With... - TIFF 2015|publisher=TIFF Originals|via=YouTube|date=June 19, 2015}}</ref> with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other. But the story just didn't seem to work properly, and Docter and Peterson realized that the most intriguing element was the isolation of the floating city. Yet the people living there would consist of a whole community, and were therefore not really isolated. So the whole city was stripped down to a single flying house with just a single occupant, where balloons replaced the magic which kept the floating city up. After that they got the idea to use an old person, and found the contrast between the elderly grumpy man and the happy balloons in Docter's drawing appealing, inspiring them to work out his backstory. The next concept introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but they decided this subplot was too distracting, and people would forgive the minor inconsistency.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Catmull|first1=Ed|last2=Wallace|first2=Amy|author-link1=Ed Catmull|author-link2=Amy Wallace|url=https://archive.org/details/creativityincove0000catm|url-access=registration|quote=Our tenth movie, Up.|title=Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration|date=April 8, 2014|publisher=[[Random House]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/creativityincove0000catm/page/148 148]\u201350|isbn=978-0812993011}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=bYJZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=%22Two+brothers+who+lived+in+a+mythical,+Muppet-like+world%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfhdixhZbmAhXqlosKHa_UDm0Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22Two%20brothers%20who%20lived%20in%20a%20mythical%2C%20Muppet-like%20world%22&f=false The Art of Up]</ref> Also, the biggest single influence on Up early on was [[The Station Agent]], by Tom McCarthy.<ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=Dny9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA120&dq=%22Muppety,+made-up+creatures+that+lived+on+a+made-up+planet%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimoLKG2vfmAhVM4KYKHYt4C8IQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22Muppety%2C%20made-up%20creatures%20that%20lived%20on%20a%20made-up%20planet%22&f=false On Animation: The Director's Perspective, Volum 2]</ref>\n\nDocter noted the film reflects his friendships with Disney veterans [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], [[Ollie Johnston]], and [[Joe Grant]] (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them).

What Pete Docter wanted most importantly out of the music was the emotion, so Giacchino wrote a character theme-based score that producer Jonas Rivera thought enhanced the story. At the beginning of the movie, when young Carl is in the movie theater watching a newsreel about Muntz, the first piece of music heard is \"Muntz's Theme\", which starts out as a celebratory theme, and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears 70&nbsp;years later. \"Ellie's Theme\" is first heard when she is introduced as a little kid and plays several times during the film in different versions; for instance, during the sequence where Carl lifts his house with the balloons, the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement. Giacchino has compared the film to opera since each character has a unique theme that [[Thematic transformation|changes]] during a particular moment in the story.<ref name=\"allm\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r1590147 |title=Up <nowiki>[Original Score]</nowiki>|publisher=Allmusic.

The war party that succeeded in capturing the principal pa and taking prisoner the chief of the district was headed by \"Ki Maru\". His warriors, to show their appreciation of his prowess and the honour of the victory, acclaimed him \"Tau-maru-nui\", which means \"Maru the Great\", or \"Maru the Conqueror\", that name was taken for the district and has been used ever since.\"\n\n==History and culture==\n[[File:Taitua-taumaranui1885.jpg|thumb|300px|Taitua at Taumarunui in 1885.]]Taumarunui was originally a Maori settlement at the confluence of the Ongarue River with the Whanganui, important canoe routes linking the interior of the island with the lower Whanganui River settlements. Some places, notably the valley of the Pungapunga Stream, which joins the upper Whanganui near Manunui, were celebrated for the size and quality of totara, and large canoes were built there. The area is a border area between a number of iwi including [[Whanganui (iwi)|Whanganui]], [[Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto]] and [[Ngati Tuwharetoa|Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa]], who lived together in relative harmony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/T/Taumarunui/Taumarunui/en |title=TAUMARUNUI \u2013 Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\nLate in December 1843 [[George Selwyn (bishop of Lichfield)|Bishop Selwyn]] travelled from the district south of Taupo to a point on the Whanganui River about six miles downstream from Taumarunui and thence continued his journey to the coast by canoe. Towards the end of 1869 Te Kooti was at Taumarunui before his march through the western Taupo district to Tapapa. In the early 1880s the first surveys of the King Country commenced and by the early 1890s the Crown had begun the purchase of large areas of land.\n\nIn 1874 Alexander Bell set up a trading post, and became the first European settler. The town has a road called Bell Road.\n\nDuring the [[New Zealand Wars]] a resident named William Moffatt manufactured and supplied Maori with a coarse kind of gunpowder. He was afterwards expelled from the district. Despite warnings he returned in 1880, ostensibly to prospect for gold, and was executed.\n\nThe Whanganui River long continued to be the principal route serving Taumarunui. Traffic was at first by Maori canoe, but by the late 1880s regular steamship communication was established. Taumarunui Landing ([http://www.riverboats.homestead.com/files/Riverboat_Mix_06.jpg Image]) was the last stop on [[Alexander Hatrick]]'s steam boat service from Wanganui. The river vessels maintained the services between Wanganui and Taumarunui until the late 1920s, when the condition of the river deteriorated.\n\nLater Taumarunui gained importance with the completion of the [[North Island Main Trunk|North Island Main Trunk line]] in 1908\u201309 (celebrated in a ballad by [[Peter Cape]] about the [[Taumarunui Railway Station|station]] refreshment room). The line south of Taumarunui caused considerable problems due to the terrain, and has several high viaducts and the famous [[Raurimu Spiral]]. The [[Stratford\u2013Okahukura Line]] to [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]] connected just north of Taumarunui. In more recent times, the town's economy has been based on [[forestry]] and farming. It has gained in importance as a tourism centre, especially as an entry point for voyagers down the scenic Wanganui River and as the possessor of a high quality golf course.\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n====1800s====\n*  1862, 8/9 February \u2013 [[Coutts Crawford|James Coutts Crawford]] visits, was given a number of old songs and \"various accounts of the taniwha, one of whom we were told overthrew the [[Whangaehu River|Wangaehu]] bridge.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/recollectionstr00coutgoog |title=Recollections of travel in New Zealand and Australia : Crawford, James Coutts : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n* 1864 \u2013 Boundaries of the [[King Country]] drawn and European settlement is prohibited.<!-- \"Switching on the King Country\" - Hellen Reilly -->\n* 1869 \u2013 [[Te Kooti]] in Taumarunui.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TC18700118.2.32 |title=Papers Past \u2014 Colonist \u2014 18 January 1870 \u2014 IMPORTANT FROM WAIKATO |publisher=Paperspast.natlib.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n* 1871 \u2013 [[Thomas McDonnell]] in area following up on reports of gold.

It is on an [[alluvial plain]] set within rugged terrain on the upper reaches of the [[Whanganui River]], 65&nbsp;km south of [[Te Kuiti]] and 55&nbsp;km west of [[Turangi]]. It is under the [[jurisdiction]] of [[Ruapehu District]] and [[Manawat\u016b-Whanganui]] region.\n\nIts population is 4,503 (2013 census, this is down 11% from the 2006 census), making it the largest centre for a considerable distance in any direction. It is on [[New Zealand State Highway 4|State Highway 4]] and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] railway.\n\nThe name ''Taumarunui'' is reported to be the dying words of the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] chief Pehi Turoa \u2013 ''taumaru'' meaning screen and ''nui'' big, literally translated as Big Screen,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/maori-language-week/1000-maori-place-names|title=1000 M\u0101ori place names|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=6 August 2019}}</ref> being built to shelter him from the sun, or more commonly known to mean \u2013 \"The place of big shelter\".  There are also references to Taumarunui being known as large sheltered location for growing [[Sweet potato|kumara]].\n\nIn the 1980s publication ''Roll Back the Years'' there are some details on how Taumarunui got its name.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rollbacktheyears.co.nz/samples/vol1.pdf |format=PDF |page=9 |title=How Taumarunui got its name |accessdate=15 March 2009 |publisher=Roll Back the Years}}</ref> Extract: \"According to Frank T Brown, who wrote in the ''Taumarunui Press'' in 1926, the name Taumarunui is closely connected with the arrival of and conquering of that portion of the King Country by the Whanganui River natives during the 18th century . . . The war party that succeeded in capturing the principal pa and taking prisoner the chief of the district was headed by \"Ki Maru\". His warriors, to show their appreciation of his prowess and the honour of the victory, acclaimed him \"Tau-maru-nui\", which means \"Maru the Great\", or \"Maru the Conqueror\", that name was taken for the district and has been used ever since.\"\n\n==History and culture==\n[[File:Taitua-taumaranui1885.jpg|thumb|300px|Taitua at Taumarunui in 1885.]]Taumarunui was originally a Maori settlement at the confluence of the Ongarue River with the Whanganui, important canoe routes linking the interior of the island with the lower Whanganui River settlements. Some places, notably the valley of the Pungapunga Stream, which joins the upper Whanganui near Manunui, were celebrated for the size and quality of totara, and large canoes were built there. The area is a border area between a number of iwi including [[Whanganui (iwi)|Whanganui]], [[Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto]] and [[Ngati Tuwharetoa|Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa]], who lived together in relative harmony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/T/Taumarunui/Taumarunui/en |title=TAUMARUNUI \u2013 Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\nLate in December 1843 [[George Selwyn (bishop of Lichfield)|Bishop Selwyn]] travelled from the district south of Taupo to a point on the Whanganui River about six miles downstream from Taumarunui and thence continued his journey to the coast by canoe. Towards the end of 1869 Te Kooti was at Taumarunui before his march through the western Taupo district to Tapapa. In the early 1880s the first surveys of the King Country commenced and by the early 1890s the Crown had begun the purchase of large areas of land.\n\nIn 1874 Alexander Bell set up a trading post, and became the first European settler. The town has a road called Bell Road.\n\nDuring the [[New Zealand Wars]] a resident named William Moffatt manufactured and supplied Maori with a coarse kind of gunpowder. He was afterwards expelled from the district. Despite warnings he returned in 1880, ostensibly to prospect for gold, and was executed.\n\nThe Whanganui River long continued to be the principal route serving Taumarunui. Traffic was at first by Maori canoe, but by the late 1880s regular steamship communication was established. Taumarunui Landing ([http://www.riverboats.homestead.com/files/Riverboat_Mix_06.jpg Image]) was the last stop on [[Alexander Hatrick]]'s steam boat service from Wanganui. The river vessels maintained the services between Wanganui and Taumarunui until the late 1920s, when the condition of the river deteriorated.\n\nLater Taumarunui gained importance with the completion of the [[North Island Main Trunk|North Island Main Trunk line]] in 1908\u201309 (celebrated in a ballad by [[Peter Cape]] about the [[Taumarunui Railway Station|station]] refreshment room). The line south of Taumarunui caused considerable problems due to the terrain, and has several high viaducts and the famous [[Raurimu Spiral]]. The [[Stratford\u2013Okahukura Line]] to [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]] connected just north of Taumarunui. In more recent times, the town's economy has been based on [[forestry]] and farming. It has gained in importance as a tourism centre, especially as an entry point for voyagers down the scenic Wanganui River and as the possessor of a high quality golf course.\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n====1800s====\n*  1862, 8/9 February \u2013 [[Coutts Crawford|James Coutts Crawford]] visits, was given a number of old songs and \"various accounts of the taniwha, one of whom we were told overthrew the [[Whangaehu River|Wangaehu]] bridge.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/recollectionstr00coutgoog |title=Recollections of travel in New Zealand and Australia : Crawford, James Coutts : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n* 1864 \u2013 Boundaries of the [[King Country]] drawn and European settlement is prohibited.<!-- \"Switching on the King Country\" - Hellen Reilly -->\n* 1869 \u2013 [[Te Kooti]] in Taumarunui.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TC18700118.2.32 |title=Papers Past \u2014 Colonist \u2014 18 January 1870 \u2014 IMPORTANT FROM WAIKATO |publisher=Paperspast.natlib.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n* 1871 \u2013 [[Thomas McDonnell]] in area following up on reports of gold.

It was released on 13 November 1989 through [[Earache Records]] and was reissued with a second disc of previously unreleased material on 21 June 2010. The album is widely acclaimed by critics and is often cited as a landmark release in industrial metal; though not the genre's first release, ''Streetcleaner'' helped define what industrial metal would become.\n\nRecorded in three distinct sessions and partially refined from pre-Godflesh demos, ''Streetcleaner'' is a weighty, bleak album that blends [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] with [[industrial music]] by means of production-emphasised bass, distorted guitar and, most importantly, [[drum machine|machine percussion]]. Unlike many metal albums, guitar is employed to create screeching noise rather than discrete riffs, and the drums and bass are louder than is typical. ''Streetcleaner'' was supported by a series of concerts where Godflesh played alongside [[Napalm Death]], and it was on the North American leg of the tour that the band began to gain significant international traction.\n\nSince its release, ''Streetcleaner'' has received a number of accolades and has been performed in its entirety by Godflesh twice (once at [[Roadburn Festival#2011 edition|Roadburn Festival]], a recording of which was released as a [[Streetcleaner: Live at Roadburn 2011|live album]] in 2013). Many other metal bands have cited the album as particularly influential, including [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]], [[Fear Factory]] and [[Isis (band)|Isis]], and Godflesh frontman [[Justin Broadrick]] considers it one of his landmark releases. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named ''Streetcleaner'' the 64th greatest metal album of all time.\n\n==Background and recording==\nBefore performing as Godflesh, [[G. C. Green]] ([[bass guitar|bass]]) and [[Paul Neville (musician)|Paul Neville]] ([[guitar]]) played together in a band known as Fall of Because.<ref name=\"allmusic2\" /> That group, formed in 1982, were less overtly heavy than what they would become as Godflesh, drawing musical and aesthetic influence from bands like [[The Cure (band)|the Cure]].<ref name=\"vice1\" /> Future frontman [[Justin Broadrick]] (guitar, [[vocals]] and [[programming (music)|programming]]) joined Fall of Because in 1984 and introduced Green and Neville to [[Swans (band)|Swans]], [[Sonic Youth]] and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]].<ref name=\"vice1\" /> Inspired by the dissonance of this music, the group recorded a demo called ''Extirpate'' (1986).<ref name=\"allmusic2\" /> The songs \"Devastator\", \"Mighty Trust Krusher\", \"Life Is Easy\" and \"[[Merciless (EP)|Merciless]]\" were included on this demo, the first three of which would be rerecorded for ''Streetcleaner''.<ref name=\"notes4\" /> These early versions were eventually released on a wide scale in 1999 via the compilation album ''[[Life Is Easy]]''.<ref name=\"exclaim1\" />\n\n[[File:Alesis HR-16 modified.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A photograph of the model of drum machine used on ''Streetcleaner'' against a carpet background|An [[Alesis]] HR-16, the model of drum machine used for ''Streetcleaner''{{'s}} percussion]]\n\nShortly after Fall of Because dissolved in 1987, Broadrick and Green reconvened without Neville and, in April 1988, renamed the project Godflesh.<ref name=\"press1\" /> They released their debut [[Godflesh (EP)|self-titled EP]] on the independent label Swordfish later that year.<ref name=\"press1\" /> That EP, though described by critics as raw and unrefined, is considered one of the originating industrial metal releases and proved to be the foundation upon which ''Streetcleaner'' would fine-tune Godflesh's approach to the genre.<ref name=\"allmusic3\" /><ref name=\"allmusic5\" /><ref name=\"LA1\" /><ref name=\"allmusic1\" /> After the underground success of ''Godflesh'',<ref name=\"chart1\" /> the band played several shows across Europe and recorded a four-track EP titled ''Tiny Tears''.<ref name=\"digby1\" /> Before they could release the EP on Swordfish, Godflesh were acquired by [[Earache Records]], and [[Digby Pearson]], the label's head, urged the band to shelve the tracks and instead focus on putting out a complete studio album next.<ref name=\"digby1\" /> Broadrick and Green agreed and began recording ''Streetcleaner'' in May 1989 at Soundcheck in [[Birmingham]] and Square Dance in [[Derby]].<ref name=\"notes1\" />\n\nThe Birmingham sessions saw Broadrick and Green recording and mixing the first half of the album, while the Derby sessions (which yielded tracks six through ten) saw the temporary reincorporation of Neville into the band, this time as a second guitarist.<ref name=\"notes1\" /> ''Tiny Tears'' was appended to the end of CD versions of ''Streetcleaner'', resulting in the album including material from three separate sessions.<ref name=\"quietus1\" /> The entirety of the creative period was reinforced by an [[Alesis]] HR-16 [[drum machine]].<ref name=\"reader1\" /> This choice was at first made out of necessity since Broadrick could not play the beats he wanted acoustically (he described himself as \"[not] a great drummer\"),<ref name=\"reader1\" /> but he came to embrace machine percussion and consider it a defining feature of Godflesh.<ref name=\"MI1\" />{{rp|2}} ''[[Loudwire]]'' called the HR-16, specifically in regard to its use on ''Streetcleaner'', \"the most devastating drum machine ever employed\".<ref name=\"loudwire3\" /> In a retrospective interview, Broadrick described the release as \"one of the most alienating albums\" he had ever made and referred to it as the band's landmark record.<ref name=\"ST2\" />\n\n==Composition and style==\n{{quote box|width=27%|align=left\n|quote=\"The bass sound and texture, this is an integral part of the Godflesh sound.

Totally anti-everything. I couldn't come to terms with anything. It was all a struggle, and I just wanted to lash out at every target I possibly could\".<ref name=\"EPol1\" />\n\n''Streetcleaner'' begins with one of Godflesh's most well-known tracks, \"Like Rats\".<ref name=\"ST1\" /> The introduction of the song, and of the album at large, is a wall of [[audio feedback|feedback]].<ref name=\"revolverdoc\" /> After the brief noise introduction, \"Like Rats\" descends into an intense, scathing song with prominent percussion, driving bass and piercing guitar.<ref name=\"quietus1\" /> The screamed vocals, which ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'s'' Andy O'Connor called \"spine-chilling\" and \"some of the angriest verses laid to tape\",<ref name=\"CoS1\" /> are harsh and regularly noted for their punchy efficacy.<ref name=\"sputnik1\" /><ref name=\"treb1\" /> Eduardo Rivadavia of ''Loudwire'' called the song \"the genre standard\",<ref name=\"loudwire1\" /> ''[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel's]]'' Jonathan Horsley referred to it as \"anthemic\" and ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' described it as \"far-beyond-heavy\".<ref name=\"decibel6\" /><ref name=\"revolver2\" />\n\n{{listen\n| pos=right\n| filename      = Like_Rats_(1989)_clip.ogg\n| title         = \"Like Rats\"\n| description   = \"Like Rats\" is an example of the album's blend of industrial programming and heavy metal.\n| format        = [[Ogg]]\n| filename2     = Godflesh,_Dream_Long_Dead_(1989).ogg\n| title2        = \"Dream Long Dead\"\n| description2  = \"Dream Long Dead\" showcases the repetitive weight of the album.\n| format2       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\n''Streetcleaner''{{'s}} second track, \"Christbait Rising\", has been cited by several critics as another high point of the album,<ref name=\"allmusic1\" /><ref name=\"ST1\" /> and ''Decibel'' named it one of Godflesh's five best songs.<ref name=\"decibeltop\" /> While this track does feature a riff-heavy guitar [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]] in its latter segments, it is still dominated by machine drumming.<ref name=\"quietus1\" /> According to Broadrick, the song's beat was his attempt to copy a rhythmic break in \"[[Microphone Fiend]]\" (1988) by [[Eric B. & Rakim]].<ref name=\"70ykl\" /> Luca Cimarusti of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' described \"Christbait Rising\" by writing, \"it's one of my all-time favorite songs. Drum machines clank and scrape by, creating an eerie cyber-racket, while Broadrick and bassist G. Christian Green lay down impossibly heavy riffs on top. Broadrick's vocals\u2014guttural and processed to sound like some sort of gigantic monster\u2014make the whole thing sound like something out of a nightmare.\"<ref name=\"reader2\" /> \"Pulp\", the album's third track, is entirely built around a locked, repeating, uncomplicated drum loop;<ref name=\"quietus1\" /> Green and Broadrick play over the beats, which completely drive the track.<ref name=\"RVA1\" /> Because the percussion on \"Pulp\" features little to no changes over its running time, Godflesh occasionally performed extended versions of it where they simply allowed the machine to continue.<ref name=\"notes2\" /> \"Pulp\" and \"Christbait Rising\" were issued together as a [[promotional single]] in 1989.<ref name=\"christbait1\" />\n\n\"Dream Long Dead\" is ''Streetcleaner''{{'s}} fourth song. Much of the track puts the squealing guitar of Broadrick at the forefront, but significant portions of the second half descend into heavy, repeating percussive movements where all instruments double the drums. The sixth track, \"Head Dirt\", displays an unusual compositional structure, with the first half comprising a disjointed, jagged rhythmic loop and the latter half being almost entirely high-pitched guitar feedback.<ref name=\"wire1\" /> Those swelling waves of noise transition into \"Devastator\" and \"Mighty Trust Krusher\" (sometimes listed as two separate songs, sometimes listed as one combined track<ref name=\"notes1\" /><ref name=\"notes2\" />), the first composition on ''Streetcleaner'' from the recording sessions with Neville as a second guitarist and the first rerecorded remnants of the Fall of Because project.<ref name=\"notes4\" /><ref name=\"notes2\" /> This nine-minute stretch is dark, dismal and oppressive, with enigmatic, growled lyrics and sounds underlaid with [[sampling (music)|samples]] of voices.<ref name=\"quietus1\" /><ref name=\"notes2\" /> Ned Raggett of [[AllMusic]] considered it, along with \"Like Rats\" and \"Christbait Rising\", one of his favorite pieces on the album.<ref name=\"allmusic1\" />\n\nThe seventh track on ''Streetcleaner'', \"Life Is Easy\", is another holdover from the mid-eighties Fall of Because demos.<ref name=\"notes4\" /> Broadrick's and Neville's guitars clash and scrape against each other, creating eerie cacophony before the bass and drums kick in. The album's eighth song, its title track, begins with a sample of convicted [[serial killer]] [[Henry Lee Lucas]] speaking during an interrogation.<ref name=\"RVA1\" /><ref name=\"prop1\" /> \"Streetcleaner\" proper is one of the album's faster, more aggressive songs; as AllMusic's Stephen Cook describes, it \"pummel[s] the listener with [[jackhammer]] percussion and ultra-demonic vocals\",<ref name=\"allmusic7\" /> and Charlie Wood of ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' agreed, also calling the drumming similar to a jackhammer.<ref name=\"clash1\" /> \"Locust Furnace\" was originally designed as the album's closing track.<ref name=\"notes1\" /> The song itself is characterised by the drums and bass trading off with the vocals and guitar, and it concludes with Broadrick repeatedly shouting \"furnace\" as he grows gradually hoarser.<ref name=\"quietus1\" />\n\n===''Tiny Tears'' and the ''Godflesh'' reissue===\n{{Listen|filename=Dead Head (1989).ogg|title=\"Dead Head\"|description=\"Dead Head\" showcases the musical differences between ''Tiny Tears'' and ''Streetcleaner'' proper.}}\n\nThe four ''Tiny Tears'' bonus songs (the title track, \"Wound\", \"Dead Head\" and \"Suction\") are ''Streetcleaner''{{'s}} shortest pieces.<ref name=\"notes2\" /> Because they were recorded apart from the album, they are compositionally different, more focused on propulsive [[hard rock]] riffs and beats than the stark, industrial sterility of ''Streetcleaner'' proper.<ref name=\"BW1\" /> Broadrick employs clean singing rather than growls, and the tone of the songs has been called \"ethereal\".<ref name=\"quietus1\" /><ref name=\"justavis1\" /> Noel Gardner of ''[[The Quietus]]'' described the EP as a \"muscular, enveloping follow-up, and utterly worth hearing\".<ref name=\"quietus1\" /> \"Dead Head\", a frantic song with stretched vocals, even has a tone that [[Sputnikmusic]] described as almost optimistic.<ref name=\"sputnik1\" /> Digby Pearson considered \"Tiny Tears\" one of his favorite Godflesh songs,<ref name=\"digby1\" /> and \"Wound\" would be revisited by Godflesh multiple times on future releases.<ref name=\"allmusic8\" /> One such future release, Earache's 1990 reissue of the band's debut EP ''Godflesh'', featured two songs entitled \"Wounds\" and \"Streetcleaner 2\".<ref name=\"godflesh3\" /> Both are extended songs that have been manipulated and altered, something [[List of songs recorded by Godflesh|common]] for Godflesh. While \"Streetcleaner 2\" primarily builds upon and distorts \"Streetcleaner\", it also features deconstructed segments of \"Pulp\". It is one of Godflesh's earliest tracks to experiment with [[ambient music|ambient]] elements.<ref name=\"MM1\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Streetcleaner'' was released on 19 November 1989 through [[Earache Records]]. In the United States, it was released the following year in December and was part of Earache's first push into the American market; it was deemed a success.<ref name=\"choosde1\" /> While the vinyl and cassette versions contained ten songs, the CD release included the ''Tiny Tears'' EP as a set of bonus tracks.<ref name=\"notes1\" /> In April 2010, Broadrick remastered the album and compiled seventy minutes of extra material for a double-disc reissue that was released later that year on 21 June.<ref name=\"notes2\" /> The bonus disc contained original unreleased mixes of songs from the Soundcheck sessions, live recordings from 1990, rehearsals and demos of some ''Tiny Tears'' songs that Broadrick believed revealed melodies that had been lost in the original mixing process.<ref name=\"notes2\" /><ref name=\"wire1\" /> On all releases, the album's cover is a still frame of a hallucination scene from the 1980 [[Ken Russell]] film ''[[Altered States]]''.<ref name=\"reader1\" />\n\n===Live performances===\n[[File:Justin Broadrick Godflesh Roadburn.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Justin Broadrick playing guitar with Godflesh at the 2011 edition of Roadburn Festival|upright|[[Justin Broadrick]] performing ''Streetcleaner'' in 2011]]\n\nGodflesh toured Europe and North America in support of ''Streetcleaner'' from 1989 to 1991.<ref name=\"exclaim1\" /> Many of these shows were under the Grindcrusher Tour umbrella, which included fellow Earache acts [[Napalm Death]] and [[Nocturnus]].<ref name=\"press1\" /> By 1991 when Godflesh played in North America for the first time, the band was gaining \"unexpected success\" and \"a loyal following\".<ref name=\"exclaim1\" /> Neville performed with Godflesh during many of these shows, playing only on the songs which were recorded at the Derby ''Streetcleaner'' sessions.<ref name=\"thomptrev1\" /> On 27 August 1989, Godflesh performed a four-song [[John Peel#Peel sessions|Peel session]] for [[BBC Radio 1]].

It was released on 13 November 1989 through [[Earache Records]] and was reissued with a second disc of previously unreleased material on 21 June 2010. The album is widely acclaimed by critics and is often cited as a landmark release in industrial metal; though not the genre's first release, ''Streetcleaner'' helped define what industrial metal would become.\n\nRecorded in three distinct sessions and partially refined from pre-Godflesh demos, ''Streetcleaner'' is a weighty, bleak album that blends [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] with [[industrial music]] by means of production-emphasised bass, distorted guitar and, most importantly, [[drum machine|machine percussion]]. Unlike many metal albums, guitar is employed to create screeching noise rather than discrete riffs, and the drums and bass are louder than is typical. ''Streetcleaner'' was supported by a series of concerts where Godflesh played alongside [[Napalm Death]], and it was on the North American leg of the tour that the band began to gain significant international traction.\n\nSince its release, ''Streetcleaner'' has received a number of accolades and has been performed in its entirety by Godflesh twice (once at [[Roadburn Festival#2011 edition|Roadburn Festival]], a recording of which was released as a [[Streetcleaner: Live at Roadburn 2011|live album]] in 2013). Many other metal bands have cited the album as particularly influential, including [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]], [[Fear Factory]] and [[Isis (band)|Isis]], and Godflesh frontman [[Justin Broadrick]] considers it one of his landmark releases. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named ''Streetcleaner'' the 64th greatest metal album of all time.\n\n==Background and recording==\nBefore performing as Godflesh, [[G. C. Green]] ([[bass guitar|bass]]) and [[Paul Neville (musician)|Paul Neville]] ([[guitar]]) played together in a band known as Fall of Because.<ref name=\"allmusic2\" /> That group, formed in 1982, were less overtly heavy than what they would become as Godflesh, drawing musical and aesthetic influence from bands like [[The Cure (band)|the Cure]].<ref name=\"vice1\" /> Future frontman [[Justin Broadrick]] (guitar, [[vocals]] and [[programming (music)|programming]]) joined Fall of Because in 1984 and introduced Green and Neville to [[Swans (band)|Swans]], [[Sonic Youth]] and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]].<ref name=\"vice1\" /> Inspired by the dissonance of this music, the group recorded a demo called ''Extirpate'' (1986).<ref name=\"allmusic2\" /> The songs \"Devastator\", \"Mighty Trust Krusher\", \"Life Is Easy\" and \"[[Merciless (EP)|Merciless]]\" were included on this demo, the first three of which would be rerecorded for ''Streetcleaner''.<ref name=\"notes4\" /> These early versions were eventually released on a wide scale in 1999 via the compilation album ''[[Life Is Easy]]''.<ref name=\"exclaim1\" />\n\n[[File:Alesis HR-16 modified.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A photograph of the model of drum machine used on ''Streetcleaner'' against a carpet background|An [[Alesis]] HR-16, the model of drum machine used for ''Streetcleaner''{{'s}} percussion]]\n\nShortly after Fall of Because dissolved in 1987, Broadrick and Green reconvened without Neville and, in April 1988, renamed the project Godflesh.<ref name=\"press1\" /> They released their debut [[Godflesh (EP)|self-titled EP]] on the independent label Swordfish later that year.<ref name=\"press1\" /> That EP, though described by critics as raw and unrefined, is considered one of the originating industrial metal releases and proved to be the foundation upon which ''Streetcleaner'' would fine-tune Godflesh's approach to the genre.<ref name=\"allmusic3\" /><ref name=\"allmusic5\" /><ref name=\"LA1\" /><ref name=\"allmusic1\" /> After the underground success of ''Godflesh'',<ref name=\"chart1\" /> the band played several shows across Europe and recorded a four-track EP titled ''Tiny Tears''.<ref name=\"digby1\" /> Before they could release the EP on Swordfish, Godflesh were acquired by [[Earache Records]], and [[Digby Pearson]], the label's head, urged the band to shelve the tracks and instead focus on putting out a complete studio album next.<ref name=\"digby1\" /> Broadrick and Green agreed and began recording ''Streetcleaner'' in May 1989 at Soundcheck in [[Birmingham]] and Square Dance in [[Derby]].<ref name=\"notes1\" />\n\nThe Birmingham sessions saw Broadrick and Green recording and mixing the first half of the album, while the Derby sessions (which yielded tracks six through ten) saw the temporary reincorporation of Neville into the band, this time as a second guitarist.<ref name=\"notes1\" /> ''Tiny Tears'' was appended to the end of CD versions of ''Streetcleaner'', resulting in the album including material from three separate sessions.<ref name=\"quietus1\" /> The entirety of the creative period was reinforced by an [[Alesis]] HR-16 [[drum machine]].<ref name=\"reader1\" /> This choice was at first made out of necessity since Broadrick could not play the beats he wanted acoustically (he described himself as \"[not] a great drummer\"),<ref name=\"reader1\" /> but he came to embrace machine percussion and consider it a defining feature of Godflesh.<ref name=\"MI1\" />{{rp|2}} ''[[Loudwire]]'' called the HR-16, specifically in regard to its use on ''Streetcleaner'', \"the most devastating drum machine ever employed\".<ref name=\"loudwire3\" /> In a retrospective interview, Broadrick described the release as \"one of the most alienating albums\" he had ever made and referred to it as the band's landmark record.<ref name=\"ST2\" />\n\n==Composition and style==\n{{quote box|width=27%|align=left\n|quote=\"The bass sound and texture, this is an integral part of the Godflesh sound. People often say that the bass is so loud in Godflesh they'll barely find another band [like it]. And that's entirely intentional, obviously.\"|source=\u2014[[Justin Broadrick]] on the bass in Godflesh.<ref name=\"MI1\" />}}\n\nMusically, ''Streetcleaner'' was one of the earliest albums to merge [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[heavy metal music]].<ref name=\"allmusic3\" /><ref name=\"newmet1\" /><ref name=\"greenwood1\" /><ref name=\"mojo1\" /> It accomplishes such a fusion through combining programmed, repetitive drum machine loops with Green's overdriven bass and Broadrick's distorted guitar.<ref name=\"allmusic1\" /><ref name=\"eb1\" /> The vocals are sparse, guttural and bleak,<ref name=\"tribune1\" /> and, according to Peter Buckley's ''Rough Guide to Rock'', \"misanthropic\".<ref name=\"rough1\" /> Inspired by the harshness of early [[Swans (band)|Swans]] material,<ref name=\"allmusic1\" /><ref name=\"mojo1\" /> ''Streetcleaner'' has been noted for its extreme weight and crushing aggression.<ref name=\"terrorizer2\" /><ref name=\"NME1\" /> Unlike the music of [[Napalm Death]]'s 1987 album ''[[Scum (Napalm Death album)|Scum]]'', a release for which Broadrick provided guitar shortly before starting Godflesh,<ref name=\"allmusic4\" /> ''Streetcleaner'' is exceptionally slow,<ref name=\"rough1\" /> and the focus is placed on percussion and bass rather than vocals or traditional riffs.<ref name=\"RS1\" /><ref name=\"MM2\" /> The style of guitar playing has been described as abrasive and deliberately grating,<ref name=\"tribune1\" /><ref name=\"loudwire2\" /> and the album is laden with factory sounds, stiff mechanical beats and overwhelming washes of noise.<ref name=\"roy1\" /> Thematically, ''Streetcleaner''{{'s}} dismal tone was born from Broadrick's troubled upbringing and from the oppressive Birmingham environment.<ref name=\"decibelgrow\" /><ref name=\"metalsucks1\" /> About the album's desolate fury, he said, \"there is a pure nihilism in there. Totally anti-everything. I couldn't come to terms with anything. It was all a struggle, and I just wanted to lash out at every target I possibly could\".<ref name=\"EPol1\" />\n\n''Streetcleaner'' begins with one of Godflesh's most well-known tracks, \"Like Rats\".<ref name=\"ST1\" /> The introduction of the song, and of the album at large, is a wall of [[audio feedback|feedback]].<ref name=\"revolverdoc\" /> After the brief noise introduction, \"Like Rats\" descends into an intense, scathing song with prominent percussion, driving bass and piercing guitar.<ref name=\"quietus1\" /> The screamed vocals, which ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'s'' Andy O'Connor called \"spine-chilling\" and \"some of the angriest verses laid to tape\",<ref name=\"CoS1\" /> are harsh and regularly noted for their punchy efficacy.<ref name=\"sputnik1\" /><ref name=\"treb1\" /> Eduardo Rivadavia of ''Loudwire'' called the song \"the genre standard\",<ref name=\"loudwire1\" /> ''[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel's]]'' Jonathan Horsley referred to it as \"anthemic\" and ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' described it as \"far-beyond-heavy\".<ref name=\"decibel6\" /><ref name=\"revolver2\" />\n\n{{listen\n| pos=right\n| filename      = Like_Rats_(1989)_clip.ogg\n| title         = \"Like Rats\"\n| description   = \"Like Rats\" is an example of the album's blend of industrial programming and heavy metal.\n| format        = [[Ogg]]\n| filename2     = Godflesh,_Dream_Long_Dead_(1989).ogg\n| title2        = \"Dream Long Dead\"\n| description2  = \"Dream Long Dead\" showcases the repetitive weight of the album.\n| format2       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\n''Streetcleaner''{{'s}} second track, \"Christbait Rising\", has been cited by several critics as another high point of the album,<ref name=\"allmusic1\" /><ref name=\"ST1\" /> and ''Decibel'' named it one of Godflesh's five best songs.<ref name=\"decibeltop\" /> While this track does feature a riff-heavy guitar [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]] in its latter segments, it is still dominated by machine drumming.<ref name=\"quietus1\" /> According to Broadrick, the song's beat was his attempt to copy a rhythmic break in \"[[Microphone Fiend]]\" (1988) by [[Eric B. & Rakim]].<ref name=\"70ykl\" /> Luca Cimarusti of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' described \"Christbait Rising\" by writing, \"it's one of my all-time favorite songs. Drum machines clank and scrape by, creating an eerie cyber-racket, while Broadrick and bassist G. Christian Green lay down impossibly heavy riffs on top. Broadrick's vocals\u2014guttural and processed to sound like some sort of gigantic monster\u2014make the whole thing sound like something out of a nightmare.\"<ref name=\"reader2\" /> \"Pulp\", the album's third track, is entirely built around a locked, repeating, uncomplicated drum loop;<ref name=\"quietus1\" /> Green and Broadrick play over the beats, which completely drive the track.<ref name=\"RVA1\" /> Because the percussion on \"Pulp\" features little to no changes over its running time, Godflesh occasionally performed extended versions of it where they simply allowed the machine to continue.<ref name=\"notes2\" /> \"Pulp\" and \"Christbait Rising\" were issued together as a [[promotional single]] in 1989.<ref name=\"christbait1\" />\n\n\"Dream Long Dead\" is ''Streetcleaner''{{'s}} fourth song. Much of the track puts the squealing guitar of Broadrick at the forefront, but significant portions of the second half descend into heavy, repeating percussive movements where all instruments double the drums. The sixth track, \"Head Dirt\", displays an unusual compositional structure, with the first half comprising a disjointed, jagged rhythmic loop and the latter half being almost entirely high-pitched guitar feedback.<ref name=\"wire1\" /> Those swelling waves of noise transition into \"Devastator\" and \"Mighty Trust Krusher\" (sometimes listed as two separate songs, sometimes listed as one combined track<ref name=\"notes1\" /><ref name=\"notes2\" />), the first composition on ''Streetcleaner'' from the recording sessions with Neville as a second guitarist and the first rerecorded remnants of the Fall of Because project.<ref name=\"notes4\" /><ref name=\"notes2\" /> This nine-minute stretch is dark, dismal and oppressive, with enigmatic, growled lyrics and sounds underlaid with [[sampling (music)|samples]] of voices.<ref name=\"quietus1\" /><ref name=\"notes2\" /> Ned Raggett of [[AllMusic]] considered it, along with \"Like Rats\" and \"Christbait Rising\", one of his favorite pieces on the album.<ref name=\"allmusic1\" />\n\nThe seventh track on ''Streetcleaner'', \"Life Is Easy\", is another holdover from the mid-eighties Fall of Because demos.<ref name=\"notes4\" /> Broadrick's and Neville's guitars clash and scrape against each other, creating eerie cacophony before the bass and drums kick in. The album's eighth song, its title track, begins with a sample of convicted [[serial killer]] [[Henry Lee Lucas]] speaking during an interrogation.<ref name=\"RVA1\" /><ref name=\"prop1\" /> \"Streetcleaner\" proper is one of the album's faster, more aggressive songs; as AllMusic's Stephen Cook describes, it \"pummel[s] the listener with [[jackhammer]] percussion and ultra-demonic vocals\",<ref name=\"allmusic7\" /> and Charlie Wood of ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' agreed, also calling the drumming similar to a jackhammer.<ref name=\"clash1\" /> \"Locust Furnace\" was originally designed as the album's closing track.<ref name=\"notes1\" /> The song itself is characterised by the drums and bass trading off with the vocals and guitar, and it concludes with Broadrick repeatedly shouting \"furnace\" as he grows gradually hoarser.<ref name=\"quietus1\" />\n\n===''Tiny Tears'' and the ''Godflesh'' reissue===\n{{Listen|filename=Dead Head (1989).ogg|title=\"Dead Head\"|description=\"Dead Head\" showcases the musical differences between ''Tiny Tears'' and ''Streetcleaner'' proper.}}\n\nThe four ''Tiny Tears'' bonus songs (the title track, \"Wound\", \"Dead Head\" and \"Suction\") are ''Streetcleaner''{{'s}} shortest pieces.<ref name=\"notes2\" /> Because they were recorded apart from the album, they are compositionally different, more focused on propulsive [[hard rock]] riffs and beats than the stark, industrial sterility of ''Streetcleaner'' proper.<ref name=\"BW1\" /> Broadrick employs clean singing rather than growls, and the tone of the songs has been called \"ethereal\".<ref name=\"quietus1\" /><ref name=\"justavis1\" /> Noel Gardner of ''[[The Quietus]]'' described the EP as a \"muscular, enveloping follow-up, and utterly worth hearing\".<ref name=\"quietus1\" /> \"Dead Head\", a frantic song with stretched vocals, even has a tone that [[Sputnikmusic]] described as almost optimistic.<ref name=\"sputnik1\" /> Digby Pearson considered \"Tiny Tears\" one of his favorite Godflesh songs,<ref name=\"digby1\" /> and \"Wound\" would be revisited by Godflesh multiple times on future releases.<ref name=\"allmusic8\" /> One such future release, Earache's 1990 reissue of the band's debut EP ''Godflesh'', featured two songs entitled \"Wounds\" and \"Streetcleaner 2\".<ref name=\"godflesh3\" /> Both are extended songs that have been manipulated and altered, something [[List of songs recorded by Godflesh|common]] for Godflesh. While \"Streetcleaner 2\" primarily builds upon and distorts \"Streetcleaner\", it also features deconstructed segments of \"Pulp\".

Retrieved March 27, 2006. Excerpt: \"Fred was based on Dobie, Velma on Zelda, Daphne on Thalia and Shaggy on [[Maynard G. Krebs|Maynard]].\"</ref> ''[[Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!]]'' shows her birthday to be December 25 to create a personal conflict for her regarding Christmas overshadowing her birthday. But \"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\" indicates her birthday is in the middle of September because the gang gets back together for her birthday ghost hunting trip and the harvest moon appears later in the episode.\n\nAccording to ''[[Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes]]'', Daphne always wanted to be both a supermodel and a detective even as a child (the latter of which disappointed her parents). Her aspirations had an effect on her personal life as she was always late for dates whenever she went on mysteries with the gang; she and Fred deny the rumors that they are dating. Her father gave her and her friends the money to start off and, prior to buying the Mystery Machine, Daphne gave her parents gas money to drive them to where there were mysteries to be solved.\n\nTogether with her other teenage companions, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], [[Velma Dinkley]], [[Shaggy Rogers]], and Shaggy's Great Dane, Scooby-Doo, Daphne would engage in solving various mysteries. In the first series, Daphne was portrayed as the beautiful and enthusiastic but clumsy and danger-prone member of the gang (hence her nickname, \"Danger-prone Daphne\") who always follows her intuition. She serves as the [[damsel in distress]] and would occasionally get kidnapped, tied up, gagged, and then left imprisoned. But as the franchise went on, she became a stronger, more independent character, who could take care of herself.\n\nDuring the series' fourth incarnation, ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'', some of the episodes focused on Daphne. In the episode, \"Shiver and Shake, That Demon's a Snake\", Daphne buys an idol which is cursed by the snake demon. On the sailboat, the snake demon attacks Daphne and demands an idol to return. In the episode, \"The Scary Sky Skeleton\", Daphne is reunited with her old friend, Wendy.\n\nIn the episode, \"I Left My Neck in San Francisco\", Daphne becomes sick and she's unable to help the gang to solve the mystery about The Lady Vampire of the Bay. Due to the vampire's look, Daphne's unseen reflection in the mirror, the bat flying around Daphne's bed and herself returning to bed a little later, Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy are convinced that Daphne is a vampire. When the vampiress is revealed to be Lefty Callahan, Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy realize they made a mistake with suspecting Daphne and she is feeling well again.\n\nWhen the original Mystery Inc. group took a hiatus from the franchise in the 80s, Daphne was initially absent too, with the series focusing on the comedy antics of Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy. However, when the \"Whodunnit?\" aspect returned to the series with ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries]]'', Daphne returned, now an accomplished investigator assisted by Shaggy and the two dogs, investigating supernatural occurrences. She continued to help Scooby battle evil forces of the supernatural in the ''[[13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'' series.\n\nThe youthful Daphne portrayed in ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'' would commonly call upon her [[butler]], Jenkins, to do various tasks. The younger Daphne is shown (along with her parents) to not believe in ghost/monsters/supernatural (one of her catchphrases in that series was \"''There is no such thing as ghosts (monsters)!''), a trait she lacks outside the ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' series.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]]'', Daphne as an adult, had a very successful investigative TV series called ''Coast to Coast with Daphne Blake'' on a [[fiction]]al [[television channel|channel]] called \"Americana\", which the show had aired on for two seasons. The producer of the show was Fred Jones.\n\nThroughout the various incarnations of the character, there has been speculation that Daphne and Fred had an attraction toward each other. This is emphasized in many of the direct-to-video movies and the TV series ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]''. By the time of the second season, they are shown to be actively dating, showing more of his feelings toward Daphne. In the first live-action ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' movie, the two initially are just friends with but as the film progresses they begin to develop a romantic interest in each other and briefly kiss after saving Spooky Island. In the sequel ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'', they are in a relationship.\n\n==Performers==\n* [[Indira Stefanianna|Stefanianna Christopherson]] (1969\u20131970; ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' (season one))\n* [[Heather North]] (1970\u20131985, 1997, 2003; ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' (season two), ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', ''[[The Scooby-Doo Show]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy Doo]]'', ''[[The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show]]'', ''[[The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire]]'')\n* [[Kellie Martin]] (1988\u20131991; ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'')\n* [[Mary Kay Bergman]] (1998\u20132000; ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders]]'')\n* [[Grey DeLisle]] (2001\u2013present; all direct-to-video films and series since ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase]]'' and ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]''; ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCkwhd23S7Y |title=Harvey Birdman Season 1, Episode 3 |last=TV Shows |date=October 13, 2015 |via=YouTube}}</ref>)\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] (2002\u20132005; ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' and ''[[Robot Chicken]]'')\n* [[Emily Tennant]] (2004; ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' (young Daphne in a flashback sequence))\n* [[Adrienne Wilkinson]] (2004; ''Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed \u2013 The Video Game''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/video-games/Scooby-Doo-2-Monsters-Unleashed-The-Video-Game/ |title=Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed: The Video Game |website=Behind The Voice Actors}}</ref>)\n* [[Kate Melton]] (2009\u20132010; ''[[Scooby-Doo!

In ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]],'' ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost]],'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase]]'', she wore a purple and green three-piece suit with matching shoes. In ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders]]'', she wore a purple sleeveless shirt with pink shorts and purple trainers boots or shoes.\n\nAs a child, she wore a pink sweater, red skirt, and pink pantyhose with white [[go-go boot]]s. In ''[[The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'', she wore other purple and pink clothes. Some included a purple jumpsuit and a purple dress with a white belt. In ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'', she wears various outfits, but mostly a purple/pink dress with pink [[Fashion boot|knee high boots]].\n\n==Relatives==\nRelatives of Daphne, including her four identical sisters, shown during the series' run include:\n*'''George Robert Nedley Blake and Elizabeth Blake''': Daphne's parents.

Voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]].\n*'''Dawn''': Daphne's sister, a model.\n*'''Dorothy''': Daphne's sister, a race car driver.\n*'''Delilah''': Daphne's sister, in the Marine Corps.

First Frights]] and [[Scooby-Doo! and the Spooky Swamp]]\n*'''Anne Blake''': Daphne's younger cousin in [[Scooby-Doo (video game)|the Scooby-Doo video game]].\n*'''Thornton Blake V''': Daphne's uncle, owner of a Golf Course near [[Lake Erie]].\n\n'''Note''': Frank Welker, Kath Soucie, and Jennifer Hale voice the Blakes in ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' series, Vanessa Marshall voiced Danica in the ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]'' series and Grey DeLisle voiced Shannon in the film ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster]]'' (direct-to-DVD). Welker also voiced George on ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]''. The late voice actor [[Don Messick]] voiced two of Daphne's uncles: Matthew \"Matt\" Blake on ''[[The Scooby-Doo Show]]'' and John Maxwell on ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]''.\n\n==In other media==\nDaphne was portrayed by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] in the film ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' and voiced in the animated series ''[[Robot Chicken]]''. Her husband [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] played Fred in the same films.\n\nIn these movies, Daphne and Fred began a relationship in the first that followed on through the second. Unlike the previous incarnation of the character, Gellar's version of Daphne is trained in martial arts during Mystery Inc.'s 2-year-long departure in the first film, as she is tired of being a damsel in distress on every case that she is involved in with the gang. Coincidentally, this subversion of the damsel in distress to a strong female fighter almost mirrors Gellar's widely recognized role of the [[Buffy Summers|title character]] in the TV series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. Though in the first movie, she is captured by the masked wrestler Zarkos, she beats him in a fight at the end.\n\nDaphne is portrayed by [[Kate Melton]] in the third film ''[[Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins]]'' (released as a TV movie in 2009) and its sequel ''[[Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster]]'' (which premiered on October 16, 2010). These two movies are prequels to the first two live-action movies and show how the gang met while in high school. Daphne is the president of the drama club at Coolsville High School and the lead in the school musical. It is also revealed that she is the actual owner of the [[Mystery Machine]].\n\n[[Sarah Jeffery]] portrayed Daphne in the live-action film ''[[Daphne & Velma]]''. This film provided a different origin to how Daphne met the rest of the gang. In this film, Daphne is shown to have met Velma first, and the two of them started solving mysteries before meeting Fred, Shaggy and Scooby.\n\n[[Amanda Seyfried]] will voice the character for the upcoming theatrical animated film ''[[Scoob!]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2019/03/zac-efron-amanda-seyfried-scooby-doo-warner-bros-movie-casting-1202580895/|title=Warner Bros\u2019 Animated Scooby-Doo Finds Its Fred & Daphne In Zac Efron & Amanda Seyfried|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|work=Deadline|date=March 22, 2019|accessdate=March 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nMembers of the fanbase of the original ''Scooby-Doo'' speculated that Daphne and [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] had a romantic attraction to one another.<ref name=\"Brizz\">Breznican, Anthony. \"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F44F8711C29358C&p_feeld_direct-0=ocument_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Are hidden meanings present in the 'Scooby-Doo' movie?, Filmmakers and cast members say some hints are there, but won't be understood by children.]\" ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.

Her father gave her and her friends the money to start off and, prior to buying the Mystery Machine, Daphne gave her parents gas money to drive them to where there were mysteries to be solved.\n\nTogether with her other teenage companions, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], [[Velma Dinkley]], [[Shaggy Rogers]], and Shaggy's Great Dane, Scooby-Doo, Daphne would engage in solving various mysteries. In the first series, Daphne was portrayed as the beautiful and enthusiastic but clumsy and danger-prone member of the gang (hence her nickname, \"Danger-prone Daphne\") who always follows her intuition. She serves as the [[damsel in distress]] and would occasionally get kidnapped, tied up, gagged, and then left imprisoned. But as the franchise went on, she became a stronger, more independent character, who could take care of herself.\n\nDuring the series' fourth incarnation, ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'', some of the episodes focused on Daphne. In the episode, \"Shiver and Shake, That Demon's a Snake\", Daphne buys an idol which is cursed by the snake demon. On the sailboat, the snake demon attacks Daphne and demands an idol to return. In the episode, \"The Scary Sky Skeleton\", Daphne is reunited with her old friend, Wendy.\n\nIn the episode, \"I Left My Neck in San Francisco\", Daphne becomes sick and she's unable to help the gang to solve the mystery about The Lady Vampire of the Bay. Due to the vampire's look, Daphne's unseen reflection in the mirror, the bat flying around Daphne's bed and herself returning to bed a little later, Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy are convinced that Daphne is a vampire. When the vampiress is revealed to be Lefty Callahan, Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy realize they made a mistake with suspecting Daphne and she is feeling well again.\n\nWhen the original Mystery Inc. group took a hiatus from the franchise in the 80s, Daphne was initially absent too, with the series focusing on the comedy antics of Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy. However, when the \"Whodunnit?\" aspect returned to the series with ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries]]'', Daphne returned, now an accomplished investigator assisted by Shaggy and the two dogs, investigating supernatural occurrences. She continued to help Scooby battle evil forces of the supernatural in the ''[[13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'' series.\n\nThe youthful Daphne portrayed in ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'' would commonly call upon her [[butler]], Jenkins, to do various tasks. The younger Daphne is shown (along with her parents) to not believe in ghost/monsters/supernatural (one of her catchphrases in that series was \"''There is no such thing as ghosts (monsters)!''), a trait she lacks outside the ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' series.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]]'', Daphne as an adult, had a very successful investigative TV series called ''Coast to Coast with Daphne Blake'' on a [[fiction]]al [[television channel|channel]] called \"Americana\", which the show had aired on for two seasons. The producer of the show was Fred Jones.\n\nThroughout the various incarnations of the character, there has been speculation that Daphne and Fred had an attraction toward each other. This is emphasized in many of the direct-to-video movies and the TV series ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]''. By the time of the second season, they are shown to be actively dating, showing more of his feelings toward Daphne. In the first live-action ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' movie, the two initially are just friends with but as the film progresses they begin to develop a romantic interest in each other and briefly kiss after saving Spooky Island. In the sequel ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'', they are in a relationship.\n\n==Performers==\n* [[Indira Stefanianna|Stefanianna Christopherson]] (1969\u20131970; ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' (season one))\n* [[Heather North]] (1970\u20131985, 1997, 2003; ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' (season two), ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', ''[[The Scooby-Doo Show]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy Doo]]'', ''[[The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show]]'', ''[[The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire]]'')\n* [[Kellie Martin]] (1988\u20131991; ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'')\n* [[Mary Kay Bergman]] (1998\u20132000; ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders]]'')\n* [[Grey DeLisle]] (2001\u2013present; all direct-to-video films and series since ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase]]'' and ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]''; ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCkwhd23S7Y |title=Harvey Birdman Season 1, Episode 3 |last=TV Shows |date=October 13, 2015 |via=YouTube}}</ref>)\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] (2002\u20132005; ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' and ''[[Robot Chicken]]'')\n* [[Emily Tennant]] (2004; ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' (young Daphne in a flashback sequence))\n* [[Adrienne Wilkinson]] (2004; ''Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed \u2013 The Video Game''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/video-games/Scooby-Doo-2-Monsters-Unleashed-The-Video-Game/ |title=Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed: The Video Game |website=Behind The Voice Actors}}</ref>)\n* [[Kate Melton]] (2009\u20132010; ''[[Scooby-Doo!

In ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]],'' ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost]],'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase]]'', she wore a purple and green three-piece suit with matching shoes. In ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders]]'', she wore a purple sleeveless shirt with pink shorts and purple trainers boots or shoes.\n\nAs a child, she wore a pink sweater, red skirt, and pink pantyhose with white [[go-go boot]]s. In ''[[The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'', she wore other purple and pink clothes. Some included a purple jumpsuit and a purple dress with a white belt. In ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'', she wears various outfits, but mostly a purple/pink dress with pink [[Fashion boot|knee high boots]].\n\n==Relatives==\nRelatives of Daphne, including her four identical sisters, shown during the series' run include:\n*'''George Robert Nedley Blake and Elizabeth Blake''': Daphne's parents. In ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' they are named Barty Blake and Nan Blake. Voiced by [[Frank Welker]] and [[Kath Soucie]].\n*'''Daisy''': Daphne's sister, a doctor. Voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]].\n*'''Dawn''': Daphne's sister, a model.\n*'''Dorothy''': Daphne's sister, a race car driver.\n*'''Delilah''': Daphne's sister, in the Marine Corps. Voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]].\n*'''Uncle Matt Blake''': Daphne's uncle, a cattle [[rancher]].\n*'''John \"J.J.\" Maxwell''': Daphne's uncle, a movie director.\n*'''Olivia Dervy''': Daphne's aunt.\n*'''Jennifer''': Daphne's cousin.\n*'''Danica LaBlake''': Daphne's cousin, a famous [[France|French]] model.

Mystery Incorporated]]'' series, Vanessa Marshall voiced Danica in the ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]'' series and Grey DeLisle voiced Shannon in the film ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster]]'' (direct-to-DVD). Welker also voiced George on ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]''. The late voice actor [[Don Messick]] voiced two of Daphne's uncles: Matthew \"Matt\" Blake on ''[[The Scooby-Doo Show]]'' and John Maxwell on ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]''.\n\n==In other media==\nDaphne was portrayed by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] in the film ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' and voiced in the animated series ''[[Robot Chicken]]''. Her husband [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]] played Fred in the same films.\n\nIn these movies, Daphne and Fred began a relationship in the first that followed on through the second. Unlike the previous incarnation of the character, Gellar's version of Daphne is trained in martial arts during Mystery Inc.'s 2-year-long departure in the first film, as she is tired of being a damsel in distress on every case that she is involved in with the gang. Coincidentally, this subversion of the damsel in distress to a strong female fighter almost mirrors Gellar's widely recognized role of the [[Buffy Summers|title character]] in the TV series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. Though in the first movie, she is captured by the masked wrestler Zarkos, she beats him in a fight at the end.\n\nDaphne is portrayed by [[Kate Melton]] in the third film ''[[Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins]]'' (released as a TV movie in 2009) and its sequel ''[[Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster]]'' (which premiered on October 16, 2010). These two movies are prequels to the first two live-action movies and show how the gang met while in high school. Daphne is the president of the drama club at Coolsville High School and the lead in the school musical. It is also revealed that she is the actual owner of the [[Mystery Machine]].\n\n[[Sarah Jeffery]] portrayed Daphne in the live-action film ''[[Daphne & Velma]]''. This film provided a different origin to how Daphne met the rest of the gang. In this film, Daphne is shown to have met Velma first, and the two of them started solving mysteries before meeting Fred, Shaggy and Scooby.\n\n[[Amanda Seyfried]] will voice the character for the upcoming theatrical animated film ''[[Scoob!]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2019/03/zac-efron-amanda-seyfried-scooby-doo-warner-bros-movie-casting-1202580895/|title=Warner Bros\u2019 Animated Scooby-Doo Finds Its Fred & Daphne In Zac Efron & Amanda Seyfried|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|work=Deadline|date=March 22, 2019|accessdate=March 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nMembers of the fanbase of the original ''Scooby-Doo'' speculated that Daphne and [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] had a romantic attraction to one another.<ref name=\"Brizz\">Breznican, Anthony. \"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F44F8711C29358C&p_feeld_direct-0=ocument_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Are hidden meanings present in the 'Scooby-Doo' movie?, Filmmakers and cast members say some hints are there, but won't be understood by children.]\" ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]''.
