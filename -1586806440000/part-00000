In the early communist era of Yugoslavia, many homes were taken away from their owners in the Land Reform programs.

He's learned in school that Tito is the greatest man ever, and he daydreams about meeting him.

He is going to be sent home on a train, and as he waits, a girl who is friendly with him walks over to his side. All of the students join, leaving only Raja and Jasna opposing him. They finish the journey and arrive at Tito's childhood home, and Zoran is asked to give a speech. He corrects his poem by saying that he in fact does love his parents more than Tito, and stating that he doesn't even like Tito that much. \n\nThe film ends with a banquet where all of the kids get to meet Tito, but Zoran is disillusioned and doesn't really care to meet him.\n\n==Awards==\n*[[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|Silver Seashell]] for Best Director: Goran Markovi\u0107\n*[[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|Silver Seashell]] for juvenile acting: Dimitrije Vojnov\n\n==Cast==\n*Ilija Ba\u0161i\u0107 as first agent\n*[[Olja Be\u0107kovi\u0107]] as \u0110ura's mother\n*[[Voja Brajovi\u0107]] as [[Josip Broz Tito]]\n*Branimir Brstina as Strahinja\n*Milutin Dap\u010devi\u0107 as Kengur\n*[[Bogdan Dikli\u0107]] as uncle\n*[[Anica Dobra]] as mother\n*Ljiljana Dragutinovi\u0107 as aunt\n*Neboj\u0161a Dugali\u0107 as policeman\n*Du\u0161an Jak\u0161i\u0107 as second agent\n*[[Miki Manojlovi\u0107]] as father\n*[[Olivera Markovi\u0107]] as granny\n*[[Rade Markovi\u0107]] as grandpa\n*Jelena Mrdak as Ljilja\n*[[Dragan Nikoli\u0107]] as Gane's father\n*Uro\u0161 Nikoli\u0107 as \u0110ura\n*[[Lazar Ristovski]] as Raja\n*Goran Smigi\u0107 as Zoran's colleague\n*[[Milivoje Tomi\u0107]] as custos\n*Miodrag Tomovi\u0107 as Tito's adjutant\n*[[Vesna Trivali\u0107]] as teacher\n*[[Dimitrije Vojnov]] as Zoran\n*Milena Vukosav as Jasna\n*Jelena \u017divkovi\u0107 as Svetlana\n*Zarko Lausevic as Borko\n\n==Production==\nScenes depicting [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] were filmed on [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]], in Serbia, because the [[War in Croatia]] already started when the filming took place.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.b92.net/zivot/licni_prostor.php?yyyy=2013&mm=11&dd=16&nav_id=777930 | title=Goran Markovi\u0107: Uspeh korumpira, neuspeh \u010deli\u010di | publisher=[[B92]] | date=16 November 2013 | accessdate=10 December 2014 | author=Nje\u017ei\u0107, Tatjana |trans-title=Goran Markovi\u0107: Success Corrupts, Failure Makes You Stronger}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Yugoslav films]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{cite web | url=http://www.rts.rs/page/tv/ci/story/17/%D0%A0%D0%A2%D0%A1+1/1330370/%D0%A2%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE+%D0%B8+%D1%98%D0%B0.html | title=\u0422\u0438\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0458\u0430 | publisher=[[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]] | date=25 May 2013 | accessdate=10 December 2014 |trans-title=Tito and Me|language=Serbian}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0105602|title=Tito i ja}}\n\n{{Goran Markovi\u0107}}\n\n[[Category:1992 films]]\n[[Category:1990s comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Serbian-language films]]\n[[Category:Serbian films]]\n[[Category:Serbian comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1950s]]\n[[Category:Films set in Yugoslavia]]\n[[Category:Films set in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Films set in Croatia]]\n[[Category:Yugoslav films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Goran Markovi\u0107]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Josip Broz Tito]]\n[[Category:Yugoslav comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about Josip Broz Tito]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n  | name = \u0422\u0438\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0458\u0430<br>Tito i ja<br>Tito and me\n  | image = Tito_i_ja.jpg\n  | director = [[Goran Markovi\u0107 (film director)|Goran Markovi\u0107]]\n  | producer = [[Goran Markovi\u0107 (film director)|Goran Markovi\u0107]]<br>[[Zoran Masirevi\u0107]]<br>[[Michel Mavros]]<br>[[Zoran Tasi\u0107]]\n  | writer = [[Goran Markovi\u0107 (film director)|Goran Markovi\u0107]]\n  | starring  = [[Dimitrije Vojnov]]<br>[[Lazar Ristovski]]<br>[[Miki Manojlovi\u0107]]<br>[[Anica Dobra]]<br>[[Voja Brajovi\u0107]]\n  | music = [[Zoran Simjanovi\u0107]]\n  | cinematography = [[Radoslav Vladi\u0107]]\n  | editing = [[Snezana Ivanovi\u0107]]\n  | distributor = [[Kino International (company)|Kino International]]\n  | released = 1992\n  | runtime =  104 min.

He viewed the natural state of humanity as that which had existed prior to the [[fall of man]], in which slavery was non-existent; on those grounds, many commentators see him as rejecting Aristotle's claim that some people were naturally slaves, although it is a matter of controversy as to whether he fully rejected Aristotle's views on the matter.<ref name=\"KretzmannStump1993\">{{cite book|author1=Norman Kretzmann|author2=Eleonore Stump|title=The Cambridge Companion to Aquinas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fi4rA6LQN5sC&pg=PA226|date=28 May 1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43769-1|pages=222\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n==John Locke==\n[[John Locke]] discusses slavery in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise of Government]]''.

He sees this contradiction as ultimately unsolvable:\n<blockquote>Locke never addressed, much less resolved, this contradiction. On Afro-American slavery, silence seems to have been his principal bequest to posterity. Locke's silence is all the more difficult to fathom inasmuch as in the ''Two Treatises'' he developed a general theory and justification of slavery for captives taken in a just war ... I hope to show that this theory is woefully inadequate as an account of Afro-American slavery and, further, that ''Locke knew this'' ... Locke's silence about the Afro-American slave practices that he helped forward remains profoundly unsettling and poses one of the greatest problems for understanding Locke as a theorist and political actor<ref name=\"Farr1986\" /></blockquote>\nWhile Locke criticised slavery as \"so vile and miserable an estate of man\",<ref>{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=Two treatises of government|url=https://archive.org/details/twotreatisesofg00lockuoft|year=1821|publisher=Whitmore and Fenn, and C.

Proslavery arguments, on the other hand, positively promoted slavery and the slave trade\".

He argues that the debate over slavery is more accurately seen, not as something exclusively American, but as a debate occurring throughout the English-speaking world.<ref name=\"Tise1990\"/>\n\n===Abolitionism in the United States===\n{{main|Abolitionism in the United States}}\nUntil the middle of the 18th century, slavery was practiced with little challenge anywhere in the world.  For centuries philosophers as varied as [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[John Locke]] accepted slavery as part of a proper social system. However, across Europe through the last part of the 18th century there were intellectual antislavery arguments based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, as well as moral arguments (notably among [[Quakers]], in Great Britain and the United States) which questioned the legitimacy of slavery. Only in the [[American Revolution|American Revolutionary War]] era did slavery first become a significant social issue in North America.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 63-64</ref> In the North, beginning during the Revolution and continuing through the first decade of the next century, state by state emancipation was achieved by legislation or lawsuit<ref>African Americans and the End of slavery in Massachusetts http://www.masshist.org/endofslavery/index.php?id=54,</ref> although in the larger slaveholding states such as New York and Pennsylvania emancipation was gradual. By 1810, 75% of Northern slaves had been freed and virtually all were freed within the next generation.<ref>Kolchin (2003) p. 78</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the antislavery contention that slavery was both economically inefficient and socially detrimental{{how|date=August 2019}} to the country as a whole was more prevalent than philosophical and moral arguments against slavery.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 65-68</ref> In Virginia, as the economy shifted away from tobacco towards less labor-intensive wheat crops, more slaves were freed between 1783 and 1812 than any time until 1865.  There was the potential, in many Southern minds, for a relatively short transition away from slavery.  However this perspective rapidly changed as the worldwide demand for sugar and cotton from America increased and the [[Louisiana Purchase]] opened up vast new territories ideally suited for a plantation economy.<ref>Wilentz (2005) pp. 218-220</ref>\n\nOnly in the early 19th century did abolitionist movements gather momentum, and many countries abolished slavery in the first half of the 19th century. The increasing rarity of slavery, combined with an increase in the number of slaves caused by a boom in the cotton trade, drew attention and criticism to the [[Southern United States|Southern states']] continuation of slavery. Faced with this growing 'antislavery' movement, slaveholders and their sympathizers began to articulate an explicit defense of slavery.\n\n===Political proslavery===\n[[Image:JHHammond.jpg|thumb|left|189px|James Henry Hammond]]\nThe famous ''Mudsill Speech (1858)'' of [[James Henry Hammond]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]'s [[s:Slavery a Positive Good|Speech to the U.S. Senate (1837)]]  articulated the pro-slavery political argument during the period at which the ideology was at its most mature (late 1830s \u2013 early 1860s). These pro-slavery theorists championed a class-sensitive view of American antebellum society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=magining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref> They felt that the bane of many past societies was the existence of the class of the landless poor. Southern pro-slavery theorists felt that this class of landless poor was inherently transient and easily manipulated, and as such often destabilized society as a whole. Thus, the greatest threat to democracy was seen as coming from class warfare that destabilized a nation's economy, society, government, and threatened the peaceful and harmonious implementation of laws.\n\nThis theory supposes that there must be, and supposedly always has been, a lower class for the upper classes to rest upon: the metaphor of a [[mudsill theory]] being that the lowest threshold (mudsill) supports the foundation for a building. This theory was used by its composer, Senator and Governor James Henry Hammond, a wealthy Southern plantation owner, to justify what he saw as the willingness of the non-whites to perform menial work which enabled the higher classes to move civilization forward. With this in mind, any efforts for class or racial equality that ran counter to the theory would inevitably run counter to [[civilization]] itself.\n\nSouthern pro-slavery theorists asserted that slavery eliminated this problem by elevating all free people to the status of \"citizen\", and removing the landless poor (the \"mudsill\") from the political process entirely by means of enslavement. Thus, those who would most threaten economic stability and political harmony were not allowed to undermine a democratic society, because they were not allowed to participate in it. So, in the mindset of pro-slavery men, slavery was for protecting the common good of slaves, masters, and society as a whole.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=Imagining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=Lexington Book|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref>\n\nThese and other arguments fought for the rights of the propertied elite against what were perceived as threats from the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], lower classes, and non-whites to gain higher [[standards of living]]. The economic self-interest of slaveholders certainly played a role, as slaves represented a massive amount of wealth \u2013 at the time of the Civil War some historians estimate the over 20% of private wealth in the US was slaves.<ref>Piketty, Thomas. \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century.\" Harvard University Press, 2014 067443000X, 9780674430006</ref>  They saw the abolition of slavery as a threat to their powerful Southern economy: an economy that revolved almost entirely around the plantation system and was supported by the use of black slaves.\n\n===Proslavery Christians===\n{{Further|The Bible and slavery|Christian views on slavery|Curse of Ham|Curse and mark of Cain}}\nPassages in the [[Bible]] which justify and regulate the institution of slavery have been used as a justification for the keeping of slaves throughout history, and they have also been used as a source of guidance on how it should be done. Therefore, when abolition was proposed, many Christians spoke vociferously against it, citing the Bible's acceptance of slavery as 'proof' that it was part of the normal condition. [[George Whitefield]], who is famed for his sparking of the ''Great Awakening'' of American evangelicalism, campaigned, in the [[Province of Georgia]], for the legalisation of slavery,<ref name=Cashin>Edward J.

He bought enslaved Africans and put them to work on his plantation as well as at the [[Bethesda Orphanage]] which he established. [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], who played a major role in financing and guiding early Methodism, inherited these slaves and kept them in bondage.<ref name=Cashin/>\n\nIn both Europe and the United States many Christians went further, arguing that slavery was actually justified by the words and doctrines of the Bible.\n\n{{quote|[Slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God ... it is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] ... it has existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts.|[[Jefferson Davis]], President, [[Confederate States of America]]<ref>[Religious Tolerance. http://www.religioustolerance.org/sla_bibl.htm.

He argues that the debate over slavery is more accurately seen, not as something exclusively American, but as a debate occurring throughout the English-speaking world.<ref name=\"Tise1990\"/>\n\n===Abolitionism in the United States===\n{{main|Abolitionism in the United States}}\nUntil the middle of the 18th century, slavery was practiced with little challenge anywhere in the world.  For centuries philosophers as varied as [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[John Locke]] accepted slavery as part of a proper social system. However, across Europe through the last part of the 18th century there were intellectual antislavery arguments based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought, as well as moral arguments (notably among [[Quakers]], in Great Britain and the United States) which questioned the legitimacy of slavery. Only in the [[American Revolution|American Revolutionary War]] era did slavery first become a significant social issue in North America.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 63-64</ref> In the North, beginning during the Revolution and continuing through the first decade of the next century, state by state emancipation was achieved by legislation or lawsuit<ref>African Americans and the End of slavery in Massachusetts http://www.masshist.org/endofslavery/index.php?id=54,</ref> although in the larger slaveholding states such as New York and Pennsylvania emancipation was gradual. By 1810, 75% of Northern slaves had been freed and virtually all were freed within the next generation.<ref>Kolchin (2003) p. 78</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the antislavery contention that slavery was both economically inefficient and socially detrimental{{how|date=August 2019}} to the country as a whole was more prevalent than philosophical and moral arguments against slavery.<ref>Kolchin (2003) pp. 65-68</ref> In Virginia, as the economy shifted away from tobacco towards less labor-intensive wheat crops, more slaves were freed between 1783 and 1812 than any time until 1865.  There was the potential, in many Southern minds, for a relatively short transition away from slavery.  However this perspective rapidly changed as the worldwide demand for sugar and cotton from America increased and the [[Louisiana Purchase]] opened up vast new territories ideally suited for a plantation economy.<ref>Wilentz (2005) pp. 218-220</ref>\n\nOnly in the early 19th century did abolitionist movements gather momentum, and many countries abolished slavery in the first half of the 19th century. The increasing rarity of slavery, combined with an increase in the number of slaves caused by a boom in the cotton trade, drew attention and criticism to the [[Southern United States|Southern states']] continuation of slavery. Faced with this growing 'antislavery' movement, slaveholders and their sympathizers began to articulate an explicit defense of slavery.\n\n===Political proslavery===\n[[Image:JHHammond.jpg|thumb|left|189px|James Henry Hammond]]\nThe famous ''Mudsill Speech (1858)'' of [[James Henry Hammond]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]'s [[s:Slavery a Positive Good|Speech to the U.S. Senate (1837)]]  articulated the pro-slavery political argument during the period at which the ideology was at its most mature (late 1830s \u2013 early 1860s). These pro-slavery theorists championed a class-sensitive view of American antebellum society.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=magining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref> They felt that the bane of many past societies was the existence of the class of the landless poor. Southern pro-slavery theorists felt that this class of landless poor was inherently transient and easily manipulated, and as such often destabilized society as a whole. Thus, the greatest threat to democracy was seen as coming from class warfare that destabilized a nation's economy, society, government, and threatened the peaceful and harmonious implementation of laws.\n\nThis theory supposes that there must be, and supposedly always has been, a lower class for the upper classes to rest upon: the metaphor of a [[mudsill theory]] being that the lowest threshold (mudsill) supports the foundation for a building. This theory was used by its composer, Senator and Governor James Henry Hammond, a wealthy Southern plantation owner, to justify what he saw as the willingness of the non-whites to perform menial work which enabled the higher classes to move civilization forward. With this in mind, any efforts for class or racial equality that ran counter to the theory would inevitably run counter to [[civilization]] itself.\n\nSouthern pro-slavery theorists asserted that slavery eliminated this problem by elevating all free people to the status of \"citizen\", and removing the landless poor (the \"mudsill\") from the political process entirely by means of enslavement. Thus, those who would most threaten economic stability and political harmony were not allowed to undermine a democratic society, because they were not allowed to participate in it. So, in the mindset of pro-slavery men, slavery was for protecting the common good of slaves, masters, and society as a whole.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerome Hampton|first1=Gregory|title=Imagining Slaves and Robots in Literature, Film, and Popular Culture|date=2015|publisher=Lexington Book|isbn=978-0-7391-9146-0|page=25}}</ref>\n\nThese and other arguments fought for the rights of the propertied elite against what were perceived as threats from the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], lower classes, and non-whites to gain higher [[standards of living]]. The economic self-interest of slaveholders certainly played a role, as slaves represented a massive amount of wealth \u2013 at the time of the Civil War some historians estimate the over 20% of private wealth in the US was slaves.<ref>Piketty, Thomas. \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century.\" Harvard University Press, 2014 067443000X, 9780674430006</ref>  They saw the abolition of slavery as a threat to their powerful Southern economy: an economy that revolved almost entirely around the plantation system and was supported by the use of black slaves.\n\n===Proslavery Christians===\n{{Further|The Bible and slavery|Christian views on slavery|Curse of Ham|Curse and mark of Cain}}\nPassages in the [[Bible]] which justify and regulate the institution of slavery have been used as a justification for the keeping of slaves throughout history, and they have also been used as a source of guidance on how it should be done. Therefore, when abolition was proposed, many Christians spoke vociferously against it, citing the Bible's acceptance of slavery as 'proof' that it was part of the normal condition. [[George Whitefield]], who is famed for his sparking of the ''Great Awakening'' of American evangelicalism, campaigned, in the [[Province of Georgia]], for the legalisation of slavery,<ref name=Cashin>Edward J.

He bought enslaved Africans and put them to work on his plantation as well as at the [[Bethesda Orphanage]] which he established. [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], who played a major role in financing and guiding early Methodism, inherited these slaves and kept them in bondage.<ref name=Cashin/>\n\nIn both Europe and the United States many Christians went further, arguing that slavery was actually justified by the words and doctrines of the Bible.\n\n{{quote|[Slavery] was established by decree of Almighty God ... it is sanctioned in the Bible, in both Testaments, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] ... it has existed in all ages, has been found among the people of the highest civilization, and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts.|[[Jefferson Davis]], President, [[Confederate States of America]]<ref>[Religious Tolerance. http://www.religioustolerance.org/sla_bibl.htm.

The signal was [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] for 10 seconds and then processed by the computer, which took 2 seconds. Therefore, every 12 seconds the result for each frequency channel was outputted on the printout as a single character, representing the 10-second average intensity, minus the baseline, expressed as a [[dimensionless]] multiple of the signal's [[standard deviation]].<ref name=\"code\">{{cite web | first = Jerry | last = Ehman | title = Explanation of the Code \"6EQUJ5\" On the Wow!

The numbers 1 to 9 denote the correspondingly numbered intensities (from 1 to 9); intensities of 10 and above are indicated by a letter: \"A\" corresponds to intensities between 10 and 11, \"B\" to 11 to 12, and so on. The Wow! signal's highest measured value was \"U\" (an intensity between 30 and 31), that is thirty standard deviations above background noise.<ref name=\"npr\" /><ref name=\"code\" />\n\n=== Frequency ===\nJohn Kraus, the director of the observatory, gave a value of {{val|1420.3556|ul=MHz}} in a 1994 summary written for [[Carl Sagan]].<ref name=Kraus/> But Ehman in 1998 gives a value of {{val|1420.4556|.005|u=MHz}}, with detailed explanation.<ref name=\"Big Ear 97\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bigear.org/wow20th.htm|first=Jerry R.|last=Ehman|title=The Big Ear Wow!

If due to blue-shift, it would correspond to the source moving about {{cvt|10|km/s}} towards us.\n\n[[File:Wow signal spectrogram.svg|thumb|A [[heat map]] of the computer printout, giving a [[spectrogram]] of the beam; the Wow! signal appears as a bright spot in the lower left.]]\nAn explanation of the difference between Ehman's value and Kraus's can be found in Ehman's paper. An [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]], which became the first [[local oscillator]], was ordered for the frequency of {{val|1450.4056|u=MHz}}. However, the university's purchasing department made a [[typographical error]] in the order and wrote {{val|1450.5056|u=MHz}} (i.e., {{val|0.1|u=MHz}} higher than desired). The software used in the experiment was then written to adjust for this error. When Ehman computed the frequency of the Wow! signal, he took this error into account.\n\n=== Bandwidth ===\nThe Wow! signal was a [[narrowband]] emission: its [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was less than {{val|10|u=kHz}}. The Big Ear telescope was equipped with a receiver capable of measuring fifty {{val|10|u=kHz}}-wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a column of alphanumeric intensity values. The Wow! signal is essentially confined to one column.<ref name=\"Big Ear 97\"/>\n\n=== Time variation ===\nAt the time of the observation, the Big Ear radio telescope was only adjustable for [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] (or height above the horizon), and relied instead on the [[rotation of the Earth]] to scan across the sky. Given the speed of Earth's rotation and the spatial width of the telescope's observation window, the Big Ear could observe any given point for just 72 seconds.<ref name=Skeptoid>{{Skeptoid|id=4342|number=342|title=Was the Wow!

All these characteristics are present in the Wow! signal.<ref name=\"edn\">{{cite web | url=http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4394137/Big-Ear-receives--Wow--Signal--August-15--1977 | title=EDN Moments | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref><ref name=\"space_com\">{{cite news | url = http://www.bigear.org/shostak_wow_20021205.htm | first = Seth | last = Shostak | title = Interstellar Signal From the 70s Continues to Puzzle Researchers | publisher = Space.com | date = 2002-12-05 | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\n== Celestial location ==\n[[File:Wow! signal source.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The two regions of space in the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] from where the Wow! signal may have originated.

An [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]], which became the first [[local oscillator]], was ordered for the frequency of {{val|1450.4056|u=MHz}}. However, the university's purchasing department made a [[typographical error]] in the order and wrote {{val|1450.5056|u=MHz}} (i.e., {{val|0.1|u=MHz}} higher than desired). The software used in the experiment was then written to adjust for this error. When Ehman computed the frequency of the Wow! signal, he took this error into account.\n\n=== Bandwidth ===\nThe Wow! signal was a [[narrowband]] emission: its [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] was less than {{val|10|u=kHz}}. The Big Ear telescope was equipped with a receiver capable of measuring fifty {{val|10|u=kHz}}-wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a column of alphanumeric intensity values. The Wow! signal is essentially confined to one column.<ref name=\"Big Ear 97\"/>\n\n=== Time variation ===\nAt the time of the observation, the Big Ear radio telescope was only adjustable for [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] (or height above the horizon), and relied instead on the [[rotation of the Earth]] to scan across the sky. Given the speed of Earth's rotation and the spatial width of the telescope's observation window, the Big Ear could observe any given point for just 72 seconds.<ref name=Skeptoid>{{Skeptoid|id=4342|number=342|title=Was the Wow!

All these characteristics are present in the Wow! signal.<ref name=\"edn\">{{cite web | url=http://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4394137/Big-Ear-receives--Wow--Signal--August-15--1977 | title=EDN Moments | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref><ref name=\"space_com\">{{cite news | url = http://www.bigear.org/shostak_wow_20021205.htm | first = Seth | last = Shostak | title = Interstellar Signal From the 70s Continues to Puzzle Researchers | publisher = Space.com | date = 2002-12-05 | accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\n== Celestial location ==\n[[File:Wow! signal source.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The two regions of space in the constellation [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] from where the Wow! signal may have originated.

These influences, along with the liberal environment of [[Greenwich Village]], served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.\n\nVery few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s. Those that did were often bars, although bar owners and managers were rarely gay.

Police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, but officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn. Tensions between [[New York City Police Department|New York City police]] and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening, and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents quickly organized into activist groups to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gay men and lesbians to be open about their [[sexual orientation]] without fear of being arrested.\n\nAfter the Stonewall riots, gay men and lesbians in New York City faced gender, race, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gay men and lesbians. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world.

Gay men and lesbians were [[lavender scare|included]] in this list by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] on the theory that they were susceptible to [[blackmail]]. In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by [[Clyde R. Hoey]] noted in a report, \"It is generally believed that those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons\",<ref>Edsall, p. 277.</ref> and said all of the government's intelligence agencies \"are in complete agreement that sex perverts in Government constitute security risks\".<ref>David K.

Cities performed \"sweeps\" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.<ref>Adam, p. 59.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] listed homosexuality in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (''DSM'') as a mental disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent\u2013child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession.<ref>Edsall, p. 247.</ref> In 1956, however, the psychologist [[Evelyn Hooker]] performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference.<ref>Edsall, p. 310.</ref> Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians,<ref>Marcus, pp. 58\u201359.</ref> but homosexuality remained in the ''DSM'' until 1974.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=drBejRLWkHkC&pg=PA76 |chapter=The Transformation of Mental Disorders in the 1980s: The DSM-III, Managed Care, and \"Cosmetic Psychopharmacology\" |page=76 |title=Medicating Children: ADHD and Pediatric Mental Health |first1=Rick |last1=Mayes |first2=Catherine |last2=Bagwell |first3=Jennifer L. |last3=Erkulwater |publisher=Harvard University Press |date= 2009 |accessdate=April 7, 2019 |isbn=978-0-674-03163-0 }}</ref>\n\n===Homophile activism===\n{{main|Homophile}}\nIn response to this trend, two organizations formed independently of each other to advance the cause of gay men and lesbians and provide social opportunities where they could socialize without fear of being arrested. [[Los Angeles]] area homosexuals created the [[Mattachine Society]] in 1950, in the home of communist activist [[Harry Hay]].<ref>Marcus, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist \"sexual deviants\" with legal troubles.<ref>Adam, pp. 62\u201363.</ref> Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gay men and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals.<ref>Adam, pp. 63\u201364.</ref><ref>Marcus, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Soon after, several women in [[San Francisco]] met in their living rooms to form the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB) for lesbians.<ref>Marcus, p. 21.</ref> Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine, and urged their members to assimilate into general society.<ref>Gallo, pp. 1\u20135, 11.</ref>\n\nOne of the first challenges to [[political repression|government repression]] came in 1953. An organization named [[ONE, Inc.]] published a magazine called ''ONE''. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexual people in heterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually [[One, Inc. v. Olesen|went to the Supreme Court]], which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.<ref>Marcus, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[Homophile]] organizations\u2014as homosexual groups self-identified in this era\u2014grew in number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. [[Frank Kameny]] founded the Mattachine of [[Washington, D.C.]] He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at [[mental health professional]]s, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal.<ref>Marcus, pp. 80\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn 1965, news on [[Cuba]]n prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine New York and D.C. to organize protests at the [[United Nations]] and the [[White House]].

A cohort of poets, later named the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]\u2014both Greenwich Village residents\u2014also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.<ref>Adam, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, a campaign to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]], who was concerned about the image of the city in preparation for the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]]. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.<ref>Carter, pp. 29\u201337.</ref> [[Entrapment]] usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together\u2014or the officer bought the man a drink\u2014he was arrested for [[solicitation]]. One story in the ''[[New York Post]]'' described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested.<ref>Carter, p. 46.</ref> Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.<ref>Duberman, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly-elected mayor [[John Lindsay]] to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City. They had a more difficult time with the [[Alcohol laws of New York|New York State Liquor Authority]] (SLA). While no laws prohibited serving homosexuals, courts allowed the SLA discretion in approving and revoking liquor licenses for businesses that might become \"disorderly\".<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/><ref>Carter, p. 48.</ref> Despite the high population of gay men and lesbians who called Greenwich Village home, very few places existed, other than bars, where they were able to congregate openly without being harassed or arrested. In 1966 the New York Mattachine held a \"sip-in\" at a Greenwich Village bar named [[Julius (New York City)|Julius]], which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the discrimination homosexuals faced.<ref>Jackson, Sharyn (June 17, 2008).

We're taking the place!\"<ref name=\"Carter, p. 137.\">Carter, p. 137.</ref> Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.&nbsp;194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate.\n\nHistorian [[David Carter (historian)|David Carter]] presents information<ref>Carter, pp. 96\u2013103</ref> indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay [[Wall Street]] customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205&nbsp;people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered,\n\n<blockquote>\"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room in the back of the bar. [[Maria Ritter (person)|Maria Ritter]], then known as male to her family, recalled, \"My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!\"<ref name=\"carter142\">Carter, p. 142.</ref> Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by \"feeling some of them up inappropriately\" while frisking them.<ref>Carter, p. 141.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=30em | align=left |quote=When did you ever see a fag fight back?...

Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required to wait in line for about 15&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=\"carter142\"/> Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150&nbsp;people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: \"Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic.\"<ref>Teal, p. 2.</ref>\n\nWhen the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the crowd\u2014most of whom were homosexual\u2014had grown to at least ten times the number of people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet.<ref>Carter, p. 147.</ref> Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, \"Gay power!\", someone began singing \"[[We Shall Overcome]]\", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with \"growing and intensive hostility\".<ref>Carter, pp. 147\u2013148.</ref> An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo.

No one has a slogan, no one even has an attitude, but something's brewing.\"<ref>Carter, p. 148.</ref> Pennies, then beer bottles, were thrown at the wagon as a rumor spread through the crowd that patrons still inside the bar were being beaten.\n\nA scuffle broke out when a woman in handcuffs was escorted from the door of the bar to the waiting police wagon several times. She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as \"a typical New York butch\" and \"a dyke\u2013stone butch\", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]] for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight.<ref>Duberman, p. 196.</ref> Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown ([[Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie]] has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary<ref name=Chu>{{cite web|last=Chu |first=Grace |url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/77167-an-interview-with-lesbian-stonewall-veteran-storm-delarverie|title=An interview with lesbian Stonewall veteran Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie |publisher=AfterEllen.com |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Accounts of people who witnessed the scene, including letters and news reports of the woman who fought with police, conflicted.

At least one was already bleeding when taken out of the bar (Carter, pp. 152\u2013153). Craig Rodwell (in Duberman, p. 197) claims the arrest of the woman was not the primary event that triggered the violence, but one of several simultaneous occurrences: \"there was just ... a flash of group\u2014of mass\u2014anger.\"</ref>), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, \"Why don't you guys do something?\" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon,<ref>Carter, p. 152.</ref> the crowd became a mob and went \"berserk\": \"It was at that moment that the scene became explosive.\"<ref>Carter, p. 151.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The night they busted Stonewall | author=Lucian K.

The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600&nbsp;people, grabbed several people, including folk singer and mentor of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Dave Van Ronk]]\u2014who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: \"As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in...

No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot, although one sarcastic account by a heterosexual publication suggested it. (Carter, p. 260.) Although [[Sylvia Rivera]] recalls she was saddened and amazed by the turnout at Garland's funeral on Friday, June 27, she said that she did not feel like going out much but changed her mind later. (Duberman, pp. 190\u2013191.) Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square, and said, \"When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing.\" (Deitcher, p. 72.)</ref> Michael Fader explained,\n\n<blockquote>We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around\u2014it's like standing your ground for the first time and in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away.

Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if he might have to use it against the mob or the police.

[[Craig Rodwell]] and his partner [[Fred Sargeant]] took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\" The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the \"intolerable situation\".<ref>Duberman, p. 205.</ref><ref>Teal, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nNot everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and many members of the Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. [[Randy Wicker]], who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the \"screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap.\"<ref>Duberman, p. 207.</ref> Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a \"sleaze joint\", as advantageous to the Village.<ref>Duberman, p. 206.</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday, however, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: \"forces of faggotry\", \"limp wrists\", and \"Sunday fag follies\".<ref name=\"Truscott\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uuwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K4wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6710,4693&dq=stonewall+inn&hl=en|title=Gay Power Comes to Sheridan Square|last=Truscott|first=Lucian|date=July 3, 1969|work=The Village Voice|page=1|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Carter (p. 201) attributes the anger at ''The Village Voice'' reports to its focus on the effeminate behavior of the participants, with the exclusion of any kind of bravery.

Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people.<ref>Duberman, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref><ref>Carter, pp. 203\u2013205.</ref> The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: \"The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have had it with oppression.\"<ref>Carter, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], called the [[Annual Reminder]]. Organizers [[Craig Rodwell]], [[Frank Kameny]], [[Randy Wicker]], [[Barbara Gittings]], and [[Kay Lahusen]], who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines.<ref>Marcus, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref> This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \"None of that! None of that!\" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches.<ref name=\"carter216-217\">Carter, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref><ref name=\"duberman210\">Duberman, p. 210.</ref> Participant [[Lilli Vincenz]] remembered, \"It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered.\"<ref name=\"carter216-217\"/> Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.<ref>Duberman, p. 211.</ref>\n\n[[File:Demonstration, with Gay Liberation Front Banner.jpg|thumb|Gay rights demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]], including members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). The GLF in the UK held its first meeting in a basement classroom at the [[London School of Economics]] on October 13, 1970. The organization was very informal, instituting marches and other activities, leading to the first British Gay Pride March in 1972.]]\n\n===Gay Liberation Front===\nAlthough the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, \"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\">LaFrank, p. 17.</ref><ref group=note>\"Hairpin drop\" was [[gay slang]] that meant to drop hints about one's sexual orientation. (LaFrank, p. 17.)</ref> When a Mattachine officer suggested an \"amicable and sweet\" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \"Sweet! ''Bullshit!'' That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play.\"<ref name=\"teal19\">Teal, p. 19.</ref> With a flyer announcing: \"Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!\",<ref name=\"teal19\"/> the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use \"gay\" in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.<ref>Clendinen, p. 31.</ref>\n\nThe rise of militancy became apparent to [[Frank Kameny]] and [[Barbara Gittings]]\u2014who had worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles\u2014when they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group. A young GLF member demanded to know who they were and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, \"I'm gay. That's why I'm here.\"<ref>Marcus, p. 136.</ref> The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|antiwar]] demonstrators with the ideal that they \"could work to restructure American society\".<ref>Duberman, p. 216.</ref> They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the [[New York Women's House of Detention|Women's House of Detention]] in support of [[Afeni Shakur]], and other radical [[New Left]] causes. Four months after the group formed, however, it disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.<ref>Carter, pp. 220\u2013221.</ref>\n\n===Gay Activists Alliance===\nWithin six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called ''Gay''; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city\u2014''The Village Voice''\u2014refused to print the word \"gay\" in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers.<ref>Clendinen, p. 40.</ref> Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: ''Come Out!'' and ''Gay Power''; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000.<ref name=\"carter242\">Carter, p. 242.</ref><ref>Duberman, p. 235.</ref>\n\nGLF members organized several same-sex dances, but GLF meetings were chaotic. When Bob Kohler asked for clothes and money to help the homeless youth who had participated in the riots, many of whom slept in Christopher Park or Sheridan Square, the response was a discussion on the downfall of [[capitalism]].<ref>Carter, p. 220.</ref> In late December 1969, several people who had visited GLF meetings and left out of frustration formed the [[Gay Activists Alliance]] (GAA). The GAA was to be entirely focused on gay issues, and more orderly. Their constitution started, \"We as liberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our dignity and value as human beings.\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> The GAA developed and perfected a confrontational tactic called a [[Zap (action)|zap]], where they would catch a politician off guard during a public relations opportunity, and force him or her to acknowledge gay and lesbian rights. City councilmen were zapped, and Mayor [[John Lindsay]] was zapped several times\u2014once on television when GAA members made up the majority of the audience.<ref>Carter, pp. 245\u2013246.</ref>\n\nRaids on gay bars did not stop after the Stonewall riots. In March 1970, Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An after-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit was soon raided, and 167&nbsp;people were arrested. One of them was [[Diego Vi\u00f1ales]], an Argentinian national so frightened that he might be [[Deportation|deported]] as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} spike fence.<ref>Carter, pp. 238\u2013239.</ref> ''The New York Daily News'' printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the Sixth Precinct in which hundreds of gay men, lesbians, and liberal sympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF.<ref name=\"carter242\"/> They also sponsored a letter-writing campaign to Mayor Lindsay in which the Greenwich Village [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and Congressman [[Ed Koch]] sent pleas to end raids on gay bars in the city.<ref>Teal, pp. 106\u2013108.</ref>\n\nThe Stonewall Inn lasted only a few weeks after the riot. By October 1969 it was up for rent. Village residents surmised it was too notorious a location, and Rodwell's boycott discouraged business.<ref>Carter, p. 252.</ref>\n\n===Gay Pride===\n{{main|NYC Pride March#Origins}}\n\nChristopher Street Liberation Day on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street; with simultaneous Gay Pride marches in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Chicago]], these were the first [[Pride parade|Gay Pride marches]] in U.S. history.<ref>Duberman, pp. 278\u2013279.</ref><ref>De la Croix, Sukie (2007).

The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers.<ref>Clendinen, pp. 62\u201364.</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15&nbsp;city blocks.<ref name=\"fosburgh\">Fosburgh, Lacey (June 29, 1970).

An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government.<ref>Cain, pp. 91\u201392.</ref> Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, \"By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred.\"<ref>Carter, p. 251.</ref>\n\nSimilar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as \"one of the greatest mistakes of his life\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\">Clendinen, p. 25.</ref> The image of gay people retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, \"stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\"/> Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, \"Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale.\"<ref>LaFrank, p. 21.</ref> David Carter, in his article \"What made Stonewall different\", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=David |title=What made Stonewall Different |journal=The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide |volume=16 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=11\u201313 |url=http://www.glreview.org/article/article-509/}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Unlikely community===\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.<ref>Adam, p. 82.</ref> People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]]. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place.<ref>Marcus, pp. 152\u2013155.</ref> Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after [[Barbara Gittings]] exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist [[Jean O'Leary]] protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by [[cross-dressers]] and [[drag queen]]s in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Lee Brewster]] jumped on the stage and shouted \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and ''these bitches'' tell us to quit being ourselves!\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.<ref name=\"duberman236\">Duberman, p. 236.</ref>\n\nO'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too difficult to attain.<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [[Tarrytown, New York|upstate New York]],<ref name=RiveraWholeInterview95>{{cite video |url=https://vimeo.com/35975275|title=Randy Wicker Interviews Sylvia Rivera on the Pier|time=Repeatedly throughout interview}} September 21, 1995.

Accessed July 24, 2015.</ref> The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \"Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\"<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> \"It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?\"<ref>Marcus, p. 156.</ref>\n\nO'Leary was referring to the [[Lavender Menace]], a description by [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]] for attempts by members of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, [[Rita Mae Brown]] and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.<ref>Adam, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe growth of [[lesbian feminism]] in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men.<ref name=\"faderman211-212\">Faderman, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> The issues most important to gay men\u2014[[entrapment]] and public solicitation\u2014were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what [[Adrienne Rich]] termed \"the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars\".<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/> Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, explaining \"It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena.\"<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, gay activism had significant successes. One of the first and most important was the \"zap\" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). At a conference on [[behavior modification]], during a film demonstrating the use of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] to decrease same-sex attraction, [[Morris Kight]] and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of \"Torture!\" and \"Barbarism!\"<ref name=\"williams\">Williams & Retter, p. 121.</ref> They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them. Although 20&nbsp;psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that homosexual people were not mentally ill.<ref name=\"williams\"/> When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought [[John E. Fryer]], a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger. In December 1973\u2014in large part due to the efforts of gay activists\u2014the APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]''.<ref>Marcus, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Cain, p. 65.</ref>\n\nGay men and lesbians came together to work in [[grassroots]] political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named [[Save Our Children]] staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in [[Dade County, Florida]]. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the [[Briggs Initiative]], designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated.<ref>Cain, p. 275.</ref> Reaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.<ref>Fejes, p. 214.</ref> The subsequent 1979 [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] was timed to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots.<ref name=\"Ghaziani\">Ghaziani, Amin. 2008. ''The Dividends of Dissent: How Conflict and Culture Work in Lesbian and Gay Marches on Washington''. The University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of prior gay subculture===\n\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior [[LGBT culture|gay and lesbian culture]], such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian [[Martin Duberman]] writes, \"The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\"<ref>Duberman, p. xv.</ref> Sociologist [[Barry D. Adam|Barry Adam]] notes, \"Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?\"<ref name=\"adam93\">Adam, p. 93.</ref> In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of [[butch and femme]] that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: \"all role playing is sick.\"<ref>Adam, p. 94.</ref> Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior.<ref>Faderman, p. 232.</ref> Some women, according to [[Lillian Faderman]], were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.<ref>Faderman, pp. 210, 266.</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Bronski highlights the \"attack on pre-Stonewall culture\", particularly [[Gay male pulp fiction|gay pulp fiction]] for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as \"an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men\",<ref>Bronski, p. 16.</ref> have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as political correctness, Bronski writes, \"gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of the past.\"<ref>Bronski, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Lasting impact and recognition===\n[[File:Stonewall Inn New York 002.JPG|thumb|alt=A color photograph of the Stonewall taken recently, showing a smaller plate glass window in a portion of the 1969 building|The Stonewall, a bar in part of the building where the [[Stonewall Inn]] was located. The building and the surrounding streets have been declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].]]\n\nThe riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \"exploitation and degradation\".<ref>Carter, p. 264.</ref> The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the \"ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality\".<ref>Carter, p. 266.</ref> Historian Nicholas Edsall writes,\n\n<blockquote>Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.<ref>Edsall, p. 333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and [[Adam Nagourney]] write,\n\n<blockquote>a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.<ref>Clendinen, p. 12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Lillian Faderman]] calls the riots the \"shot heard round the world\", explaining, \"The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they.\"<ref>Faderman, p. 195.</ref>\n[[File:Stonewall Inn raid sign pride weekend 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The sign left by police following the raid is now on display just inside the entrance]]\n\n[[Joan Nestle]] co-founded the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]] in 1974, and credits \"its creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\"/> Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism to the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes,\n\n<blockquote>I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall.<ref>Deitcher, p. 74.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe events of the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first instances of gay men and lesbians fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' [[Black Cat Tavern]] in 1967.<ref>Witt ''et al.'', p. 210</ref> However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the [[Lower Manhattan]] raid was a factor: it was across the street from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police.<ref name=\"armstrong\">Armstrong, Elizabeth&nbsp;A., Crage, Suzanna&nbsp;M.

The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual [[Gay Pride]] events around the world.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/>\n\n[[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]] (officially Stonewall Equality Limited) is an [[LGBT rights]] charity in the United Kingdom, founded in 1989, and named after the [[Stonewall Inn]] because of the Stonewall riots.

These influences, along with the liberal environment of [[Greenwich Village]], served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.\n\nVery few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s. Those that did were often bars, although bar owners and managers were rarely gay. At the time, the Stonewall Inn was owned by the [[American Mafia|Mafia]].<ref name=\"duberman183\"/><ref>Carter, pp. 79\u201383.</ref><ref name=\"AmExpMafia\">{{cite web |title=Stonewall Uprising: The Year That Changed America - Why Did the Mafia Own the Bar? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/stonewall-why-did-mafia-own-bar/ |website=American Experience |publisher=PBS |accessdate=June 5, 2019 |date=April 2011}}</ref> It catered to an assortment of patrons and was known to be popular among the poorest and most marginalized people in the gay community: [[Butch and femme|butch lesbians]], [[effeminate]] young men, [[drag queen]]s, [[male prostitution|male prostitutes]], [[transgender]] people, and [[Homelessness in the United States|homeless youth]]. Police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, but officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn. Tensions between [[New York City Police Department|New York City police]] and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening, and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents quickly organized into activist groups to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gay men and lesbians to be open about their [[sexual orientation]] without fear of being arrested.\n\nAfter the Stonewall riots, gay men and lesbians in New York City faced gender, race, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gay men and lesbians. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world. On June 28, 1970, the first [[Pride parade|gay pride marches]] took place in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfpride.org/heritage/1970.html |title=Heritage &#124; 1970 Christopher Street Liberation Day Gay-In, San Francisco |publisher=SF Pride |date=June 28, 1970 |accessdate=June 28, 2014 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022032242/http://www.sfpride.org/heritage/1970.html |archivedate=October 22, 2014}}</ref> and the anniversary of the riots was commemorated in Chicago.

Gay men and lesbians were [[lavender scare|included]] in this list by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] on the theory that they were susceptible to [[blackmail]]. In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by [[Clyde R. Hoey]] noted in a report, \"It is generally believed that those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons\",<ref>Edsall, p. 277.</ref> and said all of the government's intelligence agencies \"are in complete agreement that sex perverts in Government constitute security risks\".<ref>David K.

Cities performed \"sweeps\" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.<ref>Adam, p. 59.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] listed homosexuality in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (''DSM'') as a mental disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent\u2013child relationships.

[[Los Angeles]] area homosexuals created the [[Mattachine Society]] in 1950, in the home of communist activist [[Harry Hay]].<ref>Marcus, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist \"sexual deviants\" with legal troubles.<ref>Adam, pp. 62\u201363.</ref> Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gay men and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals.<ref>Adam, pp. 63\u201364.</ref><ref>Marcus, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Soon after, several women in [[San Francisco]] met in their living rooms to form the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB) for lesbians.<ref>Marcus, p. 21.</ref> Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine, and urged their members to assimilate into general society.<ref>Gallo, pp. 1\u20135, 11.</ref>\n\nOne of the first challenges to [[political repression|government repression]] came in 1953. An organization named [[ONE, Inc.]] published a magazine called ''ONE''. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexual people in heterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually [[One, Inc. v. Olesen|went to the Supreme Court]], which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.<ref>Marcus, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[Homophile]] organizations\u2014as homosexual groups self-identified in this era\u2014grew in number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. [[Frank Kameny]] founded the Mattachine of [[Washington, D.C.]] He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at [[mental health professional]]s, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal.<ref>Marcus, pp. 80\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn 1965, news on [[Cuba]]n prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine New York and D.C. to organize protests at the [[United Nations]] and the [[White House]].

A cohort of poets, later named the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]\u2014both Greenwich Village residents\u2014also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.<ref>Adam, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, a campaign to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]], who was concerned about the image of the city in preparation for the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]]. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.<ref>Carter, pp. 29\u201337.</ref> [[Entrapment]] usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together\u2014or the officer bought the man a drink\u2014he was arrested for [[solicitation]]. One story in the ''[[New York Post]]'' described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested.<ref>Carter, p. 46.</ref> Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.<ref>Duberman, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly-elected mayor [[John Lindsay]] to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City.

In 1966 the New York Mattachine held a \"sip-in\" at a Greenwich Village bar named [[Julius (New York City)|Julius]], which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the discrimination homosexuals faced.<ref>Jackson, Sharyn (June 17, 2008).

The legal drinking age was 18, and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called \"Lily Law\", \"Alice Blue Gown\", or \"Betty Badge\"<ref name=\"duberman187\">Duberman, p. 187.</ref>), visitors would have to be known by the doorman, or look gay. The entrance fee on weekends was $3, for which the customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for two drinks. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private \"bottle club\", but rarely signed their real names.<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or [[black light]]s.

We're taking the place!\"<ref name=\"Carter, p. 137.\">Carter, p. 137.</ref> Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.&nbsp;194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate.\n\nHistorian [[David Carter (historian)|David Carter]] presents information<ref>Carter, pp. 96\u2013103</ref> indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay [[Wall Street]] customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205&nbsp;people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered,\n\n<blockquote>\"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room in the back of the bar. [[Maria Ritter (person)|Maria Ritter]], then known as male to her family, recalled, \"My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!\"<ref name=\"carter142\">Carter, p. 142.</ref> Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by \"feeling some of them up inappropriately\" while frisking them.<ref>Carter, p. 141.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=30em | align=left |quote=When did you ever see a fag fight back?...

Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required to wait in line for about 15&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=\"carter142\"/> Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150&nbsp;people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: \"Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic.\"<ref>Teal, p. 2.</ref>\n\nWhen the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the crowd\u2014most of whom were homosexual\u2014had grown to at least ten times the number of people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet.<ref>Carter, p. 147.</ref> Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, \"Gay power!\", someone began singing \"[[We Shall Overcome]]\", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with \"growing and intensive hostility\".<ref>Carter, pp. 147\u2013148.</ref> An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo.

She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as \"a typical New York butch\" and \"a dyke\u2013stone butch\", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]] for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight.<ref>Duberman, p. 196.</ref> Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown ([[Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie]] has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary<ref name=Chu>{{cite web|last=Chu |first=Grace |url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/77167-an-interview-with-lesbian-stonewall-veteran-storm-delarverie|title=An interview with lesbian Stonewall veteran Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie |publisher=AfterEllen.com |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Accounts of people who witnessed the scene, including letters and news reports of the woman who fought with police, conflicted.

At least one was already bleeding when taken out of the bar (Carter, pp. 152\u2013153). Craig Rodwell (in Duberman, p. 197) claims the arrest of the woman was not the primary event that triggered the violence, but one of several simultaneous occurrences: \"there was just ... a flash of group\u2014of mass\u2014anger.\"</ref>), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, \"Why don't you guys do something?\" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon,<ref>Carter, p. 152.</ref> the crowd became a mob and went \"berserk\": \"It was at that moment that the scene became explosive.\"<ref>Carter, p. 151.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The night they busted Stonewall | author=Lucian K.

The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600&nbsp;people, grabbed several people, including folk singer and mentor of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Dave Van Ronk]]\u2014who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: \"As far as I was concerned, anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in...

No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot, although one sarcastic account by a heterosexual publication suggested it. (Carter, p. 260.) Although [[Sylvia Rivera]] recalls she was saddened and amazed by the turnout at Garland's funeral on Friday, June 27, she said that she did not feel like going out much but changed her mind later. (Duberman, pp. 190\u2013191.) Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square, and said, \"When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing.\" (Deitcher, p. 72.)</ref> Michael Fader explained,\n\n<blockquote>We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around\u2014it's like standing your ground for the first time and in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away.

Members of the mob stopped cars, overturning one of them to block Christopher Street. [[Jack Nichols (activist)|Jack Nichols]] and [[Lige Clarke]], in their column printed in ''[[Screw (magazine)|Screw]]'', declared that \"massive crowds of angry protesters chased [the police] for blocks screaming, 'Catch them!'&nbsp;\"<ref name=\"teal6\"/>\n\nBy 4:00&nbsp;a.m., the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or gathered nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be \"electricity in the air\".<ref>Carter, p. 180.</ref> One commented: \"There was a certain beauty in the aftermath of the riot... It was obvious, at least to me, that a lot of people really were gay and, you know, this was our street.\"<ref>Carter, p. 181.</ref> Thirteen people had been arrested.

All three papers covered the riots; the ''Daily News'' placed coverage on the front page. News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors that it had been organized by the [[Students for a Democratic Society]], the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], or triggered by \"a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes\".<ref name=\"teal4\"/> All day Saturday, June 28, people came to stare at the burned and blackened Stonewall Inn. [[Graffiti]] appeared on the walls of the bar, declaring \"Drag power\", \"They invaded our rights\", \"Support gay power\", and \"Legalize gay bars\", along with accusations of police looting, and\u2014regarding the status of the bar\u2014\"We are open.\"<ref name=\"teal4\">Teal, p. 4.</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04EFDB1E3AEE34BC4850DFB0668382679EDE |title=Police Again Rout Village Youths: Outbreak by 400 Follows a Near-Riot Over Raid |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 30, 1969 |page=22}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nThe next night, rioting again surrounded Christopher Street; participants remember differently which night was more frantic or violent.

More than a hundred police were present from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth [[Organization of the New York City Police Department#Police precincts|Precinct]]s, but after 2:00&nbsp;a.m. the TPF arrived again.

After he learned of the riot that had occurred the previous evening, he stated, \"Gay power! Isn't that great!... It's about time we did something to assert ourselves\", and visited the open Stonewall Inn for the first time. While walking home, he declared to Lucian Truscott, \"You know, the guys there were so beautiful\u2014they've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10&nbsp;years ago.\"<ref>Teal, p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Leaflets, press coverage, and more violence===\nActivity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday and Tuesday, partly due to rain. Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other. [[Craig Rodwell]] and his partner [[Fred Sargeant]] took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\" The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the \"intolerable situation\".<ref>Duberman, p. 205.</ref><ref>Teal, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nNot everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and many members of the Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. [[Randy Wicker]], who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the \"screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap.\"<ref>Duberman, p. 207.</ref> Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a \"sleaze joint\", as advantageous to the Village.<ref>Duberman, p. 206.</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday, however, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: \"forces of faggotry\", \"limp wrists\", and \"Sunday fag follies\".<ref name=\"Truscott\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uuwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K4wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6710,4693&dq=stonewall+inn&hl=en|title=Gay Power Comes to Sheridan Square|last=Truscott|first=Lucian|date=July 3, 1969|work=The Village Voice|page=1|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Carter (p. 201) attributes the anger at ''The Village Voice'' reports to its focus on the effeminate behavior of the participants, with the exclusion of any kind of bravery.

Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people.<ref>Duberman, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref><ref>Carter, pp. 203\u2013205.</ref> The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: \"The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have had it with oppression.\"<ref>Carter, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], called the [[Annual Reminder]]. Organizers [[Craig Rodwell]], [[Frank Kameny]], [[Randy Wicker]], [[Barbara Gittings]], and [[Kay Lahusen]], who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines.<ref>Marcus, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref> This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \"None of that! None of that!\" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches.<ref name=\"carter216-217\">Carter, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref><ref name=\"duberman210\">Duberman, p. 210.</ref> Participant [[Lilli Vincenz]] remembered, \"It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered.\"<ref name=\"carter216-217\"/> Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.<ref>Duberman, p. 211.</ref>\n\n[[File:Demonstration, with Gay Liberation Front Banner.jpg|thumb|Gay rights demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]], including members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). The GLF in the UK held its first meeting in a basement classroom at the [[London School of Economics]] on October 13, 1970. The organization was very informal, instituting marches and other activities, leading to the first British Gay Pride March in 1972.]]\n\n===Gay Liberation Front===\nAlthough the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, \"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\">LaFrank, p. 17.</ref><ref group=note>\"Hairpin drop\" was [[gay slang]] that meant to drop hints about one's sexual orientation. (LaFrank, p. 17.)</ref> When a Mattachine officer suggested an \"amicable and sweet\" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \"Sweet! ''Bullshit!'' That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play.\"<ref name=\"teal19\">Teal, p. 19.</ref> With a flyer announcing: \"Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!\",<ref name=\"teal19\"/> the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use \"gay\" in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.<ref>Clendinen, p. 31.</ref>\n\nThe rise of militancy became apparent to [[Frank Kameny]] and [[Barbara Gittings]]\u2014who had worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles\u2014when they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group. A young GLF member demanded to know who they were and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, \"I'm gay. That's why I'm here.\"<ref>Marcus, p. 136.</ref> The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|antiwar]] demonstrators with the ideal that they \"could work to restructure American society\".<ref>Duberman, p. 216.</ref> They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the [[New York Women's House of Detention|Women's House of Detention]] in support of [[Afeni Shakur]], and other radical [[New Left]] causes. Four months after the group formed, however, it disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.<ref>Carter, pp. 220\u2013221.</ref>\n\n===Gay Activists Alliance===\nWithin six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called ''Gay''; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city\u2014''The Village Voice''\u2014refused to print the word \"gay\" in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers.<ref>Clendinen, p. 40.</ref> Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: ''Come Out!'' and ''Gay Power''; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000.<ref name=\"carter242\">Carter, p. 242.</ref><ref>Duberman, p. 235.</ref>\n\nGLF members organized several same-sex dances, but GLF meetings were chaotic. When Bob Kohler asked for clothes and money to help the homeless youth who had participated in the riots, many of whom slept in Christopher Park or Sheridan Square, the response was a discussion on the downfall of [[capitalism]].<ref>Carter, p. 220.</ref> In late December 1969, several people who had visited GLF meetings and left out of frustration formed the [[Gay Activists Alliance]] (GAA). The GAA was to be entirely focused on gay issues, and more orderly. Their constitution started, \"We as liberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our dignity and value as human beings.\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> The GAA developed and perfected a confrontational tactic called a [[Zap (action)|zap]], where they would catch a politician off guard during a public relations opportunity, and force him or her to acknowledge gay and lesbian rights. City councilmen were zapped, and Mayor [[John Lindsay]] was zapped several times\u2014once on television when GAA members made up the majority of the audience.<ref>Carter, pp. 245\u2013246.</ref>\n\nRaids on gay bars did not stop after the Stonewall riots. In March 1970, Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An after-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit was soon raided, and 167&nbsp;people were arrested. One of them was [[Diego Vi\u00f1ales]], an Argentinian national so frightened that he might be [[Deportation|deported]] as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} spike fence.<ref>Carter, pp. 238\u2013239.</ref> ''The New York Daily News'' printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the Sixth Precinct in which hundreds of gay men, lesbians, and liberal sympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF.<ref name=\"carter242\"/> They also sponsored a letter-writing campaign to Mayor Lindsay in which the Greenwich Village [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and Congressman [[Ed Koch]] sent pleas to end raids on gay bars in the city.<ref>Teal, pp. 106\u2013108.</ref>\n\nThe Stonewall Inn lasted only a few weeks after the riot. By October 1969 it was up for rent. Village residents surmised it was too notorious a location, and Rodwell's boycott discouraged business.<ref>Carter, p. 252.</ref>\n\n===Gay Pride===\n{{main|NYC Pride March#Origins}}\n\nChristopher Street Liberation Day on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street; with simultaneous Gay Pride marches in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Chicago]], these were the first [[Pride parade|Gay Pride marches]] in U.S. history.<ref>Duberman, pp. 278\u2013279.</ref><ref>De la Croix, Sukie (2007).

The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers.<ref>Clendinen, pp. 62\u201364.</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15&nbsp;city blocks.<ref name=\"fosburgh\">Fosburgh, Lacey (June 29, 1970).

An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government.<ref>Cain, pp. 91\u201392.</ref> Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, \"By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred.\"<ref>Carter, p. 251.</ref>\n\nSimilar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as \"one of the greatest mistakes of his life\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\">Clendinen, p. 25.</ref> The image of gay people retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, \"stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\"/> Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, \"Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale.\"<ref>LaFrank, p. 21.</ref> David Carter, in his article \"What made Stonewall different\", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=David |title=What made Stonewall Different |journal=The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide |volume=16 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=11\u201313 |url=http://www.glreview.org/article/article-509/}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Unlikely community===\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.<ref>Adam, p. 82.</ref> People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]]. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place.<ref>Marcus, pp. 152\u2013155.</ref> Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after [[Barbara Gittings]] exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist [[Jean O'Leary]] protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by [[cross-dressers]] and [[drag queen]]s in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Lee Brewster]] jumped on the stage and shouted \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and ''these bitches'' tell us to quit being ourselves!\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.<ref name=\"duberman236\">Duberman, p. 236.</ref>\n\nO'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too difficult to attain.<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [[Tarrytown, New York|upstate New York]],<ref name=RiveraWholeInterview95>{{cite video |url=https://vimeo.com/35975275|title=Randy Wicker Interviews Sylvia Rivera on the Pier|time=Repeatedly throughout interview}} September 21, 1995.

Accessed July 24, 2015.</ref> The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \"Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\"<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> \"It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?\"<ref>Marcus, p. 156.</ref>\n\nO'Leary was referring to the [[Lavender Menace]], a description by [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]] for attempts by members of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, [[Rita Mae Brown]] and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.<ref>Adam, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe growth of [[lesbian feminism]] in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men.<ref name=\"faderman211-212\">Faderman, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> The issues most important to gay men\u2014[[entrapment]] and public solicitation\u2014were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what [[Adrienne Rich]] termed \"the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars\".<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/> Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, explaining \"It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena.\"<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, gay activism had significant successes. One of the first and most important was the \"zap\" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). At a conference on [[behavior modification]], during a film demonstrating the use of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] to decrease same-sex attraction, [[Morris Kight]] and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of \"Torture!\" and \"Barbarism!\"<ref name=\"williams\">Williams & Retter, p. 121.</ref> They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them. Although 20&nbsp;psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that homosexual people were not mentally ill.<ref name=\"williams\"/> When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought [[John E. Fryer]], a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger. In December 1973\u2014in large part due to the efforts of gay activists\u2014the APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]''.<ref>Marcus, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Cain, p. 65.</ref>\n\nGay men and lesbians came together to work in [[grassroots]] political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named [[Save Our Children]] staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in [[Dade County, Florida]]. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the [[Briggs Initiative]], designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated.<ref>Cain, p. 275.</ref> Reaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.<ref>Fejes, p. 214.</ref> The subsequent 1979 [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] was timed to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots.<ref name=\"Ghaziani\">Ghaziani, Amin. 2008. ''The Dividends of Dissent: How Conflict and Culture Work in Lesbian and Gay Marches on Washington''. The University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of prior gay subculture===\n\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior [[LGBT culture|gay and lesbian culture]], such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian [[Martin Duberman]] writes, \"The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\"<ref>Duberman, p. xv.</ref> Sociologist [[Barry D. Adam|Barry Adam]] notes, \"Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?\"<ref name=\"adam93\">Adam, p. 93.</ref> In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of [[butch and femme]] that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: \"all role playing is sick.\"<ref>Adam, p. 94.</ref> Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior.<ref>Faderman, p. 232.</ref> Some women, according to [[Lillian Faderman]], were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.<ref>Faderman, pp. 210, 266.</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Bronski highlights the \"attack on pre-Stonewall culture\", particularly [[Gay male pulp fiction|gay pulp fiction]] for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as \"an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men\",<ref>Bronski, p. 16.</ref> have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as political correctness, Bronski writes, \"gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of the past.\"<ref>Bronski, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Lasting impact and recognition===\n[[File:Stonewall Inn New York 002.JPG|thumb|alt=A color photograph of the Stonewall taken recently, showing a smaller plate glass window in a portion of the 1969 building|The Stonewall, a bar in part of the building where the [[Stonewall Inn]] was located. The building and the surrounding streets have been declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].]]\n\nThe riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \"exploitation and degradation\".<ref>Carter, p. 264.</ref> The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the \"ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality\".<ref>Carter, p. 266.</ref> Historian Nicholas Edsall writes,\n\n<blockquote>Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.<ref>Edsall, p. 333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and [[Adam Nagourney]] write,\n\n<blockquote>a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.<ref>Clendinen, p. 12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Lillian Faderman]] calls the riots the \"shot heard round the world\", explaining, \"The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they.\"<ref>Faderman, p. 195.</ref>\n[[File:Stonewall Inn raid sign pride weekend 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The sign left by police following the raid is now on display just inside the entrance]]\n\n[[Joan Nestle]] co-founded the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]] in 1974, and credits \"its creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\"/> Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism to the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes,\n\n<blockquote>I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall.<ref>Deitcher, p. 74.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe events of the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first instances of gay men and lesbians fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' [[Black Cat Tavern]] in 1967.<ref>Witt ''et al.'', p. 210</ref> However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the [[Lower Manhattan]] raid was a factor: it was across the street from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police.<ref name=\"armstrong\">Armstrong, Elizabeth&nbsp;A., Crage, Suzanna&nbsp;M.

Cuvier]], 1831\n}}\n\nThe '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        \n\n''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called \u201cCitharoedus\u201d, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n<br />\n\n== Morphology ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    \n\n== Behavior ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. \n<br />\n\n== Reproduction ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R. Jamil|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. Spawning occurs at dusk and eggs are released and fertilized in the water column <ref name=\":7\" />. \n\n== Habitat and Range ==\nThe Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hern\u00e1ndez, Sebasti\u00e1n, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>.

''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77\u201386.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30\u00b0N - 30\u00b0S, 77\u00b0E - 124\u00b0W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  \n\n== Habitat Threats ==\nThere are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n\n\nThese changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n\nAnother adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities\u2019 limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />\n\n== Diet and Feeding ==\n''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2).

Cuvier]], 1831\n}}\n\nThe '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.                        \n\n''C. ornatissimus'' is commonly referred to as:  Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called \u201cCitharoedus\u201d, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n<br />\n\n== Morphology ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' is most easily identified by its color pattern which helps protect them from predators. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\" />. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head: one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout, and the tail has two black bars <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>.    \n\n== Behavior ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\" />. On the other hand, juvenile ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' live in solitary, tend to be shy, and live in the arms of branching corals for protection <ref name=\":0\" />. Once juveniles reach breeding age, they form pairs <ref name=\":0\" />. It is uncommon to find adult ''Chaetodon ornatissimus'''  without a mate. Pairs also establish a \"home range\" where you will likely always find them <ref name=\":0\" />. \n<br />\n\n== Reproduction ==\n''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' are monogamous and pair-forming coral reef fish. Many ornate butterflyfish mate for life. Spawning activity occurs at different times depending on each biome. Tropical spawning peaks in winter and early spring, while temperate spawning occurs in midsummer <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chaetodontidae/|title=Chaetodontidae (Butterflyfishes)|last=Weinheimer|first=Monica|last2=Jonna|first2=R. Jamil|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. Spawning occurs at dusk and eggs are released and fertilized in the water column <ref name=\":7\" />. \n\n== Habitat and Range ==\nThe Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hern\u00e1ndez, Sebasti\u00e1n, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. Over three-quraters of the world's fish species inhabit this region<ref>{{aut|Hsu, Kui-Ching; Chen, Jeng-Ping & Shao, Kwang-Tsao}}(2007): Molecular phylogeny of ''Chaetodon''(Teleostei: Chaetodontidae) in the Indo-West Pacific: evolution in geminate species pairs and species groups. ''Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement'''''14''': 77\u201386.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30\u00b0N - 30\u00b0S, 77\u00b0E - 124\u00b0W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />.  \n\n== Habitat Threats ==\nThere are many natural and anthropogenic disruptions which play a major role in loss of habitat of organisms living in coral reef communities. Sessile, benthic communities on tropical coral reefs have natural disruptions including tropical storms, unseasonal temperature extremes and infestations of crown-of-thorn sea stars (''Acanthaster planci'')<ref name=\":5\">Pratchett, M. S., Wilson, S. K., & Baird, A. H. (2006). Declines in the abundance of Chaetodon butterflyfishes following extensive coral depletion. ''Journal of fish Biology'', ''69''(5), 1269-1280.</ref>. These events are becoming more frequent which makes anthropogenic influences more chronic. Anthropogenic disturbances include overfishing, pollution and coastal development all of which cause depletion in corals<ref name=\":5\" />. Over 30 percent of the coral reef communities in the world have already been degraded; however, by 2030 more than 60 percent of coral reef communities will have been lost<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\n\n\nThese changes in the structure of benthic coral reef habitats have adverse effects on coral reef fish, specifically butterflyfish. Several studies documented the decline of butterflyfish, and localized extinctions, following coral depletion. A study by Pratchett et. al., revealed declines in abundance of ''Chaetodon'' butterflyfish were almost certainly related to coral depletion<ref name=\":5\" />. Declines in abundances of butterflyfish were due to starvation<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n\nAnother adverse anthropogenic effect which alters habitat community composition is the shift from coral-dominated to seaweed-dominated benthic communities. Anthropogenic impacts of overfishing of herbivorous fish and increase of eutrophication create favorable conditions for seaweed growth<ref name=\":6\">Brooker, R. M. ''et al.'' Cryptic effects of habitat declines: coral-associated fishes avoid coral-seaweed interactions due to visual and chemical cues. ''Sci. Rep.'' '''6''', 18842; doi: 10.1038/srep18842 (2016).</ref>. Increase in seaweed-dominated benthic communities\u2019 limits expansion of coral colonies and availability of surfaces for larval settlement and development<ref name=\":6\" />. Coral reef communities provide shelter, and food resources for Butterflyfish<ref name=\":6\" />. However, the presence of seaweed has a substantial impact on butterflyfish, as they actively avoid corals in contact with seaweed<ref name=\":6\" />. <br />\n\n== Diet and Feeding ==\n''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2).

The isolation helped keep the art unharmed during the massive anti-religious vandalism of the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref name=\"NYTcr\">{{cite newspaper| first=Ross | last=Terrill | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&res=9C0CE6DA123FF937A25752C0A966958260 | title=Serene Haven of Buddhist Art | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 14, 1990 | accessdate=February 11, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Dazu Stone Carving.jpg|Dazu rock carving on Mount Baoding.\nFile:Bao Ding Mountain grotto1.JPG|Dazu Bao Ding Mountain Rock Carvings.\nFile:Dazu rock carvings 1.JPG|Bao Ding Mountain Buddhas.\nFile:Dazu rock carvings 2 baoding.JPG|Bao Ding Mountain Circle of Life.\nFile:Dazu rock carvings golden hands buddha.JPG|Golden Hands Buddha at Bao Ding.\nFile:Dazu rock carvings baoding buddhas.JPG|Bao Ding Mountain Buddhas 2.\nFile:Dazu rock carvings baoding 18 layers of hell.JPG|Bao Ding Mountain 18 layers of hell.\nFile:Dazu rock carvings baoding demons 2.JPG|Bao Ding Mountain Demons with Rulers of hell.\nFile:Dazu rock carvings beishan 1.JPG|Beishan Guan Yin Bodhisattva.\nFile:Dazu rock carvings beishan 2.JPG|Beishan Mahamayuri Bodhisattva.\nFile:Dazu rock carvings beishan 3.JPG|Beishan detailed Buddhas.\nFile:Bao Ding Mountain Entering Nirvana.jpg|Bao Ding Mountain Entering Nirvana.\n</gallery>\n[[File:Dazu Shike Rock Carvings Chongqing People's Republic of China David McBride Photography-0362 01.jpg|thumb|Dazu Shike Rock Carvings Chongqing People's Republic of China]]\n[[File:Dazu Shike Rock Carvings Chongqing People's Republic of China David McBride Photography-0362 02.jpg|thumb|Dazu Shike Rock Carvings Chongqing People's Republic of China]]\n[[File:Dazu Shike Rock Carvings Chongqing People's Republic of China David McBride Photography-0362 03.jpg|thumb|Dazu Shike Rock Carvings Chongqing People's Republic of China]]\n==See also==\n* [[Dazu Lotus Manor]], a nearby attraction\n* [[Tianlongshan Grottoes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Dazu Rock Carvings}}\n* [https://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&id_site=912 UNESCO World Heritage Centre page]\n*[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/62659 Wisdom embodied: Chinese Buddhist and Daoist sculpture in the Metropolitan Museum of Art], a collection catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on the Dazu Rock Carvings\n\n{{Chongqing}}\n{{World Heritage Sites in China}}\n\n[[Category:Dazu Rock Carvings| ]]\n[[Category:7th-century works]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in China]]\n[[Category:Chinese Buddhist grottoes]]\n[[Category:Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Chongqing]]\n[[Category:Song dynasty art]]\n[[Category:Tang dynasty art]]\n[[Category:Outdoor sculptures in China]]\n[[Category:Sculpture series]]\n[[Category:AAAAA-rated tourist attractions]]\n[[Category:Buddhist temples in Chongqing]]\n[[Category:Rock reliefs in China]]\n[[Category:7th-century establishments in China]]\n[[Category:Chinese architectural history]]\n", "name_user": "Aljmajor", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazu_Rock_Carvings"}

Cora was then a baseball analyst for [[ESPN]] before becoming a coach and manager.\n\nIn November 2019, Cora was implicated in a [[Houston Astros sign stealing scandal|sign-stealing scandal]] during his time as a coach with the [[Houston Astros]].<ref name=carobeltran/> Amid an investigation to determine if he took part in another such scandal during his time managing the Red Sox,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2870185-mlbs-war-on-sign-stealing-shifts-to-alex-cora-and-the-boston-red-sox |title=MLB's War on Sign-Stealing Shifts to Alex Cora and the Boston Red Sox |first=Zachary D. |last=Rymer |website=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=January 8, 2020 |accessdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref> Cora and the Red Sox mutually agreed to part ways in January 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/redsox/2020/01/14/alex-cora-out-red-sox-manager/SHuDNO9tab46sz6wVeqvxH/story.html|title=Alex Cora out as Red Sox manager - The Boston Globe|website=BostonGlobe.com|language=en-US|date=2020-01-14|access-date=2020-01-15|url-access=limited}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\n===Early career===\nCora was drafted in the 12th round of the [[1993 Major League Baseball draft]] by the [[Minnesota Twins]], but did not sign a contract and decided instead to play collegiate baseball at the [[University of Miami]]. While there, Cora was named to the [[College World Series]] all-tournament team in both 1995 and 1996. He led the team to the title game in [[1996 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|1996]], a game they lost to [[Louisiana State University]].\n\nCora was rated by ''[[Baseball America]]'' as the best collegiate defensive player going into the [[1996 Major League Baseball draft|1996 draft]]. Cora was drafted by the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the third round, and played 61 games of the 1996 season with the [[Minor League Baseball#Class A-Advanced|Class A-Advanced]] [[Vero Beach Dodgers]], batting .257 with no home runs and 26 RBIs. He played the 1997 season with the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[San Antonio Missions]]; in 127 games he batted .234 with 3 home runs and 48 RBIs. Cora spent parts of the 1998, 1999, and 2000 seasons with the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Albuquerque Dukes]], hitting .264 in 81 games, .308 in 80 games, and .373 in 30 games, respectively.\n\n===Los Angeles Dodgers===\nCora made his major league debut on June 7, 1998, with the Dodgers against the [[Seattle Mariners]]; his brother [[Joey Cora]] was Seattle's starting second baseman in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1998/B06070SEA1998.htm |title=Los Angeles Dodgers 7, Seattle Mariners 4 |website=[[Retrosheet]] |date=June 7, 1998}}</ref> Alex Cora spent the next seven years in Los Angeles, appearing in a total of 684 games while batting .246 with 27 home runs and 173 RBIs. During his time with the Dodgers, he played at second base and shortstop. During the 2000 and 2001 seasons, Cora mostly played shortstop as the Dodgers moved the aging [[Mark Grudzielanek]] to second base.  With the emergence of [[C\u00e9sar Izturis]] in 2002, and the trade of Grudzielanek to the [[Chicago Cubs]] in December of the same year, Cora spent the rest of his stint with the Dodgers as their primary second baseman.\n\nCora played in one postseason series with the Dodgers, the [[2004 National League Division Series|2004 NLDS]], which the Dodgers lost to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Cora was the Dodgers' second baseman in all four games, batting 2-for-15 (.133) during the series.\n\n===Cleveland Indians===\nIn January 2005, Cora signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]], where he appeared in 49 games, with 22 starts at shortstop and 14 at second base; he batted .205 with a home run and 8 RBIs.

In the [[2005 American League Division Series|2005 ALDS]], which Boston lost to the [[Chicago White Sox]] in a three-game sweep, Cora played in one game as a defensive replacement, without a [[plate appearance]].\n\nCora was originally intended to back up shortstop [[\u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda]]. With the trade of Renter\u00eda to the [[Atlanta Braves]] in December 2005, Cora was being eyed to take the position of starting shortstop, until the Red Sox acquired [[\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez (infielder, born 1977)|\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez]] in February 2006. For the 2006 season, Cora appeared in 96 games, batting .238 with one home run and 18 RBIs.\n\nCora was a member of the Red Sox team that won the [[2007 World Series]]. During the regular season, he appeared in 83 games and batted .246 with 3 home runs and 18 RBIs. In the postseason, he appeared as a late-innings defensive replacement in two games of the [[2007 American League Championship Series|2007 ALCS]] and two games of the World Series. He had one [[plate appearance]], a [[sacrifice bunt]] in [[2007 World Series#Game 3|World Series game 3]].\n\nFor the 2008 regular season, Cora played in 75 games, batting .270 with no home runs and 9 RBIs.

With the emergence of [[C\u00e9sar Izturis]] in 2002, and the trade of Grudzielanek to the [[Chicago Cubs]] in December of the same year, Cora spent the rest of his stint with the Dodgers as their primary second baseman.\n\nCora played in one postseason series with the Dodgers, the [[2004 National League Division Series|2004 NLDS]], which the Dodgers lost to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Cora was the Dodgers' second baseman in all four games, batting 2-for-15 (.133) during the series.\n\n===Cleveland Indians===\nIn January 2005, Cora signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]], where he appeared in 49 games, with 22 starts at shortstop and 14 at second base; he batted .205 with a home run and 8 RBIs. On July 7,2005, Cora was traded to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for infielder [[Ram\u00f3n V\u00e1zquez]].\n\n===Boston Red Sox===\n[[File:Alexcora.jpg|280px|thumb|Cora with the Red Sox, turning a double-play against the [[Los Angeles Angels]] at [[Fenway Park]] on April 16, 2007]]\nCora made his Red Sox debut on July 7, 2005, and through the end of the regular season appeared in a total of 47 games for Boston, batting .269 with 2 home runs and 16 RBIs. In the [[2005 American League Division Series|2005 ALDS]], which Boston lost to the [[Chicago White Sox]] in a three-game sweep, Cora played in one game as a defensive replacement, without a [[plate appearance]].\n\nCora was originally intended to back up shortstop [[\u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda]]. With the trade of Renter\u00eda to the [[Atlanta Braves]] in December 2005, Cora was being eyed to take the position of starting shortstop, until the Red Sox acquired [[\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez (infielder, born 1977)|\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez]] in February 2006. For the 2006 season, Cora appeared in 96 games, batting .238 with one home run and 18 RBIs.\n\nCora was a member of the Red Sox team that won the [[2007 World Series]]. During the regular season, he appeared in 83 games and batted .246 with 3 home runs and 18 RBIs. In the postseason, he appeared as a late-innings defensive replacement in two games of the [[2007 American League Championship Series|2007 ALCS]] and two games of the World Series. He had one [[plate appearance]], a [[sacrifice bunt]] in [[2007 World Series#Game 3|World Series game 3]].\n\nFor the 2008 regular season, Cora played in 75 games, batting .270 with no home runs and 9 RBIs. He appeared in four postseason games; two games of the [[2008 American League Division Series|2008 ALDS]], which Boston won, and two games of the [[2008 American League Championship Series|2008 ALCS]], which Boston lost. He batted 4-for-26 (.154) with no home runs and one RBI. These games were the final postseason appearances for Cora as a player.\n\nOn October 30, 2008, Cora became a free agent. In his four seasons with Boston, he appeared in 301 regular season games, batting .252 with 6 home runs and 61 RBIs.\n\n===New York Mets===\nOn January 22, 2009, Cora signed a one-year deal with the [[New York Mets]].<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090122&content_id=3764362&vkey=pr_nym&fext=.jsp&c_id=nym |title=Mets sign Alex Cora to a one-year contract |website=[[MLB.com]] |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=October 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021003548/http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090122&content_id=3764362&vkey=pr_nym&fext=.jsp&c_id=nym |archive-date=October 21, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> During the 2009 season, he appeared in 82 games, batting .251 with one home run and 18 RBIs.

Its residents are known as Oklahomans (or colloquially, \"[[Okie]]s\"), and its capital and largest city is [[Oklahoma City]].\n\nThe state's name is derived from the [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]] words {{wikt-lang|cho|okla}} and {{lang|cho|humma}}, meaning \"red people\".<ref name=\"Oklahoma's Name\" /> It is also known informally by its nickname, \"[[Sooners|The Sooner State]]\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on land before the official opening date of lands in the western Oklahoma Territory or before the [[Indian Appropriations Act]] of 1889, which increased [[European Americans|European-American]] settlement in the eastern [[Indian Territory]]. [[Oklahoma Territory]] and [[Indian Territory]] were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16, 1907.\n\nWith ancient mountain ranges, [[prairie]], [[mesa]]s, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the [[Great Plains]], [[Cross Timbers]], and the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]], all regions prone to [[Supercell|severe weather]].<ref name=\"Oklahoma Terrain\"/> Oklahoma is on a confluence of three major American [[cultural area|cultural regions]] and historically served as a route for [[cattle drive]]s, a destination for Southern settlers, and a government-sanctioned [[territories of the United States|territory]] for Native Americans.

Choctaw Nation Chief [[Allen Wright]] suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government on the use of [[Indian Territory]], in which he envisioned an all-Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs.

It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|20th-most extensive]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|28th-most populous]] of the 50 United States. Its residents are known as Oklahomans (or colloquially, \"[[Okie]]s\"), and its capital and largest city is [[Oklahoma City]].\n\nThe state's name is derived from the [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]] words {{wikt-lang|cho|okla}} and {{lang|cho|humma}}, meaning \"red people\".<ref name=\"Oklahoma's Name\" /> It is also known informally by its nickname, \"[[Sooners|The Sooner State]]\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on land before the official opening date of lands in the western Oklahoma Territory or before the [[Indian Appropriations Act]] of 1889, which increased [[European Americans|European-American]] settlement in the eastern [[Indian Territory]]. [[Oklahoma Territory]] and [[Indian Territory]] were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it became the 46th state to enter the union on November 16, 1907.\n\nWith ancient mountain ranges, [[prairie]], [[mesa]]s, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the [[Great Plains]], [[Cross Timbers]], and the [[U.S. Interior Highlands]], all regions prone to [[Supercell|severe weather]].<ref name=\"Oklahoma Terrain\"/> Oklahoma is on a confluence of three major American [[cultural area|cultural regions]] and historically served as a route for [[cattle drive]]s, a destination for Southern settlers, and a government-sanctioned [[territories of the United States|territory]] for Native Americans. More than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma.<ref name=\"languages\"/>\n\nA major producer of [[natural gas]], [[petroleum|oil]], and agricultural products, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and [[biotechnology]].<ref name=\"Oklahoma's Economy 1\"/> Both Oklahoma City and [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] serve as Oklahoma's primary economic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their [[metropolitan statistical area]]s.<ref name=\"metros\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/CBSA-EST2006-01.csv |title=Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2006 |website=[[United States Census Bureau]] |format=csv |accessdate=September 15, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914155415/http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/CBSA-EST2006-01.csv |archivedate=September 14, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name ''Oklahoma'' comes from the [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]] phrase ''okla'' ''humma'', literally meaning ''red people''. Choctaw Nation Chief [[Allen Wright]] suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government on the use of [[Indian Territory]], in which he envisioned an all-Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Equivalent to the English word ''Indian'', ''okla humma'' was a phrase in the Choctaw language that described Native American people as a whole. ''Oklahoma'' later became the de facto name for [[Oklahoma Territory]], and it was officially approved in 1890, two years after the area was opened to white settlers.<ref name=\"Oklahoma's Name\">{{cite web|title=Chronicles of Oklahoma |first=Muriel |last=Wright |publisher=Oklahoma State University |date=June 1936 |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v014/v014p156.html |accessdate=July 31, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013231154/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v014/v014p156.html |archivedate=October 13, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | year=2007| url=http://www.state.ok.us/osfdocs/stinfo2.html | title=Oklahoma State History and Information | website=A Look at Oklahoma | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation | accessdate=June 7, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060729003635/http://www.state.ok.us/osfdocs/stinfo2.html|archivedate=July 29, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Merserve |first=John |year=1941 |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v019/v019p314.html |title=Chief Allen Wright |website=Chronicles of Oklahoma |accessdate=June 7, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507052851/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v019/v019p314.html |archivedate=May 7, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe name of the state is {{lang-paw|Uukuhu\u00fawa}},<ref>{{cite web |title=\"River\", Southband Pawnee |website=American Indian Studies Research Institute |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |url=http://zia.aisri.indiana.edu/~dictsearch/cgi-bin/testengltoxsrchNP.pl?host=ziasrchlang=English&srchstring=okla&database=south }}</ref> and {{lang-cay|Gahnawiyo\u02c0geh}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cayuga: Our Oral Legacy |website=Cayuga Digital Dictionary |accessdate=May 27, 2012 |url=http://www.cayugalanguage.ca/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326050632/http://www.cayugalanguage.ca/ |archivedate=March 26, 2012 }}</ref> In the [[Chickasaw language]], the state is known as [[wikt:en:Oklahomma'|Oklahomma']], and in [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]] as ''bo'oobe''' (literally meaning ''red earth'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://studylib.net/doc/18549534/dictionary-of-the-arapaho-language|title=Dictionary of the Arapaho Language|website=studylib.net|accessdate=February 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geography of Oklahoma}}\n{{see also|List of Oklahoma tri-points}}\n[[File:Oklahoma K\u00f6ppen.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|K\u00f6ppen climate types of Oklahoma]]\n[[File:Rose rocks.jpg|thumb|State rock ([[Desert rose (crystal)|rose rock]]) specimens from Cleveland County]]\n[[File:Illinois River Oklahoma.jpg|alt=|thumb|Illinois River in northeastern Oklahoma]]\n[[File:Elk Mountain, OK.jpg|thumb|Elk Mountain, in the eastern Wichita Mountains, southwestern Oklahoma|alt=]]\n\nOklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United States, covering an area of {{Convert|69899|sqmi}}, with {{Convert|68595|sqmi}} of land and {{Convert|1304|sqmi}} of water.<ref name=2010census>{{cite web | url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf | title=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts, 2010 Census of Population and Housing | publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] | pages=V\u20132, 1 & 41 (Tables 1 & 18) | date=September 2012 | accessdate=October 11, 2018}}</ref> It lies partly in the [[Great Plains]] near the geographical center of the 48 [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]].
