The club plays in the [[Belarusian Premier League]], the top division in Belarusian football. Their home stadium is [[Vitebsky Central Sport Complex]].\n\n== History ==\nThe club was founded in 1960 as '''Krasnoye Znamya Vitebsk''' (''Red Flag Vitebsk''). They began playing in Soviet Class B (second-tier league) the same year. After three seasons, they relegated to the third tier. Vitebsk team would spend almost all of their subsequent Soviet-era seasons playing at the third level ([[Soviet Second League]]), with the exception of 1970 and 1990, when the team dropped to 4th level. The club went through several name changes. In 1963, they were renamed '''Dvina Vitebsk''' after [[Western Dvina|local river]]. In 1985, the club was renamed '''Vityaz Vitebsk''' and in 1989   it was renamed '''KIM Vitebsk''' (both names relate to local industry companies).\n\nIn 1992 KIM joined [[Belarusian Premier League]]. During the 90s KIM (later renamed '''Dvina Vitebsk''' again in 1994 and '''Lokomotiv-96 Vitebsk''' in 1996) was one of the league top teams. They were league runners-up in 1992\u201393 and 1994\u201395, finished third in 1993\u201394 and 1997 and also won the [[Belarusian Cup]] in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fc.vitebsk.by/index.php?sl=club&mode=history|title=\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u0424\u041a \"\u0412\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0431\u0441\u043a\"|website=fc.vitebsk.by}}</ref> Since the 2000s, the club's results declined. They have relegated to the [[Belarusian First League|First League]] several times and promoted back and were never able to fight the title in later years. In 2003, they shortened their name to '''Lokomotiv Vitebsk''' and in 2006 to the current version, '''FC Vitebsk'''.\n\n=== Name changes ===\n*1960: founded as Krasnoye Znamya Vitebsk\n*1963: renamed

The club plays in the [[Belarusian Premier League]], the top division in Belarusian football. Their home stadium is [[Vitebsky Central Sport Complex]].\n\n== History ==\nThe club was founded in 1960 as '''Krasnoye Znamya Vitebsk''' (''Red Flag Vitebsk''). They began playing in Soviet Class B (second-tier league) the same year. After three seasons they relegated to the third tier. Vitebsk team would spend almost all of their subsequent Soviet-era seasons playing at the third level ([[Soviet Second League]]), with the exception of 1970 and 1990, when the team dropped to 4th level. The club went through several name changes. In 1963, they were renamed '''Dvina Vitebsk''' after [[Western Dvina|local river]]. In 1985, the club was renamed '''Vityaz Vitebsk''' and in 1989   it was renamed '''KIM Vitebsk''' (both names relate to local industry companies).\n\nIn 1992 KIM joined [[Belarusian Premier League]]. During the 90s KIM (later renamed '''Dvina Vitebsk''' again in 1994 and '''Lokomotiv-96 Vitebsk''' in 1996) was one of the league top teams. They were league runners-up in 1992\u201393 and 1994\u201395, finished third in 1993\u201394 and 1997 and also won [[Belarusian Cup]] in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fc.vitebsk.by/index.php?sl=club&mode=history|title=\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u0424\u041a \"\u0412\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0431\u0441\u043a\"|website=fc.vitebsk.by}}</ref> Since 2000s club's results declined.
