His father died when he was 8 or 9 years old, and since his mother had already died, he was adopted by his paternal uncle, U.S. Congressman [[Daniel Sheffey]] (1770-1830), a Federalist and lawyer who had moved to [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]]. Hugh Sheffey entered [[Yale College]] at the end of the freshman year, after his uncle's death. Graduating in 1835, Hugh Sheffey taught for a few years in Southside Virginia, as well as read law with the Hon. [[Thomas Saunders Gholson|Thomas S. Gholson]] in [[Brunswick, Virginia|Brunswick]]. Hugh was the middle of five brothers. His eldest brother Daniel Henry Sheffey (1812-1871) was blind and traveled extensively with a black companion; his next eldest brother Dr. [[James White Sheffey]] Sr. (1813-1876) remained in southwest Virginia, became a delegate to the [[Virginia Secession Convention of 1861]] and later the [[Virginia House of Delegates]]; his younger brother Dr. Lawrence Brengeler Sheffey Sr. (1818-1866) practiced in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]; his youngest brother [[Robert Sheffey|Robert Sayers Sheffey]] (1820-1902) became a prominent and idiosyncratic circuit-riding Methodist evangelist in Appalachia.\n\nOn December 23, 1847, Hugh Sheffey married Louisa Cole (1820-1889) of [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. Their marriage lasted more than four decades and they had at least two daughters: Sara Louisa Sheffey (b. 1850): and Margaret (Maggie) Sheffey (b. 1851).<ref>Sara Louisa had left the household by the 1880 census.

In 1846 Augusta county voters elected him to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] as one of their two delegates. During the next decades he remained in public life (part-time).

Tate and James Walker. Re-elected two years later fellow delegates elected him their Speaker during Virginia's secession.<ref>Leonard pp.478, 483</ref> Sheffey was originally a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] man, and unlike his elder brother Dr. James W. Sheffey, Hugh Sheffey had declined to stand for election to [[Virginia Secession Convention of 1861|the convention]] which had passed the ordinance of [[Secession in the United States|secession]]. However, when Virginia's voters approved secession, Sheffey stood by his state.\n\nAfter Virginia conceded defeat, fellow legislators elected Sheffey a judge of the local Circuit Court, and he continued on the bench until the winter of 1869, when he was removed during [[Congressional Reconstruction]] because he could not take the [[Ironclad oath|\"iron-clad\" oath]] required by the federal government. Sheffey then resumed his legal practice and remained in Staunton until his death.\n\nHe was very active in [[Trinity Episcopal Church (Staunton, Virginia)|Trinity Episcopal Church]].

Sheffey, Hugh Sheffey had declined to stand for election to [[Virginia Secession Convention of 1861|the convention]] which had passed the ordinance of [[Secession in the United States|secession]]. However, when Virginia's voters approved secession, Sheffey stood by his state.\n\nAfter Virginia conceded defeat, fellow legislators elected Sheffey a judge of the local Circuit Court, and he continued on the bench until the winter of 1869, when he was removed during [[Congressional Reconstruction]] because he could not take the [[Ironclad oath|\"iron-clad\" oath]] required by the federal government. Sheffey then resumed his legal practice and remained in Staunton until his death.\n\nHe was very active in [[Trinity Episcopal Church (Staunton, Virginia)|Trinity Episcopal Church]].

After he was discharged, Davenport became a successful merchant and traded with the local tribes in the [[Illinois Territory|Illinois]] and [[Iowa Territory|Iowa territories]] for several years.

Two years later, he and six others (including close friend [[Antoine LeClaire]]), purchased a large tract of land along the [[Mississippi River]] opposite the island. On this site, the town of [[Davenport, Iowa]], was officially founded on February 23, 1836. In 1838, he succeeded U.S. [[Indian agent]] [[Joseph M.

Colonel Davenport stayed behind, however; and sometime during the late afternoon, a band of local bandits forced their way into Davenport's home. Accounts differ as to the nature of the assault, as one version claims he was shot by the burglars while another states the elderly Bowman <!-- who is this? -->was severely beaten when his assailants found there was far less money in the safe than they had first believed. Davenport was still alive when the men finally left his home and was able to describe them to authorities before he died.\n\nThe suspects were traced to a loosely organized [[Midwestern United States|Middle West]] ruffian gang, operating out of northern Illinois, known as the \"[[Banditti of the Prairie]]\". Detective and bounty hunter [[Edward Bonney]] volunteered to infiltrate the gang and was able to arrest eight men, including [[Robert H. Birch]].

During the [[Black Hawk War]], he was made an assistant [[quartermaster]] with a commission of [[colonel (United States)|colonel]] by Governor [[John Reynolds (US politician)|John Reynolds]].\n\nIn 1833, Davenport moved from his double log cabin and built his home on a lower part of Rock Island near the old fort. Two years later, he and six others (including close friend [[Antoine LeClaire]]), purchased a large tract of land along the [[Mississippi River]] opposite the island. On this site, the town of [[Davenport, Iowa]], was officially founded on February 23, 1836. In 1838, he succeeded U.S. [[Indian agent]] [[Joseph M.

He often travelled to [[St. Louis, Missouri]], sailing on his [[keel boat]], and resided there or in [[Washington, Missouri|Washington City]] during the winter months.

Colonel Davenport stayed behind, however; and sometime during the late afternoon, a band of local bandits forced their way into Davenport's home. Accounts differ as to the nature of the assault, as one version claims he was shot by the burglars while another states the elderly Bowman <!-- who is this? -->was severely beaten when his assailants found there was far less money in the safe than they had first believed. Davenport was still alive when the men finally left his home and was able to describe them to authorities before he died.\n\nThe suspects were traced to a loosely organized [[Midwestern United States|Middle West]] ruffian gang, operating out of northern Illinois, known as the \"[[Banditti of the Prairie]]\". Detective and bounty hunter [[Edward Bonney]] volunteered to infiltrate the gang and was able to arrest eight men, including [[Robert H. Birch]]. Although one man escaped and another disappeared, the others stood trial and were convicted of murder. Two received prison sentences <ref>Morgan, Bob.

He represented Middlesex County for one term, before fellow legislators elected him in 1875 to an eight year term as a judge of the 8th Circuit Court, which he died before finishing.<ref>Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond, Virginia State Library 1978), pp. xvii, xxx, 444, 472, 474, 475, 481, 486, 518</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nJudge Montague died at home of [[erysipelas]]<ref>1880 U.S. Census death schedule for Middlesex County, Virginia; he is the only entry on the page with that cause of death</ref> on March 2, 1880, and was succeeded as judge of the 8th Circuit by [[Benjamin W.

Current seats and party affiliations on the [[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority]] will be different for certain members.<ref name=\"elevated seniority2\">Delegates are non-voting members and Representatives are voting members of the United States House of Representatives.</ref>\n\nSeniority depends on the date on which members were sworn into office. Since many members are sworn in on the same day, subsequent ranking is based on previous congressional service of the individual and then by alphabetical order by the last name of the congressman.\n\nCommittee chairmanship in the House is often associated with seniority. However, party leadership is typically not associated with seniority.\n\nNote: The \"*\" indicates that the [[legislator|representative]]/[[Delegate (United States Congress)|delegate]] may have served one or more non-consecutive terms while in the House of Representatives of the [[United States Congress]].\n\n==U.S. House Seniority List==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+U.S. House Seniority\n|- valign=bottom\n!
