Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]'s party ate sled dogs during his expedition to the South Pole. This allowed the party to carry less food, thus lightening the load.<ref name=southpole /> When comparing sled dogs to ponies as draught animals he also notes:\n<blockquote>there is the obvious advantage that dog can be fed on dog. One can reduce one's pack little by little, slaughtering the feebler ones and feeding the chosen with them. In this way they get fresh meat. Our dogs lived on dog's flesh and [[pemmican]] the whole way, and this enabled them to do splendid work. And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet; it tasted to us as good as the best beef. The dogs do not object at all; as long as they get their share they do not mind what part of their comrade's carcass it comes from. All that was left after one of these canine meals was the teeth of the victim \u2013 and if it had been a really hard day, these also disappeared.<ref name=southpole >{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/tsp1210h.htm#intro|title=The South Pole|first=Roald|last=Amundsen|access-date=2009-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926120454/http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/tsp1210h.htm#intro|archive-date=2009-09-26|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Douglas Mawson]] and [[Xavier Mertz]] were part of the [[Far Eastern Party]], a three-man sledging team with [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis|Lieutenant B.E.S. Ninnis]], to survey King George V Land, Antarctica. On 14 December 1912 Ninnis fell through a snow-covered crevasse along with most of the party's rations, and was never seen again. Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one and a half weeks' food for themselves and nothing at all for the dogs. Their meagre provisions forced them to eat their remaining sled dogs on their {{convert|315|mi|km|adj=on}} return journey. Their meat was tough, stringy and without a vestige of fat. Each animal yielded very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs, which ate the meat, skin and bones until nothing remained. The men also ate the dog's brains and livers. Unfortunately eating the liver of sled dogs produces the condition [[hypervitaminosis A]] because canines have a much higher tolerance for vitamin A than humans do. Mertz suffered a quick deterioration. He developed stomach pains and became incapacitated and incoherent. On 7 January 1913, Mertz died. Mawson continued alone, eventually making it back to camp alive.<ref name=\"Mawson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6137/6137-h/6137-h.htm#2HCH0013|title=The Home of the Blizzard|first=Douglas|last=Mawson}}</ref>\n\n===Asia/Pacific===\n==== Armenia ====\nArmenia has no animal welfare laws, including any prohibition on killing dogs for consumption.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==== Azerbaijan ====\nAzerbaijan laws do not explicitly prohibit killing dogs for consumption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.azpromo.az:80/uploads/legislation/Civil_code_eng_51b1e34e863c1.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516181155/http://www.azpromo.az:80/uploads/legislation/Civil_code_eng_51b1e34e863c1.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 May 2017|title=Wayback Machine|date=16 May 2017|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Afghanistan ====\nAfghanistan has no animal welfare laws.<ref name=\":02\" /> As an Islamic nation, consumption of dog meat is strictly prohibited.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.khaama.com/sellers-of-dog-meat-jailed-for-13-years-in-herat-province-8950/|title=Sellers of dog meat jailed for 13 years in Herat province|date=15 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2015|publisher=[[Khaama Press]]}}</ref>\n\n==== Cambodia ====\nAnimal welfare NGO [[Four Paws]] estimates that 2-3 million dogs are slaughtered annually for their meat in Cambodia.

This is thought to ensure good health by balancing one's \"[[qi]]\", the believed vital energy of the body.

Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]'s party ate sled dogs during his expedition to the South Pole. This allowed the party to carry less food, thus lightening the load.<ref name=southpole /> When comparing sled dogs to ponies as draught animals he also notes:\n<blockquote>there is the obvious advantage that dog can be fed on dog. One can reduce one's pack little by little, slaughtering the feebler ones and feeding the chosen with them. In this way they get fresh meat. Our dogs lived on dog's flesh and [[pemmican]] the whole way, and this enabled them to do splendid work. And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet; it tasted to us as good as the best beef. The dogs do not object at all; as long as they get their share they do not mind what part of their comrade's carcass it comes from. All that was left after one of these canine meals was the teeth of the victim \u2013 and if it had been a really hard day, these also disappeared.<ref name=southpole >{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/tsp1210h.htm#intro|title=The South Pole|first=Roald|last=Amundsen|access-date=2009-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926120454/http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/tsp1210h.htm#intro|archive-date=2009-09-26|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Douglas Mawson]] and [[Xavier Mertz]] were part of the [[Far Eastern Party]], a three-man sledging team with [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis|Lieutenant B.E.S. Ninnis]], to survey King George V Land, Antarctica. On 14 December 1912 Ninnis fell through a snow-covered crevasse along with most of the party's rations, and was never seen again. Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one and a half weeks' food for themselves and nothing at all for the dogs. Their meagre provisions forced them to eat their remaining sled dogs on their {{convert|315|mi|km|adj=on}} return journey. Their meat was tough, stringy and without a vestige of fat. Each animal yielded very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs, which ate the meat, skin and bones until nothing remained. The men also ate the dog's brains and livers.

Dog meat is also believed to increase the body temperature, so people sweat more to keep one cool during the summer (the way of dealing with heat is called ''Heal heat with heat'' (\uc774\uc5f4\uce58\uc5f4, \u4ee5\u71b1\u6cbb\u71b1, ''i-yeol-chi-yeol''). A 19th-century version of ''gaejang-guk'' explains the preparation of the dish by boiling dog meat with vegetables such as [[scallion|green onions]] and [[chili powder|chili pepper powder]].

For example, the [[margin of error]] in [[opinion poll|polling]] data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times.  This derivation of a standard deviation is often called the \"[[standard error]]\" of the estimate or \"standard error of the mean\" when referring to a mean.  It is computed as the standard deviation of all the means that would be computed from that population if an infinite number of samples were drawn and a mean for each sample were computed.\n\nThe standard deviation of a population and the standard error of a statistic derived from that population (such as the mean) are quite different but related (related by the inverse of the square root of the number of observations). The reported margin of error of a poll is computed from the standard error of the mean (or alternatively from the product of the standard deviation of the population and the inverse of the square root of the sample size, which is the same thing) and is typically about twice the standard deviation\u2014the half-width of a 95 percent [[confidence interval]].\n\nIn science, many researchers report the standard deviation of experimental data, and by convention, only effects more than two standard deviations away from a null expectation are considered [[statistically significant]]\u2014normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from likely genuine effects or associations.  The standard deviation is also important in finance, where the standard deviation on the [[rate of return]] on an investment is a measure of the [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] of the investment.\n\nWhen only a [[statistical sample|sample]] of data from a population is available, the term ''standard deviation of the sample'' or ''sample standard deviation'' can refer to either the above-mentioned quantity as applied to those data, or to a modified quantity that is an unbiased estimate of the ''population standard deviation'' (the standard deviation of the entire population).\n\n==Basic examples==\n\n===Sample standard deviation of metabolic rate of northern fulmars===\n\nLogan<ref name=\"Logan2010\">{{Citation\n|last1= Logan\n|first1= Murray\n|title= Biostatistical Design and Analysis Using R\n|edition=First\t\n|year=2010\n|publisher= Wiley-Blackwell\n| url = http://users.monash.edu.au/~murray/BDAR/\n}}\n</ref>\ngives the following example.

By visual inspection, it appears that the variability of the metabolic rate is greater for males than for females.\n\n[[File:Metabolic rates for northern fulmars.svg|Graph of metabolic rates for northern fulmars]]\n\nThe sample standard deviation of the metabolic rate for the female fulmars is calculated as follows. The formula for the sample standard deviation is\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 },</math>\n\nwhere \n<math>\\textstyle\\{x_1,\\,x_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,x_N\\}</math> are the observed values of the sample items, <math>\\textstyle\\bar{x}</math> is the mean value of these observations, and\n''N'' is the number of observations in the sample.\n\nIn the sample standard deviation formula, for this example, the numerator is the sum of the squared deviation of each individual animal's metabolic rate from the mean metabolic rate. The table below shows the calculation of this sum of squared deviations for the female fulmars. For females, the sum of squared deviations is 886047.09, as shown in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Sum of squares calculation for female fulmars\n|-\n! Animal !! Sex !! Metabolic rate !!

In this example, there are ''N'' = 6 females, so the denominator is 6 \u2013 1 = 5. The sample standard deviation for the female fulmars is therefore\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{N-1} } = \\sqrt{\\frac{886047.09}{5}} = 420.96.</math>\n\nFor the male fulmars, a similar calculation gives a sample standard deviation of 894.37, approximately twice as large as the standard deviation for the females. The graph shows the metabolic rate data, the means (red dots), and the standard deviations (red lines) for females and males.\n\n[[File:SD of metabolic rate of fulmars.svg|Graph of standard deviation of metabolic rate of fulmars]]\n\nUse of the sample standard deviation implies that these 14 fulmars are a sample from a larger population of fulmars. If these 14 fulmars comprised the entire population (perhaps the last 14 surviving fulmars), then instead of the sample standard deviation, the calculation would use the population standard deviation. In the population standard deviation formula, the denominator is ''N'' instead of ''N'' - 1. It is rare that measurements can be taken for an entire population, so, by default, statistical [[computer program]]s calculate the sample standard deviation. Similarly, journal articles report the sample standard deviation unless otherwise specified.\n\n===Population standard deviation of grades of eight students===\n\nSuppose that the entire population of interest was eight students in a particular class. For a finite set of numbers, the population standard deviation is found by taking the [[square root]] of the [[Arithmetic average|average]] of the squared deviations of the values subtracted from their average value. The marks of a class of eight students (that is, a [[statistical population]]) are the following eight values:\n: <math>2,\\  4,\\  4,\\  4,\\  5,\\  5,\\  7,\\  9.</math>\nThese eight data points have the mean (average) of 5:\n: <math> \\mu = \\frac{2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 9}{8} = 5. </math>\nFirst, calculate the deviations of each data point from the mean, and [[square (algebra)|square]] the result of each:\n: <math>\n    \\begin{array}{lll}\n    (2-5)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9  &&  (5-5)^2 = 0^2 = 0 \\\\\n    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (5-5)^2 = 0^2 = 0 \\\\\n    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (7-5)^2 = 2^2 = 4 \\\\\n    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (9-5)^2 = 4^2 = 16. \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n  </math>\nThe [[variance]] is the mean of these values:\n<!-- Notice:  DO NOT CHANGE the denominator below to 7. If you don't understand why it is 8, read the Talk page. -->\n:<math>\\sigma^2 = \\frac{9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 16}{8} = 4.</math><!-- DO NOT CHANGE the denominator to 7. See talk page-->\n\nand the ''population'' standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{ 4 } = 2.</math>\nThis <!-- 1.  the ''population'' standard deviation, 2. \"the ''population'' standard deviation is equal to the square root of the [[variance]]\" --> formula is valid only if the eight values with which we began form the complete population. If the values instead were a random sample drawn from some large parent population (for example, they were 8 students randomly and independently chosen from a class of 2&nbsp;million), then one often divides by {{nowrap|7&nbsp;(which is ''n'' \u2212 1)}} instead of {{nowrap|8&nbsp;(which is ''n'')}} in the denominator of the last formula. In that case the result of the original formula would be called the ''sample'' standard deviation. Dividing by ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 rather than by ''n'' gives an unbiased estimate of the variance of the larger parent population. This is known as ''[[Bessel's correction]]''.<ref>{{MathWorld|urlname=BesselsCorrection|title=Bessel's Correction}}</ref>\n\n===Standard deviation of average height for adult men===\n\nIf the population of interest is approximately normally distributed, the standard deviation provides information on the proportion of observations above or below certain values. For example, the [[Average human height|average height for adult men]] in the [[United States]] is about 70&nbsp;inches (177.8&nbsp;cm), with a standard deviation of around 3&nbsp;inches (7.62&nbsp;cm). This means that most men (about 68%, assuming a [[normal distribution]]) have a height within 3&nbsp;inches (7.62&nbsp;cm) of the mean (67\u201373&nbsp;inches (170.18\u2013185.42&nbsp;cm)){{snd}}one standard deviation{{snd}}and almost all men (about 95%) have a height within 6&nbsp;inches (15.24&nbsp;cm) of the mean (64\u201376&nbsp;inches (162.56\u2013193.04&nbsp;cm)){{snd}}two standard deviations. If the standard deviation were zero, then all men would be exactly 70&nbsp;inches (177.8&nbsp;cm) tall. If the standard deviation were 20&nbsp;inches (50.8&nbsp;cm), then men would have much more variable heights, with a typical range of about 50\u201390&nbsp;inches (127\u2013228.6&nbsp;cm). Three standard deviations account for 99.7% of the sample population being studied, assuming the distribution is [[Normal distribution|normal]] (bell-shaped). (See the [[68-95-99.7 rule]], or the ''empirical rule,'' for more information.)\n\n==Definition of population values==\nLet ''X'' be a [[random variable]] with mean value ''\u03bc'':\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}[X] = \\mu.\\,\\!</math>\nHere the operator E denotes the average or [[expected value]] of ''X''.  Then the standard deviation of ''X'' is the quantity\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\sigma & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[(X - \\mu)^2]}\\\\\n         & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] + \\operatorname E[-2 \\mu X] + \\operatorname E[\\mu^2]}\\\\\n            & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] -2 \\mu \\operatorname E[X] + \\mu^2}\\\\\n         & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] -2 \\mu^2 + \\mu^2}\\\\\n           & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] - \\mu^2}\\\\\n         & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2]-(\\operatorname E[X])^2}\n\\end{align}</math>\n(derived using the [[expected value#Basic properties|properties of expected value]]).\n\nIn other words, the standard deviation ''\u03c3'' ([[sigma]]) is the square root of the [[variance]] of ''X''; i.e., it is the square root of the average value of (''X''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03bc'')<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe standard deviation of a ([[univariate]]) probability distribution is the same as that of a random variable having that distribution.  Not all random variables have a standard deviation, since these expected values need not exist. For example, the standard deviation of a random variable that follows a [[Cauchy distribution]] is undefined because its expected value ''\u03bc'' is undefined.\n\n===Discrete random variable===\nIn the case where ''X'' takes random values from a finite data set ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>N</sub>'', with each value having the same probability, the standard deviation is\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\left[(x_1-\\mu)^2 + (x_2-\\mu)^2 + \\cdots + (x_N - \\mu)^2\\right]}, {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\frac{1}{N} (x_1 + \\cdots + x_N),</math>\n\nor, using [[summation]] notation,\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2}, {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i.</math><!-- In the previous, not N - 1 but N.  This is the whole population. -->\n\nIf, instead of having equal probabilities, the values have different probabilities, let ''x''<sub>1</sub> have probability ''p''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub> have probability ''p''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub> have probability ''p''<sub>''N''</sub>.  In this case, the standard deviation will be\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i(x_i - \\mu)^2} , {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i x_i.</math>\n\n===Continuous random variable===\nThe standard deviation of a [[continuous distribution|continuous real-valued random variable]] ''X'' with [[probability density function]] ''p''(''x'') is\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\int_\\mathbf{X} (x-\\mu)^2 \\, p(x) \\, {\\rm d} x}, {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\int_\\mathbf{X} x \\, p(x) \\, {\\rm d} x,</math>\n\nand where the integrals are [[definite integral]]s taken for ''x'' ranging over the set of possible values of the random variable&nbsp;''X''.\n\nIn the case of a [[parametric model|parametric family of distributions]], the standard deviation can be expressed in terms of the parameters.  For example, in the case of the [[log-normal distribution]] with parameters ''\u03bc'' and ''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>, the standard deviation is\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{(e^{\\sigma^2} - 1)e^{2\\mu + \\sigma^2}}.</math>\n\n==Estimation==\n{{anchor|Estimation}}{{anchor|Sample standard deviation}}\n{{see also|Sample variance}}\n{{main|Unbiased estimation of standard deviation}}\n\nOne can find the standard deviation of an entire population in cases (such as [[Standardized testing (statistics)|standardized testing]]) where every member of a population is sampled. In cases where that cannot be done, the standard deviation ''\u03c3'' is estimated by examining a random sample taken from the population and computing a [[statistic]] of the sample, which is used as an estimate of the population standard deviation. Such a statistic is called an [[estimator]], and the estimator (or the value of the estimator, namely the estimate) is called a sample standard deviation, and is denoted by ''s'' (possibly with modifiers).\n\nUnlike in the case of estimating the population mean, for which the [[sample mean]] is a simple estimator with many desirable properties ([[unbiased estimator|unbiased]], [[Efficient estimator|efficient]], maximum likelihood), there is no single estimator for the standard deviation with all these properties, and [[unbiased estimation of standard deviation]] is a very technically involved problem. Most often, the standard deviation is estimated using the ''[[#Corrected sample standard deviation|corrected sample standard deviation]]'' (using ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), defined below, and this is often referred to as the \"sample standard deviation\", without qualifiers. However, other estimators are better in other respects: the uncorrected estimator (using ''N'') yields lower mean squared error, while using ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5 (for the normal distribution) almost completely eliminates bias.\n\n===Uncorrected sample standard deviation===\nThe formula for the ''population'' standard deviation (of a finite population) can be applied to the sample, using the size of the sample as the size of the population (though the actual population size from which the sample is drawn may be much larger). This estimator, denoted by ''s''<sub>''N''</sub>, is known as the ''uncorrected sample standard deviation'', or sometimes the ''standard deviation of the sample'' (considered as the entire population), and is defined as follows:{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n:<math>\ns_N = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\textstyle\\{x_1,\\,x_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,x_N\\}</math> are the observed values of the sample items and <math>\\textstyle\\bar{x}</math> is the mean value of these observations, while the denominator&nbsp;''N'' stands for the size of the sample: this is the square root of the sample variance, which is the average of the [[squared deviations]] about the sample mean.\n\nThis is a [[consistent estimator]] (it converges in probability to the population value as the number of samples goes to infinity), and is the [[maximum likelihood|maximum-likelihood estimate]] when the population is normally distributed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} However, this is a [[biased estimator]], as the estimates are generally too low. The bias decreases as sample size grows, dropping off as 1/''N'', and thus is most significant for small or moderate sample sizes; for <math>N > 75</math> the bias is below 1%. Thus for very large sample sizes, the uncorrected sample standard deviation is generally acceptable. This estimator also has a uniformly smaller [[mean squared error]] than the corrected sample standard deviation.\n\n===Corrected sample standard deviation===\n\nIf the ''biased [[sample variance]]'' (the second [[central moment]] of the sample, which is a downward-biased estimate of the population variance) is used to compute an estimate of the population's standard deviation, the result is\n\n:<math>\ns_N =\\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}.\n</math>\nHere taking the square root introduces further downward bias, by [[Jensen's inequality]], due to the square root's being a [[concave function]]. The bias in the variance is easily corrected, but the bias from the square root is more difficult to correct, and depends on the distribution in question.\n\nAn unbiased estimator for the ''variance'' is given by applying [[Bessel's correction]], using ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 instead of ''N'' to yield the ''unbiased sample variance,'' denoted ''s''<sup>2</sup>:\n:<math>s^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2.</math>\nThis estimator is unbiased if the variance exists and the sample values are drawn independently with replacement. ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 corresponds to the number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] in the vector of deviations from the mean, <math>\\textstyle(x_1-\\overline{x},\\; \\dots,\\; x_n-\\overline{x}).</math>\n\nTaking square roots reintroduces bias (because the square root is a nonlinear function, which does not [[Commutative property|commute]] with the expectation), yielding the ''corrected sample standard deviation,'' denoted by ''s:''\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}.</math>\nAs explained above, while ''s''<sup>2</sup> is an unbiased estimator for the population variance, ''s'' is still a biased estimator for the population standard deviation, though markedly less biased than the uncorrected sample standard deviation. This estimator is commonly used and generally known simply as the \"sample standard deviation\". The bias may still be large for small samples (''N'' less than 10). As sample size increases, the amount of bias decreases. We obtain more information and the difference between <math>\\frac{1}{N}</math> and <math>\\frac{1}{N-1}</math> becomes smaller.\n\n===Unbiased sample standard deviation===\nFor [[unbiased estimation of standard deviation]], there is no formula that works across all distributions, unlike for mean and variance. Instead, ''s'' is used as a basis, and is scaled by a correction factor to produce an unbiased estimate. For the normal distribution, an unbiased estimator is given by ''s''/''c''<sub>4</sub>, where the correction factor (which depends on ''N'') is given in terms of the [[Gamma function]], and equals:\n:<math>c_4(N)\\,=\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N-1}}\\,\\,\\,\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{N-1}{2}\\right)}.</math>\nThis arises because the sampling distribution of the sample standard deviation follows a (scaled) [[chi distribution]], and the correction factor is the mean of the chi distribution.\n\nAn approximation can be given by replacing ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 with ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5, yielding:\n: <math>\n    \\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N - 1.5} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 },\n  </math>\nThe error in this approximation decays quadratically (as 1/''N''<sup>2</sup>), and it is suited for all but the smallest samples or highest precision: for ''N'' = 3 the bias is equal to 1.3%, and for ''N'' = 9 the bias is already less than 0.1%.\nA more accurate approximation is to replace <math>N-1.5</math> above with <math>N-1.5+1/(8(N-1))</math>.<ref>{{Citation|first1=John |last1=Gurland |first2=Ram C. |last2=Tripathi|title=A Simple Approximation for Unbiased Estimation of the Standard Deviation|journal=The American Statistician|volume=25|issue=4|year=1971|pages=30\u201332|doi=10.2307/2682923|jstor=2682923 }}</ref>\n\nFor other distributions, the correct formula depends on the distribution, but a rule of thumb is to use the further refinement of the approximation:\n: <math>\n    \\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N - 1.5 - \\tfrac14 \\gamma_2} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 },\n  </math>\nwhere ''\u03b3''<sub>2</sub> denotes the population [[excess kurtosis]]. The excess kurtosis may be either known beforehand for certain distributions, or estimated from the data.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Confidence interval of a sampled standard deviation===\n{{see also|Margin of error|Variance#Distribution of the sample variance|Student's_t-distribution#Robust_parametric_modeling}}\nThe standard deviation we obtain by sampling a distribution is itself not absolutely accurate, both for mathematical reasons (explained here by the confidence interval) and for practical reasons of measurement (measurement error). The mathematical effect can be described by the [[confidence interval]] or CI. \nTo show how a larger sample will make the confidence interval narrower, consider the following examples: \nA small population of ''N'' = 2 has only 1 degree of freedom for estimating the standard deviation.  The result is that a 95% CI of the SD runs from 0.45&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD to 31.9&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD;  [[Confidence interval#Statistical theory|the factors here are as follows]]:\n\n:<math> \\Pr \\left( q_{\\frac \\alpha 2} < k \\frac{s^2}{\\sigma^2} < q_{1-\\frac \\alpha 2} \\right) = 1-\\alpha,</math>\n\nwhere <math>q_p</math> is the ''p''-th quantile of the chi-square distribution with ''k'' degrees of freedom, and <math>1-\\alpha</math> is the confidence level.  This is equivalent to the following:\n\n:<math> \\Pr \\left( k \\frac{s^2}{q_{1-\\frac \\alpha 2}} < \\sigma^2 < k \\frac{s^2}{q_{\\frac \\alpha 2}} \\right) = 1-\\alpha.</math>\n\nWith ''k'' = 1, <math>q_{0.025} = 0.000982</math> and <math>q_{0.975} = 5.024</math>.  The reciprocals of the square roots of these two numbers give us the factors 0.45 and 31.9 given above.\n\nA larger population of ''N'' = 10 has 9 degrees of freedom for estimating the standard deviation.  The same computations as above give us in this case a 95% CI running from 0.69&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD to 1.83&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD. So even with a sample population of 10, the actual SD can still be almost a factor 2 higher than the sampled SD. For a sample population N=100, this is down to 0.88&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD to 1.16&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD. To be more certain that the sampled SD is close to the actual SD we need to sample a large number of points.\n\nThese same formulae can be used to obtain confidence intervals on the variance of residuals from a [[least squares]] fit under standard normal theory, where ''k'' is now the number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] for error.\n\n===Bounds on standard deviation===\nFor a set of  ''N'' > 4 data spanning a range of values ''R'', an upper bound on the standard deviation ''s'' is given by ''s = 0.6R''.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9639.1980.tb00398.x| title=Upper and Lower Bounds for the Sample Standard Deviation| journal=Teaching Statistics| volume=2| issue=3| pages=84\u201386| year=1980| last1=Shiffler| first1=Ronald E.| last2=Harsha| first2=Phillip D.}}</ref> \nAn estimate of the standard deviation for ''N'' > 100 data taken to be approximately normal follows from the heuristic that 95% of the area under the normal curve lies roughly two standard deviations to either side of the mean, so that, with 95% probability the total range of values ''R'' represents four standard deviations so that ''s \u2248 R/4''. This so-called range rule is useful in [[sample size]] estimation, as the range of possible values is easier to estimate than the standard deviation.

Thus, for a constant ''c'' and random variables ''X'' and ''Y'':\n\n: <math> \\sigma(c) = 0 \\, </math>\n\n: <math> \\sigma(X + c) = \\sigma(X), \\, </math>\n\n: <math> \\sigma(cX) = |c| \\sigma(X). \\, </math>\n\nThe standard deviation of the sum of two random variables can be related to their individual standard deviations and the [[covariance]] between them:\n\n: <math> \\sigma(X + Y) = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{var}(X) + \\operatorname{var}(Y) + 2 \\,\\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)}. \\, </math>\nwhere <math>\\textstyle\\operatorname{var} \\,=\\, \\sigma^2</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\operatorname{cov}</math> stand for variance and [[covariance]], respectively.\n\nThe calculation of the sum of squared deviations can be related to [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s calculated directly from the data.  In the following formula, the letter E is interpreted to mean expected value, i.e., mean.\n\n:<math>\n\\sigma(X) = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[(X - \\operatorname E[X])^2]} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] - (\\operatorname E[X])^2}.\n</math>\n\nThe sample standard deviation can be computed as:\n\n:<math>\ns(X) = \\sqrt{\\frac{N}{N-1}} \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[(X - \\operatorname E[X])^2]}.\n</math>\n\nFor a finite population with equal probabilities at all points, we have\n\n:<math>\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\\overline{x})^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2\\right) - (\\overline{x})^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i\\right)^2},\n</math>\nwhich means that the standard deviation is equal to the square root of the difference between the average of the squares of the values and the square of the average value.\nSee computational formula for the variance for proof, and for an analogous result for the sample standard deviation.\n\n==Interpretation and application==\n{{further|Prediction interval|Confidence interval}}\n[[File:Comparison standard deviations.svg|thumb|400px|right|Example of samples from two populations with the same mean but different standard deviations. Red population has mean 100 and SD 10; blue population has mean 100 and SD 50.]]\nA large standard deviation indicates that the data points can spread far from the mean and a small standard deviation indicates that they are clustered closely around the mean.\n\nFor example, each of the three populations {0, 0, 14, 14}, {0, 6, 8, 14} and {6, 6, 8, 8} has a mean of 7. Their standard deviations are 7, 5, and 1, respectively. The third population has a much smaller standard deviation than the other two because its values are all close to 7.  These standard deviations have the same units as the data points themselves. If, for instance, the data set {0, 6, 8, 14} represents the ages of a population of four siblings in years, the standard deviation is 5 years. As another example, the population {1000, 1006, 1008, 1014} may represent the distances traveled by four athletes, measured in meters. It has a mean of 1007 meters, and a standard deviation of 5 meters.\n\nStandard deviation may serve as a measure of uncertainty.  In physical science, for example, the reported standard deviation of a group of repeated [[measurement]]s gives the [[accuracy and precision|precision]] of those measurements.  When deciding whether measurements agree with a theoretical prediction, the standard deviation of those measurements is of crucial importance: if the mean of the measurements is too far away from the prediction (with the distance measured in standard deviations), then the theory being tested probably needs to be revised. This makes sense since they fall outside the range of values that could reasonably be expected to occur, if the prediction were correct and the standard deviation appropriately quantified.  See [[prediction interval]].\n\nWhile the standard deviation does measure how far typical values tend to be from the mean, other measures are available. An example is the [[mean absolute deviation]], which might be considered a more direct measure of average distance, compared to the [[Root-mean-square deviation|root mean square distance]] inherent in the standard deviation.\n\n===Application examples===\nThe practical value of understanding the standard deviation of a set of values is in appreciating how much variation there is from the average (mean).\n\n====Experiment, industrial and hypothesis testing====\nStandard deviation is often used to compare real-world data against a model to test the model.\nFor example, in industrial applications the weight of products coming off a production line may need to comply with a legally required value. By weighing some fraction of the products an average weight can be found, which will always be slightly different from the long-term average. By using standard deviations, a minimum and maximum value can be calculated that the averaged weight will be within some very high percentage of the time (99.9% or more). If it falls outside the range then the production process may need to be corrected. Statistical tests such as these are particularly important when the testing is relatively expensive. For example, if the product needs to be opened and drained and weighed, or if the product was otherwise used up by the test.\n\nIn experimental science, a theoretical model of reality is used. [[Particle physics]] conventionally uses a standard of \"5 sigma\" for the declaration of a discovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.org/article-questions.asp?id=103 |title=What does the 5 sigma mean? |publisher=Physics.org |accessdate=2019-02-05}}</ref> A five-sigma level translates to one chance in 3.5 million that a random fluctuation would yield the result.

It is helpful to understand that the range of daily maximum temperatures for cities near the coast is smaller than for cities inland. Thus, while these two cities may each have the same average maximum temperature, the standard deviation of the daily maximum temperature for the coastal city will be less than that of the inland city as, on any particular day, the actual maximum temperature is more likely to be farther from the average maximum temperature for the inland city than for the coastal one.\n\n====Finance====\nIn finance, standard deviation is often used as a measure of the [[Risk#Finance|risk]] associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edupristine.com/blog/what-is-standard-deviation |title=What is Standard Deviation |publisher=Pristine |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk is an important factor in determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions (known as [[Modern portfolio theory|mean-variance optimization]]). The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the risk premium. In other words, investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty. When evaluating investments, investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.\n\nFor example, assume an investor had to choose between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, with a standard deviation of 20 [[percentage point]]s (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, an investor may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock B's additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to \u221210 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to \u221250 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).\n\nCalculating the average (or arithmetic mean) of the return of a security over a given period will generate the expected return of the asset. For each period, subtracting the expected return from the actual return results in the difference from the mean.  Squaring the difference in each period and taking the average gives the overall variance of the return of the asset.  The larger the variance, the greater risk the security carries.  Finding the square root of this variance will give the standard deviation of the investment tool in question.\n\nPopulation standard deviation is used to set the width of [[Bollinger Bands]], a widely adopted [[technical analysis]] tool. For example, the upper Bollinger Band is given as {{nowrap|<span style{{=}}\"text-decoration:overline;\">''x''</span> + ''n\u03c3<sub>x</sub>''.}} The most commonly used value for ''n'' is 2; there is about a five percent chance of going outside, assuming a normal distribution of returns.\n\nFinancial time series are known to be non-stationary series, whereas the statistical calculations above, such as standard deviation, apply only to stationary series. To apply the above statistical tools to non-stationary series, the series first must be transformed to a stationary series, enabling use of statistical tools that now have a valid basis from which to work.\n\n===Geometric interpretation===\nTo gain some geometric insights and clarification, we will start with a population of three values, ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>. This defines a point ''P'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>) in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. Consider the line ''L'' = {(''r'', ''r'', ''r'') : ''r'' \u2208 '''R'''}. This is the \"main diagonal\" going through the origin. If our three given values were all equal, then the standard deviation would be zero and ''P'' would lie on ''L''. So it is not unreasonable to assume that the standard deviation is related to the ''distance'' of ''P'' to ''L''. That is indeed the case. To move orthogonally from ''L'' to the point ''P'', one begins at the point:\n\n:<math>M = (\\overline{x},\\overline{x},\\overline{x})</math>\n\nwhose coordinates are the mean of the values we started out with. \n{{Collapse top|title=Derivation of <math>M = (\\overline{x},\\overline{x},\\overline{x})</math>}}\n<math>M</math> is on <math>L</math> therefore <math>M = (\\ell,\\ell,\\ell)</math> for some <math>\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}</math>.\n\nThe line <math>L</math> is to be orthogonal to the vector from <math>M</math> to <math>P</math>. Therefore:\n\n: <math> \\begin{align} \nL \\cdot (P-M) &= 0 \\\\[4pt]\n(r,r,r) \\cdot (x_1 - \\ell, x_2 -\\ell, x_3 -\\ell)&=0 \\\\[4pt]\nr(x_1 - \\ell+ x_2 -\\ell+ x_3 -\\ell) &=0 \\\\[4pt]\nr\\left(\\sum_i x_i - 3\\ell\\right)  &=0 \\\\[4pt]\n\\sum_i x_i - 3\\ell  &=0 \\\\[4pt]\n\\frac1{3}\\sum_i x_i &=\\ell\\\\[4pt]\n\\overline{x}&=\\ell\n\\end{align}</math>\n{{Collapse bottom}}\nA little algebra shows that the distance between ''P'' and ''M'' (which is the same as the orthogonal distance between ''P'' and the line ''L'') <math>\\sqrt{\\sum\\limits_i (x_i-\\overline{x})^2}</math> is equal to the standard deviation of the vector (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>), multiplied by the square root of the number of dimensions of the vector (3 in this case).\n\n===Chebyshev's inequality===\n{{main|Chebyshev's inequality}}\nAn observation is rarely more than a few standard deviations away from the mean. Chebyshev's inequality ensures that, for all distributions for which the standard deviation is defined, the amount of data within a number of standard deviations of the mean is at least as much as given in the following table.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The two points of the curve that are one standard deviation from the mean are also the [[inflection point]]s.]]\n\nThe [[central limit theorem]] states that the distribution of an average of many independent, identically distributed random variables tends toward the famous bell-shaped normal distribution with a [[probability density function]] of\n\n:<math>f(x;\\mu,\\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{ -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 }\n</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03bc'' is the [[expected value]] of the random variables, ''\u03c3'' equals their distribution's standard deviation divided by ''n''<sup>1/2</sup>, and ''n'' is the number of random variables.  The standard deviation therefore is simply a scaling variable that adjusts how broad the curve will be, though it also appears in the [[normalizing constant]].\n\nIf a data distribution is approximately normal, then the proportion of data values within ''z'' standard deviations of the mean is defined by:\n\n: <math> \\text{Proportion} = \\operatorname{erf}\\left(\\frac z {\\sqrt 2}\\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\textstyle\\operatorname{erf}</math> is the [[error function]].

In a certain sense, the standard deviation is a \"natural\" measure of [[statistical dispersion]] if the center of the data is measured about the mean. This is because the standard deviation from the mean is smaller than from any other point. The precise statement is the following: suppose ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> are real numbers and define the function:\n\n:<math>\\sigma(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - r)^2}.</math>\n\nUsing [[calculus]] or by [[completing the square]], it is possible to show that ''\u03c3''(''r'') has a unique minimum at the mean:\n\n:<math>r = \\overline{x}.\\,</math>\n\nVariability can also be measured by the [[coefficient of variation]], which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.  It is a [[dimensionless number]].\n\n===Standard deviation of the mean===\n{{Main|Standard error of the mean}}\nOften, we want some information about the precision of the mean we obtained. We can obtain this by determining the standard deviation of the sampled mean.\nAssuming statistical independence of the values in the sample, the standard deviation of the mean is related to the standard deviation of the distribution by:\n\n:<math>\\sigma_{\\text{mean}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sigma</math>\n\nwhere ''N'' is the number of observations in the sample used to estimate the mean. This can easily be proven with (see [[Variance#Basic properties|basic properties of the variance]]):\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{var}(X) &\\equiv \\sigma^2_X\\\\\n\\operatorname{var}(X_1+X_2) &\\equiv \\operatorname{var}(X_1) + \\operatorname{var}(X_2)\\\\  \n\\end{align}</math>\n(Statistical Independence is assumed.)\n:<math>\\begin{align}  \n\\operatorname{var}(cX_1) &\\equiv c^2 \\, \\operatorname{var}(X_1)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nhence\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{var}(\\text{mean})\n &= \\operatorname{var}\\left (\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i \\right)\n   = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\operatorname{var}\\left (\\sum_{i=1}^N X_i \\right ) \\\\\n &= \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\operatorname{var}(X_i)\n   = \\frac{N}{N^2} \\operatorname{var}(X)\n   = \\frac{1}{N} \\operatorname{var} (X).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nResulting in:\n:<math>\\sigma_\\text{mean} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}.</math>\nIn order to estimate the standard deviation of the mean <math>\\sigma_\\text{mean}</math> it is necessary to know the standard deviation of the entire population <math>\\sigma</math> beforehand. However, in most applications this parameter is unknown. For example, if a series of 10 measurements of a previously unknown quantity is performed in a laboratory, it is possible to calculate the resulting sample mean and sample standard deviation, but it is impossible to calculate the standard deviation of the mean.\n\n==Rapid calculation methods==\n{{See also|Algorithms for calculating variance}}\nThe following two formulas can represent a running (repeatedly updated) standard deviation. A set of two power sums ''s''<sub>1</sub> and ''s''<sub>2</sub> are computed over a set of ''N'' values of ''x'', denoted as ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>:\n\n:<math>\\ s_j=\\sum_{k=1}^N{x_k^j}.</math>\n\nGiven the results of these running summations, the values ''N'', ''s''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub> can be used at any time to compute the ''current'' value of the running standard deviation:\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\frac{\\sqrt{Ns_2-s_1^2} }{N}</math>\n\nWhere N, as mentioned above, is the size of the set of values (or can also be regarded as ''s''<sub>0</sub>).\n\nSimilarly for sample standard deviation,\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{Ns_2-s_1^2}{N(N-1)}}.</math>\n\nIn a computer implementation, as the three ''s''<sub>''j''</sub> sums become large, we need to consider [[round-off error]], [[arithmetic overflow]], and [[arithmetic underflow]]. The method below calculates the running sums method with reduced rounding errors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Welford, BP |title=Note on a Method for Calculating Corrected Sums of Squares and Products |journal=Technometrics |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=August 1962 |pages=419\u2013420 |doi=10.1080/00401706.1962.10490022|citeseerx=10.1.1.302.7503 }}</ref> This is a \"one pass\" algorithm for calculating variance of ''n'' samples without the need to store prior data during the calculation.

expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.\n\nStandard deviation may be abbreviated '''SD''', and is most commonly represented in mathematical texts and equations by the lower case Greek letter sigma '''[[Sigma|\u03c3]]''', for the population standard deviation, or the Latin letter [[s]], for the sample standard deviation. (For other uses of the symbol \u03c3 in science and mathematics see [[Sigma#Science and mathematics|the main article]].)\n\nThe standard deviation of a [[random variable]], [[statistical population]], [[data set]], or [[probability distribution]] is the [[square root]] of its [[variance]].  It is [[algebra]]ically simpler, though in practice less [[Robust statistics|robust]], than the [[average absolute deviation]].<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Gauss  | first = Carl Friedrich  | authorlink = Carl Friedrich Gauss\n  | title = Bestimmung der Genauigkeit der Beobachtungen\n  | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Astronomie und Verwandte Wissenschaften\n  | volume = 1  | pages = 187\u2013197\n  | year = 1816 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Walker | first = Helen | title = Studies in the History of the Statistical Method\n  | publisher = Williams & Wilkins Co | year = 1931 | location = Baltimore, MD\n  | pages = 24\u201325 }}</ref>\nA useful property of the standard deviation is that, unlike the variance, it is expressed in the same units as the data.\n\nIn addition to expressing the variability of a population, the standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusions.  For example, the [[margin of error]] in [[opinion poll|polling]] data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times.  This derivation of a standard deviation is often called the \"[[standard error]]\" of the estimate or \"standard error of the mean\" when referring to a mean.  It is computed as the standard deviation of all the means that would be computed from that population if an infinite number of samples were drawn and a mean for each sample were computed.\n\nThe standard deviation of a population and the standard error of a statistic derived from that population (such as the mean) are quite different but related (related by the inverse of the square root of the number of observations). The reported margin of error of a poll is computed from the standard error of the mean (or alternatively from the product of the standard deviation of the population and the inverse of the square root of the sample size, which is the same thing) and is typically about twice the standard deviation\u2014the half-width of a 95 percent [[confidence interval]].\n\nIn science, many researchers report the standard deviation of experimental data, and by convention, only effects more than two standard deviations away from a null expectation are considered [[statistically significant]]\u2014normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from likely genuine effects or associations.  The standard deviation is also important in finance, where the standard deviation on the [[rate of return]] on an investment is a measure of the [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] of the investment.\n\nWhen only a [[statistical sample|sample]] of data from a population is available, the term ''standard deviation of the sample'' or ''sample standard deviation'' can refer to either the above-mentioned quantity as applied to those data, or to a modified quantity that is an unbiased estimate of the ''population standard deviation'' (the standard deviation of the entire population).\n\n==Basic examples==\n\n===Sample standard deviation of metabolic rate of northern fulmars===\n\nLogan<ref name=\"Logan2010\">{{Citation\n|last1= Logan\n|first1= Murray\n|title= Biostatistical Design and Analysis Using R\n|edition=First\t\n|year=2010\n|publisher= Wiley-Blackwell\n| url = http://users.monash.edu.au/~murray/BDAR/\n}}\n</ref>\ngives the following example.

The table shows the Furness data set.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Furness data set on metabolic rates of northern fulmars\n|-\n! Sex !! Metabolic rate !! Sex !!

By visual inspection, it appears that the variability of the metabolic rate is greater for males than for females.\n\n[[File:Metabolic rates for northern fulmars.svg|Graph of metabolic rates for northern fulmars]]\n\nThe sample standard deviation of the metabolic rate for the female fulmars is calculated as follows. The formula for the sample standard deviation is\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 },</math>\n\nwhere \n<math>\\textstyle\\{x_1,\\,x_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,x_N\\}</math> are the observed values of the sample items, <math>\\textstyle\\bar{x}</math> is the mean value of these observations, and\n''N'' is the number of observations in the sample.\n\nIn the sample standard deviation formula, for this example, the numerator is the sum of the squared deviation of each individual animal's metabolic rate from the mean metabolic rate. The table below shows the calculation of this sum of squared deviations for the female fulmars. For females, the sum of squared deviations is 886047.09, as shown in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Sum of squares calculation for female fulmars\n|-\n! Animal !! Sex !! Metabolic rate !!

In this example, there are ''N'' = 6 females, so the denominator is 6 \u2013 1 = 5. The sample standard deviation for the female fulmars is therefore\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{N-1} } = \\sqrt{\\frac{886047.09}{5}} = 420.96.</math>\n\nFor the male fulmars, a similar calculation gives a sample standard deviation of 894.37, approximately twice as large as the standard deviation for the females. The graph shows the metabolic rate data, the means (red dots), and the standard deviations (red lines) for females and males.\n\n[[File:SD of metabolic rate of fulmars.svg|Graph of standard deviation of metabolic rate of fulmars]]\n\nUse of the sample standard deviation implies that these 14 fulmars are a sample from a larger population of fulmars. If these 14 fulmars comprised the entire population (perhaps the last 14 surviving fulmars), then instead of the sample standard deviation, the calculation would use the population standard deviation. In the population standard deviation formula, the denominator is ''N'' instead of ''N'' - 1. It is rare that measurements can be taken for an entire population, so, by default, statistical [[computer program]]s calculate the sample standard deviation. Similarly, journal articles report the sample standard deviation unless otherwise specified.\n\n===Population standard deviation of grades of eight students===\n\nSuppose that the entire population of interest was eight students in a particular class. For a finite set of numbers, the population standard deviation is found by taking the [[square root]] of the [[Arithmetic average|average]] of the squared deviations of the values subtracted from their average value. The marks of a class of eight students (that is, a [[statistical population]]) are the following eight values:\n: <math>2,\\  4,\\  4,\\  4,\\  5,\\  5,\\  7,\\  9.</math>\nThese eight data points have the mean (average) of 5:\n: <math> \\mu = \\frac{2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 9}{8} = 5. </math>\nFirst, calculate the deviations of each data point from the mean, and [[square (algebra)|square]] the result of each:\n: <math>\n    \\begin{array}{lll}\n    (2-5)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9  &&  (5-5)^2 = 0^2 = 0 \\\\\n    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (5-5)^2 = 0^2 = 0 \\\\\n    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (7-5)^2 = 2^2 = 4 \\\\\n    (4-5)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1  &&  (9-5)^2 = 4^2 = 16. \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n  </math>\nThe [[variance]] is the mean of these values:\n<!-- Notice:  DO NOT CHANGE the denominator below to 7. If you don't understand why it is 8, read the Talk page. -->\n:<math>\\sigma^2 = \\frac{9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 16}{8} = 4.</math><!-- DO NOT CHANGE the denominator to 7. See talk page-->\n\nand the ''population'' standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance:\n: <math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{ 4 } = 2.</math>\nThis <!-- 1.  the ''population'' standard deviation, 2. \"the ''population'' standard deviation is equal to the square root of the [[variance]]\" --> formula is valid only if the eight values with which we began form the complete population. If the values instead were a random sample drawn from some large parent population (for example, they were 8 students randomly and independently chosen from a class of 2&nbsp;million), then one often divides by {{nowrap|7&nbsp;(which is ''n'' \u2212 1)}} instead of {{nowrap|8&nbsp;(which is ''n'')}} in the denominator of the last formula. In that case the result of the original formula would be called the ''sample'' standard deviation. Dividing by ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 rather than by ''n'' gives an unbiased estimate of the variance of the larger parent population. This is known as ''[[Bessel's correction]]''.<ref>{{MathWorld|urlname=BesselsCorrection|title=Bessel's Correction}}</ref>\n\n===Standard deviation of average height for adult men===\n\nIf the population of interest is approximately normally distributed, the standard deviation provides information on the proportion of observations above or below certain values. For example, the [[Average human height|average height for adult men]] in the [[United States]] is about 70&nbsp;inches (177.8&nbsp;cm), with a standard deviation of around 3&nbsp;inches (7.62&nbsp;cm). This means that most men (about 68%, assuming a [[normal distribution]]) have a height within 3&nbsp;inches (7.62&nbsp;cm) of the mean (67\u201373&nbsp;inches (170.18\u2013185.42&nbsp;cm)){{snd}}one standard deviation{{snd}}and almost all men (about 95%) have a height within 6&nbsp;inches (15.24&nbsp;cm) of the mean (64\u201376&nbsp;inches (162.56\u2013193.04&nbsp;cm)){{snd}}two standard deviations. If the standard deviation were zero, then all men would be exactly 70&nbsp;inches (177.8&nbsp;cm) tall. If the standard deviation were 20&nbsp;inches (50.8&nbsp;cm), then men would have much more variable heights, with a typical range of about 50\u201390&nbsp;inches (127\u2013228.6&nbsp;cm). Three standard deviations account for 99.7% of the sample population being studied, assuming the distribution is [[Normal distribution|normal]] (bell-shaped). (See the [[68-95-99.7 rule]], or the ''empirical rule,'' for more information.)\n\n==Definition of population values==\nLet ''X'' be a [[random variable]] with mean value ''\u03bc'':\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}[X] = \\mu.\\,\\!</math>\nHere the operator E denotes the average or [[expected value]] of ''X''.  Then the standard deviation of ''X'' is the quantity\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\sigma & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[(X - \\mu)^2]}\\\\\n         & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] + \\operatorname E[-2 \\mu X] + \\operatorname E[\\mu^2]}\\\\\n            & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] -2 \\mu \\operatorname E[X] + \\mu^2}\\\\\n         & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] -2 \\mu^2 + \\mu^2}\\\\\n           & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2] - \\mu^2}\\\\\n         & = \\sqrt{\\operatorname E[X^2]-(\\operatorname E[X])^2}\n\\end{align}</math>\n(derived using the [[expected value#Basic properties|properties of expected value]]).\n\nIn other words, the standard deviation ''\u03c3'' ([[sigma]]) is the square root of the [[variance]] of ''X''; i.e., it is the square root of the average value of (''X''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03bc'')<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe standard deviation of a ([[univariate]]) probability distribution is the same as that of a random variable having that distribution.  Not all random variables have a standard deviation, since these expected values need not exist. For example, the standard deviation of a random variable that follows a [[Cauchy distribution]] is undefined because its expected value ''\u03bc'' is undefined.\n\n===Discrete random variable===\nIn the case where ''X'' takes random values from a finite data set ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>N</sub>'', with each value having the same probability, the standard deviation is\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\left[(x_1-\\mu)^2 + (x_2-\\mu)^2 + \\cdots + (x_N - \\mu)^2\\right]}, {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\frac{1}{N} (x_1 + \\cdots + x_N),</math>\n\nor, using [[summation]] notation,\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\mu)^2}, {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i.</math><!-- In the previous, not N - 1 but N.  This is the whole population. -->\n\nIf, instead of having equal probabilities, the values have different probabilities, let ''x''<sub>1</sub> have probability ''p''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub> have probability ''p''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub> have probability ''p''<sub>''N''</sub>.  In this case, the standard deviation will be\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i(x_i - \\mu)^2} , {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i x_i.</math>\n\n===Continuous random variable===\nThe standard deviation of a [[continuous distribution|continuous real-valued random variable]] ''X'' with [[probability density function]] ''p''(''x'') is\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\int_\\mathbf{X} (x-\\mu)^2 \\, p(x) \\, {\\rm d} x}, {\\rm \\ \\ where\\ \\ } \\mu = \\int_\\mathbf{X} x \\, p(x) \\, {\\rm d} x,</math>\n\nand where the integrals are [[definite integral]]s taken for ''x'' ranging over the set of possible values of the random variable&nbsp;''X''.\n\nIn the case of a [[parametric model|parametric family of distributions]], the standard deviation can be expressed in terms of the parameters.  For example, in the case of the [[log-normal distribution]] with parameters ''\u03bc'' and ''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>, the standard deviation is\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{(e^{\\sigma^2} - 1)e^{2\\mu + \\sigma^2}}.</math>\n\n==Estimation==\n{{anchor|Estimation}}{{anchor|Sample standard deviation}}\n{{see also|Sample variance}}\n{{main|Unbiased estimation of standard deviation}}\n\nOne can find the standard deviation of an entire population in cases (such as [[Standardized testing (statistics)|standardized testing]]) where every member of a population is sampled. In cases where that cannot be done, the standard deviation ''\u03c3'' is estimated by examining a random sample taken from the population and computing a [[statistic]] of the sample, which is used as an estimate of the population standard deviation. Such a statistic is called an [[estimator]], and the estimator (or the value of the estimator, namely the estimate) is called a sample standard deviation, and is denoted by ''s'' (possibly with modifiers).\n\nUnlike in the case of estimating the population mean, for which the [[sample mean]] is a simple estimator with many desirable properties ([[unbiased estimator|unbiased]], [[Efficient estimator|efficient]], maximum likelihood), there is no single estimator for the standard deviation with all these properties, and [[unbiased estimation of standard deviation]] is a very technically involved problem. Most often, the standard deviation is estimated using the ''[[#Corrected sample standard deviation|corrected sample standard deviation]]'' (using ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), defined below, and this is often referred to as the \"sample standard deviation\", without qualifiers. However, other estimators are better in other respects: the uncorrected estimator (using ''N'') yields lower mean squared error, while using ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5 (for the normal distribution) almost completely eliminates bias.\n\n===Uncorrected sample standard deviation===\nThe formula for the ''population'' standard deviation (of a finite population) can be applied to the sample, using the size of the sample as the size of the population (though the actual population size from which the sample is drawn may be much larger). This estimator, denoted by ''s''<sub>''N''</sub>, is known as the ''uncorrected sample standard deviation'', or sometimes the ''standard deviation of the sample'' (considered as the entire population), and is defined as follows:{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n:<math>\ns_N = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2},\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\textstyle\\{x_1,\\,x_2,\\,\\ldots,\\,x_N\\}</math> are the observed values of the sample items and <math>\\textstyle\\bar{x}</math> is the mean value of these observations, while the denominator&nbsp;''N'' stands for the size of the sample: this is the square root of the sample variance, which is the average of the [[squared deviations]] about the sample mean.\n\nThis is a [[consistent estimator]] (it converges in probability to the population value as the number of samples goes to infinity), and is the [[maximum likelihood|maximum-likelihood estimate]] when the population is normally distributed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} However, this is a [[biased estimator]], as the estimates are generally too low. The bias decreases as sample size grows, dropping off as 1/''N'', and thus is most significant for small or moderate sample sizes; for <math>N > 75</math> the bias is below 1%. Thus for very large sample sizes, the uncorrected sample standard deviation is generally acceptable. This estimator also has a uniformly smaller [[mean squared error]] than the corrected sample standard deviation.\n\n===Corrected sample standard deviation===\n\nIf the ''biased [[sample variance]]'' (the second [[central moment]] of the sample, which is a downward-biased estimate of the population variance) is used to compute an estimate of the population's standard deviation, the result is\n\n:<math>\ns_N =\\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}.\n</math>\nHere taking the square root introduces further downward bias, by [[Jensen's inequality]], due to the square root's being a [[concave function]]. The bias in the variance is easily corrected, but the bias from the square root is more difficult to correct, and depends on the distribution in question.\n\nAn unbiased estimator for the ''variance'' is given by applying [[Bessel's correction]], using ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 instead of ''N'' to yield the ''unbiased sample variance,'' denoted ''s''<sup>2</sup>:\n:<math>s^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2.</math>\nThis estimator is unbiased if the variance exists and the sample values are drawn independently with replacement. ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 corresponds to the number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] in the vector of deviations from the mean, <math>\\textstyle(x_1-\\overline{x},\\; \\dots,\\; x_n-\\overline{x}).</math>\n\nTaking square roots reintroduces bias (because the square root is a nonlinear function, which does not [[Commutative property|commute]] with the expectation), yielding the ''corrected sample standard deviation,'' denoted by ''s:''\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}.</math>\nAs explained above, while ''s''<sup>2</sup> is an unbiased estimator for the population variance, ''s'' is still a biased estimator for the population standard deviation, though markedly less biased than the uncorrected sample standard deviation. This estimator is commonly used and generally known simply as the \"sample standard deviation\". The bias may still be large for small samples (''N'' less than 10). As sample size increases, the amount of bias decreases. We obtain more information and the difference between <math>\\frac{1}{N}</math> and <math>\\frac{1}{N-1}</math> becomes smaller.\n\n===Unbiased sample standard deviation===\nFor [[unbiased estimation of standard deviation]], there is no formula that works across all distributions, unlike for mean and variance. Instead, ''s'' is used as a basis, and is scaled by a correction factor to produce an unbiased estimate. For the normal distribution, an unbiased estimator is given by ''s''/''c''<sub>4</sub>, where the correction factor (which depends on ''N'') is given in terms of the [[Gamma function]], and equals:\n:<math>c_4(N)\\,=\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N-1}}\\,\\,\\,\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{N-1}{2}\\right)}.</math>\nThis arises because the sampling distribution of the sample standard deviation follows a (scaled) [[chi distribution]], and the correction factor is the mean of the chi distribution.\n\nAn approximation can be given by replacing ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 with ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.5, yielding:\n: <math>\n    \\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N - 1.5} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 },\n  </math>\nThe error in this approximation decays quadratically (as 1/''N''<sup>2</sup>), and it is suited for all but the smallest samples or highest precision: for ''N'' = 3 the bias is equal to 1.3%, and for ''N'' = 9 the bias is already less than 0.1%.\nA more accurate approximation is to replace <math>N-1.5</math> above with <math>N-1.5+1/(8(N-1))</math>.<ref>{{Citation|first1=John |last1=Gurland |first2=Ram C. |last2=Tripathi|title=A Simple Approximation for Unbiased Estimation of the Standard Deviation|journal=The American Statistician|volume=25|issue=4|year=1971|pages=30\u201332|doi=10.2307/2682923|jstor=2682923 }}</ref>\n\nFor other distributions, the correct formula depends on the distribution, but a rule of thumb is to use the further refinement of the approximation:\n: <math>\n    \\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N - 1.5 - \\tfrac14 \\gamma_2} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 },\n  </math>\nwhere ''\u03b3''<sub>2</sub> denotes the population [[excess kurtosis]]. The excess kurtosis may be either known beforehand for certain distributions, or estimated from the data.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Confidence interval of a sampled standard deviation===\n{{see also|Margin of error|Variance#Distribution of the sample variance|Student's_t-distribution#Robust_parametric_modeling}}\nThe standard deviation we obtain by sampling a distribution is itself not absolutely accurate, both for mathematical reasons (explained here by the confidence interval) and for practical reasons of measurement (measurement error). The mathematical effect can be described by the [[confidence interval]] or CI. \nTo show how a larger sample will make the confidence interval narrower, consider the following examples: \nA small population of ''N'' = 2 has only 1 degree of freedom for estimating the standard deviation.  The result is that a 95% CI of the SD runs from 0.45&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD to 31.9&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD;  [[Confidence interval#Statistical theory|the factors here are as follows]]:\n\n:<math> \\Pr \\left( q_{\\frac \\alpha 2} < k \\frac{s^2}{\\sigma^2} < q_{1-\\frac \\alpha 2} \\right) = 1-\\alpha,</math>\n\nwhere <math>q_p</math> is the ''p''-th quantile of the chi-square distribution with ''k'' degrees of freedom, and <math>1-\\alpha</math> is the confidence level.  This is equivalent to the following:\n\n:<math> \\Pr \\left( k \\frac{s^2}{q_{1-\\frac \\alpha 2}} < \\sigma^2 < k \\frac{s^2}{q_{\\frac \\alpha 2}} \\right) = 1-\\alpha.</math>\n\nWith ''k'' = 1, <math>q_{0.025} = 0.000982</math> and <math>q_{0.975} = 5.024</math>.  The reciprocals of the square roots of these two numbers give us the factors 0.45 and 31.9 given above.\n\nA larger population of ''N'' = 10 has 9 degrees of freedom for estimating the standard deviation.  The same computations as above give us in this case a 95% CI running from 0.69&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD to 1.83&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD. So even with a sample population of 10, the actual SD can still be almost a factor 2 higher than the sampled SD. For a sample population N=100, this is down to 0.88&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD to 1.16&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;SD. To be more certain that the sampled SD is close to the actual SD we need to sample a large number of points.\n\nThese same formulae can be used to obtain confidence intervals on the variance of residuals from a [[least squares]] fit under standard normal theory, where ''k'' is now the number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] for error.\n\n===Bounds on standard deviation===\nFor a set of  ''N'' > 4 data spanning a range of values ''R'', an upper bound on the standard deviation ''s'' is given by ''s = 0.6R''.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9639.1980.tb00398.x| title=Upper and Lower Bounds for the Sample Standard Deviation| journal=Teaching Statistics| volume=2| issue=3| pages=84\u201386| year=1980| last1=Shiffler| first1=Ronald E.| last2=Harsha| first2=Phillip D.}}</ref> \nAn estimate of the standard deviation for ''N'' > 100 data taken to be approximately normal follows from the heuristic that 95% of the area under the normal curve lies roughly two standard deviations to either side of the mean, so that, with 95% probability the total range of values ''R'' represents four standard deviations so that ''s \u2248 R/4''. This so-called range rule is useful in [[sample size]] estimation, as the range of possible values is easier to estimate than the standard deviation.

Red population has mean 100 and SD 10; blue population has mean 100 and SD 50.]]\nA large standard deviation indicates that the data points can spread far from the mean and a small standard deviation indicates that they are clustered closely around the mean.\n\nFor example, each of the three populations {0, 0, 14, 14}, {0, 6, 8, 14} and {6, 6, 8, 8} has a mean of 7. Their standard deviations are 7, 5, and 1, respectively. The third population has a much smaller standard deviation than the other two because its values are all close to 7.  These standard deviations have the same units as the data points themselves. If, for instance, the data set {0, 6, 8, 14} represents the ages of a population of four siblings in years, the standard deviation is 5 years. As another example, the population {1000, 1006, 1008, 1014} may represent the distances traveled by four athletes, measured in meters. It has a mean of 1007 meters, and a standard deviation of 5 meters.\n\nStandard deviation may serve as a measure of uncertainty.  In physical science, for example, the reported standard deviation of a group of repeated [[measurement]]s gives the [[accuracy and precision|precision]] of those measurements.  When deciding whether measurements agree with a theoretical prediction, the standard deviation of those measurements is of crucial importance: if the mean of the measurements is too far away from the prediction (with the distance measured in standard deviations), then the theory being tested probably needs to be revised. This makes sense since they fall outside the range of values that could reasonably be expected to occur, if the prediction were correct and the standard deviation appropriately quantified.  See [[prediction interval]].\n\nWhile the standard deviation does measure how far typical values tend to be from the mean, other measures are available. An example is the [[mean absolute deviation]], which might be considered a more direct measure of average distance, compared to the [[Root-mean-square deviation|root mean square distance]] inherent in the standard deviation.\n\n===Application examples===\nThe practical value of understanding the standard deviation of a set of values is in appreciating how much variation there is from the average (mean).\n\n====Experiment, industrial and hypothesis testing====\nStandard deviation is often used to compare real-world data against a model to test the model.\nFor example, in industrial applications the weight of products coming off a production line may need to comply with a legally required value. By weighing some fraction of the products an average weight can be found, which will always be slightly different from the long-term average. By using standard deviations, a minimum and maximum value can be calculated that the averaged weight will be within some very high percentage of the time (99.9% or more). If it falls outside the range then the production process may need to be corrected. Statistical tests such as these are particularly important when the testing is relatively expensive. For example, if the product needs to be opened and drained and weighed, or if the product was otherwise used up by the test.\n\nIn experimental science, a theoretical model of reality is used. [[Particle physics]] conventionally uses a standard of \"5 sigma\" for the declaration of a discovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.org/article-questions.asp?id=103 |title=What does the 5 sigma mean? |publisher=Physics.org |accessdate=2019-02-05}}</ref> A five-sigma level translates to one chance in 3.5 million that a random fluctuation would yield the result.

It is helpful to understand that the range of daily maximum temperatures for cities near the coast is smaller than for cities inland. Thus, while these two cities may each have the same average maximum temperature, the standard deviation of the daily maximum temperature for the coastal city will be less than that of the inland city as, on any particular day, the actual maximum temperature is more likely to be farther from the average maximum temperature for the inland city than for the coastal one.\n\n====Finance====\nIn finance, standard deviation is often used as a measure of the [[Risk#Finance|risk]] associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edupristine.com/blog/what-is-standard-deviation |title=What is Standard Deviation |publisher=Pristine |accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk is an important factor in determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions (known as [[Modern portfolio theory|mean-variance optimization]]). The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the risk premium. In other words, investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty. When evaluating investments, investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.\n\nFor example, assume an investor had to choose between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, with a standard deviation of 20 [[percentage point]]s (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, an investor may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock B's additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to \u221210 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to \u221250 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).\n\nCalculating the average (or arithmetic mean) of the return of a security over a given period will generate the expected return of the asset. For each period, subtracting the expected return from the actual return results in the difference from the mean.  Squaring the difference in each period and taking the average gives the overall variance of the return of the asset.  The larger the variance, the greater risk the security carries.  Finding the square root of this variance will give the standard deviation of the investment tool in question.\n\nPopulation standard deviation is used to set the width of [[Bollinger Bands]], a widely adopted [[technical analysis]] tool. For example, the upper Bollinger Band is given as {{nowrap|<span style{{=}}\"text-decoration:overline;\">''x''</span> + ''n\u03c3<sub>x</sub>''.}} The most commonly used value for ''n'' is 2; there is about a five percent chance of going outside, assuming a normal distribution of returns.\n\nFinancial time series are known to be non-stationary series, whereas the statistical calculations above, such as standard deviation, apply only to stationary series. To apply the above statistical tools to non-stationary series, the series first must be transformed to a stationary series, enabling use of statistical tools that now have a valid basis from which to work.\n\n===Geometric interpretation===\nTo gain some geometric insights and clarification, we will start with a population of three values, ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>. This defines a point ''P'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>) in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. Consider the line ''L'' = {(''r'', ''r'', ''r'') : ''r'' \u2208 '''R'''}. This is the \"main diagonal\" going through the origin. If our three given values were all equal, then the standard deviation would be zero and ''P'' would lie on ''L''. So it is not unreasonable to assume that the standard deviation is related to the ''distance'' of ''P'' to ''L''. That is indeed the case. To move orthogonally from ''L'' to the point ''P'', one begins at the point:\n\n:<math>M = (\\overline{x},\\overline{x},\\overline{x})</math>\n\nwhose coordinates are the mean of the values we started out with. \n{{Collapse top|title=Derivation of <math>M = (\\overline{x},\\overline{x},\\overline{x})</math>}}\n<math>M</math> is on <math>L</math> therefore <math>M = (\\ell,\\ell,\\ell)</math> for some <math>\\ell \\in \\mathbb{R}</math>.\n\nThe line <math>L</math> is to be orthogonal to the vector from <math>M</math> to <math>P</math>.

Chebyshev's inequality ensures that, for all distributions for which the standard deviation is defined, the amount of data within a number of standard deviations of the mean is at least as much as given in the following table.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In a certain sense, the standard deviation is a \"natural\" measure of [[statistical dispersion]] if the center of the data is measured about the mean. This is because the standard deviation from the mean is smaller than from any other point. The precise statement is the following: suppose ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> are real numbers and define the function:\n\n:<math>\\sigma(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - r)^2}.</math>\n\nUsing [[calculus]] or by [[completing the square]], it is possible to show that ''\u03c3''(''r'') has a unique minimum at the mean:\n\n:<math>r = \\overline{x}.\\,</math>\n\nVariability can also be measured by the [[coefficient of variation]], which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.  It is a [[dimensionless number]].\n\n===Standard deviation of the mean===\n{{Main|Standard error of the mean}}\nOften, we want some information about the precision of the mean we obtained. We can obtain this by determining the standard deviation of the sampled mean.\nAssuming statistical independence of the values in the sample, the standard deviation of the mean is related to the standard deviation of the distribution by:\n\n:<math>\\sigma_{\\text{mean}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sigma</math>\n\nwhere ''N'' is the number of observations in the sample used to estimate the mean. This can easily be proven with (see [[Variance#Basic properties|basic properties of the variance]]):\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{var}(X) &\\equiv \\sigma^2_X\\\\\n\\operatorname{var}(X_1+X_2) &\\equiv \\operatorname{var}(X_1) + \\operatorname{var}(X_2)\\\\  \n\\end{align}</math>\n(Statistical Independence is assumed.)\n:<math>\\begin{align}  \n\\operatorname{var}(cX_1) &\\equiv c^2 \\, \\operatorname{var}(X_1)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nhence\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{var}(\\text{mean})\n &= \\operatorname{var}\\left (\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i \\right)\n   = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\operatorname{var}\\left (\\sum_{i=1}^N X_i \\right ) \\\\\n &= \\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\operatorname{var}(X_i)\n   = \\frac{N}{N^2} \\operatorname{var}(X)\n   = \\frac{1}{N} \\operatorname{var} (X).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nResulting in:\n:<math>\\sigma_\\text{mean} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}.</math>\nIn order to estimate the standard deviation of the mean <math>\\sigma_\\text{mean}</math> it is necessary to know the standard deviation of the entire population <math>\\sigma</math> beforehand. However, in most applications this parameter is unknown. For example, if a series of 10 measurements of a previously unknown quantity is performed in a laboratory, it is possible to calculate the resulting sample mean and sample standard deviation, but it is impossible to calculate the standard deviation of the mean.\n\n==Rapid calculation methods==\n{{See also|Algorithms for calculating variance}}\nThe following two formulas can represent a running (repeatedly updated) standard deviation. A set of two power sums ''s''<sub>1</sub> and ''s''<sub>2</sub> are computed over a set of ''N'' values of ''x'', denoted as ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>:\n\n:<math>\\ s_j=\\sum_{k=1}^N{x_k^j}.</math>\n\nGiven the results of these running summations, the values ''N'', ''s''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub> can be used at any time to compute the ''current'' value of the running standard deviation:\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\frac{\\sqrt{Ns_2-s_1^2} }{N}</math>\n\nWhere N, as mentioned above, is the size of the set of values (or can also be regarded as ''s''<sub>0</sub>).\n\nSimilarly for sample standard deviation,\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{Ns_2-s_1^2}{N(N-1)}}.</math>\n\nIn a computer implementation, as the three ''s''<sub>''j''</sub> sums become large, we need to consider [[round-off error]], [[arithmetic overflow]], and [[arithmetic underflow]]. The method below calculates the running sums method with reduced rounding errors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Welford, BP |title=Note on a Method for Calculating Corrected Sums of Squares and Products |journal=Technometrics |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=August 1962 |pages=419\u2013420 |doi=10.1080/00401706.1962.10490022|citeseerx=10.1.1.302.7503 }}</ref> This is a \"one pass\" algorithm for calculating variance of ''n'' samples without the need to store prior data during the calculation. Applying this method to a time series will result in successive values of standard deviation corresponding to ''n'' data points as ''n'' grows larger with each new sample, rather than a constant-width sliding window calculation.\n\nFor ''k'' = 1, ..., ''n'':\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nA_0 &= 0\\\\\nA_k &= A_{k-1}+\\frac{x_k-A_{k-1}}{k}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere A is the mean value.\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nQ_0 &= 0\\\\\nQ_k &= Q_{k-1}+\\frac{k-1}{k} (x_k-A_{k-1})^2 = Q_{k-1}+ (x_k-A_{k-1})(x_k-A_k)\\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNote: <math>Q_1 = 0</math> since <math>k-1 = 0</math> or <math>x_1 = A_1</math>\n\nSample variance:\n:<math>s^2_n=\\frac{Q_n}{n-1}</math>\nPopulation variance:\n:<math>\\sigma^2_n=\\frac{Q_n}{n}</math>\n\n===Weighted calculation===\n<!--N.B. the apparently superfluous trailing \\0 in the <math> equations prevents conversion of simple formulas to HTML, resulting in more consistent formatting.-->\nWhen the values ''x<sub>i</sub>'' are weighted with unequal weights ''w<sub>i</sub>'', the power sums ''s''<sub>0</sub>, ''s''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub> are each computed as:\n\n:<math>\\ s_j=\\sum_{k=1}^N w_k x_k^j.\\,</math>\n\nAnd the standard deviation equations remain unchanged. ''s''<sub>0</sub> is now the sum of the weights and not the number of samples ''N''.\n\nThe incremental method with reduced rounding errors can also be applied, with some additional complexity.\n\nA running sum of weights must be computed for each ''k'' from 1 to ''n'':\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nW_0 &= 0\\\\\nW_k &= W_{k-1} + w_k\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand places where 1/''n'' is used above must be replaced by ''w<sub>i</sub>''/''W<sub>n</sub>'':\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nA_0 &= 0\\\\\nA_k &= A_{k-1}+\\frac{w_k}{W_k}(x_k-A_{k-1})\\\\\nQ_0 &= 0\\\\\nQ_k &= Q _{k-1} + \\frac{w_k W_{k-1}}{W_k}(x_k-A_{k-1})^2 = Q_{k-1}+w_k(x_k-A_{k-1})(x_k-A_k)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn the final division,\n:<math>\\sigma^2_n=\\frac{Q_n}{W_n}\\,</math>\nand\n:<math>s^2_n = \\frac{Q_n}{W_n-1},</math>\nor \n:<math>s^2_n = \\frac{n'}{n'-1} \\sigma^2_n,</math>\nwhere ''n'' is the total number of elements, and ''n''' is the number of elements with non-zero weights.\nThe above formulas become equal to the simpler formulas given above if weights are taken as equal to one.\n\n==History==\nThe term ''standard deviation'' was first used in writing by [[Karl Pearson]] in 1894, following his use of it in lectures.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dodge |first=Yadolah |year=2003 |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-920613-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/oxforddictionary0000unse }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pearson |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Pearson |year=1894 |title=On the dissection of asymmetrical frequency curves |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] |volume=185 |pages=71\u2013110|doi=10.1098/rsta.1894.0003|bibcode=1894RSPTA.185...71P }}</ref> This was as a replacement for earlier alternative names for the same idea: for example, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] used ''mean error''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Jeff |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathword.html |title=Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[68\u201395\u201399.7 rule]]\n* [[Accuracy and precision]]\n* [[Chebyshev's inequality]] An inequality on location and scale parameters\n* [[Cumulant]]\n* [[Deviation (statistics)]]\n* [[Distance correlation]] Distance standard deviation\n* [[Error bar]]\n* [[Geometric standard deviation]]\n* [[Mahalanobis distance]] generalizing number of standard deviations to the mean\n* [[Mean absolute error]]\n* [[Pooled standard deviation]]\n* [[Propagation of uncertainty]]\n* [[Percentile]]\n* [[Raw score]]\n* [[Relative standard deviation]]\n* [[Robust standard deviation]]\n* [[Root mean square]]\n* [[Sample size]]\n* [[Samuelson's inequality]]\n* [[Six Sigma]]\n* [[Standard error (statistics)|Standard error]]\n* [[Standard score]]\n* [[Volatility (finance)]]\n* [[Yamartino method]] for calculating standard deviation of wind direction\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n*{{springer|title=Quadratic deviation|id=p/q076030}}\n*[https://standard-deviation.appspot.com/ A simple way to understand Standard Deviation]\n*[http://www.techbookreport.com/tutorials/stddev-30-secs.html Standard Deviation&nbsp;\u2013 an explanation without maths]\n\n{{Statistics|descriptive}}\n{{Technical analysis|state=collapsed}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Standard Deviation}}\n[[Category:Statistical deviation and dispersion]]\n[[Category:Summary statistics]]\n", "name_user": "Pulasena", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation"}

A secondary benefit was keeping the desk or table surface from being scratched and worn by continuous hand and mouse rubbing motion.  Another benefit was reduction of the collection of debris under the mouse, which resulted in reduced jitter of the pointer on the display. Also, it is important to clean mousepads.

Modern optical mice can function to an acceptable degree of accuracy on plain paper and other surfaces.  However, some optical mouse users (especially gamers, designers, and other heavy users) may prefer a mousepad for comfort, speed and accuracy, and to prevent wear to the desk or table surface.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Mousepad out.jpg|thumb|A mousepad with a padded wrist rest]]\n\nA variety of mousepads exist with many different textured surfaces to fit various types of mouse technologies. Vinyl board cover, because of its natural adhesive properties, was a popular mousepad surface around 1980. {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nAfter the steel mouse ball was given a silicone rubber surface, the popular fabric-surface mousepad was found to be the most appropriate. It helped keep the rubberized roller-ball surface cleaner and gave better tracking, speed and accuracy than just a desk surface. Such surfaces collected dirt which was then deposited onto the internal rollers that picked off ball movement. Dirty rollers caused erratic pointer movement on the screen.\n\nEarly types of optical mice have the problem of not working well on transparent or reflective surfaces such as glass or highly polished wood. These surfaces, which often include desk and table surfaces, cause jitter and loss of tracking on the display pointer as the mouse moves over these reflective spots. The use of mousepads with precision surfaces eliminates spot jitter effects of older and/or low-quality optical mice.\n\nNewer generations of mouse pads incorporate a wireless charging system into the pad, allowing a wireless mouse to be used without the need to replace or recharge batteries.\n\n==Materials==\nModern mousepads are typically made of lesser density rubber composites (open cell styrene, butadiene rubber or open cell [[Styrene-butadiene|SBR]]) with fabric bonded to the upper surface. However, many other types of material have been used, including [[fabric]], [[plastics]],  [[recycling|recycled]] [[rubber]] [[tire]]s, [[neoprene]], [[silicone rubber]], [[leather]], [[glass]], [[Cork (material)|cork]], [[wood]], [[aluminum]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[stainless steel]].

Modern optical mice can function to an acceptable degree of accuracy on plain paper and other surfaces.  However, some optical mouse users (especially gamers, designers, and other heavy users) may prefer a mousepad for comfort, speed and accuracy, and to prevent wear to the desk or table surface.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Mousepad out.jpg|thumb|A mousepad with a padded wrist rest]]\n\nA variety of mousepads exist with many different textured surfaces to fit various types of mouse technologies. Vinyl board cover, because of its natural adhesive properties, was a popular mousepad surface around 1980. {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nAfter the steel mouse ball was given a silicone rubber surface, the popular fabric-surface mousepad was found to be the most appropriate. It helped keep the rubberized roller-ball surface cleaner and gave better tracking, speed and accuracy than just a desk surface. Such surfaces collected dirt which was then deposited onto the internal rollers that picked off ball movement. Dirty rollers caused erratic pointer movement on the screen.\n\nEarly types of optical mice have the problem of not working well on transparent or reflective surfaces such as glass or highly polished wood. These surfaces, which often include desk and table surfaces, cause jitter and loss of tracking on the display pointer as the mouse moves over these reflective spots. The use of mousepads with precision surfaces eliminates spot jitter effects of older and/or low-quality optical mice.\n\nNewer generations of mouse pads incorporate a wireless charging system into the pad, allowing a wireless mouse to be used without the need to replace or recharge batteries.\n\n==Materials==\nModern mousepads are typically made of lesser density rubber composites (open cell styrene, butadiene rubber or open cell [[Styrene-butadiene|SBR]]) with fabric bonded to the upper surface. However, many other types of material have been used, including [[fabric]], [[plastics]],  [[recycling|recycled]] [[rubber]] [[tire]]s, [[neoprene]], [[silicone rubber]], [[leather]], [[glass]], [[Cork (material)|cork]], [[wood]], [[aluminum]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[stainless steel]].  High-quality gaming mats are usually made from plastic, glass, aluminum or carbon fiber.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|mousepad|mouse pad|mousemat|mouse mat}}\n*{{Commons category-inline|Mousepads|lcfirst=yes}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Computer mice]]\n[[Category:History of human\u2013computer interaction]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1969]]\n", "name_user": "Pulasena", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mousepad"}
