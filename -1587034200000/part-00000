The film stars [[Matt Damon]] and [[Christian Bale]], with [[Jon Bernthal]], [[Caitriona Balfe]], [[Tracy Letts]], [[Josh Lucas]], [[Noah Jupe]], [[Remo Girone]], and [[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by automotive designer [[Carroll Shelby]] and his British driver, [[Ken Miles]], who are dispatched by [[Henry Ford II]] and [[Lee Iacocca]] with the mission of building the [[Ford GT40]], a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari racing team]] at the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]] race in France. In early stages of the film's production, [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Brad Pitt]] were cast in the starring roles, but those plans fell through. Mangold was then hired in February 2018, and Damon, Bale, and the rest of the cast joined that summer. Filming began in July 2018 in California and lasted a little over two months.\n\n''Ford v Ferrari'' had its world premiere at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 30, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 15 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film has grossed $225.5 million worldwide and received acclaim from critics, who lauded the performances (particularly Bale's and Damon's), Mangold's direction, the editing and the racing sequences. It was chosen by the [[National Board of Review Awards 2019#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] as one of the ten best films of the year, and at the [[92nd Academy Awards]] received four nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/2020-oscar-nominations-list-academy-awards-nominees-1203461985/|title=Oscar Nominations 2020: The Complete List|date=2020-01-13|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113151810/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/2020-oscar-nominations-list-academy-awards-nominees-1203461985/|archive-date=January 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> For his performance, Bale was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Drama]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2020-golden-globes-nominations-full-list-1259626/item/best-motion-picture-musical-comedy-1259661|title=Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy - Golden Globes: Full List of Nominations|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=December 9, 2019|date=December 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209142818/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2020-golden-globes-nominations-full-list-1259626/item/best-motion-picture-musical-comedy-1259661|archive-date=December 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.indiewire.com/2019/12/national-board-of-review-2019-winners-irishman-1202193897/ |title= National Board of Review 2019: 'The Irishman' Wins Best Film, Adam Sandler Named Best Actor |publisher= [[National Board of Review]] |date= December 3, 2019 |accessdate= December 3, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191203194830/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/12/national-board-of-review-2019-winners-irishman-1202193897/ |archive-date= December 3, 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1963, [[Ford Motor Company]] Vice President [[Lee Iacocca]] proposes to [[Henry Ford II]] to purchase the cash-strapped [[Ferrari]] as a means to boost their car sales by participating in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. [[Enzo Ferrari]], however, walks out of the deal, as [[Fiat S.p.A.|Fiat]] offers him a more lucrative deal that allows him to retain complete ownership of [[Scuderia Ferrari]]. In rejecting the proposed deal with Ford, an insulted Ferrari returns the favor to the company and its CEO. A furious Ford orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American]] owner [[Carroll Shelby]], a racing driver who won Le Mans in [[1959 24 Hours of Le Mans|1959]] but was forced to retire due to a heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of [[Ken Miles]], a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic.\n\nShelby and Miles test the [[Ford GT40#Mk I|Ford GT40 Mk I]] prototype at [[Los Angeles International Airport]], working out all of its design flaws until it is race-ready. Seeing that Miles is not their ideal driver, Ford opts to send [[Phil Hill]] and [[Bruce McLaren]] to the [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans]] instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Fords finish the race. While Ford sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains to him that the GT40 instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari, as it reached 218&nbsp;mph on the [[Mulsanne Straight]] before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the [[Ford GT40#Mk II|GT40 Mk II]], but Miles is nearly killed when the car's brakes fail during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe takes over the racing division, with the intent to continue the program without Miles, but Shelby gives Ford a ride in the car and wagers his own company to convince Ford to agree that if Miles wins the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], he will be allowed to race at Le Mans.\n\nShelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with [[NASCAR]] team [[Holman-Moody]] supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car's limit to 7,000 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]], and he wins the race.\n\nAt the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap, but after team engineer [[Phil Remington]] fixes it with a mallet, Miles begins to set lap records while catching up to the Ferraris. While racing with Ferrari driver [[Lorenzo Bandini]] \u2013 piloting Ferrari's new prototype [[Ferrari P|330 P3]] \u2013 Miles experiences brake failure and has his brake system replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but Shelby convinces race officials that the replacement is legal. Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight until Bandini blows his engine, eliminating the Ferrari from the race. With three Ford teams in the top positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other two Fords to catch up with him and provide the press with a three-car [[photo finish]]. Miles is initially against this decision, continuing to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have their way on the final lap. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, but Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans.\n\nTwo months after Le Mans, while testing the [[Ford GT40#J-car|J-car]] at [[Riverside International Raceway]], Miles once again experiences brake failure and is killed in the resulting crash. Six months later, Shelby pays Miles' widow Mollie and son Peter a visit and gives Peter a wrench that Miles threw at him before winning an [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] race at [[Willow Springs International Motorsports Park|Willow Springs]] in 1963.\n\nFord continued its winning streak at Le Mans in [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|1967]], [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|1968]], and [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans|1969]]. Miles was posthumously inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2001.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Matt Damon]] as [[Carroll Shelby]], American former race car driver, automotive designer, and builder\n* [[Christian Bale]] as [[Ken Miles]], British [[World War II]] veteran and professional race car driver\n* [[Jon Bernthal]] as [[Lee Iacocca]], vice president of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]\n* [[Caitriona Balfe]] as Mollie Miles, Miles' wife\n* [[Josh Lucas]] as Leo Beebe, senior executive vice president\n* [[Noah Jupe]] as Peter Miles, Miles's son\n* [[Tracy Letts]] as [[Henry Ford II]], the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Ford and grandson of automotive pioneer [[Henry Ford]] \n* [[Remo Girone]] as [[Enzo Ferrari]], founder of [[Ferrari]] and its automobile racing team [[Scuderia Ferrari]].\n* [[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]] as [[Phil Remington]]\n* [[JJ Feild]] as [[Roy Lunn]], a Ford engineer involved in the GT40 program\n* [[Jack McMullen]] as Charlie Agapiou\n* [[Corrado Invernizzi]] as Franco Gozzi, [[Enzo Ferrari]]'s right-hand man\n* Joe Williamson as [[Donald N.

The film stars [[Matt Damon]] and [[Christian Bale]], with [[Jon Bernthal]], [[Caitriona Balfe]], [[Tracy Letts]], [[Josh Lucas]], [[Noah Jupe]], [[Remo Girone]], and [[Ray McKinnon (actor)|Ray McKinnon]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe plot follows a determined team of American engineers and designers, led by automotive designer [[Carroll Shelby]] and his British driver, [[Ken Miles]], who are dispatched by [[Henry Ford II]] and [[Lee Iacocca]] with the mission of building the [[Ford GT40]], a new racing car with the potential to finally defeat the perennially dominant [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari racing team]] at the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]] race in France. In early stages of the film's production, [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Brad Pitt]] were cast in the starring roles, but those plans fell through. Mangold was then hired in February 2018, and Damon, Bale, and the rest of the cast joined that summer. Filming began in July 2018 in California and lasted a little over two months.\n\n''Ford v Ferrari'' had its world premiere at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 30, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 15 by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film has grossed $225.5 million worldwide and received acclaim from critics, who lauded the performances (particularly Bale's and Damon's), Mangold's direction, the editing and the racing sequences. It was chosen by the [[National Board of Review Awards 2019#Top 10 Films|National Board of Review]] as one of the ten best films of the year, and at the [[92nd Academy Awards]] received four nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and won [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/2020-oscar-nominations-list-academy-awards-nominees-1203461985/|title=Oscar Nominations 2020: The Complete List|date=2020-01-13|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113151810/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/2020-oscar-nominations-list-academy-awards-nominees-1203461985/|archive-date=January 13, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> For his performance, Bale was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Drama]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2020-golden-globes-nominations-full-list-1259626/item/best-motion-picture-musical-comedy-1259661|title=Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy - Golden Globes: Full List of Nominations|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=December 9, 2019|date=December 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209142818/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2020-golden-globes-nominations-full-list-1259626/item/best-motion-picture-musical-comedy-1259661|archive-date=December 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.indiewire.com/2019/12/national-board-of-review-2019-winners-irishman-1202193897/ |title= National Board of Review 2019: 'The Irishman' Wins Best Film, Adam Sandler Named Best Actor |publisher= [[National Board of Review]] |date= December 3, 2019 |accessdate= December 3, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20191203194830/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/12/national-board-of-review-2019-winners-irishman-1202193897/ |archive-date= December 3, 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1963, [[Ford Motor Company]] Vice President [[Lee Iacocca]] proposes to [[Henry Ford II]] to purchase the cash-strapped [[Ferrari]] as a means to boost their car sales by participating in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. [[Enzo Ferrari]], however, walks out of the deal, as [[Fiat S.p.A.|Fiat]] offers him a more lucrative deal that allows him to retain complete ownership of [[Scuderia Ferrari]]. In rejecting the proposed deal with Ford, an insulted Ferrari returns the favor to the company and its CEO. A furious Ford orders his racing division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca hires [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby American]] owner [[Carroll Shelby]], a racing driver who won Le Mans in [[1959 24 Hours of Le Mans|1959]] but was forced to retire due to a heart condition. In turn, Shelby enlists the help of [[Ken Miles]], a hot-tempered British racer and struggling mechanic.\n\nShelby and Miles test the [[Ford GT40#Mk I|Ford GT40 Mk I]] prototype at [[Los Angeles International Airport]], working out all of its design flaws until it is race-ready. Seeing that Miles is not their ideal driver, Ford opts to send [[Phil Hill]] and [[Bruce McLaren]] to the [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans]] instead. As predicted by Miles, none of the Fords finish the race. While Ford sees this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains to him that the GT40 instilled fear in Enzo Ferrari, as it reached 218&nbsp;mph on the [[Mulsanne Straight]] before it broke down. Shelby and Miles continue development on the [[Ford GT40#Mk II|GT40 Mk II]], but Miles is nearly killed when the car's brakes fail during testing. In 1966, Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe takes over the racing division, with the intent to continue the program without Miles, but Shelby gives Ford a ride in the car and wagers his own company to convince Ford to agree that if Miles wins the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], he will be allowed to race at Le Mans.\n\nShelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with [[NASCAR]] team [[Holman-Moody]] supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car's limit to 7,000 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]], and he wins the race.\n\nAt the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap, but after team engineer [[Phil Remington]] fixes it with a mallet, Miles begins to set lap records while catching up to the Ferraris. While racing with Ferrari driver [[Lorenzo Bandini]] \u2013 piloting Ferrari's new prototype [[Ferrari P|330 P3]] \u2013 Miles experiences brake failure and has his brake system replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but Shelby convinces race officials that the replacement is legal. Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight until Bandini blows his engine, eliminating the Ferrari from the race. With three Ford teams in the top positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for the other two Fords to catch up with him and provide the press with a three-car [[photo finish]]. Miles is initially against this decision, continuing to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have their way on the final lap. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a technicality, but Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le Mans.\n\nTwo months after Le Mans, while testing the [[Ford GT40#J-car|J-car]] at [[Riverside International Raceway]], Miles once again experiences brake failure and is killed in the resulting crash. Six months later, Shelby pays Miles' widow Mollie and son Peter a visit and gives Peter a wrench that Miles threw at him before winning an [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] race at [[Willow Springs International Motorsports Park|Willow Springs]] in 1963.\n\nFord continued its winning streak at Le Mans in [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|1967]], [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|1968]], and [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans|1969]].

Macy]] and, in flashbacks, [[imdbname:1881849|Jacob DeMonte-Finn]]) aged 52, is the father of six children. He is a deadbeat alcoholic and drug addict who relies on his children to get by. He also swindles the state welfare system and taught this type of opportunistic deceit to his children. Since Frank refuses to work and most of the children are underage, the family lives far below the federal [[poverty threshold]] for a family of their size. As mentioned by one of his sons, Lip, Frank is intelligent and finished high school before he attended college to study psychology, where he met Monica. They dated for about 2 weeks before he dropped out of school and they got married.\n\nFrank has [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] with almost any available woman to support himself. For instance, he begins a relationship with Sheila Jackson when he discovers that she gets maximum disability benefits for her [[agoraphobia]]. He is the biological father of Sammi, Fiona, Lip, Debbie, Carl, and Liam, but not to Ian, who is presumed to be the son of Frank's brother Clayton, making him Frank's nephew as well as the children's half-brother and cousin. Despite that, he refers to Ian as his son. Frank is also the grandfather of Chuckie, Frances, Carl's unnamed twins, and Freddie.\n\nThe children do not think highly of him and refer to him primarily by his first name, though there have been occasions where they have called him \"Dad\". Although Frank preaches self-righteously about political and social issues, he spends most of his time developing schemes to [[Welfare fraud|cheat the system]] and takes advantage of others to make money. He pays little attention to his children but displays care and concern for them in drastic circumstances, having shown on occasion that he does indeed love his children, and at times proves himself to be a better parent than Monica or his own mother.\n\nIn season 1, he is introduced as an alcoholic deadbeat who neglects his children after his wife abandons the family. The older Gallagher children resent him while the younger ones still have faith in him. Frank attempts to cash a settlement check only to find that he needs it to be signed by his estranged wife Monica and tracks her down. She agrees to sign the check on the condition that he give up their youngest child Liam so that she and her new girlfriend can raise him. Frank learns through two paternity tests that he is indeed Liam's father but not Ian, who is the result of an affair. The pair make amends after the event and Frank walks away. \n  \nIn season 2, his mother Peggy is released from prison and the root of Frank's bad parenting is revealed to stem from his own childhood with his abusive parents. The main factor was his mother, who was often neglectful and condescending of him and left him scarred. Frank finds himself at her beck and call, as she puts him down at any opportunity. A saddened Frank finds comfort in Fiona, who now sees what her father went through as a child and finds him better than Peggy. After Peggy moves in to Frank's house, Frank's former trauma returns, such as his bedwetting and being his mother's personal servant. He briefly contemplates [[matricide|killing his mother]] in her sleep, but continues to assist her as her health deteriorates. After Sheila suffocates Peggy to death, he rejoices at being free of his mother's influence.\n\nDuring Season 3, he calls CPS on Fiona out of spite and is kicked out of the house once his actions are revealed. At court, he retains his parental rights while Fiona is named guardian of the children. During his exile from the Gallagher house, he finds Carl and they bond while stealing from the latter's former foster parents. When the police try to arrest Carl, Frank selflessly takes full responsibility for the theft and is arrested while Carl, Lip, and Ian look on. Frank is released when his [[Cirrhosis|liver fails]] as a result of his [[chronic alcoholism|chronic alcoholism]]. Frank is initially in denial of this fact and bonds with Lip to congratulate him on his high school graduation. However, he succumbs to his illness and is sent to the hospital. Fiona reveals that she loves him and only wishes for him to show his love to the family, since she fears that he does not care for them.\n\nIn Season 4, he returns home and is tended to by Carl. After Fiona refuses to help him by donating her liver, he reveals the existence of his eldest daughter Sammi, much to Fiona's shock. Frank and Carl track down Sammi, where he finds her with a child of her own. Although she is initially not aware of their connection, Frank accidentally reveals the truth after he learns she is not a match for a liver transplant, which causes her to kick him out. Later on, Sammi tracks him down and they reconcile. Due to him having parental rights, Frank is needed to reclaim a hospitalized Liam. Afterwards, Sammi, Carl, and Sheila go out of their way to arrange Frank's liver surgery. Frank bonds with Sammi and sees that she is more like the other Gallagher kids than he thought. They find an unlicensed Bangladeshi surgeon willing to do the operation, using a Bangladeshi donor. The surgeon initially asks for $30,000 but when the two women admit they can only pay $26,000, he reluctantly agrees to operate. The cost of the surgery is covered by selling Sheila's furniture and Sheila's savings. The surgeon makes off with the money and one of Frank's kidneys, leaving Frank with his original failing liver. Nevertheless, Frank is supplied with a healthy liver when his condition deteriorates and pushes him to the top of the donor list. Afterwards, he shares a beer with Carl to thank him for his help and rejoices at surviving the ordeal.\n \nIn season 5, a home beer brewing mishap causes Sheila to leave for good. He moves back into the house, asserting himself as their father and refusing to leave. He allows Sammi to move in after her trailer is confiscated; However, she shoots Frank in the arm when he refuses to leave the house and does not show care for her. Frank gets payback by implicating his grandson Chuckie for Carl's heroin smuggling attempt. In episode 9, Frank embarks on a \"[[Kick the bucket|bucket list]]\" style spree with a doctor named Bianca, who has advanced pancreatic cancer. They spend Bianca's last days together and although some of Bianca's thrill-seeking tendencies are too much for Frank, they end up in Costa Rica. After leaving a note for Frank, Bianca commits suicide by walking naked into the ocean. Frank returns home distraught and tells Lip and Ian that Bianca has died.\n\nIn season 6, he supports Debbie's pregnancy and reconnects with his ex-girlfriend Queenie (Sammi's mother). After he ruins Fiona's wedding the Gallagher kids (except Lip, Liam, and Fiona) and friends have had enough of him and throw him off a bridge into a frozen river.\n\nIn Season 7, he is shown to have survived the fall, and falls into a coma for a month in a hospital. He awakens with brief amnesia. He returns to the Alibi and everyone is surprised that he survived. Frank recalls them throwing him off the bridge and is angry at the pain they put him through, as well as the fact that no one looked for him during the month he was comatose. Kevin is the only person who feels guilty. Frank attempts to go back to his house, where he is depressed to learn from Carl that no one looked for him because they hoped he was dead. Fiona kicks Frank out of the house and the other children do the same. Hurt by this, he \"disowns\" them (except Liam) and attempts to start over with a \"new\" family he finds at a homeless shelter. Frank and his new family crash a realtor's showing of a house on his block. When the realtor calls the cops, he manipulates them into thinking the old owner okayed it. Frank establishes the home as a homeless shelter and attracts the attention and money of a wealthy philanthropist. Frank basks in his fortune and accumulates even more by manipulating the patrons of his shelter into earning money. He is eventually thrown out a window when the homeless patrons find out he's been hoarding the money they've earned. He suffers an injured arm and leg before he tries to burn the house in revenge. Instead, he helps Liam get into a private school. Near the end of the season, he is allowed to return to his old home after he starts making amends with the family, including helping fix up the house with some stolen possessions from the shelter. Frank is reunited with Monica and falls back into their old habits, only to be devastated when she dies from brain damage. He is later attacked by Monica's enraged father and shares touching words at her funeral before leaving heartbroken. Afterwards, he is allowed to return home with all animosity ended and he is once again accepted by his children.\n\nIn season 8, Frank copes with Monica's death by consuming [[Crystal meth|meth]] she gave him, before having a [[midlife crisis]] where he decides to restart his life as a 21 year old, having realized that Monica was the trigger of his alcoholism and bad parenting. As a result, he becomes sober and starts going by Francis to disassociate from his past. He cleans up his hygiene up, gets a real job, makes amends with his family and friends, buys a car, and tries to be a more productive member of society. While his children believe Frank has lost it, he proves his change is genuine by protecting his family from an armed meth head who was Monica's partner, earning him Fiona's gratitude. Frank soon bonds with his youngest son Liam and acts more fatherly to him, as he sees Liam as his last chance to be a proper parent. However, when the hardware store chain he is working at shuts down and he is unable to find new employment, Frank starts to fall back into his old ways.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/shameless-season-8-spoilers-emmy-rossum-jeremy-allen-white-william-h-macy-1202547937/|title=\u2018Shameless\u2019 Season 8: Trump\u2019s America, Sobriety and a New Frank?|last=Turchiano|first=Danielle|date=2017-09-07|work=Variety|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDuring Season 9, he reverts back to his old self and sleeps with many of the mothers in the PTA and secretly stealing from them to pawn their belongings. After an STD outbreak sweeps through the PTA, Frank is revealed to be the source. Because of this, his son Liam is expelled from private school and forced to attend public school. Frank also nominates former congressman Mo White during a congressional election as a part of a scam to earn money, though he ends up with second thoughts after the man is revealed to be a sex offender.  Despite that, he continues on as campaign manager and attempts to win the election by any means necessary, going as far as recruiting Terry Milkovich to intimidate voters. Mo wins the race, but Frank is fired as campaign manager. He later ends up the hospital for his liver and meets a bipolar woman named Ingrid who catches his interest. He starts a relationship with her and they go on to have a series of adventures. Ingrid asks Frank to fertilize her eggs but since his habits have left him sterile, he bribes Carl into donating sperm, and Ingrid finds herself pregnant with six fetuses. As he is financially insecure, he enters a local contest to win money. Ingrid realizes Frank cannot be depended upon and returns to her ex-husband, who pays Frank to stay away. Frank mostly falls back into his old habits again and bonds with Fiona after she spirals into alcoholism. Frank injures his leg and is rendered out of commission for months, which forces his children to hire a nurse for him. When Fiona leaves for good, he wishes his daughter luck while thanking her for what she has done.\n\nIn Season 10, Frank recovers from his injuries and resumes his old habits. He reunites with his old friend Mikey and they carry out a series of scams. He  becomes a grandfather to Lip's son Freddy. When Mikey is sent to prison, Frank continues his scams. Very soon, Frank is visited by his ex-girlfriend's husband who tried to pawn off her twins. Frank later reveals that the babies are actually Carl's, much to the latter's shock.\n\n===Fiona Gallagher===\n'''Fiona Monica Gallagher''' ([[Emmy Rossum]]), aged 29, is the eldest of the Gallagher children. As a result of her mother's absence and Frank's neglect, most of the responsibility for child-rearing falls on her shoulders, which forces her out of high school in her junior year. Fiona works a few dead-end minimum-wage jobs to support her five siblings. Though often stressed and exhausted, she always carries out her responsibilities. Prone to selflessness, she sometimes needs to be reminded to look out for her own happiness.\n\nIn Season 1, Fiona begins a relationship with Steve Wilton and juggles her own desire for happiness with her responsibilities towards her siblings. At the end of the season, she is distraught to learn of Steve's illicit activities and, despite an invitation to run away with him to Brazil, stays in Chicago with her family.\n\nIn Season 2, she shows that she loves her father in spite of his neglect after she witnesses her previously imprisoned grandmother's abusive treatment of him. Fiona comforts him and sees his bad parenting stems from her. Steve returns, but Fiona is shocked to find he is married to a Brazilian woman named Estefania and that his real name Jimmy Lishman, who is the son of wealthy parents. Although these revelations strain their relationship, they eventually reconcile. At the end of season 2, Fiona receives her [[GED]] and begins to take more interest in jobs.\n\nDuring season 3, after Frank calls social services out of spite, Fiona wins a court case and is appointed her siblings' legal guardian, though Frank maintains parental rights, which strains her relationship with Jimmy. Towards the end of season 3, Fiona gets a better job with a cup manufacturing company, although Jimmy leaves.\n\nIn season 4, she moves up in her job and puts in effort to financially support her family. However, she refuses to help her ailing father with his liver. She is shocked to learn of his oldest daughter, who he never told her of.

After the breakup, Liam ingests cocaine that Fiona got from Robbie at her birthday party and is hospitalized. Fiona is arrested for child neglect and drug possession. Mike posts her bail and she is put under house arrest with a curfew. When Fiona breaks her probation by partying with Robbie, she is incarcerated with a 90-day sentence. She is released shortly after due to overcrowding in the prison and gets a job at a diner.\n\nIn season 5, Fiona impulsively marries Gus Pfender, the bassist of an indie rock band. She then cheats on Gus with Jimmy when he appears in town once again. Her extramarital affair with Jimmy, along with her budding relationship with her manager, Sean, end her marriage. She begins dating Sean afterwards. She discovers she is pregnant around the same time as Debbie does, though she is unsure as to who father is. She gets an abortion and urges Debbie to do the same. By the end of season 6, Fiona and Sean plan to get married, but Frank ruins their happiness on their wedding day by revealing that Sean has continued using heroin behind Fiona's back, causing Sean to leave.\n\nAt the start of season 7, Fiona becomes acting manager at Patsy's Pies in Sean's absence and refuses to deal with the fallout of her aborted wedding. She begins to act more selfishly as she is tired of being unappreciated by her family members. She bans Frank from the house, despite appreciating him for saving her from marrying Sean. She learns her boss, Margo, is also a high-school dropout but has amassed a net worth of $300 million, and Fiona wants to follow in her footsteps. She sees an opportunity to invest in a deteriorating laundromat and uses the Gallagher home as collateral, which angers Lip. She eventually sells the laundromat to Margo and buys an apartment building.\n\nWhen Monica dies, Fiona is indifferent and declares her willingness to have the funeral consist of a bonfire in the funeral home parking lot using the ashes stored in a bag.

However, she learns Ford is married and goes bankrupt following a bad investment. She is forced to sell her building and falls into a drunk slump. Fiona finds solace when Debbie gives her a chance to humiliate Ford as revenge for his deceit. As a result of her downward spiral, her role as caretaker falls into Debbie's hands. Her drunken antics results in her being fired from the pie shop and being arrested for assaulting a neighbor. Eventually, Lip kicks her out when she accidentally gets his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsee drunk. Fiona's habits warrant Frank's attention who also tells her to check herself. After waking up after a night of drinking in her former apartment building, she attends an AA meeting and gets a job at the advice of her attorney. While working at a gas station, she learns from an old business partner that an investment she made garnered her a large sum of money. The man offers to buy her out, giving her $100,000.

In high school he was a straight-A student. He created various money-making schemes to help the Gallagher clan survive, such as running an ice cream truck that also sold beer and marijuana and fraudulently taking the SAT's for fellow classmates for a fee; this latter scheme is thwarted by Professor Hearst, an investigator from the Educational Evaluation Service. After testing Lip in private, Hearst discovers Lip is one of the statistically very rare students capable of achieving a perfect SAT score and offers him an internship at the robotics lab at the University of Chicago, which Lip turns down. Hearst gets Lip in trouble with his past clients by invalidating all of their SAT scores, since they didn't actually take the tests themselves. In addition to being adept scientifically, Lip, like his father, is multilingual; in season 2 he speaks Portuguese and Italian and in season 4 he speaks Spanish.\n\nOutside the classroom, Lip spends much of his time drinking beer, smoking weed, and eventually participating in car theft schemes with Jimmy.

Despite difficulties in paying for his education, Lip receives a grant and also begins an affair with a professor named Helene Runyon. Helene invites Lip into her home and her husband catches them, but condones the affair due to an apparent taste for voyeurism. Because of his affair with the much more worldly Helene, Lip starts losing interest in Amanda, and she eventually punches him in the face when he reveals he did not take their relationship as seriously as she was.\n\nIn season 6, Amanda gets her revenge by posting a naked picture of Helene online.

When he learns Youens stole his work he smashes up Youens' car in a fit of rage. Lip gets arrested but is bailed out by Professor Youens who takes pity on him and informs him he has been expelled. Youens pays for Lip to go to rehab and sets him up with a job for when he gets out.\n\nIn season 7, Lip adjusts to sobriety and begins working as an intern at a sketchy tech company that is eventually shut down due to an FBI investigation. He then gets a job at Patsy's Pies working for Fiona. In this season, he becomes more contentious; Lip believes that because his internship can lead to a 6-figure income, that he is the one who should be the breadwinner of the family and that Fiona's job is not enough, which makes Fiona leave the house and vow to stop taking care of everyone else. He meets a girl named Sierra who also works at Patsy's, and they become friends with benefits, although the relationship eventually develops into something more. Youens tries to convince Lip to go back to college; Lip agrees to attend an appeals hearing, but is denied because of his previous actions.

Macy]] and, in flashbacks, [[imdbname:1881849|Jacob DeMonte-Finn]]) aged 52, is the father of six children. He is a deadbeat alcoholic and drug addict who relies on his children to get by. He also swindles the state welfare system and taught this type of opportunistic deceit to his children. Since Frank refuses to work and most of the children are underage, the family lives far below the federal [[poverty threshold]] for a family of their size. As mentioned by one of his sons, Lip, Frank is intelligent and finished high school before he attended college to study psychology, where he met Monica. They dated for about 2 weeks before he dropped out of school and they got married.\n\nFrank has [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] with almost any available woman to support himself. For instance, he begins a relationship with Sheila Jackson when he discovers that she gets maximum disability benefits for her [[agoraphobia]]. He is the biological father of Sammi, Fiona, Lip, Debbie, Carl, and Liam, but not to Ian, who is presumed to be the son of Frank's brother Clayton, making him Frank's nephew as well as the children's half-brother and cousin. Despite that, he refers to Ian as his son. Frank is also the grandfather of Chuckie, Frances, Carl's unnamed twins, and Freddie.\n\nThe children do not think highly of him and refer to him primarily by his first name, though there have been occasions where they have called him \"Dad\". Although Frank preaches self-righteously about political and social issues, he spends most of his time developing schemes to [[Welfare fraud|cheat the system]] and takes advantage of others to make money. He pays little attention to his children but displays care and concern for them in drastic circumstances, having shown on occasion that he does indeed love his children, and at times proves himself to be a better parent than Monica or his own mother.\n\nIn season 1, he is introduced as an alcoholic deadbeat who neglects his children after his wife abandons the family. The older Gallagher children resent him while the younger ones still have faith in him. Frank attempts to cash a settlement check only to find that he needs it to be signed by his estranged wife Monica and tracks her down. She agrees to sign the check on the condition that he give up their youngest child Liam so that she and her new girlfriend can raise him. Frank learns through two paternity tests that he is indeed Liam's father but not Ian, who is the result of an affair. The pair make amends after the event and Frank walks away. \n  \nIn season 2, his mother Peggy is released from prison and the root of Frank's bad parenting is revealed to stem from his own childhood with his abusive parents. The main factor was his mother, who was often neglectful and condescending of him and left him scarred. Frank finds himself at her beck and call, as she puts him down at any opportunity. A saddened Frank finds comfort in Fiona, who now sees what her father went through as a child and finds him better than Peggy. After Peggy moves in to Frank's house, Frank's former trauma returns, such as his bedwetting and being his mother's personal servant. He briefly contemplates [[matricide|killing his mother]] in her sleep, but continues to assist her as her health deteriorates. After Sheila suffocates Peggy to death, he rejoices at being free of his mother's influence.\n\nDuring Season 3, he calls CPS on Fiona out of spite and is kicked out of the house once his actions are revealed. At court, he retains his parental rights while Fiona is named guardian of the children. During his exile from the Gallagher house, he finds Carl and they bond while stealing from the latter's former foster parents. When the police try to arrest Carl, Frank selflessly takes full responsibility for the theft and is arrested while Carl, Lip, and Ian look on. Frank is released when his [[Cirrhosis|liver fails]] as a result of his [[chronic alcoholism|chronic alcoholism]]. Frank is initially in denial of this fact and bonds with Lip to congratulate him on his high school graduation. However, he succumbs to his illness and is sent to the hospital. Fiona reveals that she loves him and only wishes for him to show his love to the family, since she fears that he does not care for them.\n\nIn Season 4, he returns home and is tended to by Carl. After Fiona refuses to help him by donating her liver, he reveals the existence of his eldest daughter Sammi, much to Fiona's shock. Frank and Carl track down Sammi, where he finds her with a child of her own. Although she is initially not aware of their connection, Frank accidentally reveals the truth after he learns she is not a match for a liver transplant, which causes her to kick him out. Later on, Sammi tracks him down and they reconcile. Due to him having parental rights, Frank is needed to reclaim a hospitalized Liam. Afterwards, Sammi, Carl, and Sheila go out of their way to arrange Frank's liver surgery. Frank bonds with Sammi and sees that she is more like the other Gallagher kids than he thought. They find an unlicensed Bangladeshi surgeon willing to do the operation, using a Bangladeshi donor. The surgeon initially asks for $30,000 but when the two women admit they can only pay $26,000, he reluctantly agrees to operate. The cost of the surgery is covered by selling Sheila's furniture and Sheila's savings. The surgeon makes off with the money and one of Frank's kidneys, leaving Frank with his original failing liver. Nevertheless, Frank is supplied with a healthy liver when his condition deteriorates and pushes him to the top of the donor list. Afterwards, he shares a beer with Carl to thank him for his help and rejoices at surviving the ordeal.\n \nIn season 5, a home beer brewing mishap causes Sheila to leave for good. He moves back into the house, asserting himself as their father and refusing to leave. He allows Sammi to move in after her trailer is confiscated; However, she shoots Frank in the arm when he refuses to leave the house and does not show care for her. Frank gets payback by implicating his grandson Chuckie for Carl's heroin smuggling attempt. In episode 9, Frank embarks on a \"[[Kick the bucket|bucket list]]\" style spree with a doctor named Bianca, who has advanced pancreatic cancer. They spend Bianca's last days together and although some of Bianca's thrill-seeking tendencies are too much for Frank, they end up in Costa Rica. After leaving a note for Frank, Bianca commits suicide by walking naked into the ocean. Frank returns home distraught and tells Lip and Ian that Bianca has died.\n\nIn season 6, he supports Debbie's pregnancy and reconnects with his ex-girlfriend Queenie (Sammi's mother). After he ruins Fiona's wedding the Gallagher kids (except Lip, Liam, and Fiona) and friends have had enough of him and throw him off a bridge into a frozen river.\n\nIn Season 7, he is shown to have survived the fall, and falls into a coma for a month in a hospital. He awakens with brief amnesia. He returns to the Alibi and everyone is surprised that he survived. Frank recalls them throwing him off the bridge and is angry at the pain they put him through, as well as the fact that no one looked for him during the month he was comatose. Kevin is the only person who feels guilty. Frank attempts to go back to his house, where he is depressed to learn from Carl that no one looked for him because they hoped he was dead. Fiona kicks Frank out of the house and the other children do the same. Hurt by this, he \"disowns\" them (except Liam) and attempts to start over with a \"new\" family he finds at a homeless shelter. Frank and his new family crash a realtor's showing of a house on his block. When the realtor calls the cops, he manipulates them into thinking the old owner okayed it. Frank establishes the home as a homeless shelter and attracts the attention and money of a wealthy philanthropist. Frank basks in his fortune and accumulates even more by manipulating the patrons of his shelter into earning money. He is eventually thrown out a window when the homeless patrons find out he's been hoarding the money they've earned. He suffers an injured arm and leg before he tries to burn the house in revenge. Instead, he helps Liam get into a private school. Near the end of the season, he is allowed to return to his old home after he starts making amends with the family, including helping fix up the house with some stolen possessions from the shelter. Frank is reunited with Monica and falls back into their old habits, only to be devastated when she dies from brain damage. He is later attacked by Monica's enraged father and shares touching words at her funeral before leaving heartbroken. Afterwards, he is allowed to return home with all animosity ended and he is once again accepted by his children.\n\nIn season 8, Frank copes with Monica's death by consuming [[Crystal meth|meth]] she gave him, before having a [[midlife crisis]] where he decides to restart his life as a 21 year old, having realized that Monica was the trigger of his alcoholism and bad parenting. As a result, he becomes sober and starts going by Francis to disassociate from his past. He cleans up his hygiene up, gets a real job, makes amends with his family and friends, buys a car, and tries to be a more productive member of society.

The show can now be watched on YouTube.\n\n== Production  ==\nThe series was mainly filmed in Pampa Studios, located in Buenos Aires, although also some takes were shot in the street. During the end of 2008 the cast and production went on to film the first 5 episodes of the third season on location, to be more specific, in different points in the provinces of Mendoza and San Juan. Also, to record the last episodes of the same season, the team went to San Pedro, a town in Buenos Aires. Towards the end of the last season, the actors Peter Lanzani, Pablo Mart\u00ednez and Roc\u00edo Igarz\u00e1bal, recorded in the ruins of Villa Epecu\u00e9n.\n\n== Plot ==\nCasi \u00c1ngeles is the story of a group of homeless kids and teenagers who are exploited and forced to steal for Bartolom\u00e9 Bedoya Ag\u00fcero ([[Alejo Garc\u00eda Pintos]]) and Justina Merarda Garc\u00eda (Julia Calvo). But everything changes when Cielo M\u00e1gico ([[Emilia Attias]]), acrobat and dancer, and Dr. Nicol\u00e1s Bauer  ([[Nicol\u00e1s V\u00e1zquez]]), an archaeologist, enter the kids' lives. Cielo, through her music and her love and kindness, and Nicol\u00e1s, with his fatherly nature and his dreams, will give the children the chance to believe in joy again. They both keep important secrets that, when discovered, will change everyone's lives forever. This is a story packed with magic, love, music, songs, dances and competitions. But there is a mystery, the mystery, and it involves everyone. It has to do with the secrets protected by the hidden portal in the clock inside the Inchaustis' mansion and the special connection that everyone has with it. This portal has chosen each and every one with the utmost care, and everyone thus has a mission. Discovering this mission will be the meaning of this action-packed adventure. And yes, there will be setbacks, suffering, misunderstanding, separations, uncertainty, despair and disappointments but the strong bond they have with each other wil be enough for them to achieve their ultimate mission: to guarantee a better world. Thanks to Hope (Esperanza Bauer) and adult Thiago, their mission is fulfilled and they return home.\n\n== Seasons ==\n=== '''Season 1; ''The Eudam\u00f3n Island'' (2007)''' ===\nThe story begins when \u00c1ngeles Inchuasti, aka Cielo M\u00e1gico ([[Emilia Attias]]), a circus acrobat, and Nicol\u00e1s Bauer ([[Nicol\u00e1s V\u00e1zquez]]), an archaeologist (obsessed with finding the Eudam\u00f3n Island), arrive at the Inchausti Mansion. In this mansion, the evil Bartolom\u00e9 Bedoya Ag\u00fcero ([[Alejo Garc\u00eda Pintos]]) serves as director of the '''''BB Foundation''''', a foundation for orphans which he uses as a fa\u00e7ade for his fearsome plans. In this house the orphan kids are exploited by Bartolom\u00e9 and his housekeeper, Justina Merarda Garc\u00eda ([[Julia Calvo]]), they are enslaved to work and steal and they are heavily punished if they don't do as told. But his plans are threatened with the appearance of the heiresses of the house, the sisters \u00c1ngeles and Luz Inchausti.  Cielo and Nico will help and rescue this kids, discovering in the meantime, the dark secrets that the Inchausti Mansion hides, linked to Cielo's past and Eudam\u00f3n.\n\n=== '''Season 2; ''The Man of the Thousand Faces'' (2008)''' ===\nIn the second season, the kids, not being subdued by Bartolom\u00e9 Bedoya Ag\u00fcero any longer, start having a normal life, in the renamed : '''''Magical Home''''', now directed by Nico (Nicol\u00e1s V\u00e1zquez) and Cielo/\u00c1ngeles (Emilia Attias), who at first is missing after being absorbed by the magic portal (clock) inside the mansion. New kids come to the home, and the '''Corporaci\u00f3n Cruz''' ['''CC'''] appears, led by Juan Cruz ([[Mariano Torre]]), the main villain of this season. '''JC''' is a fallen angel, a shadow, obsessed with returning to Eudam\u00f3n and with Cielo, who managed, just like him, to reach that \"other level\". Juan Cruz will try to emotionally break everyone who lives in the mansion, and in order to achieve his goal he will try in many ways to prevent Cielo from having her and Nico's daughter: Paz.\n\n=== '''Season 3; ''The Little Prince'' (2009)'''===\nThe third season incorporated themes such as lateral thinking and ecology, which were added to and reinforced ideas implemented in previous seasons such as freedom of expression and social awareness. This season the kids and Justina reappear in different places, 22 years in the future, after opening the book of the 7 padlocks. From there, with the help of their \"acquired nieces\": Paz (Emilia Attias), and Hope ([[Jimena Bar\u00f3n]]), Nico daughters, and with also the help of Camilo Estrella (Mariano Torre), they will have to discover their mission, that turns out to be \"Save Paz\" (which also means : \"Save the peace [in the world]\"). Paz is a restless, disobedient girl, with a maternal, liberal and protective spirit, who falls in love with Camilo Estrella, the new director of the '''''Mandalay Institute'''''. In this season Juan Cruz, unable to prevent the birth of Paz, will try to kill her 22 years later, in order to return to Eudam\u00f3n. To all this, will also added the confrontation against the dictatorial government under the command of the Chief of Ministers ([[Mercedes Funes]]).\n\n=== '''Season 4; ''The Resistance'' (2010)'''===\nThis season is all about the consequences of having saved Paz (Emilia Attias) in the previous one. Having fulfilled this mission meant succumbing to a great temporal paradox, where the Head of Ministers,Luz Inchausti, the youngest heiress from the first season, launched the protocol called \"The Little Prince\". From there on, the kids were unable to return to their time and dispersed themselves. Several were captured by the '''Government Corporation''', and given a literal brainwash (these are Mar, Jazm\u00edn, Rama, Lleca, Esperanza and later Sim\u00f3n and Vale as well). But as if that was not enough, they implanted on them a different life story, and subsequently, they were taken to where  '''''Mandalay''''' '''''Institute''''' once was --the school was completely modified by Luz, and renamed '''''NE'''''  '''''Institute''''' [acronym for '''''New Era''''']. At the same time, there is a group called '''''The Resistance''''', made up of Thiago, Tacho, Luca, Tefi, Melody, Kika and, at the beginning, Sim\u00f3n and Vale as well ( there are also two new characters: Johnny, a boy who claims having attended '''''Mandalay'''''  '''''Institute''''', but nobody had seen and finally Nina, a mysterious \"mute\" girl, who appears suddenly, and is a friend of Kika. From there on, hidden in a lair, protected by a dimensional portal, they will try to do everything possible to accomplish their new mission, try to get his friends to remember their past, save the future from this new reality, and then go home.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Nicol\u00e1s V\u00e1zquez]] as Nicol\u00e1s Bauer \n* [[Emilia Attias]] as \u00c1ngeles Inchausti/Cielo M\u00e1gico/Linda Barba and

children and adolescents and, in some cases, young adults. In its first season, it averaged 12.0 points along the 166 issues.\n\nIn the second season, the program was much more oriented to the adolescent public, increasing the cast of that strip, in addition to the love conflicts between Cielo and Nico. A new format was introduced for a daily fiction: the episodes had titles and ended with a monologue in \"off\", following the model of the North American series and moments of suspense became important. This season achieved an average of 13.6 rating points in its 160 issues.\n\nIn January, Disney Channel began broadcasting the program for Latin America, in an edited version that eliminated all scenes of sex and violence.\n\nThe third season, which aired in Argentina in April 2009 and ended on December 3, with an average of 13.9 rating points, in its 140 issues, was the most viewed season.\n\nThe fourth season started in April 2010 and was aired until November 29 of the same year. During the month of June it was out of the air due to the transmission by the channel of the World Cup South Africa 2010. Therefore, it was the shortest season with 113 episodes, achieving a high average of 11.6 points.\n\nEleven years have gone by after its release (2020) and the audience has enlarged. Not only are yesterday's teenagers, now all grown-ups and young adults rewatching Casi \u00c1ngeles but today's adolescents are also submerging themselves into following the adventures of Nico, Cielo and the kids, (and later only the kids) through the most unexpected and life-changing adventures. Nowadays the series can be watched on YouTube on the verified channel of the same name, [https://www.youtube.com/user/casiangeles Casi Angeles]. The four complete seasons have been uploaded plus the extra material that was broadcast on TV back in the day. What is more, the channel is constantly updated with videos about the making of the show, some fun-facts and some videos to celebrate special days. In addition, the Instagram account @bycrismorena, which belongs to the producer of the show, regularly posts pictures, videos and edits.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Season\n!Original release\n!End of Season\n!# of episodes\n!Average rating\n|-\n|1\n|March 21, 2007\n|November 15, 2007\n|166\n|12.0\n|-\n|2\n|April 3, 2008\n|December 1, 2008\n|160\n|13.6\n|-\n|3\n|April 20, 2009\n|December 3, 2009\n|140\n|13.9\n|-\n|4\n|April 12, 2010\n|November 29, 2010\n|113\n|11.6\n|}\n\n=== International Broadcast ===\nThe series in addition to being broadcast by Telefe is also broadcast by air and cable channels in different countries of the world, reason why the strip transcended the borders and got a big fanatic around the world, being highlighted Israel. Some of the featured channels are: Jetix South American Zone, as it issued the first two of the strip and Disney Channel north zone, which is in charge of its respective zone of emission.\n\n== Team Angels/Bonus Track ==\nThe ''Team Angels'' or ''Bonus Track'' is a block of the program that began to be broadcast the 20 of June 2008 during the second season of the series in Argentina and that was emitted at the end of each episode. It lasted for about five minutes. In this segment, you could see interviews with the actors and creators, bloopers, behind the scenes, backstage of the Gran Rex Theater performances, rehearsals, real-cam of the actors, questionnaires, fans' videos, among others.\n\n== Logo creation ==\nIn Season 1, the logo had two angel wings united by a safety pin, which also represented the ''A'' for ''\u00c1ngeles''. The wings were covered in patches to represent the fact they were poor and had affection holes in their hearts. This explanation was given by Cris Morena during an interview for Produ.tv.\n\nIn Season 2, the patches disappeared from the logo. In this season, the characters were not poor anymore and had a loving family.\n\nIn Season 3, there was not a safety pin uniting the two wings anymore. The font of ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' changed slightly. The logo background image had a [[mandala]], which is one important symbol this season, for example, the school they attend is called ''Mandalay''. For a brief period of the Season 3, the logo went dark to represent the fact Camilo Estrella, [[Mariano Torre]] character, had been possessed by the evil Juan Cruz and tragedy would ensue.\n\nIn the third-season finale, the fourth season logo was revealed. It is orange and black and it has a different font. There's also a peace sign with two wings coming out of it. The I and V from the title resemble the Roman number for 4, IV.\n\n== Reception ==\nAlthough the show had a good critical reception, ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' was received with lukewarm ratings. The fans of Cris Morena criticized the show for being too repetitive, with scenes exactly like some of her previous hits such as Rebelde Way, Floricienta, Chiquititas and Alma Pirata. In the beginning, the show did not have a specific audience, it was targeted to kids and teenagers with some story lines skewing too young while others too old. The ratings were dropping and the highly promoted ''[[Patito Feo]]'' debuted on [[Canal 13 (Argentina)|Canal 13]] at the same time slot, and easily beat ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' ratings. While repercussion and sales of ''Patito Feo'' products were astronomic and ratings were soaring, ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' rating numbers were struggling which prompted [[Telefe]] to hurriedly change the show to an earlier time slot.\n\nAlso some changes were made in ''Casi \u00c1ngeles''. The show concentrated on teenagers and started distancing from previous shows of Cris Morena, adding mystery and suspense elements. The changes had an effect and the audience started to grow. After a few weeks in the earlier time slot, the show returned to its original 6 P.M. slot, again confronting ''Patito Feo'' and this time it had similar rating numbers. In the end, the show had an average of 12 points according to [[Ibope]], only 0.2 points lower than ''Patito Feo''. The Season 1 finale reached 15 points, a series high and 1 point higher than ''Patito Feo'''s finale.\n\nAlthough the show was struggling on television, the 2007 musical with the entire cast of the show in [[Teatro Gran Rex]] was the highest-grossing live event of the year. As usual, Cris Morena invested millions of dollars in a [[high-tech]] concert full of expensive effects and production. It sold over 120,000 tickets. The first-season soundtrack album, with all songs sung by the cast, ranked 12th on the best-selling albums of 2007 list compiled by [[CAPIF]], much lower than ''Patito Feo'''s soundtrack which was number one. It also ranked lower than some of the previous Cris Morena production soundtracks (''[[Chiquititas soundtracks|Chiquititas 2006]]'' was sixth on the annual list in 2006, ''[[Floricienta|Floricienta 2]]'' was first in 2005, ''[[Floricienta|Floricienta 1]]'' was 3rd in 2004 and 10th in 2005, [[Erreway]]'s ''[[Se\u00f1ales]]'' was 3rd in 2002 and 7th in 2003) although it did achieve [[Record certification|Platinum certification]]. During the summer hiatus, the cast of the show played concerts in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Rosario]] and [[Punta del Este]].\n\nIn the second season, the show got a total makeover. It became much more oriented to teenagers, with the Teen Angels receiving more screen time and Nico and Cielo's relationship less. It also introduced a new format for a daily fiction: episodes had titles and ended in monologues, following the model of U.S. shows such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. In the same vein as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', the mystery elements became very important. The changes were well received and the show's rating exploded. It easily beat ''Patito Feo'''s Season 2 number; while the Canal 13 show had a 9 points average, 3 points lower than previous season, ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' Season 2 averaged 14 points, 2 points higher. The second soundtrack album was also a strong seller, achieving double platinum and ending the year as the third-best-selling album in the annual ranking.\n\nThe Teen Angels popularity skyrocketed with the cast appearing on the cover of several magazines and attracting huge hysteria wherever they went.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In [[Unicenter (shopping)|Unicenter]], a store was opened to sell exclusive ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' merchandising, ''Fans Store''. The 2008 live musical in [[Teatro Gran Rex]] broke records with 220,000 tickets sold, the second highest attendance ever in the theater's 81 years of history and doubling the number of the previous season<ref>[http://www.extremista.com.ar/13277/entradas-de-casi-angeles-en-el-teatro-gran-rex-agotadas Entradas de Casi \u00c1ngeles en el teatro Gran Rex agotadas]</ref> After the season of concerts in [[Buenos Aires]], the Teen Angels toured extensively in Argentina, selling out arenas everywhere. They also played a sold-out concert for 40,000 in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay. After the second-season finale, the cast played six additional concerts in Buenos Aires, and, during the summer hiatus, the Teen Angels were chosen as the spokespersons for [[Coca-Cola]]. They recorded the song \"Hoy Quiero\" which became the official Coke Summer Anthem. Also during the summer, they played two sold-out concerts in [[Mar del Plata]] and opened the official Coca-Cola stand in [[Pinamar]], attracting over 2500 people to the event.\n\nIn January,{{When|date=February 2011}} [[Disney Channel]] started airing the show to Latin America, in a highly edited version cutting all the sexual and violent elements. To promote the show and their CD, the Teen Angels traveled to [[Mexico City]] for a showcase and interviews. The third season finally debuted in Argentina in April, six months after production began. Without no substantial competition, after ''Patito Feo'' was canceled due to season 2's disastrous number, ratings went through the roof. The third season average is, up to August, 15 points, two points higher than 2008. The third CD is also the best-selling album of the year until the moment. However, the live musical could not top the first two seasons' attendance numbers due to the [[swine flu]] epidemic which caused panic in Buenos Aires in July, during the Winter vacations. In August, sales were normalized and the concerts started to sell out fast as usual. However, all the canceled shows in July meant 2009 musical would not top previous years' numbers. In the end, it sold 100,000 tickets, which was less than the two previous seasons.\n\nIn late 2008, after the debut of the second season, ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' became a gigantic hit in [[Israel]]. [[Peter Lanzani]] and [[Mariana Esp\u00f3sito|Lali Esp\u00f3sito]] visited the country to promote the show and caused hysteria.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The complete cast visited [[Tel Aviv]] in October 2009 for a series of sold-out concerts which had over 80,000 tickets sold. Peter and Mariana were also chosen as spokespeople for the Keff shampoo.\n\nThe third season ended on 5 December 2009. It reached 16.6 points and didn't exceed the season 2 season finale or the season 3 debut (both achieved 18.4 points). Season 3 averaged 14 points, the same as season 2. However, there was a drop in the ratings from the middle of the season.\n\nIn November, the Teen Angels did a promotional tour across Latin America. In December,{{When|date=November 2010}} they'll visit Spain and Italy.\n\nThe show was renewed for a fourth season and will return to [[Telefe]] in 2010. The [[Teen Angels]] will star in Coca-Cola Argentina's Christmas promotional campaign and will be featured on Coke's cans.\n\n== Licensing ==\n''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' spawned a series of merchandising. During the Season 1, the products were targeted to children with toys, apparel, bicycle, cosmetics among others targeting mostly young girls. With the second season became teenage-oriented and the licensing program also started to skew older beginning. Stationery items, posters, postcards, furniture, clothing line, perfumes among other products were released to accompany the second and the third season. An official store, ''Fans Store'', is located at [[Unicenter (shopping)|Unicenter]] shopping mall in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe show also spawned an official monthly magazine, four sticker albums by [[Panini (stickers)|Panini]], three soundtrack albums, two live album, among other products. The program has tie-ins with several brands. Lingerie line ''Sweet Victorian'' and label ''47 Street'' are sponsors of the show and also responsible for the wardrobe of most female characters. Shoe brand ''Jaguar'' is also a sponsor and their products are advertised on the show and used by the characters. Jaguar also has a Casi Angeles shoe line available. [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Movistar]] also have ties with the program.\n\n== Other releases ==\n\n=== ''Team Angels'' ===\n''Team Angels'' is a five-minute segment usually aired at the end of each episode with backstage, interviews, among other extra content.<ref name=\"Team\">[[:es:Team Angel,m,ll,;/s|Team Angels \u2013 Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre]]</ref> This segment was introduced in the Season 2.<ref name=\"Team\"/> Luli Fern\u00e1ndez and Jaime Dom\u00ednguez hosted the show in 2008; in 2009 they were replaced with Carolina Ibarra and Gast\u00f3n Vietto.<ref name=\"Team\"/> The format changed for the fourth season, changing the segment to Bonus Track where most of the content is put online through YouTube Casi \u00c1ngeles channel.\nIn the fourth season they took out the name Team Angels and named it Bonus Track.\nThe aired content includes backstage videos from the concerts and the shooting of ''Casi \u00c1ngeles''; [[Teen Angels]] music videos; ''Real Cam'', when a member of the cast use a handheld camero to document his day and life; interviews; ''Q&A'', when the actors reply the question posted by ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' fans via its official website, etc.<ref name=\"Team\"/> In 2009 ''Team Angels'' added the ''Fans Store'', so fans can leave their messages for the cast; some of these messages are aired during the show.<ref name=\"Team\"/> In some occasions, ''Team Angels'' have special exhibitions, named ''Casual Team''.<ref name=\"Team\"/>\n\n=== Soundtracks albums ===\n{{main|Teen Angels}}\n\n=== DVDs ===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#EFEFEF\"\n!

Its first broadcast was on March 21, 2007 and it ended on November 29, 2010, with a total of 579 episodes divided over four seasons.

The show can now be watched on YouTube.\n\n== Production  ==\nThe series was mainly filmed in Pampa Studios, located in Buenos Aires, although also some takes were shot in the street. During the end of 2008 the cast and production went on to film the first 5 episodes of the third season on location, to be more specific, in different points in the provinces of Mendoza and San Juan. Also, to record the last episodes of the same season, the team went to San Pedro, a town in Buenos Aires. Towards the end of the last season, the actors Peter Lanzani, Pablo Mart\u00ednez and Roc\u00edo Igarz\u00e1bal, recorded in the ruins of Villa Epecu\u00e9n.\n\n== Plot ==\nCasi \u00c1ngeles is the story of a group of homeless kids and teenagers who are exploited and forced to steal for Bartolom\u00e9 Bedoya Ag\u00fcero ([[Alejo Garc\u00eda Pintos]]) and Justina Merarda Garc\u00eda (Julia Calvo). But everything changes when Cielo M\u00e1gico ([[Emilia Attias]]), acrobat and dancer, and Dr. Nicol\u00e1s Bauer  ([[Nicol\u00e1s V\u00e1zquez]]), an archaeologist, enter the kids' lives. Cielo, through her music and her love and kindness, and Nicol\u00e1s, with his fatherly nature and his dreams, will give the children the chance to believe in joy again. They both keep important secrets that, when discovered, will change everyone's lives forever. This is a story packed with magic, love, music, songs, dances and competitions. But there is a mystery, the mystery, and it involves everyone. It has to do with the secrets protected by the hidden portal in the clock inside the Inchaustis' mansion and the special connection that everyone has with it. This portal has chosen each and every one with the utmost care, and everyone thus has a mission. Discovering this mission will be the meaning of this action-packed adventure. And yes, there will be setbacks, suffering, misunderstanding, separations, uncertainty, despair and disappointments but the strong bond they have with each other wil be enough for them to achieve their ultimate mission: to guarantee a better world. Thanks to Hope (Esperanza Bauer) and adult Thiago, their mission is fulfilled and they return home.\n\n== Seasons ==\n=== '''Season 1; ''The Eudam\u00f3n Island'' (2007)''' ===\nThe story begins when \u00c1ngeles Inchuasti, aka Cielo M\u00e1gico ([[Emilia Attias]]), a circus acrobat, and Nicol\u00e1s Bauer ([[Nicol\u00e1s V\u00e1zquez]]), an archaeologist (obsessed with finding the Eudam\u00f3n Island), arrive at the Inchausti Mansion. In this mansion, the evil Bartolom\u00e9 Bedoya Ag\u00fcero ([[Alejo Garc\u00eda Pintos]]) serves as director of the '''''BB Foundation''''', a foundation for orphans which he uses as a fa\u00e7ade for his fearsome plans. In this house the orphan kids are exploited by Bartolom\u00e9 and his housekeeper, Justina Merarda Garc\u00eda ([[Julia Calvo]]), they are enslaved to work and steal and they are heavily punished if they don't do as told. But his plans are threatened with the appearance of the heiresses of the house, the sisters \u00c1ngeles and Luz Inchausti.  Cielo and Nico will help and rescue this kids, discovering in the meantime, the dark secrets that the Inchausti Mansion hides, linked to Cielo's past and Eudam\u00f3n.\n\n=== '''Season 2; ''The Man of the Thousand Faces'' (2008)''' ===\nIn the second season, the kids, not being subdued by Bartolom\u00e9 Bedoya Ag\u00fcero any longer, start having a normal life, in the renamed : '''''Magical Home''''', now directed by Nico (Nicol\u00e1s V\u00e1zquez) and Cielo/\u00c1ngeles (Emilia Attias), who at first is missing after being absorbed by the magic portal (clock) inside the mansion. New kids come to the home, and the '''Corporaci\u00f3n Cruz''' ['''CC'''] appears, led by Juan Cruz ([[Mariano Torre]]), the main villain of this season. '''JC''' is a fallen angel, a shadow, obsessed with returning to Eudam\u00f3n and with Cielo, who managed, just like him, to reach that \"other level\". Juan Cruz will try to emotionally break everyone who lives in the mansion, and in order to achieve his goal he will try in many ways to prevent Cielo from having her and Nico's daughter: Paz.\n\n=== '''Season 3; ''The Little Prince'' (2009)'''===\nThe third season incorporated themes such as lateral thinking and ecology, which were added to and reinforced ideas implemented in previous seasons such as freedom of expression and social awareness. This season the kids and Justina reappear in different places, 22 years in the future, after opening the book of the 7 padlocks. From there, with the help of their \"acquired nieces\": Paz (Emilia Attias), and Hope ([[Jimena Bar\u00f3n]]), Nico daughters, and with also the help of Camilo Estrella (Mariano Torre), they will have to discover their mission, that turns out to be \"Save Paz\" (which also means : \"Save the peace [in the world]\"). Paz is a restless, disobedient girl, with a maternal, liberal and protective spirit, who falls in love with Camilo Estrella, the new director of the '''''Mandalay Institute'''''. In this season Juan Cruz, unable to prevent the birth of Paz, will try to kill her 22 years later, in order to return to Eudam\u00f3n. To all this, will also added the confrontation against the dictatorial government under the command of the Chief of Ministers ([[Mercedes Funes]]).\n\n=== '''Season 4; ''The Resistance'' (2010)'''===\nThis season is all about the consequences of having saved Paz (Emilia Attias) in the previous one. Having fulfilled this mission meant succumbing to a great temporal paradox, where the Head of Ministers,Luz Inchausti, the youngest heiress from the first season, launched the protocol called \"The Little Prince\". From there on, the kids were unable to return to their time and dispersed themselves. Several were captured by the '''Government Corporation''', and given a literal brainwash (these are Mar, Jazm\u00edn, Rama, Lleca, Esperanza and later Sim\u00f3n and Vale as well). But as if that was not enough, they implanted on them a different life story, and subsequently, they were taken to where  '''''Mandalay''''' '''''Institute''''' once was --the school was completely modified by Luz, and renamed '''''NE'''''  '''''Institute''''' [acronym for '''''New Era''''']. At the same time, there is a group called '''''The Resistance''''', made up of Thiago, Tacho, Luca, Tefi, Melody, Kika and, at the beginning, Sim\u00f3n and Vale as well ( there are also two new characters: Johnny, a boy who claims having attended '''''Mandalay'''''  '''''Institute''''', but nobody had seen and finally Nina, a mysterious \"mute\" girl, who appears suddenly, and is a friend of Kika. From there on, hidden in a lair, protected by a dimensional portal, they will try to do everything possible to accomplish their new mission, try to get his friends to remember their past, save the future from this new reality, and then go home.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Nicol\u00e1s V\u00e1zquez]] as Nicol\u00e1s Bauer \n* [[Emilia Attias]] as \u00c1ngeles Inchausti/Cielo M\u00e1gico/Linda Barba and

children and adolescents and, in some cases, young adults. In its first season, it averaged 12.0 points along the 166 issues.\n\nIn the second season, the program was much more oriented to the adolescent public, increasing the cast of that strip, in addition to the love conflicts between Cielo and Nico. A new format was introduced for a daily fiction: the episodes had titles and ended with a monologue in \"off\", following the model of the North American series and moments of suspense became important. This season achieved an average of 13.6 rating points in its 160 issues.\n\nIn January, Disney Channel began broadcasting the program for Latin America, in an edited version that eliminated all scenes of sex and violence.\n\nThe third season, which aired in Argentina in April 2009 and ended on December 3, with an average of 13.9 rating points, in its 140 issues, was the most viewed season.\n\nThe fourth season started in April 2010 and was aired until November 29 of the same year. During the month of June it was out of the air due to the transmission by the channel of the World Cup South Africa 2010. Therefore, it was the shortest season with 113 episodes, achieving a high average of 11.6 points.\n\nEleven years have gone by after its release (2020) and the audience has enlarged. Not only are yesterday's teenagers, now all grown-ups and young adults rewatching Casi \u00c1ngeles but today's adolescents are also submerging themselves into following the adventures of Nico, Cielo and the kids, (and later only the kids) through the most unexpected and life-changing adventures. Nowadays the series can be watched on YouTube on the verified channel of the same name, [https://www.youtube.com/user/casiangeles Casi Angeles]. The four complete seasons have been uploaded plus the extra material that was broadcast on TV back in the day. What is more, the channel is constantly updated with videos about the making of the show, some fun-facts and some videos to celebrate special days. In addition, the Instagram account @bycrismorena, which belongs to the producer of the show, regularly posts pictures, videos and edits.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Season\n!Original release\n!End of Season\n!# of episodes\n!Average rating\n|-\n|1\n|March 21, 2007\n|November 15, 2007\n|166\n|12.0\n|-\n|2\n|April 3, 2008\n|December 1, 2008\n|160\n|13.6\n|-\n|3\n|April 20, 2009\n|December 3, 2009\n|140\n|13.9\n|-\n|4\n|April 12, 2010\n|November 29, 2010\n|113\n|11.6\n|}\n\n=== International Broadcast ===\nThe series in addition to being broadcast by Telefe is also broadcast by air and cable channels in different countries of the world, reason why the strip transcended the borders and got a big fanatic around the world, being highlighted Israel. Some of the featured channels are: Jetix South American Zone, as it issued the first two of the strip and Disney Channel north zone, which is in charge of its respective zone of emission.\n\n== Team Angels/Bonus Track ==\nThe ''Team Angels'' or ''Bonus Track'' is a block of the program that began to be broadcast the 20 of June 2008 during the second season of the series in Argentina and that was emitted at the end of each episode. It lasted for about five minutes. In this segment, you could see interviews with the actors and creators, bloopers, behind the scenes, backstage of the Gran Rex Theater performances, rehearsals, real-cam of the actors, questionnaires, fans' videos, among others.\n\n== Logo creation ==\nIn Season 1, the logo had two angel wings united by a safety pin, which also represented the ''A'' for ''\u00c1ngeles''. The wings were covered in patches to represent the fact they were poor and had affection holes in their hearts. This explanation was given by Cris Morena during an interview for Produ.tv.\n\nIn Season 2, the patches disappeared from the logo. In this season, the characters were not poor anymore and had a loving family.\n\nIn Season 3, there was not a safety pin uniting the two wings anymore. The font of ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' changed slightly. The logo background image had a [[mandala]], which is one important symbol this season, for example, the school they attend is called ''Mandalay''. For a brief period of the Season 3, the logo went dark to represent the fact Camilo Estrella, [[Mariano Torre]] character, had been possessed by the evil Juan Cruz and tragedy would ensue.\n\nIn the third-season finale, the fourth season logo was revealed. It is orange and black and it has a different font. There's also a peace sign with two wings coming out of it. The I and V from the title resemble the Roman number for 4, IV.\n\n== Reception ==\nAlthough the show had a good critical reception, ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' was received with lukewarm ratings. The fans of Cris Morena criticized the show for being too repetitive, with scenes exactly like some of her previous hits such as Rebelde Way, Floricienta, Chiquititas and Alma Pirata. In the beginning, the show did not have a specific audience, it was targeted to kids and teenagers with some story lines skewing too young while others too old. The ratings were dropping and the highly promoted ''[[Patito Feo]]'' debuted on [[Canal 13 (Argentina)|Canal 13]] at the same time slot, and easily beat ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' ratings. While repercussion and sales of ''Patito Feo'' products were astronomic and ratings were soaring, ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' rating numbers were struggling which prompted [[Telefe]] to hurriedly change the show to an earlier time slot.\n\nAlso some changes were made in ''Casi \u00c1ngeles''. The show concentrated on teenagers and started distancing from previous shows of Cris Morena, adding mystery and suspense elements. The changes had an effect and the audience started to grow. After a few weeks in the earlier time slot, the show returned to its original 6 P.M. slot, again confronting ''Patito Feo'' and this time it had similar rating numbers. In the end, the show had an average of 12 points according to [[Ibope]], only 0.2 points lower than ''Patito Feo''. The Season 1 finale reached 15 points, a series high and 1 point higher than ''Patito Feo'''s finale.\n\nAlthough the show was struggling on television, the 2007 musical with the entire cast of the show in [[Teatro Gran Rex]] was the highest-grossing live event of the year. As usual, Cris Morena invested millions of dollars in a [[high-tech]] concert full of expensive effects and production. It sold over 120,000 tickets. The first-season soundtrack album, with all songs sung by the cast, ranked 12th on the best-selling albums of 2007 list compiled by [[CAPIF]], much lower than ''Patito Feo'''s soundtrack which was number one. It also ranked lower than some of the previous Cris Morena production soundtracks (''[[Chiquititas soundtracks|Chiquititas 2006]]'' was sixth on the annual list in 2006, ''[[Floricienta|Floricienta 2]]'' was first in 2005, ''[[Floricienta|Floricienta 1]]'' was 3rd in 2004 and 10th in 2005, [[Erreway]]'s ''[[Se\u00f1ales]]'' was 3rd in 2002 and 7th in 2003) although it did achieve [[Record certification|Platinum certification]]. During the summer hiatus, the cast of the show played concerts in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Rosario]] and [[Punta del Este]].\n\nIn the second season, the show got a total makeover. It became much more oriented to teenagers, with the Teen Angels receiving more screen time and Nico and Cielo's relationship less. It also introduced a new format for a daily fiction: episodes had titles and ended in monologues, following the model of U.S. shows such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. In the same vein as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', the mystery elements became very important. The changes were well received and the show's rating exploded. It easily beat ''Patito Feo'''s Season 2 number; while the Canal 13 show had a 9 points average, 3 points lower than previous season, ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' Season 2 averaged 14 points, 2 points higher. The second soundtrack album was also a strong seller, achieving double platinum and ending the year as the third-best-selling album in the annual ranking.\n\nThe Teen Angels popularity skyrocketed with the cast appearing on the cover of several magazines and attracting huge hysteria wherever they went.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In [[Unicenter (shopping)|Unicenter]], a store was opened to sell exclusive ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' merchandising, ''Fans Store''. The 2008 live musical in [[Teatro Gran Rex]] broke records with 220,000 tickets sold, the second highest attendance ever in the theater's 81 years of history and doubling the number of the previous season<ref>[http://www.extremista.com.ar/13277/entradas-de-casi-angeles-en-el-teatro-gran-rex-agotadas Entradas de Casi \u00c1ngeles en el teatro Gran Rex agotadas]</ref> After the season of concerts in [[Buenos Aires]], the Teen Angels toured extensively in Argentina, selling out arenas everywhere. They also played a sold-out concert for 40,000 in [[Montevideo]], Uruguay. After the second-season finale, the cast played six additional concerts in Buenos Aires, and, during the summer hiatus, the Teen Angels were chosen as the spokespersons for [[Coca-Cola]]. They recorded the song \"Hoy Quiero\" which became the official Coke Summer Anthem. Also during the summer, they played two sold-out concerts in [[Mar del Plata]] and opened the official Coca-Cola stand in [[Pinamar]], attracting over 2500 people to the event.\n\nIn January,{{When|date=February 2011}} [[Disney Channel]] started airing the show to Latin America, in a highly edited version cutting all the sexual and violent elements. To promote the show and their CD, the Teen Angels traveled to [[Mexico City]] for a showcase and interviews. The third season finally debuted in Argentina in April, six months after production began. Without no substantial competition, after ''Patito Feo'' was canceled due to season 2's disastrous number, ratings went through the roof. The third season average is, up to August, 15 points, two points higher than 2008. The third CD is also the best-selling album of the year until the moment. However, the live musical could not top the first two seasons' attendance numbers due to the [[swine flu]] epidemic which caused panic in Buenos Aires in July, during the Winter vacations. In August, sales were normalized and the concerts started to sell out fast as usual. However, all the canceled shows in July meant 2009 musical would not top previous years' numbers. In the end, it sold 100,000 tickets, which was less than the two previous seasons.\n\nIn late 2008, after the debut of the second season, ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' became a gigantic hit in [[Israel]]. [[Peter Lanzani]] and [[Mariana Esp\u00f3sito|Lali Esp\u00f3sito]] visited the country to promote the show and caused hysteria.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The complete cast visited [[Tel Aviv]] in October 2009 for a series of sold-out concerts which had over 80,000 tickets sold. Peter and Mariana were also chosen as spokespeople for the Keff shampoo.\n\nThe third season ended on 5 December 2009. It reached 16.6 points and didn't exceed the season 2 season finale or the season 3 debut (both achieved 18.4 points). Season 3 averaged 14 points, the same as season 2. However, there was a drop in the ratings from the middle of the season.\n\nIn November, the Teen Angels did a promotional tour across Latin America. In December,{{When|date=November 2010}} they'll visit Spain and Italy.\n\nThe show was renewed for a fourth season and will return to [[Telefe]] in 2010. The [[Teen Angels]] will star in Coca-Cola Argentina's Christmas promotional campaign and will be featured on Coke's cans.\n\n== Licensing ==\n''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' spawned a series of merchandising. During the Season 1, the products were targeted to children with toys, apparel, bicycle, cosmetics among others targeting mostly young girls. With the second season became teenage-oriented and the licensing program also started to skew older beginning. Stationery items, posters, postcards, furniture, clothing line, perfumes among other products were released to accompany the second and the third season. An official store, ''Fans Store'', is located at [[Unicenter (shopping)|Unicenter]] shopping mall in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe show also spawned an official monthly magazine, four sticker albums by [[Panini (stickers)|Panini]], three soundtrack albums, two live album, among other products. The program has tie-ins with several brands. Lingerie line ''Sweet Victorian'' and label ''[[47 Street]]'' are sponsors of the show and also responsible for the wardrobe of most female characters. Shoe brand ''Jaguar'' is also a sponsor and their products are advertised on the show and used by the characters. Jaguar also has a Casi Angeles shoe line available. [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Movistar]] also have ties with the program.\n\n== Other releases ==\n\n=== ''Team Angels'' ===\n''Team Angels'' is a five-minute segment usually aired at the end of each episode with backstage, interviews, among other extra content.<ref name=\"Team\">[[:es:Team Angel,m,ll,;/s|Team Angels \u2013 Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre]]</ref> This segment was introduced in the Season 2.<ref name=\"Team\"/> Luli Fern\u00e1ndez and Jaime Dom\u00ednguez hosted the show in 2008; in 2009 they were replaced with Carolina Ibarra and Gast\u00f3n Vietto.<ref name=\"Team\"/> The format changed for the fourth season, changing the segment to Bonus Track where most of the content is put online through YouTube Casi \u00c1ngeles channel.\nIn the fourth season they took out the name Team Angels and named it Bonus Track.\nThe aired content includes backstage videos from the concerts and the shooting of ''Casi \u00c1ngeles''; [[Teen Angels]] music videos; ''Real Cam'', when a member of the cast use a handheld camero to document his day and life; interviews; ''Q&A'', when the actors reply the question posted by ''Casi \u00c1ngeles'' fans via its official website, etc.<ref name=\"Team\"/> In 2009 ''Team Angels'' added the ''Fans Store'', so fans can leave their messages for the cast; some of these messages are aired during the show.<ref name=\"Team\"/> In some occasions, ''Team Angels'' have special exhibitions, named ''Casual Team''.<ref name=\"Team\"/>\n\n=== Soundtracks albums ===\n{{main|Teen Angels}}\n\n=== DVDs ===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#EFEFEF\"\n!

{"title_page": "Patio Olmos", "text_new": "[[File:Patio Olmos 2011-12-22.jpg|thumb|260px|Patio Olmos Shopping Gallery]]\n'''Patio Olmos''' is an architecturally significant shopping gallery in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina]], and the city's most important.\n\n==History and overview==\nThe development of a suburb southeast of C\u00f3rdoba proper by developer Miguel Crisol was accompanied by a flurry of public investment. Among the first of such works was the Boys' [[Middle School]], commissioned by Governor [[Jos\u00e9 Vicente de Olmos]] in 1906 and built by the Ministry of Public Works of the [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|Province of C\u00f3rdoba]]. Designed by El\u00edas Senestrari, the [[renaissance revival]]ist building was inaugurated on November 4, 1909. Governor Olmos, who had recently died, was honored by having the school named after him.<ref>[http://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?t=168868 Skyscraper page forum: Patio Omos {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n[[File:Cordoba Patio Olmos.JPG|left|thumb|The promenade]]\n\nSet on the northeast corner of the intersection of three major avenues, the semi-circular school was designed to maximize classroom area, and its original capacity of 500 students was later expanded to 800. The building's condition declined over the decades, however, and a [[1977 San Juan earthquake|1977 earthquake]] in [[San Juan, Argentina]], though over 300 mi (480 km) to the west, caused it serious structural damage and led to its closure. It remained abandoned until a 1991 initiative by Governor [[Eduardo Angeloz]] resulted in the building's restoration. The agreement signed in 1992 between the Province of C\u00f3rdoba, the building's proprietors and a consortium of two local developers allowed the firms a 35-year lease at a token monthly rent in exchange for their development of the former school into an upscale shopping gallery and other investments.

Among the first of such works was the Boys' [[Middle School]], commissioned by Governor [[Jos\u00e9 Vicente de Olmos]] in 1906 and built by the Ministry of Public Works of the [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|Province of C\u00f3rdoba]]. Designed by El\u00edas Senestrari, the [[renaissance revival]]ist building was inaugurated on November 4, 1909. Governor Olmos, who had recently died, was honored by having the school named after him.<ref>[http://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?t=168868 Skyscraper page forum: Patio Omos {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n[[File:Cordoba Patio Olmos.JPG|left|thumb|The promenade]]\n\nSet on the northeast corner of the intersection of three major avenues, the semi-circular school was designed to maximize classroom area, and its original capacity of 500 students was later expanded to 800. The building's condition declined over the decades, however, and a [[1977 San Juan earthquake|1977 earthquake]] in [[San Juan, Argentina]], though over 300 mi (480 km) to the west, caused it serious structural damage and led to its closure. It remained abandoned until a 1991 initiative by Governor [[Eduardo Angeloz]] resulted in the building's restoration. The agreement signed in 1992 between the Province of C\u00f3rdoba, the building's proprietors and a consortium of two local developers allowed the firms a 35-year lease at a token monthly rent in exchange for their development of the former school into an upscale shopping gallery and other investments.
