Between 1922\u20131923 he was a senator of the [[Second Polish Republic]] (Polish ''Rzeczpospolita''). In 1946, [[Pope Pius XII]] created him Cardinal.\n\n==Early life==\nSapieha was born in 1867 in the castle of [[Krasiczyn]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. His family, originally from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], were members of the Polish [[nobility]]. He was the youngest of the seven children of Prince [[Adam Stanis\u0142aw Sapieha|Adam Stanis\u0142aw Sapieha-Kodenski]] and Princess Jadwiga Klementyna [[House of Sanguszko|Sanguszko-Lubartowicza]], daughter of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Hieronim Sanguszko]]. His elder brother prince [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Leon Sapieha]] is the great-grand father of [[Mathilde of Belgium|Queen Mathilde of the Belgians]].\n\n==Education and early vocation==\nAfter graduating from [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Lw\u00f3w]] in 1886, he enrolled in the Law Department at the [[University of Vienna]], starting simultaneously law studies at [[Institut Catholique de Paris|Institut Catholique]] in [[Lille]]. In 1887 on the basis of his certificate from the [[University of Vienna]] Sapieha continued studies at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. After two years he passed the examination and returned to [[Vienna]] for further studies, where he remained until 1890, obtaining the certificate of completion. \n\nIn the same year he began theological studies at the [[University of Innsbruck]], and in 1892 signed up for the third year of the [[Roman Catholic Seminary in Lviv|Major Roman Catholic Theological Seminary in Lviv]]. He was then educated at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in Rome, where he was also [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|ordained as priest]] of [[Lviv]] (Lw\u00f3w, Lemberg) on 1 October 1893 by Bishop [[Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko]] (later [[Bishop of Krak\u00f3w]] and Cardinal). Father Sapieha then did pastoral work in the Archdiocese of Lviv before in October 1895 he started further studies in Rome, where he obtained a doctorate of civil and canon law at the [[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy]]. At the same time he studied diplomacy at the [[Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles]].\n\nAfter returning to the home country in 1897, he was designated vice-rector of the diocesan seminary in Lviv and eventually became its [[Rector (academia)|rector]]. He resigned because he was discouraged by the imposed rules of education of young priests. After a half-year trip across the [[United States|United States of America]], he was designated a vicar of the St. Nicholas congregation in Lviv in October 1902. In 1905 Sapieha was appointed a [[papal chamberlain]], and sent to Rome where he was a consultant on matters concerning the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, in the [[History of Poland|annexed territories]], the realization of an idea by Lviv [[Armenian Catholic]] Archbishop [[J\u00f3zef Teodorowicz]] (who was the Sapieha's long-term friend)<ref>Wielki Zapomniany, ks.Tadeusz Isakowicz-Zaleski. [http://lwow.home.pl/ormianie/teodorowicz.html ks. abp J\u00f3zef Teodorowicz (1864\u20131938)].</ref> to have a representative of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland at the [[Roman Curia]].\n\n==Bishop==\nSapieha was appointed [[Bishop of Krak\u00f3w]] on 24 November 1911 and was consecrated by [[Pope Pius X]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]] on 7 December of the same year. In 1915, he established a relief committee for victims of World War I.\n\nAfter World War I, Sapieha became a vocal opponent of the new [[concordat]] negotiated between the [[Holy See]] and the newly resurrected Polish state. He argued that the Polish Church should be completely independent of the state and that its primate should be the [[Archbishop of Warsaw]]. This attitude led to a conflict with [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Achille Ratti]], [[Pope Benedict XV]]'s nuncio who himself later became [[Pope]], during the first post-war congress of Polish bishops in [[Gniezno]] held 26\u201330 August 1919. Sapieha thought that the Polish should decide their affairs without outside influence and asked Ratti to leave the conference room. Sapieha was not elevated to the cardinalate by Ratti after he became Pope [[Pius XI]] in 1922.\n\nIn 1922, Sapieha was elected senator from the [[Christian Union of National Unity]] party. He ordered a memorial service and issued a proclamation on the assassination of [[Gabriel Narutowicz]]. It was the only speech he delivered as a senator because papal mandate at the time prohibited clergy from holding public office. He resigned on 9 March 1923.\n\nSapieha was appointed Metropolitan Archbishop in 1925 when the Diocese of Krak\u00f3w was elevated to the rank of Archdiocese. He received a [[honorary degree|degree honoris causa]] from the [[Jagiellonian University]] in 1926. In September 1930, after opposition leaders were arrested and placed in confinement at [[Brest Fortress]], Archbishops Sapieha and Teodorowicz strongly criticized the government. Despite this, and other occasional disagreements with the government, Sapieha was awarded the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]] in 1936.\n\nIn 1937, Sapieha, who had opposed the [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski|Pilsudski]] regime (sanacja), made the controversial decision to move Pi\u0142sudski's body, within [[Wawel Cathedral|Wawel's Cathedral]], from [[St. Leonard's Crypt]] to the crypt under the Silver Bells.<ref>Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945.

After the death of Pius XI, he repeated his request to the new pope, [[Pius XII]] on 19 June 1939.

He told the German official: ''No! They are not going to change anything, but they will take a photograph of me and write that a Polish bishop arrived at Hitler's birthday party with best wishes. Tell him I will not come.'' Another such anecdote recalls when governor Hans Frank ordered the archbishop to hand him the keys to the [[Wawel Castle]]. Sapieha replied: ''But don't forget to give them back to me when you will be leaving Wawel.''\n\n==Cardinal==\nIn March 1945, he initiated the publication of [[Tygodnik Powszechny]]. He was created [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal-Priest]], of the title of ''[[Santa Francesca Romana, Rome|Santa Maria Nuova]]'', on 18 February 1946. On 1 November 1946 he conferred priestly ordination on [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Wojty\u0142a]] in the chapel of his episcopal residence.

Between 1922\u20131923 he was a senator of the [[Second Polish Republic]] (Polish ''Rzeczpospolita''). In 1946, [[Pope Pius XII]] created him Cardinal.\n\n==Early life==\nSapieha was born in 1867 in the castle of [[Krasiczyn]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. His family, originally from the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], were members of the Polish [[nobility]]. He was the youngest of the seven children of Prince [[Adam Stanis\u0142aw Sapieha|Adam Stanis\u0142aw Sapieha-Kodenski]] and Princess Jadwiga Klementyna [[House of Sanguszko|Sanguszko-Lubartowicza]], daughter of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Hieronim Sanguszko]]. His elder brother prince [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Leon Sapieha]] is the great-grand father of [[Mathilde of Belgium|Queen Mathilde of the Belgians]].\n\n==Education and early vocation==\nAfter graduating from [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Lw\u00f3w]] in 1886, he enrolled in the Law Department at the [[University of Vienna]], starting simultaneously law studies at [[Institut Catholique de Paris|Institut Catholique]] in [[Lille]]. In 1887 on the basis of his certificate from the [[University of Vienna]] Sapieha continued studies at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. After two years he passed the examination and returned to [[Vienna]] for further studies, where he remained until 1890, obtaining the certificate of completion. \n\nIn the same year he began theological studies at the [[University of Innsbruck]], and in 1892 signed up for the third year of the [[Roman Catholic Seminary in Lviv|Major Roman Catholic Theological Seminary in Lviv]]. He was then educated at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in Rome, where he was also [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|ordained as priest]] of [[Lviv]] (Lw\u00f3w, Lemberg) on 1 October 1893 by Bishop [[Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko]] (later [[Bishop of Krak\u00f3w]] and Cardinal). Father Sapieha then did pastoral work in the Archdiocese of Lviv before in October 1895 he started further studies in Rome, where he obtained a doctorate of civil and canon law at the [[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy]]. At the same time he studied diplomacy at the [[Pontifical Academy of Ecclesiastical Nobles]].\n\nAfter returning to the home country in 1897, he was designated vice-rector of the diocesan seminary in Lviv and eventually became its [[Rector (academia)|rector]]. He resigned because he was discouraged by the imposed rules of education of young priests. After a half-year trip across the [[United states of america|United States of America]], he was designated a vicar of the St. Nicholas congregation in Lviv in October 1902. In 1905 Sapieha was appointed a [[papal chamberlain]], and sent to Rome where he was a consultant on matters concerning the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, in the [[History of Poland|annexed territories]], the realization of an idea by Lviv [[Armenian Catholic]] Archbishop [[J\u00f3zef Teodorowicz]] (who was the Sapieha's long-term friend)<ref>Wielki Zapomniany, ks.Tadeusz Isakowicz-Zaleski. [http://lwow.home.pl/ormianie/teodorowicz.html ks. abp J\u00f3zef Teodorowicz (1864\u20131938)].</ref> to have a representative of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland at the [[Roman Curia]].\n\n==Bishop==\nSapieha was appointed [[Bishop of Krak\u00f3w]] on 24 November 1911 and was consecrated by [[Pope Pius X]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]] on 7 December of the same year. In 1915, he established a relief committee for victims of World War I.\n\nAfter World War I, Sapieha became a vocal opponent of the new [[concordat]] negotiated between the [[Holy See]] and the newly resurrected Polish state. He argued that the Polish Church should be completely independent of the state and that its primate should be the [[Archbishop of Warsaw]]. This attitude led to a conflict with [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Achille Ratti]], [[Pope Benedict XV]]'s nuncio who himself later became [[Pope]], during the first post-war congress of Polish bishops in [[Gniezno]] held 26\u201330 August 1919. Sapieha thought that the Polish should decide their affairs without outside influence and asked Ratti to leave the conference room. Sapieha was not elevated to the cardinalate by Ratti after he became Pope [[Pius XI]] in 1922.\n\nIn 1922, Sapieha was elected senator from the [[Christian Union of National Unity]] party. He ordered a memorial service and issued a proclamation on the assassination of [[Gabriel Narutowicz]]. It was the only speech he delivered as a senator because papal mandate at the time prohibited clergy from holding public office. He resigned on 9 March 1923.\n\nSapieha was appointed Metropolitan Archbishop in 1925 when the Diocese of Krak\u00f3w was elevated to the rank of Archdiocese. He received a [[honorary degree|degree honoris causa]] from the [[Jagiellonian University]] in 1926. In September 1930, after opposition leaders were arrested and placed in confinement at [[Brest Fortress]], Archbishops Sapieha and Teodorowicz strongly criticized the government. Despite this, and other occasional disagreements with the government, Sapieha was awarded the [[Order of the White Eagle (Poland)|Order of the White Eagle]] in 1936.\n\nIn 1937, Sapieha, who had opposed the [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski|Pilsudski]] regime (sanacja), made the controversial decision to move Pi\u0142sudski's body, within [[Wawel Cathedral|Wawel's Cathedral]], from [[St. Leonard's Crypt]] to the crypt under the Silver Bells.<ref>Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966-1945.

Texts written in this cuneiform have been found in [[Iran]] ([[Persepolis]], [[Susa]], [[Hamadan]], [[Kharg Island]]), [[Armenia]], [[Romania]] ([[Gherla]]),{{sfn|Kuhrt|2013|page=197}}{{sfn|Frye|1984|page=103}}{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|page=53}} [[Turkey]] ([[Van Fortress]]), and along the [[Suez Canal]].<ref name=\"OPGTL 6\">Kent, R. G.: \"Old Persian: Grammar Texts Lexicon\", page 6. American Oriental Society, 1950.</ref> They were mostly inscriptions from the time period of [[Darius I]], such as the [[DNa inscription]], as well as his son, [[Xerxes I]].<ref name=\"OLDPERSIANDICTIONARY\">Bachenheimer, Avi: \"Old Persian: Dictionary, Glossary and Concordance\", pages 27-92.</ref> Later kings down to [[Artaxerxes III]] used more recent forms of the language classified as \"pre-Middle Persian\".<ref name=\"OPGTL 6\" />\n\n==History==\nOld Persian cuneiform is loosely inspired by the [[Sumerian language|Sumero]]-[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]]; however, only one [[glyph]] is directly derived from it - ''l(a)'' ({{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbe}}), from ''la'' ({{cuneiform|\ud808\uddb7}}). (''l<sup>a</sup>'' did not occur in native Old Persian words, but was found in Akkadian borrowings.)\n\nScholars today mostly agree that the Old Persian script was invented by about 525 BC to provide monument inscriptions for the [[Achaemenid]] king [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]], to be used at [[Behistun]]. While a few Old Persian texts seem to be inscribed during the reigns of [[Cyrus the Great]] (CMa, CMb, and CMc, all found at [[Pasargadae]]), the first Achaemenid emperor, or [[Arsames of Persia|Arsames]] and [[Ariaramnes of Persia|Ariaramnes]] (AsH and AmH, both found at [[Hamadan]]), grandfather and great-grandfather of Darius I, all five, specially the later two, are generally agreed to have been later inscriptions.\n\nAround the time period in which Old Persian was used, nearby languages included [[Elamite]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].  One of the main differences between the writing systems of these languages is that Old Persian is a semi-alphabet while [[Elamite cuneiform|Elamite]] and [[Cuneiform script#Akkadian cuneiform|Akkadian]] were syllabic. In addition, while Old Persian is written in a consistent semi-alphabetic system, Elamite and Akkadian used borrowings from other languages, creating mixed systems.\n\n==Decipherment==\nMuch of the progress made in [[decipherment]] depended on the names of kings.  Attempts at deciphering Old Persian cuneiform started in 1711 when some of Darius's inscriptions were published by [[Jean Chardin]].<ref name=\"OPGTL 9\">Kent, R. G.: \"Old Persian: Grammar Texts Lexicon\", page 9. American Oriental Society, 1950.</ref> In 1802, [[Friedrich M\u00fcnter]] realized that recurring groups of characters must be the word for \u201cking\u201d ({{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfb9\ud800\udfb0\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfb9}}, now known to be pronounced ''x\u0161\u0101ya\u03d1iya''). [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]] extended this work by realizing a king's name is often followed by \u201cgreat king, king of kings\u201d and the name of the king's father.<ref name=\"RGK\">Kent, R. G.: \"Old Persian: Grammar Texts Lexicon\", page 10. American Oriental Society, 1950.</ref>\n\nGrotefend made a major breakthrough when he noticed that one of the kings' father was not a king.  In Persian history around the time period the inscriptions were expected to be made, there were only two instances where a ruler came to power without being a previous king's son.  They were [[Darius the Great]] and [[Cyrus the Great]], both of whom became emperor by revolt. The deciding factors between these two choices were the names of their fathers and sons. Darius's father was Hystaspes and his son was [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], while Cyrus' father was [[Cambyses I]] and his son was [[Cambyses II]]. Within the text, the father and son of the king had different groups of symbols for names so Grotefend assumed that the king must have been Darius. These connections allowed Grotefend to figure out the cuneiform characters that are part of Darius, Darius's father Hystaspes, and Darius's son [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]. Grotefend's contribution to Old Persian is unique in that he did not have comparisons between Old Persian and known languages, as opposed to the decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphics and the [[Rosetta Stone]]. All his decipherments were done by comparing the texts with known history.\n\nMore advances were made on Grotefend's work and by 1847, most of the symbols were correctly identified.  Notable uses of Old Persian's decipherment include the decipherment of Elamite and Akkadian through the [[Behistun Inscription]].\n\n==Signs==\nMost scholars consider the writing system to be an independent invention because it has no obvious connections with other writing systems at the time, such as [[Elamite language|Elamite]], Akkadian, [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], and [[Hittite language|Hittite]] cuneiforms.<ref>Windfuhr, G. L.: \"Notes on the old Persian signs\", page 1. Indo-Iranian Journal, 1970.</ref> While Old Persian's basic strokes are similar to those found in cuneiform scripts, Old Persian texts were engraved on hard materials, so the engravers had to make cuts that imitated the forms easily made on clay tablets.<ref name=\"OPGTL 9\" />  The signs are composed of horizontal, vertical, and angled wedges.  There are four basic components and new signs are created by adding wedges to these basic components.<ref name=\"NOPS 2\">Windfuhr, G. L.: \"Notes on the old Persian signs\", page 2. Indo-Iranian Journal, 1970.</ref> These four basic components are two parallel wedges without angle, three parallel wedges without angle, one wedge without angle and an angled wedge, and two angled wedges.<ref name=\"NOPS 2\" /> The script is written from left to right.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 134.

Old Persian contains two sets of consonants: those whose shape depends on the following vowel and those whose shape is independent of the following vowel.  The consonant symbols that depend on the following vowel act like the consonants in [[Devanagari]].  Vowel diacritics are added to these consonant symbols to change the inherent vowel or add length to the inherent vowel.  However, the vowel symbols are usually still included so [di] would be written as [di] [i] even though [di] already implies the vowel.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 136. Oxford University Press, 1996</ref> For the consonants whose shape does not depend on the following vowels, the vowel signs must be used after the consonant symbol.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 135. Oxford University Press, 1996</ref>\n\nCompared to the [[Avestan alphabet]] Old Persian notably lacks voiced fricatives, but includes the sign ''\u00e7'' (of uncertain pronunciation) and a sign for the non-native ''l''. Notably, in common with the [[Brahmic scripts]], there appears to be no distinction between a consonant followed by an ''a'' and a consonant followed by nothing.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|  ||  || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">k-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">x-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">g-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">c-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u00e7-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">j-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">t-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u03b8-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">d-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">p-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">f-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">b-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">n-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">m-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">y-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">v-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">r-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">l-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">s-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">z-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u0161-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">h-</span>\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-(a)</span> || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa0}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa3}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa7}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa5}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa8}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc2}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa9}}  || rowspan=2|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfab}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb0}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb1}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb3}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb2}} || rowspan=2|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb6}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb9}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfba}} || rowspan=2|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbc}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbe}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbf}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc0}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc1}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}}\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-i</span> || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa1}}\n! <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u2014</span> !! \u2014 \n| {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaa}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb7}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbb}}\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-u</span> || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa2}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa4}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa6}}\n! \u2014\n| {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfac}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb5}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb8}}\n! \u2014 \n| {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbd}}\n|-\n|}\n\n*logograms:\n**''[[Ahura Mazda|Auramazd\u0101]]'': {{script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc8}}, {{script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc9}}, {{script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfca}} (genitive)\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">x\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iya</span>'' \"king\": {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcb}}\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">dahy\u0101u\u0161-</span>'' \"country\": <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcc}}, {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcd}}</span>\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">baga-</span>'' \"god\": {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfce}}\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">b\u016bmi\u0161-</span>'' \"earth\": {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcf}}\n*[[word divider]]: <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfd0}}</span>\n*numerals:<ref>Unattested numbers are not listed.

Inscription.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Old Persian inscription in [[Persepolis]]]]\nAlthough based on a logo-syllabic prototype, all vowels but short /a/ are written and so the system is essentially an [[alphabet]]. There are three vowels, long and short. Initially, no distinction is made for length: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa0}} ''a'' or ''\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa1}} ''i'' or ''\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa2}} ''u'' or ''\u016b.'' However, as in the Brahmic scripts, short ''a'' is not written after a consonant: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}} ''h'' or ''ha,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa0}} ''h\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa1}} ''hi'' or ''h\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa2}} ''hu'' or ''h\u016b.'' (Old Persian is not considered an [[abugida]] because vowels are represented as full letters.)\n\nThirteen out of twenty-two consonants, such as {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}} ''h(a),'' are invariant, regardless of the following vowel (that is, they are alphabetic), while only six have a distinct form for each consonant-vowel combination (that is, they are syllabic), and among these, only ''d'' and ''m'' occur in three forms for all three vowels: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad}} ''d'' or ''da,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad\ud800\udfa0}} ''d\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae\ud800\udfa1}} ''di'' or ''d\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf\ud800\udfa2}} ''du'' or ''d\u016b.'' (''k, g'' do not occur before ''i,'' and ''j, v'' do not occur before ''u,'' so these consonants only have two forms each.)\n\nSometimes medial long vowels are written with a ''y'' or ''v,'' as in Semitic: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfb9}} ''d\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfba}} ''d\u016b.'' Diphthongs are written by mismatching consonant and vowel: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad\ud800\udfa1}} ''dai'', or sometimes, in cases where the consonant does not differentiate between vowels, by writing the consonant and both vowel components: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa8\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfb1\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfc1}} ''ci\u0161pai\u0161'' (gen. of name Ci\u0161pi- '[[Teispes]]').\n\nIn addition, three consonants, ''t'', ''n'', and ''r'', are partially syllabic, having the same form before ''a'' and ''i'', and a distinct form only before ''u'': {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4}} ''n'' or ''na,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4\ud800\udfa0}} ''n\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4\ud800\udfa1}} ''ni'' or ''n\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb5\ud800\udfa2}} ''nu'' or ''n\u016b.''\n\nThe effect is not unlike the English {{IPA|[d\u0292]}} sound, which is typically written ''g'' before ''i'' or ''e'', but ''j'' before other vowels (''gem'', ''jam''), or the [[Castilian Spanish]] {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} sound, which is written ''c'' before ''i'' or ''e'' and ''z'' before other vowels (''cinco, zapato''): it is more accurate to say that some of the Old Persian consonants are written by different letters depending on the following vowel, rather than classifying the script as syllabic. This situation had its origin in [[Cuneiform script#Assyrian cuneiform|Assyrian cuneiform]], where several syllabic distinctions had been lost and were often clarified with explicit vowels. However, in the case of Assyrian, the vowel was not always used, and was never used where not needed, so the system remained (logo-)syllabic.\n\nFor a while it was speculated that the alphabet could have had its origin in such a system, with a leveling of consonant signs a millennium earlier producing something like the [[Ugaritic alphabet]], but today it is generally accepted that the Semitic alphabet arose from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], where vowel notation was not important.

the word for \"King\". The words positionned before it would then logically be the names of kings, which were known historically from other sources. Various characteristics of these words, such as length or recurrence of signs, allowed to discriminate between the various possible kings, and then create a correspondence between each cuneiform and a specific sound. This word is now known to be pronounced ''x\u0161\u0101ya\u03d1iya'' (\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfb9\ud800\udfb0\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfb9), and indeed means \"King\".<ref name=\"RGK\"/>]]\n'''Old Persian cuneiform''' is a semi-alphabetic [[cuneiform script]] that was the primary script for [[Old Persian]].  Texts written in this cuneiform have been found in [[Iran]] ([[Persepolis]], [[Susa]], [[Hamadan]], [[Kharg Island]]), [[Armenia]], [[Romania]] ([[Gherla]]),{{sfn|Kuhrt|2013|page=197}}{{sfn|Frye|1984|page=103}}{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|page=53}} [[Turkey]] ([[Van Fortress]]), and along the [[Suez Canal]].<ref name=\"OPGTL 6\">Kent, R. G.: \"Old Persian: Grammar Texts Lexicon\", page 6. American Oriental Society, 1950.</ref> They were mostly inscriptions from the time period of [[Darius I]], such as the [[DNa inscription]], as well as his son, [[Xerxes I]].<ref name=\"OLDPERSIANDICTIONARY\">Bachenheimer, Avi: \"Old Persian: Dictionary, Glossary and Concordance\", pages 27-92.</ref> Later kings down to [[Artaxerxes III]] used more recent forms of the language classified as \"pre-Middle Persian\".<ref name=\"OPGTL 6\" />\n\n==History==\nOld Persian cuneiform is loosely inspired by the [[Sumerian language|Sumero]]-[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]]; however, only one [[glyph]] is directly derived from it - ''l(a)'' ({{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbe}}), from ''la'' ({{cuneiform|\ud808\uddb7}}). (''l<sup>a</sup>'' did not occur in native Old Persian words, but was found in Akkadian borrowings.)\n\nScholars today mostly agree that the Old Persian script was invented by about 525 BC to provide monument inscriptions for the [[Achaemenid]] king [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]], to be used at [[Behistun]]. While a few Old Persian texts seem to be inscribed during the reigns of [[Cyrus the Great]] (CMa, CMb, and CMc, all found at [[Pasargadae]]), the first Achaemenid emperor, or [[Arsames of Persia|Arsames]] and [[Ariaramnes of Persia|Ariaramnes]] (AsH and AmH, both found at [[Hamadan]]), grandfather and great-grandfather of Darius I, all five, specially the later two, are generally agreed to have been later inscriptions.\n\nAround the time period in which Old Persian was used, nearby languages included [[Elamite]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].  One of the main differences between the writing systems of these languages is that Old Persian is a semi-alphabet while [[Elamite cuneiform|Elamite]] and [[Cuneiform script#Akkadian cuneiform|Akkadian]] were syllabic. In addition, while Old Persian is written in a consistent semi-alphabetic system, Elamite and Akkadian used borrowings from other languages, creating mixed systems.\n\n==Decipherment==\nMuch of the progress made in [[decipherment]] depended on the names of kings.  Attempts at deciphering Old Persian cuneiform started in 1711 when some of Darius's inscriptions were published by [[Jean Chardin]].<ref name=\"OPGTL 9\">Kent, R. G.: \"Old Persian: Grammar Texts Lexicon\", page 9. American Oriental Society, 1950.</ref> In 1802, [[Friedrich M\u00fcnter]] realized that recurring groups of characters must be the word for \u201cking\u201d ({{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa7\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfb9\ud800\udfb0\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfb9}}, now known to be pronounced ''x\u0161\u0101ya\u03d1iya''). [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]] extended this work by realizing a king's name is often followed by \u201cgreat king, king of kings\u201d and the name of the king's father.<ref name=\"RGK\">Kent, R. G.: \"Old Persian: Grammar Texts Lexicon\", page 10. American Oriental Society, 1950.</ref>\n\nGrotefend made a major breakthrough when he noticed that one of the kings' father was not a king.  In Persian history around the time period the inscriptions were expected to be made, there were only two instances where a ruler came to power without being a previous king's son.  They were [[Darius the Great]] and [[Cyrus the Great]], both of whom became emperor by revolt. The deciding factors between these two choices were the names of their fathers and sons. Darius's father was Hystaspes and his son was [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], while Cyrus' father was [[Cambyses I]] and his son was [[Cambyses II]]. Within the text, the father and son of the king had different groups of symbols for names so Grotefend assumed that the king must have been Darius. These connections allowed Grotefend to figure out the cuneiform characters that are part of Darius, Darius's father Hystaspes, and Darius's son [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]. Grotefend's contribution to Old Persian is unique in that he did not have comparisons between Old Persian and known languages, as opposed to the decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphics and the [[Rosetta Stone]]. All his decipherments were done by comparing the texts with known history.\n\nMore advances were made on Grotefend's work and by 1847, most of the symbols were correctly identified.  Notable uses of Old Persian's decipherment include the decipherment of Elamite and Akkadian through the [[Behistun Inscription]].\n\n==Signs==\nMost scholars consider the writing system to be an independent invention because it has no obvious connections with other writing systems at the time, such as [[Elamite language|Elamite]], Akkadian, [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], and [[Hittite language|Hittite]] cuneiforms.<ref>Windfuhr, G. L.: \"Notes on the old Persian signs\", page 1. Indo-Iranian Journal, 1970.</ref> While Old Persian's basic strokes are similar to those found in cuneiform scripts, Old Persian texts were engraved on hard materials, so the engravers had to make cuts that imitated the forms easily made on clay tablets.<ref name=\"OPGTL 9\" />  The signs are composed of horizontal, vertical, and angled wedges.  There are four basic components and new signs are created by adding wedges to these basic components.<ref name=\"NOPS 2\">Windfuhr, G. L.: \"Notes on the old Persian signs\", page 2. Indo-Iranian Journal, 1970.</ref> These four basic components are two parallel wedges without angle, three parallel wedges without angle, one wedge without angle and an angled wedge, and two angled wedges.<ref name=\"NOPS 2\" /> The script is written from left to right.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 134. Oxford University Press, 1996</ref>\n\n[[File:DNa Inscription D\u0101rayavau\u0161.jpg|thumb|<center>The name of [[Darius I]] in Old Persian cuneiform on the [[DNa inscription]] of [[Tomb of Darius I|his tomb]]: ''D\u0101rayavau\u0161'' ([[Wikt:\ud800\udfad\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfbc\ud800\udfb9\ud800\udfba\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfc1|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfbc\ud800\udfb9\ud800\udfba\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfc1}}]])</center>]]\nThe script encodes three vowels, ''a'', ''i'', ''u'', and twenty-two consonants, ''k'', ''x'', ''g'', ''c'', ''\u00e7'', ''j'', ''t'', ''\u03b8'', ''d'', ''p'', ''f'', ''b'', ''n'', ''m'', ''y'', ''v'', ''r'', ''l'', ''s'', ''z'', ''\u0161'', and ''h''.  Old Persian contains two sets of consonants: those whose shape depends on the following vowel and those whose shape is independent of the following vowel.  The consonant symbols that depend on the following vowel act like the consonants in [[Devanagari]].  Vowel diacritics are added to these consonant symbols to change the inherent vowel or add length to the inherent vowel.  However, the vowel symbols are usually still included so [di] would be written as [di] [i] even though [di] already implies the vowel.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 136. Oxford University Press, 1996</ref> For the consonants whose shape does not depend on the following vowels, the vowel signs must be used after the consonant symbol.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 135. Oxford University Press, 1996</ref>\n\nCompared to the [[Avestan alphabet]] Old Persian notably lacks voiced fricatives, but includes the sign ''\u00e7'' (of uncertain pronunciation) and a sign for the non-native ''l''. Notably, in common with the [[Brahmic scripts]], there appears to be no distinction between a consonant followed by an ''a'' and a consonant followed by nothing.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|  ||  || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">k-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">x-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">g-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">c-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u00e7-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">j-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">t-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u03b8-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">d-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">p-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">f-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">b-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">n-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">m-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">y-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">v-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">r-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">l-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">s-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">z-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u0161-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">h-</span>\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-(a)</span> || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa0}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa3}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa7}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa5}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa8}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc2}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa9}}  || rowspan=2|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfab}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb0}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb1}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb3}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb2}} || rowspan=2|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb6}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb9}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfba}} || rowspan=2|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbc}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbe}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbf}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc0}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc1}} || rowspan=3|{{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}}\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-i</span> || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa1}}\n! <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">\u2014</span> !! \u2014 \n| {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaa}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb7}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbb}}\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-u</span> || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa2}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa4}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa6}}\n! \u2014\n| {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfac}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb5}} || {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb8}}\n! \u2014 \n| {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfbd}}\n|-\n|}\n\n*logograms:\n**''[[Ahura Mazda|Auramazd\u0101]]'': {{script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc8}}, {{script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc9}}, {{script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfca}} (genitive)\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">x\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iya</span>'' \"king\": {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcb}}\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">dahy\u0101u\u0161-</span>'' \"country\": <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcc}}, {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcd}}</span>\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">baga-</span>'' \"god\": <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfce}}</span>\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">b\u016bmi\u0161-</span>'' \"earth\": {{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfcf}}\n*[[word divider]]: <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|\ud800\udfd0}}</span>\n*numerals:<ref>Unattested numbers are not listed.

Inscription.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Old Persian inscription in [[Persepolis]]]]\nAlthough based on a logo-syllabic prototype, all vowels but short /a/ are written and so the system is essentially an [[alphabet]]. There are three vowels, long and short. Initially, no distinction is made for length: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa0}} ''a'' or ''\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa1}} ''i'' or ''\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa2}} ''u'' or ''\u016b.'' However, as in the Brahmic scripts, short ''a'' is not written after a consonant: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}} ''h'' or ''ha,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa0}} ''h\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa1}} ''hi'' or ''h\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa2}} ''hu'' or ''h\u016b.'' (Old Persian is not considered an [[abugida]] because vowels are represented as full letters.)\n\nThirteen out of twenty-two consonants, such as {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}} ''h(a),'' are invariant, regardless of the following vowel (that is, they are alphabetic), while only six have a distinct form for each consonant-vowel combination (that is, they are syllabic), and among these, only ''d'' and ''m'' occur in three forms for all three vowels: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad}} ''d'' or ''da,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad\ud800\udfa0}} ''d\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae\ud800\udfa1}} ''di'' or ''d\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf\ud800\udfa2}} ''du'' or ''d\u016b.'' (''k, g'' do not occur before ''i,'' and ''j, v'' do not occur before ''u,'' so these consonants only have two forms each.)\n\nSometimes medial long vowels are written with a ''y'' or ''v,'' as in Semitic: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfb9}} ''d\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfba}} ''d\u016b.'' Diphthongs are written by mismatching consonant and vowel: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad\ud800\udfa1}} ''dai'', or sometimes, in cases where the consonant does not differentiate between vowels, by writing the consonant and both vowel components: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa8\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfb1\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfc1}} ''ci\u0161pai\u0161'' (gen. of name Ci\u0161pi- '[[Teispes]]').\n\nIn addition, three consonants, ''t'', ''n'', and ''r'', are partially syllabic, having the same form before ''a'' and ''i'', and a distinct form only before ''u'': {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4}} ''n'' or ''na,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4\ud800\udfa0}} ''n\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4\ud800\udfa1}} ''ni'' or ''n\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb5\ud800\udfa2}} ''nu'' or ''n\u016b.''\n\nThe effect is not unlike the English {{IPA|[d\u0292]}} sound, which is typically written ''g'' before ''i'' or ''e'', but ''j'' before other vowels (''gem'', ''jam''), or the [[Castilian Spanish]] {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} sound, which is written ''c'' before ''i'' or ''e'' and ''z'' before other vowels (''cinco, zapato''): it is more accurate to say that some of the Old Persian consonants are written by different letters depending on the following vowel, rather than classifying the script as syllabic. This situation had its origin in [[Cuneiform script#Assyrian cuneiform|Assyrian cuneiform]], where several syllabic distinctions had been lost and were often clarified with explicit vowels. However, in the case of Assyrian, the vowel was not always used, and was never used where not needed, so the system remained (logo-)syllabic.\n\nFor a while it was speculated that the alphabet could have had its origin in such a system, with a leveling of consonant signs a millennium earlier producing something like the [[Ugaritic alphabet]], but today it is generally accepted that the Semitic alphabet arose from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], where vowel notation was not important.
