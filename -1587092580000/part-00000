He is opposed by a young pig keeper named [[Taran (character)|Taran]], the young princess [[Eilonwy]], the bard [[Fflewddur Fflam]], and a wild creature named [[Gurgi]] who seek to destroy the cauldron, to prevent the Horned King from ruling the world.\n\nThe film is directed by [[Ted Berman]] and [[Richard Rich (director)|Richard Rich]], who had directed Disney's previous animated film ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'' in 1981, the first Disney animated film to be recorded in [[Dolby Stereo]]. It features the voices of Grant Bardsley, [[Susan Sheridan]], [[Freddie Jones]], [[Nigel Hawthorne]], [[John Byner]], and [[John Hurt]].\n\nIt was the first Disney animated film to receive a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#PG|PG rating]] as well as the first Disney animated film to feature [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=SlateRevisiting /> The film was distributed theatrically through [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]] on July 26, 1985. With the budget of $25 to $44 million, it was the most expensive animated film ever made at the time. The film grossed $21.3 million domestically. Because of its commercial failure, Disney did not release the film on home video until 1998.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. Current word count is 635 words.-->\nIn the land of Prydain, [[Taran (character)|Taran]] is an \"assistant pig-keeper\" on the small farm of [[Caer Dallben]], home of [[Dallben]] the Enchanter. Taran dreams of becoming a famous warrior. Dallben learns that the [[Horned King]] is searching for a mystical relic known as the Black Cauldron, which is capable of creating an invincible army of undead warriors, the \"Cauldron-Born\". Dallben fears the Horned King will try to steal his pig [[Hen Wen]], who has [[oracle|oracular powers]], and use her to locate the cauldron. Dallben directs Taran to take Hen Wen to safety; unfortunately, Taran's foolish daydreaming causes Hen Wen to be captured by Gwythaints, the Horned King's [[dragon]]-like creatures.\n\nTaran follows them to the Horned King's castle. Along the way, he encounters the pestering, dog-like creature [[Gurgi]], who wants to be Taran's friend. Frustrated by Gurgi's antics and fear of the castle, Taran leaves him. He sneaks inside and rescues Hen Wen, but although she escapes, Taran is captured and thrown into the dungeon. A fellow captive named [[Princess Eilonwy]] frees Taran as she is trying to make her own escape. In the [[Spiral Castle|catacombs beneath the castle]], Taran and Eilonwy discover the ancient burial chamber of a king, where Taran arms himself with [[Dyrnwyn|the king's sword]]. It contains magic that allows him to effectively fight the Horned King's minions and so to fulfil his dream of heroism. Along with a third prisoner, the comical, middle-aged bard Fflewddur Fflam, they escape from the castle and are soon reunited with Gurgi. Upon discovering that Taran has escaped, the Horned King orders his goblin, Creeper, to send the Gwythaints to follow Taran.\n\nFollowing Hen Wen's trail, the four companions stumble into the underground kingdom of the [[Fair Folk]] who reveal that Hen Wen is under their protection. When the kindly King Eidilleg reveals that he knows where the cauldron is, Taran decides to destroy it. Eilonwy, Gurgi and Fflewddur agree to join him and Eidilleg's obnoxious right-hand man [[Doli (fictional character)|Doli]] is assigned to lead them to the [[Marshes of Morva]] while the Fair Folk escort Hen Wen safely back to Caer Dallben. At the marshes they learn that the cauldron is held by [[Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch|three witches]]\u2014the grasping Orddu, who acts as leader; the greedy Orgoch; and the more benevolent Orwen, who falls in love with Fflewddur at first sight. Orddu agrees to trade the cauldron for Taran's sword and he reluctantly agrees, knowing it will cost his chance for heroism. Before vanishing, the witches reveal that the cauldron is indestructible, and that its power can only be broken when someone climbs in under his own free will, which will kill him. Doli angrily abandons the group. Although Taran feels foolish for aspiring to destroy the cauldron alone, his companions show their belief in him; and Eilonwy and Taran almost kiss. Suddenly they are interrupted by the Horned King's soldiers who have followed them to Morva. Gurgi runs away before they seize the cauldron and take the companions back to the castle. The Horned King uses the cauldron to raise the dead and his Cauldron-born army begins to pour out into the world.\n\nGurgi manages to sneak into the castle and rescue his friends. Taran decides to cast himself into the cauldron to save everyone, but Gurgi stops him and jumps into it himself. The undead army collapses. When the Horned King spots Taran, he infers the turn of events, says that Taran has interfered for the last time, and throws the youth toward the cauldron; however, the cauldron's magic is out of control. It consumes the Horned King in a tunnel of fire, killing him and destroying the castle, using up all its powers forever. The three witches come to recover the now-inert Black Cauldron. However, Taran has finally realised Gurgi's true friendship, and he asks them to revive his friend in exchange for the cauldron, choosing to give up his magical sword permanently. Fflewddur challenges the reluctant witches to demonstrate their powers, and upon hearing Fflewddur's remarks, the witches honor the request, returning Gurgi to them. At first, Gurgi appears to be dead but is resurrected. After they reunite, he pushes Taran and Eilonwy into a kiss. The four friends then journey back to Caer Dallben where Dallben and Doli watch them in a vision created by Hen Wen, and Dallben finally praises Taran for his heroism.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* Grant Bardsley as [[Taran (character)|Taran]]\n* [[Susan Sheridan]] as [[Princess Eilonwy]]\n* [[John Byner]] as [[Gurgi]] and [[Doli (character)|Doli]]\n* [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as [[Fflewddur Fflam]]\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[The Horned King]]\n* [[Phil Fondacaro]] as Creeper/ Horned King's Henchman\n* [[Freddie Jones]] as [[Dallben]]\n* [[Arthur Malet]] as King [[Eiddileg|Eidilleg]]\n* Eda Reiss Merin as [[Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch|Orddu]]\n* Adele Malis-Morey as [[Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch|Orwen]]\n* [[Billie Hayes]] as [[Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch|Orgoch]]\n* [[Peter Renaday]], [[Wayne Allwine]], James Almanzar, [[Steve Hale]], [[Phil Nibbelink]], and Jack Laing as the Horned King's Henchmen \n* [[Frank Welker]] as Hen-Wen, Dallben's cat, dog, Gwythaints, the rats, and the frogs\n* [[John Huston]] as Narrator\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nWalt Disney Productions [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] Lloyd Alexander's five-volume series in 1971,<ref name=SlateRevisiting /> and pre-production work began in 1973 when the film rights to Alexander's books were finally obtained.

Having set up the three principal characters, Gerry adapted the Horned King into a big-bellied Viking who had a red beard, fiery temper, and wore a steel helmet with two large horns. Desiring an experienced British screenwriter to write the screenplay, the studio signed [[Rosemary Anne Sisson]] onto the project.{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=46}}\n\nThe first director attached to the project was animator [[John Musker]] after he was proposed the job by production head Tom Wilhite. As director, Musker was assigned to expand several sequences in the first act, but they were eventually deemed too comedic. When production on ''The Fox and the Hound'' had wrapped, several feature animation directors [[Art Stevens]], [[Richard Rich (director)|Richard Rich]], [[Ted Berman]], and Dave Michener became involved in ''The Black Cauldron''.

He and the story team (including two story artists David Jonas and Al Wilson that Hale brought to the project) revised the film, capsulizing the story of the first two books and making some considerable changes which led to the departure of Sisson who had creative differences with Hale and the directors.{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=48}} Animators John Musker and [[Ron Clements]], also citing creative differences, were removed from the project and began development on ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''.<ref>{{cite interview|interviewer=Michael Mallory|subject=Ron Clements and John Musker| url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/top-stories/john-and-ron-mention-the-unmentionable/|title=John and Ron Mention \u2018The Unmentionable\u2019|work=[[Animation (magazine)|Animation]]|date=September 7, 2012|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref> Displeased with Vance Gerry's concept for the Horned King, Hale turned the Horned King into a thin creature donning a hood and carrying a spectral presence with shadowed face and glowing red eyes, his role expanded into a composite villain of  several characters from the books.<ref name=D23 /> Taran and Eilonwy eventually acquired elements of the past designs and costumes of earlier Disney characters, especially the latter, who was drawn to resemble [[Aurora (Disney character)|Princess Aurora]].{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=48}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Deja|first=Andreas|authorlink=Andreas Deja|url=http://andreasdeja.blogspot.com/2013/02/milt-kahls-black-cauldron.html|title=Milt Kahl's Black Cauldron|work=Deja View|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|date=February 9, 2013|accessdate=May 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Test-screening and editing===\nShortly before the film's initially planned 1984 theatrical release, a test screening for the rough cut of ''The Black Cauldron'' was held at the studio's private theater in Burbank, California. After the film, particularly the climactic \"cauldron born\" sequence, proved to be too intense and frightening for the majority of the children in the audience (most of whom fled the theater in terror before it was even finished), the newly appointed Disney studio chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] ordered certain scenes from ''The Black Cauldron'' be cut, as a result of the length and the fear that their graphic nature would alienate children and family audiences.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68\u201370}} Since animated films were generally edited in [[storyboard]] form using [[Leica reel]]s (later known as [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]]: storyboards shot sequentially and set to temporary audio tracks), producer Joe Hale objected to Katzenberg's demands. Katzenberg responded by having the film brought into an edit bay and editing the film himself.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68\u201370}}\n\nInformed of what Katzenberg was doing by Hale, Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] called Katzenberg in the editing room and convinced him to stop. Though he did what Eisner insisted, Katzenberg requested that the film be modified, and delayed its scheduled Christmas 1984 release to July 1985 so that the film could be reworked.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68\u201370}}\n\nThe film was ultimately cut by twelve minutes,<ref name=\"peraza\" /> with existing scenes rewritten and reanimated for continuity.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68\u201370}} Many of the cut scenes involved extended character interactions, but other trims involve violent content, including the undead \"Cauldron Born\", who are used as the Horned King's army in the final act of the film. While most of the scenes were seamlessly removed from the film, the Cauldron Born sequence contains rather recognizable lapses because the removal of the scenes of the Cauldron Born mauling the henchmen, as well as one of them being dissolved by the mist, creates a jump in the film's soundtrack.<ref name=\"SlateRevisiting\" />\n\n===Animation===\nInvented by David W.

It was made shortly after the first ''[[King's Quest]]'' game, so it resembles that adventure in many ways. Along with ''[[The Dark Crystal (video game)|The Dark Crystal]]'' it remains one of only a few adventure games by Sierra to be based on films.\n\nThe [[player character]] is a young assistant pig-keeper named Taran, who undertakes a quest to stop the evil Horned King, who seeks for Hen Wen, the magical pig of the wizard Dallben, for her [[Vision (religion)|visionary]] abilities. With these abilities, the Horned King would be able to discover the Black Cauldron and rule the land. Taran's first mission is to lead her to the [[Fairy|Fair Folk]] while the Horned King's dragons are looking for them. If the pig should be captured (the game allows either possibility), Taran can go to the Horned King's castle and rescue her. As soon as he is inside, Taran will meet Eilonwy with her magic bauble and may rescue Fflewddur Fflam, as well as discover a Magic Sword. The Cauldron is in the possession of three witches of Morva who will trade it for the Sword. A dragon grasps the cauldron and Taran goes back to encounter the evil man himself. The game features plot branches and multiple endings depending on many variables, such as whether Hen Wen the pig was saved, how the cauldron was destroyed, and what reward was chosen afterward. This use of multiple endings preceded the more famous use in [[Lucasfilm]]'s game ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'' by a year.\n\n===Reception===\n{{expand section|date=October 2017}}\n''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' in 1987 criticized the Atari ST version of ''The Black Cauldron'' as \"typical of early software for newer computers. It doesn't fully utilize the ST's capabilities\", citing the \"chunky low-resolution\" graphics \"obviously ported from another make of computer\". The magazine concluded that fans of other Sierra adventures would enjoy the game.<ref name=\"loveless198704\">{{Cite magazine |last=Loveless |first=Matthew |date=April 1987 |title=Black Cauldron |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/v5n12/STProductNews.html |magazine=Antic}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=SlateRevisiting>{{cite news|last1=Kois|first1=Dan|title=Revisiting The Black Cauldron, the Movie That Almost Killed Disney Animation|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2010/10/the_black_cauldron.single.html|accessdate=September 6, 2015|work=Slate|date=October 19, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117020425/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2010/10/the_black_cauldron.single.html|archivedate=January 17, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<ref name=CTAugust4>{{cite news|last1=Torme Olson|first1=Karen|title=August 4 releases (dates subject to change) - Blues...|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-30/features/9807300404_1_anchor-bay-polygram-video-first-run-features|accessdate=September 6, 2015|work=Chicago Tribune|date=July 30, 1998|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906201901/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-30/features/9807300404_1_anchor-bay-polygram-video-first-run-features|archivedate=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<ref name=WSBBudget>{{Cite video|people=[[Don Hahn|Hahn, Don]] (Director)|title=[[Waking Sleeping Beauty]]|medium=Documentary film|publisher=Stone Circle Pictures/[[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]]|location=[[Burbank, CA]]|date=2010|time=16:08|quote=Black Cauldron cost $44 million to make and made less than half that at the box office.}}</ref>\n<ref name=SFGSleepingBeauty>{{cite news|last1=Hartlaub|first1=Peter|title=Review: 'Waking Sleeping Beauty'|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Review-Waking-Sleeping-Beauty-3269188.php|newspaper=SFGate|accessdate=September 7, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420151247/http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Review-Waking-Sleeping-Beauty-3269188.php|archivedate=April 20, 2013|date=March 26, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hulett|first=Steve|title=Mouse In Transition: An Insider's Look at Disney Feature Animation|publisher=Theme Park Press|date=December 4, 2014|isbn=978-1-941500-24-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Stewart|first=James|title=DisneyWar|edition=1st|year=2005|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=0-684-80993-1|authorlink=James B.

It features the voices of Grant Bardsley, [[Susan Sheridan]], [[Freddie Jones]], [[Nigel Hawthorne]], [[John Byner]], and [[John Hurt]].\n\nIt was the first Disney animated film to receive a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#PG|PG rating]] as well as the first Disney animated film to feature [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=SlateRevisiting /> The film was distributed theatrically through [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]] on July 26, 1985. With the budget of $25 to $44 million, it was the most expensive animated film ever made at the time. The film grossed $21.3 million domestically. Because of its commercial failure, Disney did not release the film on home video until 1998.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. Current word count is 635 words.-->\nIn the land of Prydain, [[Taran (character)|Taran]] is an \"assistant pig-keeper\" on the small farm of [[Caer Dallben]], home of [[Dallben]] the Enchanter. Taran dreams of becoming a famous warrior. Dallben learns that the [[Horned King]] is searching for a mystical relic known as the Black Cauldron, which is capable of creating an invincible army of undead warriors, the \"Cauldron-Born\". Dallben fears the Horned King will try to steal his pig [[Hen Wen]], who has [[oracle|oracular powers]], and use her to locate the cauldron. Dallben directs Taran to take Hen Wen to safety; unfortunately, Taran's foolish daydreaming causes Hen Wen to be captured by Gwythaints, the Horned King's [[dragon]]-like creatures.\n\nTaran follows them to the Horned King's castle. Along the way, he encounters the pestering, dog-like creature [[Gurgi]], who wants to be Taran's friend. Frustrated by Gurgi's antics and fear of the castle, Taran leaves him. He sneaks inside and rescues Hen Wen, but although she escapes, Taran is captured and thrown into the dungeon. A fellow captive named [[Princess Eilonwy]] frees Taran as she is trying to make her own escape. In the [[Spiral Castle|catacombs beneath the castle]], Taran and Eilonwy discover the ancient burial chamber of a king, where Taran arms himself with [[Dyrnwyn|the king's sword]]. It contains magic that allows him to effectively fight the Horned King's minions and so to fulfil his dream of heroism. Along with a third prisoner, the comical, middle-aged bard Fflewddur Fflam, they escape from the castle and are soon reunited with Gurgi. Upon discovering that Taran has escaped, the Horned King orders his goblin, Creeper, to send the Gwythaints to follow Taran.\n\nFollowing Hen Wen's trail, the four companions stumble into the underground kingdom of the [[Fair Folk]] who reveal that Hen Wen is under their protection. When the kindly King Eidilleg reveals that he knows where the cauldron is, Taran decides to destroy it. Eilonwy, Gurgi and Fflewddur agree to join him and Eidilleg's obnoxious right-hand man [[Doli (fictional character)|Doli]] is assigned to lead them to the [[Marshes of Morva]] while the Fair Folk escort Hen Wen safely back to Caer Dallben. At the marshes they learn that the cauldron is held by [[Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch|three witches]]\u2014the grasping Orddu, who acts as leader; the greedy Orgoch; and the more benevolent Orwen, who falls in love with Fflewddur at first sight. Orddu agrees to trade the cauldron for Taran's sword and he reluctantly agrees, knowing it will cost his chance for heroism. Before vanishing, the witches reveal that the cauldron is indestructible, and that its power can only be broken when someone climbs in under his own free will, which will kill him. Doli angrily abandons the group. Although Taran feels foolish for aspiring to destroy the cauldron alone, his companions show their belief in him; and Eilonwy and Taran almost kiss. Suddenly they are interrupted by the Horned King's soldiers who have followed them to Morva. Gurgi runs away before they seize the cauldron and take the companions back to the castle. The Horned King uses the cauldron to raise the dead and his Cauldron-born army begins to pour out into the world.\n\nGurgi manages to sneak into the castle and rescue his friends. Taran decides to cast himself into the cauldron to save everyone, but Gurgi stops him and jumps into it himself. The undead army collapses. When the Horned King spots Taran, he infers the turn of events, says that Taran has interfered for the last time, and throws the youth toward the cauldron; however, the cauldron's magic is out of control. It consumes the Horned King in a tunnel of fire, killing him and destroying the castle, using up all its powers forever. The three witches come to recover the now-inert Black Cauldron. However, Taran has finally realised Gurgi's true friendship, and he asks them to revive his friend in exchange for the cauldron, choosing to give up his magical sword permanently. Fflewddur challenges the reluctant witches to demonstrate their powers, and upon hearing Fflewddur's remarks, the witches honor the request, returning Gurgi to them. At first, Gurgi appears to be dead but is resurrected. After they reunite, he pushes Taran and Eilonwy into a kiss. The four friends then journey back to Caer Dallben where Dallben and Doli watch them in a vision created by Hen Wen, and Dallben finally praises Taran for his heroism.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* Grant Bardsley as [[Taran (character)|Taran]]\n* [[Susan Sheridan]] as [[Princess Eilonwy]]\n* [[John Byner]] as [[Gurgi]] and [[Doli (character)|Doli]]\n* [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as [[Fflewddur Fflam]]\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[The Horned King]]\n* [[Phil Fondacaro]] as Creeper/ Horned King's Henchman\n* [[Freddie Jones]] as [[Dallben]]\n* [[Arthur Malet]] as King [[Eiddileg|Eidilleg]]\n* Eda Reiss Merin as [[Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch|Orddu]]\n* Adele Malis-Morey as [[Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch|Orwen]]\n* [[Billie Hayes]] as [[Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch|Orgoch]]\n* [[Peter Renaday]], [[Wayne Allwine]], James Almanzar, [[Steve Hale]], [[Phil Nibbelink]], and Jack Laing as the Horned King's Henchmen \n* [[Frank Welker]] as Hen-Wen, Dallben's cat, dog, Gwythaints, the rats, and the frogs\n* [[John Huston]] as Narrator\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nWalt Disney Productions [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] Lloyd Alexander's five-volume series in 1971,<ref name=SlateRevisiting /> and pre-production work began in 1973 when the film rights to Alexander's books were finally obtained. According to [[Ollie Johnston]], it was he and [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] that convinced the studio to produce the movie, and that if it had been done properly, it might be \"as good as ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]''\".<ref>{{cite interview |subject-link=[[Ollie Johnston]] |interviewer=Jo J\u00fcrgens |title=Ollie Johnston - an interview, part 1 |url=http://www.norskanimasjon.no/pub/index.php/ffaf/artikler/ollie_johnston_et_intervju_del_1 | language=Norwegian | year=1996}}</ref> Because of the numerous storylines and with over thirty characters in the original series, several story artists and animators worked on the development of the film throughout the 1970s,<ref name=D23>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906012122/https://d23.com/a-to-z/black-cauldron-the-film/|url=https://d23.com/a-to-z/black-cauldron-the-film/|title=Black Cauldron, The (film)|work=[[Disney D23]]|archivedate=September 6, 2015|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref> when it was originally slated for release in 1980.

Having set up the three principal characters, Gerry adapted the Horned King into a big-bellied Viking who had a red beard, fiery temper, and wore a steel helmet with two large horns. Desiring an experienced British screenwriter to write the screenplay, the studio signed [[Rosemary Anne Sisson]] onto the project.{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=46}}\n\nThe first director attached to the project was animator [[John Musker]] after he was proposed the job by production head Tom Wilhite. As director, Musker was assigned to expand several sequences in the first act, but they were eventually deemed too comedic. When production on ''The Fox and the Hound'' had wrapped, several feature animation directors [[Art Stevens]], [[Richard Rich (director)|Richard Rich]], [[Ted Berman]], and Dave Michener became involved in ''The Black Cauldron''. When Miller decided too many people were involved, he decided Stevens was not appropriate to supervise the project so he contacted Joe Hale, who was a longtime layout artist at Disney Studios, to serve as producer.<ref name=JHMWhatWentWrong />{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=47\u20138}}<ref>{{cite interview|interviewer=J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Noyer|title=The Black Cauldron: Producer Joe Hale talks munchings and crunchings\u2026|url=http://animatedviews.com/2010/the-black-cauldron-producer-joe-hale-talks-munchings-and-crunchings/|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref> With Hale as producer, actual production on ''The Black Cauldron'' officially began in 1980.<ref name=D23 /><ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-08-03/features/8502210564_1_horned-king-black-cauldron-disney-films | title='Black Cauldron' A Brew Of Vintage Disney Animation | last=Blowen | first=Michael | work=[[Boston Globe]] | publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=August 3, 1985 | accessdate=February 20, 2015}}</ref> He tossed out visual character artwork submitted by [[Tim Burton]] and along with ''The Fox and the Hound'' directors Richard Rich and Ted Berman, they desired a ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''-style approach and brought [[Milt Kahl]] out of retirement to create character designs for Taran, Eilonwy, Fflewddur Fflam, and the other principal characters. He and the story team (including two story artists David Jonas and Al Wilson that Hale brought to the project) revised the film, capsulizing the story of the first two books and making some considerable changes which led to the departure of Sisson who had creative differences with Hale and the directors.{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=48}} Animators John Musker and [[Ron Clements]], also citing creative differences, were removed from the project and began development on ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]''.<ref>{{cite interview|interviewer=Michael Mallory|subject=Ron Clements and John Musker| url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/top-stories/john-and-ron-mention-the-unmentionable/|title=John and Ron Mention \u2018The Unmentionable\u2019|work=[[Animation (magazine)|Animation]]|date=September 7, 2012|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref> Displeased with Vance Gerry's concept for the Horned King, Hale turned the Horned King into a thin creature donning a hood and carrying a spectral presence with shadowed face and glowing red eyes, his role expanded into a composite villain of  several characters from the books.<ref name=D23 /> Taran and Eilonwy eventually acquired elements of the past designs and costumes of earlier Disney characters, especially the latter, who was drawn to resemble [[Aurora (Disney character)|Princess Aurora]].{{sfn|Hulett|2014|p=48}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Deja|first=Andreas|authorlink=Andreas Deja|url=http://andreasdeja.blogspot.com/2013/02/milt-kahls-black-cauldron.html|title=Milt Kahl's Black Cauldron|work=Deja View|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|date=February 9, 2013|accessdate=May 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Test-screening and editing===\nShortly before the film's initially planned 1984 theatrical release, a test screening for the rough cut of ''The Black Cauldron'' was held at the studio's private theater in Burbank, California. After the film, particularly the climactic \"cauldron born\" sequence, proved to be too intense and frightening for the majority of the children in the audience (most of whom fled the theater in terror before it was even finished), the newly appointed Disney studio chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] ordered certain scenes from ''The Black Cauldron'' be cut, as a result of the length and the fear that their graphic nature would alienate children and family audiences.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68\u201370}} Since animated films were generally edited in [[storyboard]] form using [[Leica reel]]s (later known as [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]]: storyboards shot sequentially and set to temporary audio tracks), producer Joe Hale objected to Katzenberg's demands. Katzenberg responded by having the film brought into an edit bay and editing the film himself.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68\u201370}}\n\nInformed of what Katzenberg was doing by Hale, Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] called Katzenberg in the editing room and convinced him to stop. Though he did what Eisner insisted, Katzenberg requested that the film be modified, and delayed its scheduled Christmas 1984 release to July 1985 so that the film could be reworked.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68\u201370}}\n\nThe film was ultimately cut by twelve minutes,<ref name=\"peraza\" /> with existing scenes rewritten and reanimated for continuity.{{sfn|Stewart|2005|pages=68\u201370}} Many of the cut scenes involved extended character interactions, but other trims involve violent content, including the undead \"Cauldron Born\", who are used as the Horned King's army in the final act of the film. While most of the scenes were seamlessly removed from the film, the Cauldron Born sequence contains rather recognizable lapses because the removal of the scenes of the Cauldron Born mauling the henchmen, as well as one of them being dissolved by the mist, creates a jump in the film's soundtrack.<ref name=\"SlateRevisiting\" />\n\n===Animation===\nInvented by David W.

It was made shortly after the first ''[[King's Quest]]'' game, so it resembles that adventure in many ways. Along with ''[[The Dark Crystal (video game)|The Dark Crystal]]'' it remains one of only a few adventure games by Sierra to be based on films.\n\nThe [[player character]] is a young assistant pig-keeper named Taran, who undertakes a quest to stop the evil Horned King, who seeks for Hen Wen, the magical pig of the wizard Dallben, for her [[Vision (religion)|visionary]] abilities. With these abilities, the Horned King would be able to discover the Black Cauldron and rule the land. Taran's first mission is to lead her to the [[Fairy|Fair Folk]] while the Horned King's dragons are looking for them. If the pig should be captured (the game allows either possibility), Taran can go to the Horned King's castle and rescue her. As soon as he is inside, Taran will meet Eilonwy with her magic bauble and may rescue Fflewddur Fflam, as well as discover a Magic Sword. The Cauldron is in the possession of three witches of Morva who will trade it for the Sword. A dragon grasps the cauldron and Taran goes back to encounter the evil man himself. The game features plot branches and multiple endings depending on many variables, such as whether Hen Wen the pig was saved, how the cauldron was destroyed, and what reward was chosen afterward. This use of multiple endings preceded the more famous use in [[Lucasfilm]]'s game ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'' by a year.\n\n===Reception===\n{{expand section|date=October 2017}}\n''[[Antic (magazine)|Antic]]'' in 1987 criticized the Atari ST version of ''The Black Cauldron'' as \"typical of early software for newer computers. It doesn't fully utilize the ST's capabilities\", citing the \"chunky low-resolution\" graphics \"obviously ported from another make of computer\".

{"title_page": "Category of topological spaces", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], the '''category of topological spaces''', often denoted '''Top''', is the [[category (category theory)|category]] whose [[object (category theory)|object]]s are [[topological space]]s and whose [[morphism]]s are [[continuous map]]s.  This is a category because the [[function composition|composition]] of two continuous maps is again continuous, and the identity function is continuous. The study of '''Top''' and of properties of [[topological space]]s using the techniques of [[category theory]] is known as '''categorical topology'''.\n\nN.B. Some authors use the name '''Top''' for the categories with [[topological manifold]]s or with [[compactly generated space|compactly generated spaces]].as objects and continuous maps as morphisms.\n\n==As a concrete category==\n\nLike many categories, the category '''Top''' is a [[concrete category]], meaning its objects are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] with additional structure (i.e. topologies) and its morphisms are [[function (mathematics)|function]]s preserving this structure. There is a natural [[forgetful functor]]\n:''U'' : '''Top''' &rarr; '''Set'''\nto the [[category of sets]] which assigns to each topological space the underlying set and to each continuous map the underlying [[function (mathematics)|function]].\n\nThe forgetful functor ''U'' has both a [[left adjoint]]\n:''D'' : '''Set''' &rarr; '''Top'''\nwhich equips a given set with the [[discrete topology]], and a [[right adjoint]]\n:''I'' : '''Set''' &rarr; '''Top'''\nwhich equips a given set with the [[indiscrete topology]]. Both of these functors are, in fact, [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverses]] to ''U'' (meaning that ''UD'' and ''UI'' are equal to the [[identity functor]] on '''Set'''). Moreover, since any function between discrete or between indiscrete spaces is continuous, both of these functors give [[full embedding]]s of '''Set''' into '''Top'''.\n\n'''Top''' is also ''fiber-complete'' meaning that the [[lattice of topologies|category of all topologies]] on a given set ''X'' (called the ''[[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]]'' of ''U'' above ''X'') forms a [[complete lattice]] when ordered by [[set inclusion|inclusion]]. The [[greatest element]] in this fiber is the discrete topology on ''X'', while the [[least element]] is the indiscrete topology.\n\n'''Top''' is the model of what is called a [[topological category]]. These categories are characterized by the fact that every [[structured source]] <math>(X \\to UA_i)_I</math> has a unique [[initial lift]] <math>( A \\to A_i)_I</math>. In '''Top''' the initial lift is obtained by placing the [[initial topology]] on the source. Topological categories have many properties in common with '''Top''' (such as fiber-completeness, discrete and indiscrete functors, and unique lifting of limits).\n\n==Limits and colimits==\n\nThe category '''Top''' is both [[complete category|complete and cocomplete]], which means that all small [[limit (category theory)|limits and colimit]]s exist in '''Top'''. In fact, the forgetful functor ''U'' : '''Top''' \u2192 '''Set''' uniquely lifts both limits and colimits and preserves them as well. Therefore, (co)limits in '''Top''' are given by placing topologies on the corresponding (co)limits in '''Set'''.\n\nSpecifically, if ''F'' is a [[diagram (category theory)|diagram]] in '''Top''' and  (''L'', ''\u03c6'' : ''L'' \u2192 ''F'') is a limit of ''UF'' in '''Set''', the corresponding limit of ''F'' in '''Top''' is obtained by placing the [[initial topology]] on (''L'', ''\u03c6'' : ''L'' \u2192 ''F''). Dually, colimits in '''Top''' are obtained by placing the [[final topology]] on the corresponding colimits in '''Set'''.\n\nUnlike many ''algebraic'' categories, the forgetful functor ''U'' : '''Top''' \u2192 '''Set''' does not create or reflect limits since there will typically be non-universal [[cone (category theory)|cones]] in '''Top''' covering universal cones in '''Set'''.\n\nExamples of limits and colimits in '''Top''' include:\n\n*The [[empty set]] (considered as a topological space) is the [[initial object]] of '''Top'''; any [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] topological space is a [[terminal object]]. There are thus no [[zero object]]s in '''Top'''.\n*The [[product (category theory)|product]] in '''Top''' is given by the [[product topology]] on the [[Cartesian product]].

This is a category because the [[function composition|composition]] of two continuous maps is again continuous, and the identity function is continuous. The study of '''Top''' and of properties of [[topological space]]s using the techniques of [[category theory]] is known as '''categorical topology'''.\n\nN.B. Some authors use the name '''Top''' for the categories with [[topological manifold]]s or with [[compactly generated space|compactly generated spaces]].as objects and continuous maps as morphisms.\n\n==As a concrete category==\n\nLike many categories, the category '''Top''' is a [[concrete category]], meaning its objects are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] with additional structure (i.e. topologies) and its morphisms are [[function (mathematics)|function]]s preserving this structure. There is a natural [[forgetful functor]]\n:''U'' : '''Top''' &rarr; '''Set'''\nto the [[category of sets]] which assigns to each topological space the underlying set and to each continuous map the underlying [[function (mathematics)|function]].\n\nThe forgetful functor ''U'' has both a [[left adjoint]]\n:''D'' : '''Set''' &rarr; '''Top'''\nwhich equips a given set with the [[discrete topology]], and a [[right adjoint]]\n:''I'' : '''Set''' &rarr; '''Top'''\nwhich equips a given set with the [[indiscrete topology]]. Both of these functors are, in fact, [[Inverse function#Left and right inverses|right inverses]] to ''U'' (meaning that ''UD'' and ''UI'' are equal to the [[identity functor]] on '''Set'''). Moreover, since any function between discrete or between indiscrete spaces is continuous, both of these functors give [[full embedding]]s of '''Set''' into '''Top'''.\n\n'''Top''' is also ''fiber-complete'' meaning that the [[lattice of topologies|category of all topologies]] on a given set ''X'' (called the ''[[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]]'' of ''U'' above ''X'') forms a [[complete lattice]] when ordered by [[set inclusion|inclusion]]. The [[greatest element]] in this fiber is the discrete topology on ''X'', while the [[least element]] is the indiscrete topology.\n\n'''Top''' is the model of what is called a [[topological category]]. These categories are characterized by the fact that every [[structured source]] <math>(X \\to UA_i)_I</math> has a unique [[initial lift]] <math>( A \\to A_i)_I</math>. In '''Top''' the initial lift is obtained by placing the [[initial topology]] on the source. Topological categories have many properties in common with '''Top''' (such as fiber-completeness, discrete and indiscrete functors, and unique lifting of limits).\n\n==Limits and colimits==\n\nThe category '''Top''' is both [[complete category|complete and cocomplete]], which means that all small [[limit (category theory)|limits and colimit]]s exist in '''Top'''. In fact, the forgetful functor ''U'' : '''Top''' \u2192 '''Set''' uniquely lifts both limits and colimits and preserves them as well. Therefore, (co)limits in '''Top''' are given by placing topologies on the corresponding (co)limits in '''Set'''.\n\nSpecifically, if ''F'' is a [[diagram (category theory)|diagram]] in '''Top''' and  (''L'', ''\u03c6'' : ''L'' \u2192 ''F'') is a limit of ''UF'' in '''Set''', the corresponding limit of ''F'' in '''Top''' is obtained by placing the [[initial topology]] on (''L'', ''\u03c6'' : ''L'' \u2192 ''F''). Dually, colimits in '''Top''' are obtained by placing the [[final topology]] on the corresponding colimits in '''Set'''.\n\nUnlike many ''algebraic'' categories, the forgetful functor ''U'' : '''Top''' \u2192 '''Set''' does not create or reflect limits since there will typically be non-universal [[cone (category theory)|cones]] in '''Top''' covering universal cones in '''Set'''.\n\nExamples of limits and colimits in '''Top''' include:\n\n*The [[empty set]] (considered as a topological space) is the [[initial object]] of '''Top'''; any [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] topological space is a [[terminal object]]. There are thus no [[zero object]]s in '''Top'''.\n*The [[product (category theory)|product]] in '''Top''' is given by the [[product topology]] on the [[Cartesian product]]. The [[coproduct (category theory)|coproduct]] is given by the [[disjoint union (topology)|disjoint union]] of topological spaces.\n*The [[equaliser (mathematics)#In category theory|equalizer]] of a pair of morphisms is given by placing the [[subspace topology]] on the set-theoretic equalizer. Dually, the [[coequalizer]] is given by placing the [[quotient topology]] on the set-theoretic coequalizer.\n*[[Direct limit]]s and [[inverse limit]]s are the set-theoretic limits with the [[final topology]] and [[initial topology]] respectively.\n*[[Adjunction space]]s are an example of [[pushout (category theory)|pushouts]] in '''Top'''.\n\n==Other properties==\n*The [[monomorphism]]s in '''Top''' are the [[injective]] continuous maps, the [[epimorphism]]s are the [[surjective]] continuous maps, and the [[isomorphism]]s are the [[homeomorphism]]s.\n*The extremal monomorphisms are (up to isomorphism) the [[subspace topology|subspace]] embeddings.

A number of physiological responses occur in the body and mind as preparation for [[sexual intercourse]] and continue during it. [[#Male physiological response|Male arousal]] will lead to an [[erection]], and in [[#Female physiological response|female arousal]] the body's response is engorged sexual tissues such as [[Erection of nipples|nipples]], [[vulva]], [[Clitoral erection|clitoris]], [[Vagina#Sexual activity|vaginal wall]]s and [[vaginal lubrication]]. [[Stimulus (psychology)|Mental stimuli]] and [[Stimulus (physiology)|physical stimuli]] such as touch, and the internal fluctuation of [[hormones]], can influence sexual arousal.\n\nSexual arousal has several stages and may not lead to any actual sexual activity, beyond a mental arousal and the physiological changes that accompany it. Given sufficient [[sexual stimulation]], sexual arousal in humans reaches its climax during an [[orgasm]]. It may also be pursued for its own sake, even in the absence of an orgasm.\n\n==Terminology==\nThere are several informalities, terms and phrases to describe sexual arousal including ''horny'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/horny |title=horny - definition of horny by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> ''turned on'', ''randy'', ''steamy'', and ''lustful''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synonyms.net/synonym/aroused |title=aroused synonym. |publisher=Synonyms.net |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> Things that precipitate human sexual arousal are called '''erotic stimuli''' and colloquially known as '''turn-ons'''.\n\n==Erotic stimuli==\n{{Main|Sexual stimulation|Erogenous zone}}\n\nDepending on the situation, a person can be sexually aroused by a variety of factors, both physical and mental. A person may be sexually aroused by another person or by particular aspects of that person, or by a non-human object. The physical stimulation of an [[erogenous zone]] or acts of [[foreplay]] can result in arousal, especially if it is accompanied with the anticipation of imminent sexual activity. Sexual arousal may be assisted by a [[romance (love)|romantic]] setting, music or other soothing situation. The potential stimuli for sexual arousal vary from person to person, and from one time to another, as does the level of arousal.\n\nStimuli can be classified according to the sense involved: [[somatosensory]] (touch), visual, and [[olfactory]] (scent). Auditory stimuli are also possible, though they are generally considered secondary in role to the other three.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Erotic stimuli which can result in sexual arousal can include conversation, reading, films or images, or a smell or setting, any of which can generate erotic thoughts and memories in a person. Given the right context, these may lead to the person desiring physical contact, including [[kiss]]ing, [[hug|cuddling]], and [[petting]] of an erogenous zone. This may in turn make the person desire direct sexual stimulation of the [[breast]]s, [[nipple]]s, [[buttocks]] and/or [[Sex organ|genitals]], and further [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].\n\nErotic stimuli may originate from a source unrelated to the object of subsequent sexual interest. For example, many people may find [[nudity]], [[erotica]] or [[pornography]] sexually arousing.<ref>DeVita-Raeburn, Elizabeth. \"[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200512/lust-the-long-haul Lust For The Long Haul]\". [[Psychology Today]]. 2008-12-26</ref> This may generate a general sexual interest that is satisfied by sexual activity. When sexual arousal is achieved by or dependent on the use of objects, it is referred to as [[sexual fetishism]], or in some instances a [[paraphilia]].\n\nThere is a common belief that women need more time to achieve arousal. However, recent scientific research has shown that there is no considerable difference for the time men and women require to become fully aroused. Scientists from [[McGill University Health Centre]] in [[Montreal]] (in Canada) used the method of [[thermal]] imaging to record baseline [[temperature]] change in genital area to define the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal while watching sexually explicit movies or pictures and came to the conclusion that on average women and men took almost the same time for sexual arousal&nbsp;\u2014 around 10 minutes.<ref name=intro/> The time needed for foreplay is very individualistic and varies from one time to the next depending on many circumstances.<ref name=intro>{{cite web|url=http://edu.love-shop.biz/post/foreplayint.html|title=Your introduction to foreplay|accessdate=2007-05-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618222527/http://edu.love-shop.biz/post/foreplayint.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>\n\nUnlike many other animals, [[human]]s do not have a [[mating season]], and both sexes are potentially capable of sexual arousal throughout the year.\n\n==Disorders==\n{{see also|Sexual arousal disorder|Hypoactive sexual desire disorder|Female sexual arousal disorder}}\n\nSexual arousal for most people is a positive experience and an aspect of their sexuality, and is often sought. A person can normally control how they will respond to arousal. They will normally know what things or situations are potentially stimulating, and may at their leisure decide to either create or avoid these situations. Similarly, a person's sexual partner will normally also know his or her partner's erotic stimuli and turn-offs. Some people feel embarrassed by sexual arousal and some are [[sexually inhibited]]. Some people do not feel aroused on every occasion that they are exposed to erotic stimuli, nor act in a sexual way on every arousal. A person can take an active part in a sexual activity without sexual arousal. These situations are considered normal, but depend on the maturity, age, culture and other factors influencing the person.\n\nHowever, when a person fails to be aroused in a situation that would normally produce arousal and the lack of arousal is persistent, it may be due to a [[sexual arousal disorder]] or [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]]. There are many reasons why a person fails to be aroused, including a mental disorder, such as depression, [[Recreational drug use|drug use]], or a medical or physical condition. The lack of sexual arousal may be due to a general lack of sexual desire or due to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner. A person may always have had no or low sexual desire or the lack of desire may have been acquired during the person's life. There are also complex philosophical and psychological issues surrounding sexuality. Attitudes towards life, death, childbirth, one's parents, friends, family, contemporary society, the human race in general, and particularly one's place in the world play a substantive role in determining how a person will respond in any given sexual situation.\n\nOn the other hand, a person may be [[Hypersexuality|hypersexual]], which is a desire to engage in sexual activities considered abnormally high in relation to normal development or culture, or suffering from a [[persistent genital arousal disorder]], which is a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable arousal, and the physiological changes associated with arousal.\n\n== Physiological and psychological response patterns ==\n=== Physiological responses ===\n\nSexual arousal causes various physical responses, most significantly in the [[sex organ]]s (genital organs). Sexual arousal for a man is usually indicated by the [[tumescence|swelling]] and [[erection]] of the [[human penis|penis]] when blood fills the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]]. This is usually the most prominent and reliable sign of sexual arousal in males. In a woman, sexual arousal leads to increased blood flow to the [[clitoris]] and [[vulva]], as well as vaginal transudation - the seeping of moisture through the vaginal walls which serves as [[vaginal lubrication|lubrication]].\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!style=\"width:50%\"|\nIn males:\n!In females:\n|-\n|[[File:Comparison of flaccid and erect penis.jpg|thumb]]<br /><small>Male sexual arousal.

Physical or psychological stimulation, or both, leads to [[vasodilation]] and the increased blood flow engorges the three spongy areas that run along the length of the penis (the two [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]] and the [[corpus spongiosum]]). The penis grows enlarged and firm, the skin of the [[scrotum]] is pulled tighter, and the [[testes]] are pulled up against the body.<ref name=\"NHS\">{{cite web|title=Sexual arousal in men|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodsex/Pages/Malesexualarousal.aspx|work=NHS Direct|publisher=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref> However, the relationship between erection and arousal is not one-to-one.

As the testicles continue to rise, a feeling of warmth may develop around them and the [[perineum]]. With further sexual stimulation, the heart rate increases, blood pressure rises and breathing becomes quicker.<ref name=\"NHS\"/> The increase in blood flow in the genital and other regions may lead to a [[sex flush]] sometimes, in some men.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kennard|first=Jerry|title=Sexual Arousal|url=http://menshealth.about.com/od/sexualhealth/a/sexual_arousal.htm|work=Men's health|publisher=About.com|year=2006|accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref>\n\nAs sexual stimulation continues, [[orgasm]] begins, when the muscles of the [[pelvic floor]], the [[vas deferens]] (between the testicles and the prostate), the [[seminal vesicle]]s and the [[prostate]] gland itself may begin to contract in a way that forces sperm and semen into the [[urethra]] inside the penis. Once this has started, it is likely that the man will continue to [[ejaculate]] and orgasm fully, with or without further stimulation.\n\nEqually, if sexual stimulation stops before orgasm, the physical effects of the stimulation, including the [[vasocongestion]], will subside in a short time. Repeated or prolonged stimulation without orgasm and ejaculation can lead to discomfort in the testes (corresponding to the slang term \"[[blue balls]]\"<ref>Weinzimer, S.A. & Thorton, P.S., \"Blue balls\", \" ''Pediatrics'' 108(5), 1233-1234\", 2001</ref>).\n\nAfter orgasm and ejaculation, men usually experience a [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]] characterised by loss of erection, a subsidence in any sex flush, less interest in sex, and a feeling of relaxation that can be attributed to the [[neurohormone]]s [[oxytocin]] and [[prolactin]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Exton MS, Kr\u00fcger TH, Koch M, etal |title=Coitus-induced orgasm stimulates prolactin secretion in healthy subjects |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=287\u201394 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11166491 |doi=10.1016/S0306-4530(00)00053-6|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/eb194b5e0370574c39ab5765d9e7221aa6a213c7 }}</ref> The intensity and duration of the refractory period can be very short in a highly aroused young man in what he sees as a highly arousing situation, perhaps without even a noticeable loss of erection.

Older women produce less vaginal lubrication and studies have investigated changes to degrees of satisfaction, frequency of sexual activity, to desire, sexual thoughts and [[sexual fantasy|fantasies]], sexual arousal, beliefs about and attitudes to sex, pain, and the ability to reach orgasm in women in their 40s and after [[menopause]]. Other factors have also been studied including socio-demographic variables, health, psychological variables, partner variables such as their partner's health or sexual problems, and lifestyle variables. It appears that these other factors often have a greater impact on women's sexual functioning than their menopausal status. It is therefore seen as important always to understand the \"context of women's lives\" when studying their sexuality.<ref name=\"sexualityandu.ca\"/>\n\nReduced [[estrogen]] levels may be associated with increased vaginal dryness and less [[clitoral erection]] when aroused, but are not directly related to other aspects of sexual interest or arousal. In older women, decreased pelvic muscle tone may mean that it takes longer for arousal to lead to orgasm, may diminish the intensity of orgasms, and then cause more rapid resolution.

The first stage, ''aesthetic response,'' is an emotional reaction to noticing an attractive face or figure. This emotional reaction produces an increase in attention toward the object of attraction, typically involving head and eye movements toward the attractive object. The second stage, ''approach response,'' progresses from the first and involves bodily movements towards the object. The final ''genital response'' stage recognizes that with both attention and closer proximity, physical reactions result in genital tumescence. Singer also stated that there is an array of other autonomic responses, but acknowledges that the research literature suggests that the genital response is ''the most reliable and convenient to measure'' in males.<ref name=\"singer\">{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = B | year = 1984 | title = Conceptualizing sexual arousal and attraction | url = | journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 230\u2013240 | doi=10.1080/00224498409551222}}</ref>\n\n===Basson's sexual response cycle===\nIn 2000, Rosemary Basson presented an alternative model to the human sexual response cycle that is ''specific to women\u2019s sexual response''.<ref name=\"A different model\">{{cite journal | last1 = Basson | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = The female sexual response: A different model | url = | journal = [[Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy]] | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 51\u201365 | doi=10.1080/009262300278641 | pmid=10693116| doi-access = free }}</ref> She argues that gender differences in [[sex drive]], sexual motivation, sexual concordance, and capacity for orgasm underlie the need for an alternative model of sexual response. While the human sexual response cycle begins with desire, followed by arousal, orgasm, and finally resolution, Basson's<ref name=\"autogenerated2001\"/> alternative model is circular and begins with women feeling a need for [[intimacy]], which leads her to seek out and be receptive to sexual stimuli; women then feel sexual arousal, in addition to [[sexual desire]]. The cycle results in an enhanced feeling of intimacy. Basson emphasizes the idea that a lack of spontaneous desire should not be taken as an indication of [[female sexual dysfunction]]; many women experience sexual arousal and responsive desire simultaneously when they are engaged in sexual activity.<ref name=\"A different model\"/>\n\n===Toates's incentive-motivation model===\nFrederick Toates presented a model of sexual motivation, arousal, and behavior in 2009 that combines the principles of ''incentive-motivation theory'' and ''hierarchical control of behavior''. The [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|basic incentive-motivation model]] of sex suggests that incentive cues in the environment invade the nervous system, which results in sexual motivation. Positive sexual experiences enhance motivation, while negative experiences reduce it. Motivation and behaviour are organized [[hierarchy|hierarchically]]; each are controlled by a combination direct (external stimuli) and indirect (internal cognitions) factors. Excitation and inhibition of behavior act at various levels of this hierarchical structure. For instance, an external stimulus may directly excite sexual arousal and motivation below a conscious level of awareness, while an internal cognition can elicit the same effects indirectly, through the conscious representation of a sexual image. In the case of inhibition, sexual behavior can be active or conscious (e.g., choosing not to have sex) or it can be passive or unconscious (e.g., being unable to have sex due to fear). Toates emphasizes the importance considering [[cognitive]] representations in addition to external stimuli; he suggests that mental representations of incentives are interchangeable with excitatory external stimuli for eliciting sexual arousal and motivation.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Toates | first1 = F. | title = An Integrative Theoretical Framework for Understanding Sexual Motivation, Arousal, and Behavior | doi = 10.1080/00224490902747768 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 46 | issue = 2\u20133 | pages = 168\u2013193 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19308842| pmc = }}</ref>\n\n===Bancroft's dual control model===\nThis model created by [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] and Erick Janssen at the Kinsey Institute explores the ''individual variability of sexual response''.  They postulate that this variability depends on the interaction between an individual's sexual excitation system (SES) and sexual inhibition system (SIS). Popularized by Emily Nagoski's self-help book ''Come as You Are'', the SES has been described as the sexual response's 'accelerator' and the SIS as the 'brake'.<ref name=Nagoski2015>Nagoski, E. (2015). Come As You Are. New York City, New York: Simon and Schuster.</ref>  The SIS/SES questionnaire was developed to assess an individual's SIS and SES levels.  A factor analysis of the SIS/SES questionnaire, revealed a single excitation factor and two inhibition factors.  These inhibition factors were interpreted as SIS1 (inhibition due to the threat of performance failure) and SIS2 (inhibition due to the threat of performance consequences). \n \nThe SIS/SES questionnaire was originally developed for men though it has since proven its statistical validity among women. Despite this, the SESII-W (the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women) was created by Graham and associates.<ref name=Graham2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = C.

A factor analysis of this questionnaire revealed only two factors: sexual excitation (SE) and sexual inhibition (SI).  This may point to internal inconsistencies in the SIS/SES questionnaire regarding gender.  One lower order factor in the SESII-W labeled Arousal Contingency was particularly relevant; this factor explains the easy disruption of sexual arousal.\n\nRegardless of the difference in these two questionnaires, both surveys' scores show normal distribution verifying the hypothesis that there is a normal individual variation in sexual arousal and inhibition.  In the original SIS/SES questionnaire, statistically significant gender differences are seen despite considerable overlap in scores between men and women.  On average, males score higher on sexual excitation and lower than females on both facets of sexual inhibition.  As yet, the differences in scores between genders have not been explained beyond the theoretical level. \n \nThe source of individual variability on the sexual excitation and inhibition systems is not known definitively.  Even less is known about how these systems develop in individuals.  Age of first [[masturbation]] has been used as a measure to assess sexual development. Age of masturbatory onset is much more variable in girls than boys, whose tend to be close to puberty.<ref name= Bancroft_et_al.,2003>Bancroft, J., Herbenick, D., & Reynolds, M. (2003).

If the level of this tension reaches threshold, sexual arousal occurs as the expression of necessity to let off steam. Gary F. Kelly ([[Clarkson University]]) describes this model as follows:\n{{Quotation|For centuries, the assumption was made that the longing for [[Sexual intercourse|sexual interaction]] was innate, and an inner drive model was used to explain it.

Such an approach assumes sexual arousal to be a spontaneous desire that appears periodically like sensations of hunger and thirst.

Sensations of hunger and thirst occur due to certain states of physiological insufficiency. The feeling of hunger results from the lack of glucose, fats and amino acids in blood. The feeling of thirst occurs in response to reduction of the water content of tissues. None of similar states of physiological deficiency responsible for the periodical appearance of sexual arousal has been revealed in human sexuality.<ref>[[Kazimierz Imieli\u0144ski|\u0418\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a.]]. \u0421\u0435\u043a\u0441\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0441\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u044f (Sexology a.

There are a variety of methods used to assess genital sexual arousal in women. [[Vaginal photoplethysmography]] (VPG) can measure changes in vaginal blood volume or phasic changes in vasocongestion associated with each heartbeat. [[Clitoral photoplethysmograph]]y functions in a similar way to VPG, but measures changes in clitoral blood volume, rather than vaginal vasocongestion. [[Thermography (sexual psychophysiology)|Thermography]] provides a direct measure of genital sexual arousal by measuring changes in [[temperature]] associated with increased blood flow to the [[external genitals|external genital]] tissues. Similarly, [[labial thermistor clip]]s measure changes in temperature associated with genital engorgement; this method directly measures changes in temperature of the labia. More recently, [[laser doppler imaging]] (LDI) has been used as a direct measure of genital sexual arousal in women. LDI functions by measuring superficial changes in blood flow in the vulvar tissues.\n\n==Category-specificity==\nCategory-specificity refers to a person showing sexual arousal to the categories of people they prefer to have sex with. Sexual arousal studies involving category-specificity look at genital responses (physiological changes), as well as subjective responses (what people report their arousal levels to be). Category-specific sexual arousal is more commonly found amongst men than women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chivers | first1 = M.L. | year = 2005 | title = Leading comment: A brief review and discussion of sex differences in the specificity of sexual arousal | journal = Sexual and Relationship Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 377\u2013390 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.513.4313 | doi = 10.1080/14681990500238802 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid15482445\">{{cite journal|last=Chivers|first=ML|author2=Rieger, G |author3=Latty, E |author4= Bailey, JM |title=A sex difference in the specificity of sexual arousal.|journal=Psychological Science|date=Nov 2004|volume=15|issue=11|pages=736\u201344|doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00750.x|pmid=15482445}}</ref> [[Heterosexuality|Heterosexual]] men experience much higher genital and subjective arousal to women than to men.

This hypothesis suggests that, provided there is enough of an increase in vaginal blood flow for [[vaginal lubrication]] to occur in a sexual context, the magnitude of arousal need not be consistent. That is, the hypothesis is that vaginal lubrication can take place as a protective mechanism even in a non-preferred sexual situation, such as when sexual activity is [[Rape|non-consensual]].<ref name=\"stable\" />\n\nOther researchers argue that since the research is done on people who volunteer to be studied, the observed levels of category specificity may not represent the population, that there may be different cultural expectations of sexual interests being linked to genital arousal that make men with non-category specific genital arousal less likely to appear as test subjects. There researchers also argue that the assumption that men are always sexually interested in what causes genital arousal removes its own falsifiability by explaining all contradictory data away as \"denial\", making the theory untestable.<ref>Research Methods in Psychiatry, third edition. Chris Freeman, Peter J.</ref><ref>Issues in Psychology and Psychiatry Research and Practice: 2013 Edition. Q Ashton Acton</ref>\n\n===Overlapping brain variables and sexual arousal===\nWhile there is disagreement among neurologists on whether or not it is possible to categorically distinguish male brains and female brains by measuring many variables in the brain, neurologists agree that all single variables in the brain display more individual variation and overlap between the sexes than differences between the sexes. For instance, men and women alike are capable of classifying sex acts as sexual no matter if they find them appealing or not, making a genital response to unappealing erotic stimuli a single mechanism step. It is therefore argued by neurologists that category specificity of genital response to erotical imagery, being determined by one or a small number of closely linked brain mechanisms and therefore not subject to significant multivariate effects, cannot be subject to such a large sex difference as that apparent in pletysmographic studies. These neurologists cite the existence of significant volunteering bias among men but not women in erotica research, in particular that the overrepresentation of erectile dysfunction yet underrepresentation of sexuality-related shame in volunteers is consistent with the hypothesis that genital response to both sexual relevance and appeal allows for a stronger erectile function than response only to appeal and that a majority of the male population are ashamed of their responses to unappealing stimuli, accounting for the discrepancy between the report from most heterosexual couples that male erection is faster than female lubrication and the appearance on pletysmography volunteers that female lubrication is at least as fast as male erection. They also argue that the appearance of a greater individual variability in female genital response than in male genital response is consistent with a representative female sample and a male sample subject to bias that leaves much of the individual variability unstudied, with a reference to the neurological observation that all brain structures display significant individual variability in both sexes and that no brain structure is variable only in females and not in males.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15468.full Sex beyond the genitalia: The human brain mosaic] October 23, 2015</ref><ref>Multivariate revisit to \u201csex beyond the genitalia\u201d</ref>\n\n==Concordance==\nSexual arousal results in a combination of physiological and psychological factors, like genital sexual response and subjective experience of sexual arousal. The degree to which genital and subjective sexual response correspond is termed ''concordance''. Research has shown a [[reliability (statistics)|reliable]] gender difference in concordance of sexual arousal, such that men have a higher level of concordance between genital and subjective sexual responding than women do.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Suschinsky | first1 = K.

A number of physiological responses occur in the body and mind as preparation for [[sexual intercourse]] and continue during it. [[#Male physiological response|Male arousal]] will lead to an [[erection]], and in [[#Female physiological response|female arousal]] the body's response is engorged sexual tissues such as [[Erection of nipples|nipples]], [[vulva]], [[Clitoral erection|clitoris]], [[Vagina#Sexual activity|vaginal wall]]s and [[vaginal lubrication]]. [[Stimulus (psychology)|Mental stimuli]] and [[Stimulus (physiology)|physical stimuli]] such as touch, and the internal fluctuation of [[hormones]], can influence sexual arousal.\n\nSexual arousal has several stages and may not lead to any actual sexual activity, beyond a mental arousal and the physiological changes that accompany it. Given sufficient [[sexual stimulation]], sexual arousal in humans reaches its climax during an [[orgasm]]. It may also be pursued for its own sake, even in the absence of an orgasm.\n\n==Terminology==\nThere are several informalities, terms and phrases to describe sexual arousal including ''horny'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/horny |title=horny - definition of horny by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> ''turned on'', ''randy'', ''steamy'', and ''lustful''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synonyms.net/synonym/aroused |title=aroused synonym. |publisher=Synonyms.net |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> Things that precipitate human sexual arousal are called '''erotic stimuli''' and colloquially known as '''turn-ons'''.\n\n==Erotic stimuli==\n{{Main|Sexual stimulation|Erogenous zone}}\n\nDepending on the situation, a person can be sexually aroused by a variety of factors, both physical and mental. A person may be sexually aroused by another person or by particular aspects of that person, or by a non-human object. The physical stimulation of an [[erogenous zone]] or acts of [[foreplay]] can result in arousal, especially if it is accompanied with the anticipation of imminent sexual activity. Sexual arousal may be assisted by a [[romance (love)|romantic]] setting, music or other soothing situation. The potential stimuli for sexual arousal vary from person to person, and from one time to another, as does the level of arousal.\n\nStimuli can be classified according to the sense involved: [[somatosensory]] (touch), visual, and [[olfactory]] (scent). Auditory stimuli are also possible, though they are generally considered secondary in role to the other three.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Erotic stimuli which can result in sexual arousal can include conversation, reading, films or images, or a smell or setting, any of which can generate erotic thoughts and memories in a person. Given the right context, these may lead to the person desiring physical contact, including [[kiss]]ing, [[hug|cuddling]], and [[petting]] of an erogenous zone. This may in turn make the person desire direct sexual stimulation of the [[breast]]s, [[nipple]]s, [[buttocks]] and/or [[Sex organ|genitals]], and further [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].\n\nErotic stimuli may originate from a source unrelated to the object of subsequent sexual interest. For example, many people may find [[nudity]], [[erotica]] or [[pornography]] sexually arousing.<ref>DeVita-Raeburn, Elizabeth. \"[http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200512/lust-the-long-haul Lust For The Long Haul]\". [[Psychology Today]]. 2008-12-26</ref> This may generate a general sexual interest that is satisfied by sexual activity. When sexual arousal is achieved by or dependent on the use of objects, it is referred to as [[sexual fetishism]], or in some instances a [[paraphilia]].\n\nThere is a common belief that women need more time to achieve arousal. However, recent scientific research has shown that there is no considerable difference for the time men and women require to become fully aroused. Scientists from [[McGill University Health Centre]] in [[Montreal]] (in Canada) used the method of [[thermal]] imaging to record baseline [[temperature]] change in genital area to define the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal while watching sexually explicit movies or pictures and came to the conclusion that on average women and men took almost the same time for sexual arousal&nbsp;\u2014 around 10 minutes.<ref name=intro/> The time needed for foreplay is very individualistic and varies from one time to the next depending on many circumstances.<ref name=intro>{{cite web|url=http://edu.love-shop.biz/post/foreplayint.html|title=Your introduction to foreplay|accessdate=2007-05-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070618222527/http://edu.love-shop.biz/post/foreplayint.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>\n\nUnlike many other animals, [[human]]s do not have a [[mating season]], and both sexes are potentially capable of sexual arousal throughout the year.\n\n==Disorders==\n{{see also|Sexual arousal disorder|Hypoactive sexual desire disorder|Female sexual arousal disorder}}\n\nSexual arousal for most people is a positive experience and an aspect of their sexuality, and is often sought. A person can normally control how they will respond to arousal. They will normally know what things or situations are potentially stimulating, and may at their leisure decide to either create or avoid these situations. Similarly, a person's sexual partner will normally also know his or her partner's erotic stimuli and turn-offs. Some people feel embarrassed by sexual arousal and some are [[sexually inhibited]]. Some people do not feel aroused on every occasion that they are exposed to erotic stimuli, nor act in a sexual way on every arousal. A person can take an active part in a sexual activity without sexual arousal. These situations are considered normal, but depend on the maturity, age, culture and other factors influencing the person.\n\nHowever, when a person fails to be aroused in a situation that would normally produce arousal and the lack of arousal is persistent, it may be due to a [[sexual arousal disorder]] or [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]]. There are many reasons why a person fails to be aroused, including a mental disorder, such as depression, [[Recreational drug use|drug use]], or a medical or physical condition. The lack of sexual arousal may be due to a general lack of sexual desire or due to a lack of sexual desire for the current partner. A person may always have had no or low sexual desire or the lack of desire may have been acquired during the person's life. There are also complex philosophical and psychological issues surrounding sexuality. Attitudes towards life, death, childbirth, one's parents, friends, family, contemporary society, the human race in general, and particularly one's place in the world play a substantive role in determining how a person will respond in any given sexual situation.\n\nOn the other hand, a person may be [[Hypersexuality|hypersexual]], which is a desire to engage in sexual activities considered abnormally high in relation to normal development or culture, or suffering from a [[persistent genital arousal disorder]], which is a spontaneous, persistent, and uncontrollable arousal, and the physiological changes associated with arousal.\n\n== Physiological and psychological response patterns ==\n=== Physiological responses ===\n\nSexual arousal causes various physical responses, most significantly in the [[sex organ]]s (genital organs). Sexual arousal for a man is usually indicated by the [[tumescence|swelling]] and [[erection]] of the [[human penis|penis]] when blood fills the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum]]. This is usually the most prominent and reliable sign of sexual arousal in males. In a woman, sexual arousal leads to increased blood flow to the [[clitoris]] and [[vulva]], as well as vaginal transudation - the seeping of moisture through the vaginal walls which serves as [[vaginal lubrication|lubrication]].\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!style=\"width:50%\"|\nIn males:\n!In females:\n|-\n|[[File:Comparison of flaccid and erect penis.jpg|thumb]]<br /><small>Male sexual arousal.

Physical or psychological stimulation, or both, leads to [[vasodilation]] and the increased blood flow engorges the three spongy areas that run along the length of the penis (the two [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]] and the [[corpus spongiosum]]). The penis grows enlarged and firm, the skin of the [[scrotum]] is pulled tighter, and the [[testes]] are pulled up against the body.<ref name=\"NHS\">{{cite web|title=Sexual arousal in men|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Goodsex/Pages/Malesexualarousal.aspx|work=NHS Direct|publisher=[[National Health Service]]|accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref> However, the relationship between erection and arousal is not one-to-one.

As the testicles continue to rise, a feeling of warmth may develop around them and the [[perineum]].

Older women produce less vaginal lubrication and studies have investigated changes to degrees of satisfaction, frequency of sexual activity, to desire, sexual thoughts and [[sexual fantasy|fantasies]], sexual arousal, beliefs about and attitudes to sex, pain, and the ability to reach orgasm in women in their 40s and after [[menopause]]. Other factors have also been studied including socio-demographic variables, health, psychological variables, partner variables such as their partner's health or sexual problems, and lifestyle variables.

The first stage, ''aesthetic response,'' is an emotional reaction to noticing an attractive face or figure. This emotional reaction produces an increase in attention toward the object of attraction, typically involving head and eye movements toward the attractive object. The second stage, ''approach response,'' progresses from the first and involves bodily movements towards the object. The final ''genital response'' stage recognizes that with both attention and closer proximity, physical reactions result in genital tumescence. Singer also stated that there is an array of other autonomic responses, but acknowledges that the research literature suggests that the genital response is ''the most reliable and convenient to measure'' in males.<ref name=\"singer\">{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = B | year = 1984 | title = Conceptualizing sexual arousal and attraction | url = | journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 230\u2013240 | doi=10.1080/00224498409551222}}</ref>\n\n===Basson's sexual response cycle===\nIn 2000, Rosemary Basson presented an alternative model to the human sexual response cycle that is ''specific to women\u2019s sexual response''.<ref name=\"A different model\">{{cite journal | last1 = Basson | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = The female sexual response: A different model | url = | journal = [[Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy]] | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 51\u201365 | doi=10.1080/009262300278641 | pmid=10693116| doi-access = free }}</ref> She argues that gender differences in [[sex drive]], sexual motivation, sexual concordance, and capacity for orgasm underlie the need for an alternative model of sexual response. While the human sexual response cycle begins with desire, followed by arousal, orgasm, and finally resolution, Basson's<ref name=\"autogenerated2001\"/> alternative model is circular and begins with women feeling a need for [[intimacy]], which leads her to seek out and be receptive to sexual stimuli; women then feel sexual arousal, in addition to [[sexual desire]]. The cycle results in an enhanced feeling of intimacy. Basson emphasizes the idea that a lack of spontaneous desire should not be taken as an indication of [[female sexual dysfunction]]; many women experience sexual arousal and responsive desire simultaneously when they are engaged in sexual activity.<ref name=\"A different model\"/>\n\n===Toates's incentive-motivation model===\nFrederick Toates presented a model of sexual motivation, arousal, and behavior in 2009 that combines the principles of ''incentive-motivation theory'' and ''hierarchical control of behavior''. The [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|basic incentive-motivation model]] of sex suggests that incentive cues in the environment invade the nervous system, which results in sexual motivation. Positive sexual experiences enhance motivation, while negative experiences reduce it. Motivation and behaviour are organized [[hierarchy|hierarchically]]; each are controlled by a combination direct (external stimuli) and indirect (internal cognitions) factors. Excitation and inhibition of behavior act at various levels of this hierarchical structure. For instance, an external stimulus may directly excite sexual arousal and motivation below a conscious level of awareness, while an internal cognition can elicit the same effects indirectly, through the conscious representation of a sexual image. In the case of inhibition, sexual behavior can be active or conscious (e.g., choosing not to have sex) or it can be passive or unconscious (e.g., being unable to have sex due to fear). Toates emphasizes the importance considering [[cognitive]] representations in addition to external stimuli; he suggests that mental representations of incentives are interchangeable with excitatory external stimuli for eliciting sexual arousal and motivation.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Toates | first1 = F. | title = An Integrative Theoretical Framework for Understanding Sexual Motivation, Arousal, and Behavior | doi = 10.1080/00224490902747768 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 46 | issue = 2\u20133 | pages = 168\u2013193 | year = 2009 | pmid =  19308842| pmc = }}</ref>\n\n===Bancroft's dual control model===\nThis model created by [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] and Erick Janssen at the Kinsey Institute explores the ''individual variability of sexual response''.  They postulate that this variability depends on the interaction between an individual's sexual excitation system (SES) and sexual inhibition system (SIS). Popularized by Emily Nagoski's self-help book ''Come as You Are'', the SES has been described as the sexual response's 'accelerator' and the SIS as the 'brake'.<ref name=Nagoski2015>Nagoski, E. (2015). Come As You Are. New York City, New York: Simon and Schuster.</ref>  The SIS/SES questionnaire was developed to assess an individual's SIS and SES levels.  A factor analysis of the SIS/SES questionnaire, revealed a single excitation factor and two inhibition factors.  These inhibition factors were interpreted as SIS1 (inhibition due to the threat of performance failure) and SIS2 (inhibition due to the threat of performance consequences). \n \nThe SIS/SES questionnaire was originally developed for men though it has since proven its statistical validity among women. Despite this, the SESII-W (the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women) was created by Graham and associates.<ref name=Graham2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = C.

A factor analysis of this questionnaire revealed only two factors: sexual excitation (SE) and sexual inhibition (SI).  This may point to internal inconsistencies in the SIS/SES questionnaire regarding gender.  One lower order factor in the SESII-W labeled Arousal Contingency was particularly relevant; this factor explains the easy disruption of sexual arousal.\n\nRegardless of the difference in these two questionnaires, both surveys' scores show normal distribution verifying the hypothesis that there is a normal individual variation in sexual arousal and inhibition.  In the original SIS/SES questionnaire, statistically significant gender differences are seen despite considerable overlap in scores between men and women.  On average, males score higher on sexual excitation and lower than females on both facets of sexual inhibition.  As yet, the differences in scores between genders have not been explained beyond the theoretical level. \n \nThe source of individual variability on the sexual excitation and inhibition systems is not known definitively.  Even less is known about how these systems develop in individuals.  Age of first [[masturbation]] has been used as a measure to assess sexual development. Age of masturbatory onset is much more variable in girls than boys, whose tend to be close to puberty.<ref name= Bancroft_et_al.,2003>Bancroft, J., Herbenick, D., & Reynolds, M. (2003).

[[Ivan Tarkhanov (physiologist)|Ivan Tarkhanov]] showed, in experiments on cutting and artificial emptying of the [[seminal vesicle]]s, that the latter played the crucial role in the generation of sexual excitement in frogs. Proceeding from these experimental results, Tarkhanov put forward a hypothesis that filling and evacuation of the seminal vesicles were the main biological cause which led to sexual arousal and its disappearance in mammals and humans.<ref>[[Ivan Tarkhanov (physiologist)|\u0422\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0418. \u0420.]] \u041a \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0443 \u043b\u044f\u0433\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438 (On Physiology of the Reproductive system in frogs). \u2014 \u00ab\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0430 (Russian medicine)\u00bb, 1885, \u211630\u201332, \u0441. 1\u201326.

If the level of this tension reaches threshold, sexual arousal occurs as the expression of necessity to let off steam. Gary F. Kelly ([[Clarkson University]]) describes this model as follows:\n{{Quotation|For centuries, the assumption was made that the longing for [[Sexual intercourse|sexual interaction]] was innate, and an inner drive model was used to explain it. It has been suggested that this model was much like a metaphor for a steam boiler. Internal sexual \u201csteam\u201d would build up until the pressure became so great that the drive to release it was very strong.

An erection, for example, is pleasurable and painful at the same time. With an increase of sexual excitation, the tension increases and becomes wholly unpleasurable. This condition becomes so unbearable that the individual is forced to seek release from these tensions and liberation from the painful feelings.&nbsp;...

Such an approach assumes sexual arousal to be a spontaneous desire that appears periodically like sensations of hunger and thirst. Drawing a parallel between these sensations and sexual excitation is widely accepted now: \"Everyone must experience sexuality in some way to survive.&nbsp;... In this sense sex is a necessity of life, just as air, food, and warmth.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Coleman | first = E. | editor = Eli Coleman| title = Chemical Dependency and Intimacy Dysfunction | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=MmA78fbMYEwC&pg=PA189#v=onepage&q&f=false | year = 2009 | publisher = [[Routledge]] | isbn = 978-0-86656-640-7 | pages = 189\u2013204 | chapter = Sexual Compulsivity: Definition, Etiology and Treatment Considerations | accessdate = 2013-11-03 }}</ref>{{rp|190|}} And yet there is no empirical evidence in support of such a parallel, Imieli\u0144ski says. Sensations of hunger and thirst occur due to certain states of physiological insufficiency. The feeling of hunger results from the lack of glucose, fats and amino acids in blood. The feeling of thirst occurs in response to reduction of the water content of tissues.

There are a variety of methods used to assess genital sexual arousal in women. [[Vaginal photoplethysmography]] (VPG) can measure changes in vaginal blood volume or phasic changes in vasocongestion associated with each heartbeat. [[Clitoral photoplethysmograph]]y functions in a similar way to VPG, but measures changes in clitoral blood volume, rather than vaginal vasocongestion. [[Thermography (sexual psychophysiology)|Thermography]] provides a direct measure of genital sexual arousal by measuring changes in [[temperature]] associated with increased blood flow to the [[external genitals|external genital]] tissues. Similarly, [[labial thermistor clip]]s measure changes in temperature associated with genital engorgement; this method directly measures changes in temperature of the labia. More recently, [[laser doppler imaging]] (LDI) has been used as a direct measure of genital sexual arousal in women. LDI functions by measuring superficial changes in blood flow in the vulvar tissues.\n\n==Category-specificity==\nCategory-specificity refers to a person showing sexual arousal to the categories of people they prefer to have sex with. Sexual arousal studies involving category-specificity look at genital responses (physiological changes), as well as subjective responses (what people report their arousal levels to be).

That is, the hypothesis is that vaginal lubrication can take place as a protective mechanism even in a non-preferred sexual situation, such as when sexual activity is [[Rape|non-consensual]].<ref name=\"stable\" />\n\nOther researchers argue that since the research is done on people who volunteer to be studied, the observed levels of category specificity may not represent the population, that there may be different cultural expectations of sexual interests being linked to genital arousal that make men with non-category specific genital arousal less likely to appear as test subjects. There researchers also argue that the assumption that men are always sexually interested in what causes genital arousal removes its own falsifiability by explaining all contradictory data away as \"denial\", making the theory untestable.<ref>Research Methods in Psychiatry, third edition. Chris Freeman, Peter J.</ref><ref>Issues in Psychology and Psychiatry Research and Practice: 2013 Edition. Q Ashton Acton</ref>\n\n===Overlapping brain variables and sexual arousal===\nWhile there is disagreement among neurologists on whether or not it is possible to categorically distinguish male brains and female brains by measuring many variables in the brain, neurologists agree that all single variables in the brain display more individual variation and overlap between the sexes than differences between the sexes. For instance, men and women alike are capable of classifying sex acts as sexual no matter if they find them appealing or not, making a genital response to unappealing erotic stimuli a single mechanism step. It is therefore argued by neurologists that category specificity of genital response to erotical imagery, being determined by one or a small number of closely linked brain mechanisms and therefore not subject to significant multivariate effects, cannot be subject to such a large sex difference as that apparent in pletysmographic studies. These neurologists cite the existence of significant volunteering bias among men but not women in erotica research, in particular that the overrepresentation of erectile dysfunction yet underrepresentation of sexuality-related shame in volunteers is consistent with the hypothesis that genital response to both sexual relevance and appeal allows for a stronger erectile function than response only to appeal and that a majority of the male population are ashamed of their responses to unappealing stimuli, accounting for the discrepancy between the report from most heterosexual couples that male erection is faster than female lubrication and the appearance on pletysmography volunteers that female lubrication is at least as fast as male erection. They also argue that the appearance of a greater individual variability in female genital response than in male genital response is consistent with a representative female sample and a male sample subject to bias that leaves much of the individual variability unstudied, with a reference to the neurological observation that all brain structures display significant individual variability in both sexes and that no brain structure is variable only in females and not in males.<ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15468.full Sex beyond the genitalia: The human brain mosaic] October 23, 2015</ref><ref>Multivariate revisit to \u201csex beyond the genitalia\u201d</ref>\n\n==Concordance==\nSexual arousal results in a combination of physiological and psychological factors, like genital sexual response and subjective experience of sexual arousal. The degree to which genital and subjective sexual response correspond is termed ''concordance''.

The display of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s in humans such as a penis-like enlarged [[clitoris]] in females during arousal and [[gynecomastia]] in males are thought to have once been objects of [[mate selection]] in human evolution because of the persistence of the phenomenon of these features invoking sexual arousal for potential mates in [[cross-cultural studies]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Miller, Geoffrey|url=http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/Human%20Nature%20S%201999/SexualSelection/sex%5B1%5D.pdf|title=A Review of Sexual Selection and Human Evolution|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309180820/http://cas.bellarmine.edu/tietjen/Human%20Nature%20S%201999/SexualSelection/sex%5B1%5D.pdf|archivedate=2006-03-09}}</ref> A dramatic example of this is the high rates of secondary sex characteristic [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphism]] in some Southeast Asia human populations.<ref>Harpending, Henry \"Human Diversity and its History\" ''(Bibliographic Guide to East Asian Studies'', by Gale Group, Gale Group, 2001, {{ISBN|0-7838-9219-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7838-9219-1}})</ref> Similar evolutionary stimuli may also have resulted in novel structures such as the [[pseudo-penis]] of the female [[spotted hyena]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/699-painful-realities-hyena-sex.html |title=The Painful Realities of Hyena Sex |publisher=LiveScience |date=2006-04-26 |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Human sexuality}}\n* [[Aphrodisiac]]\n* [[Erectile tissue]]\n* [[Kinsey Reports]]\n* [[Nudity and sexuality]]\n* [[Priapism]]\n* [[Sexology]]\n* [[Sexual frustration]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Sexual arousal}}\n\n{{Sex}}\n{{Human sexuality}}\n\n<!--Eponymous categories:-->\n<!--Other categories:-->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sexual Arousal}}\n[[Category:Sexual arousal| ]]\n", "name_user": "MickyMouse88", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_arousal"}

Despite the setback, the rebellion rekindled with funds from [[revolutionary tax]]es, [[extortion]] and large scale foreign support campaigns.<ref name=AcEh /> Both the CPP and NPA attempted to garner support from the [[Workers' Party of Korea]], the Maoist factions of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestinian Liberation Organization]], [[Japanese Red Army]], [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]], [[Communist Party of El Salvador]], [[Shining Path|Communist Party of Peru]], and the [[Algerian People's National Armed Forces|Algerian military]]. Financial aid, training and other forms of support were received from a number of the above. NDF-controlled trading companies were allegedly set up in [[Hong Kong]], [[Belgium]], and [[Yugoslavia]]. At the same time the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] formed a unit in the [[Netherlands]] and sent representatives to [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Ireland]], [[United States]], [[Sweden]], and various parts of the [[Middle East]].

This was quickly followed by the  Hague Joint Declaration of September 1, 1992, in which the Government of the Philippines and the  Communist Party of the Philippines (through the National Democratic Front) agreed to work towards formal negotiations and \u201ca just and lasting peace.\u201d<ref name=\"Marchadesch20171124\"/>\n\n==== 1995 JASIG and 1998 CARHRIHL agreements ====\nIn 1995, negotiations led to the signing of the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (JASIG), under which negotiators on either side of the conflict were assured of \"free and safe movement\u2014without fear of search, surveillance, or arrest.\"<ref name=\"StanfordFSICISACMapping\"/> \n\nIn 1998, another agreement, the Comprehensive Agreement to Respect Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL) was signed in an effort to protect civilians from the violence between the two parties.<ref name=\"StanfordFSICISACMapping\"/>\n\n==== Resurgence of conflict under the Estrada administration====\nThe peace talks broke down soon after the 1998 agreement,<ref name=\"StanfordFSICISACMapping\"/> however, and conflict between the two parties resumed at high levels after [[Joseph Estrada]] assumed the presidency later that year.<ref name=\"StanfordFSICISACMapping\"/> In March 2001, a few months after Estrada was ousted by the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001|\"EDSA II\" Revolution]], National Security Advisor Roilo Golez noted that the number of \"barangays influenced by\" the CPP-NPA grew from 772 barangays 1,279 under the Estrada administration, which Golez added was \"quite a big jump.\"<ref name=\"NPABarangaysUnderErap\"/> In July 2001, officials of the Armed Forces of the Philippines noted that the NPA grew in strength \"at an average of three to five percent yearly\" since 1998.<ref name=\"NPAGrewErap\"/>\n\n=== Incidents during the Arroyo administration ===\nIn 2001, the AFP launched a campaign of selective [[extrajudicial killing]]s, in an attempt to suppress NPA activity. By targeting suspected rebel sympathizers, the campaign aimed to destroy the communist political infrastructure. The program was modeled after the [[Phoenix Program]], a U.S. project implemented during the [[Vietnam War]].

Instances of landowner harassment and violence towards working class tenants led to escalating tensions between the two social groups.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nAnother factor into the Samar Island being a stronghold is historically the island has been among the most rebellious against the American Commonwealth rule, Spanish rule, and the Japanese occupation.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nIn 1976, NPA gained popular support among the inhabitants of Samar following vigilante actions against cattle rustling gangs. The following year, NPA transferred agents from [[Cebu]] and Manila where conditions were less favorable. The influx of troops enable NPA to form units fully engaged in guerrilla activities. In 1982, an unofficial communist government was formed, solidifying Samar as a communist stronghold. The 1980s downfall of the coconut industry greatly affected livelihoods of many Samaranos, further fueling the rebellion. Between January 2011 and December 2012, a total of 153 insurgency related incidents took place in [[Samar]], resulting in 21 deaths and 55 injuries.<ref name=Damw/>\n\n==Peace talks==\nBased on the

Samar's terrain consists of densely forested mountainous areas, providing fertile ground for the conduct of guerrilla warfare.<ref name=Damw/>\n\nAn important factor in the spread of the rebellion was the issue of widespread landlessness. Land reforms provided only a limited solution for the millions of Philippine landless farmers. In the case of Samar, 40 landowning clans controlled approximately half of the island's agricultural land. Instances of landowner harassment and violence towards working class tenants led to escalating tensions between the two social groups.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nAnother factor into the Samar Island being a stronghold is historically the island has been among the most rebellious against the American Commonwealth rule, Spanish rule, and the Japanese occupation.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nIn 1976, NPA gained popular support among the inhabitants of Samar following vigilante actions against cattle rustling gangs. The following year, NPA transferred agents from [[Cebu]] and Manila where conditions were less favorable. The influx of troops enable NPA to form units fully engaged in guerrilla activities. In 1982, an unofficial communist government was formed, solidifying Samar as a communist stronghold. The 1980s downfall of the coconut industry greatly affected livelihoods of many Samaranos, further fueling the rebellion.

On September 3, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (DJIA) peaked at 381.17, a height it would not reach again until November  1954. Then, from [[October 24]]\u2013[[October 29]], stock prices suffered three multi-digit percentage drops, wiping out more than $30 billion from the New York Stock Exchange (10 times greater than the annual budget of the federal government).<ref>Gilbert, 767\u20139</ref><!-- This ref only covers part of the preceding info --> On [[December 3]] U.S. President [[Herbert Hoover]] announced to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] that the worst effects of the recent [[stock market]] crash were behind the nation, and that the American people had regained faith in the [[Economics|economy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=22021|first=Herbert|last=Hoover|title=Annual Message to Congress on the State of the Union|work=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=2013-02-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Literature, arts, and entertainment ===\n{{Main|1929 in the arts (disambiguation)}}\nLiterature of the time reflected the memories many harbored of the horrors of World War I. A major seller was ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' by [[Erich Maria Remarque]]. Remarque was a German who had fought in the war at age eighteen and been wounded in the [[Third Battle of Ypres]]. He stated that he intended the book to tell the story \"of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war.\" Another 1929 book reflecting on World War I was [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'', as well as ''[[Good-Bye to All That]]'' by [[Robert Graves]].<ref>Gilbert, pp. 769\u201370</ref> In lighter media, a few stars of the comic industry made their debut, including ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'', a [[comic book]] character created by [[Herg\u00e9]], who would appear in over 200  million comic books in 60 languages. ''[[Popeye]]'', another [[comic strip]] character created by [[Elzie Crisler Segar]], also appeared in this year.\n\nWithin the film industry, on [[May 16]] the [[1st Academy Awards]] were presented at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]], with ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' winning [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Also, ''[[Hallelujah! (film)|Hallelujah!]]'' became the first Hollywood film to contain an entirely black cast, and ''[[Atlantic (film)|Atlantic]]'', a film about the ''[[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'', is an early sound-on-film movie. The arts were in the midst of the [[Modernist]] movement, as [[Pablo Picasso]] painted two [[cubist]] works, ''Woman in a Garden'' and ''Nude in an Armchair'', during this year. The [[surrealist]] painters [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]] completed several works, including ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' and ''[[The Treachery of Images]]''. On [[November 7]] in New York City, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] opened to the public. The latest in [[modern architecture]] was also represented by the [[Barcelona Pavilion]] in Spain, and the [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]] in Toronto, at its completion the tallest building in the British Empire.\n\n===Science and technology===\n{{Main|1929 in science}}\nThe year saw several advances in technology and exploration. On [[June 27]] the first public demonstration of color TV was held by H. E. Ives and his colleagues at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York. The first images were a bouquet of roses and an American flag. A mechanical system was used to transmit 50-line color television images between New York and Washington. The [[BBC]] broadcast a television transmission for the first time. By November, [[Vladimir Zworykin]] had taken out the first patent for color television. On [[November 29]], [[Bernt Balchen]], U.S. Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd|Richard Byrd]], Captain Ashley McKinley, and [[Harold June]], became the first to fly over the [[South Pole]]. Within the year, Britain, Australia and New Zealand began a joint [[British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition|Antarctic Research Expedition]], and the German airship ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' began a round-the-world flight (ended [[August 29]]).

Then, from [[October 24]]\u2013[[October 29]], stock prices suffered three multi-digit percentage drops, wiping out more than $30 billion from the New York Stock Exchange (10 times greater than the annual budget of the federal government).<ref>Gilbert, 767\u20139</ref><!-- This ref only covers part of the preceding info --> On [[December 3]] U.S. President [[Herbert Hoover]] announced to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] that the worst effects of the recent [[stock market]] crash were behind the nation, and that the American people had regained faith in the [[Economics|economy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=22021|first=Herbert|last=Hoover|title=Annual Message to Congress on the State of the Union|work=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=2013-02-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Literature, arts, and entertainment ===\n{{Main|1929 in the arts (disambiguation)}}\nLiterature of the time reflected the memories many harbored of the horrors of World War I. A major seller was ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' by [[Erich Maria Remarque]]. Remarque was a German who had fought in the war at age eighteen and been wounded in the [[Third Battle of Ypres]]. He stated that he intended the book to tell the story \"of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war.\" Another 1929 book reflecting on World War I was [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'', as well as ''[[Good-Bye to All That]]'' by [[Robert Graves]].<ref>Gilbert, pp. 769\u201370</ref> In lighter media, a few stars of the comic industry made their debut, including ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'', a [[comic book]] character created by [[Herg\u00e9]], who would appear in over 200  million comic books in 60 languages. ''[[Popeye]]'', another [[comic strip]] character created by [[Elzie Crisler Segar]], also appeared in this year.\n\nWithin the film industry, on [[May 16]] the [[1st Academy Awards]] were presented at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]], with ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' winning [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Also, ''[[Hallelujah! (film)|Hallelujah!]]'' became the first Hollywood film to contain an entirely black cast, and ''[[Atlantic (film)|Atlantic]]'', a film about the ''[[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'', is an early sound-on-film movie. The arts were in the midst of the [[Modernist]] movement, as [[Pablo Picasso]] painted two [[cubist]] works, ''Woman in a Garden'' and ''Nude in an Armchair'', during this year. The [[surrealist]] painters [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]] completed several works, including ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' and ''[[The Treachery of Images]]''. On [[November 7]] in New York City, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] opened to the public. The latest in [[modern architecture]] was also represented by the [[Barcelona Pavilion]] in Spain, and the [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]] in Toronto, at its completion the tallest building in the British Empire.\n\n===Science and technology===\n{{Main|1929 in science}}\nThe year saw several advances in technology and exploration. On [[June 27]] the first public demonstration of color TV was held by H. E. Ives and his colleagues at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York. The first images were a bouquet of roses and an American flag. A mechanical system was used to transmit 50-line color television images between New York and Washington. The [[BBC]] broadcast a television transmission for the first time. By November, [[Vladimir Zworykin]] had taken out the first patent for color television. On [[November 29]], [[Bernt Balchen]], U.S. Admiral [[Richard E. Byrd|Richard Byrd]], Captain Ashley McKinley, and [[Harold June]], became the first to fly over the [[South Pole]]. Within the year, Britain, Australia and New Zealand began a joint [[British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition|Antarctic Research Expedition]], and the German airship ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' began a round-the-world flight (ended [[August 29]]).

Three days after the Derg took power, on 14 September 1974, seven leaders of this trend established the ''Association of Progressives of the Tigray Nation'' ({{lang-ti|\u121b\u1215\u1260\u122d \u1308\u1235\u1308\u1235\u1272 \u1265\u1214\u122d \u1275\u130d\u122b\u12ed}}; ''Mahb\u00e4r G\u00e4sg\u00e4sti B\u0259her T\u0259gray''), also known as Tigrayan National Organization (TNO): Alemseged Mengesha (nom de gurre: Haylu), Ammaha Tsehay (Abbay), Aregawi Berhe (Berhu), [[Seyoum Mesfin|Embay Mesfin]] (Seyoum), Fentahun Zeatsyon (Gidey), Mulugeta Hagos (Asfeha) and Zeru Gesese (Agazi).

The ELF resented the liquidation of the TLF and viewed the relations between the EPLF and the TPLF as a serious threat. Since 1977 the ELF and the TPLF had conflicts over the issue of Eritrean settlers in western Tigray, who were organized under the ELF and rejected the TPLF-land reform.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nRelations with the EPLF also did not develop smoothly.

The ''Derg''<nowiki/>'s increasingly alienating intervention, the Front's handling of the famine and of the refugee problems, as well as the foreign connections it built through its mission in [[Khartoum]], all enabled the movement to mobilize and better equip more fighters and prepare for a change from guerrilla to frontal battles.

In early 1985 it organized a march of over 200,000 famine victims from Tigray to Sudan to draw international attention to the plight of Tigray. Its humanitarian branch, the [[Relief Society of Tigray]] (REST), established in 1978, received large amounts of international humanitarian aid for famine victims and small-scale development projects in liberated Tigray.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\nIn July 1985, a congress of a few hundred selected cadres established the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist League of Tigray|Marxist-Leninist League of Tigray]] (MLLT). The MLLT was conceived to be the nucleus of the future [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist-Leninst]] vanguard part for the whole of Ethiopia. The MLLT invited the genuine revolutionaries within the ranks of ''Derg'' regime, which was then busy [[Commission for Organizing the Party of the Working People of Ethiopia|organizing its own communist party]], the [[Ethiopian Workers' Party]], to join it.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAfter the congress, the TPLF and its mass organizations were ruthlessly brought under the control of the MLLT, dissenting cadres among them TPLF-co-founders Gidey and Berhu, were purged.\n\nIn December 1988, the TPLF and [[Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement]] (EPDM, a TPLF-loyal splinter group from the EPRP, founded in 1980) founded the EPRDF as the nucleus of the envisaged United Democratic Front. In spring 1989 first the MLLT and then the TPLF held a congress. Abbay was elected Chairman of both but towards the end of 1989 Meles became the chairman of both organizations. In May 1989 the EPDM established the Ethiopian Marxist-Leninist Force (EMLF). In July 1989 MLLT and EMLF created the Union of Ethiopian Proletarian Organizations. In April 1990 the TPLF formed the Ethiopian Democratic Officers Movement from politically re-educated captured Ethiopian officers to undercut the Free Officers Movement formed in 1987 by exiled Ethiopian officers in opposition to the ''Derg''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Generation: The history of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party, Part 2: Ethiopia-Transformation and Conflict|last=Tadesse|first=Kiflu|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=}}</ref> In May 1990 Oromo-members of the EPDM and politically re-educated Oromo-Prisoners-of-War founded the [[Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization|Oromo People's Democratic Organization]] (OPDO) to deny the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] the claim to be the exclusive representative of the Ethiopian Oromo.<ref name=\":1\" /> In November 1990 an Oromo Marxist-Leninist Movement was established within the OPDO. Also in 1990 the TPLF created the Afar Democratic Union to undercut the Afar movements. Before 1985 it had already helped to establish liberation fronts in Gambella and Benshangul.\n\nIn early 1988, both the EPLF and the TPLF went on the offensive. The developing situation in both Eritrea and Tigray but also the shifting international context after the demise of the Soviet bloc induced the TPLF and EPLF to put their differences aside and to resume military cooperation.

In February 1991 the EPRDF launched its final offensive against the ''[[PDRE]]'' regime assisted by a large EPLF contingent. When on 28 May 1991 the EPRDF entered Addis Ababa and took power as the [[Transitional Government of Ethiopia]], the TPLF had 80,000, the EPDM 8,000 and the OPDO 2,000 fighters.

Three days after the Derg took power, on 14 September 1974, seven leaders of this trend established the ''Association of Progressives of the Tigray Nation'' ({{lang-ti|\u121b\u1215\u1260\u122d \u1308\u1235\u1308\u1235\u1272 \u1265\u1214\u122d \u1275\u130d\u122b\u12ed}}; ''Mahb\u00e4r G\u00e4sg\u00e4sti B\u0259her T\u0259gray''), also known as Tigrayan National Organization (TNO): Alemseged Mengesha (nom de gurre: Haylu), Ammaha Tsehay (Abbay), Aregawi Berhe (Berhu), [[Seyoum Mesfin|Embay Mesfin]] (Seyoum), Fentahun Zeatsyon (Gidey), Mulugeta Hagos (Asfeha) and Zeru Gesese (Agazi).

In November 1974 the EPLF agreed to train TNO-members and allowed EPLF-fighters from the Tigrayan community in Eritrea, among them Mehari Tekle (Muse), to join the TPLF.

On 18 February 1976 a fighters' conference elected a new leadership: Berhu (Chairman), Muse (Military Committee), Abbay (Political Committee), Agazi (Socio-Economic Committee), Seyoum (Foreign Relations), Gidey, and Sebhat.<ref name=\":0\" /> Meles became head of the political cadre school.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first three years of its existence were marked by a constant struggle for survival, unstable cooperation with the Eritrean forces, and power struggles against the other Tigrayan fronts: in 1975 the TPLF liquidated the TLF, in 1976-78 it fought back the Ethiopian Democratic Union (EDU) in [[Shire, Ethiopia|Shire]] and in 1978 it fought the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Party (EPRP) in eastern Tigray. Besides this the Front had to suffer heavy losses due to the ''Derg''<nowiki/>'s offensives in the region.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa|last=Tareke|first=Gebru|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=76\u2013177}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the TPLF, the ELF and the EPLF co-operated during the ''Derg'' offensives of 1976 and 1978 in Tigray and Eritrea, no stable alliance was formed. The ELF resented the liquidation of the TLF and viewed the relations between the EPLF and the TPLF as a serious threat. Since 1977 the ELF and the TPLF had conflicts over the issue of Eritrean settlers in western Tigray, who were organized under the ELF and rejected the TPLF-land reform.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nRelations with the EPLF also did not develop smoothly. Its material support was much less than the TPLF expected. Politically the EPLF preferred the multi-national EPRP to the ethno-regionalist TPLF with its then separatist agenda.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== 1978-1990 ===\nFollowing the Derg's victory in the [[Ogaden War]] in February 1978, [[Mengistu Haile Mariam|Mengestu Haile Mariam]]'s new alliance with the Soviets and the revolutionary growth of his armed forces, the TPLF momentum seemed to slow.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tareke|first=Gebry|date=2004|title=From Af Abet to Shire: the Defeat and Demise of Ethiopia's \"Red\" Army 1988-89|url=|journal=Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=42|issue=2|pages=239\u201381|doi=10.1017/S0022278X04000114}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1979 the TPLF held its first regular congress. It declared its struggle to be the second ''w\u00e4yyan\u00e4'' (''kalay w\u00e4yyan\u00e4'') and changed its Tigrinya name to ''H\u0259zbayawi W\u00e4yyan\u00e4 Har\u0259nn\u00e4t\u00e4 T\u0259gray''.

The ''Derg''<nowiki/>'s increasingly alienating intervention, the Front's handling of the famine and of the refugee problems, as well as the foreign connections it built through its mission in [[Khartoum]], all enabled the movement to mobilize and better equip more fighters and prepare for a change from guerrilla to frontal battles. Also, in the mid-1980s, developments within the TPLF led to a conceptual change from a struggle for the liberation of Tigray to that of all of Ethiopia.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Sweeter than Honey: Testimonies of Tigrayan Women|last=Hammond|first=Jenny|publisher=|year=1989|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}</ref> They established their headquarters in caves in [[Addi Geza'iti]], some 50 kilometres west of [[Mekelle]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smidt |first1=W |title=Geo-trekking in Ethiopia's Tropical Mountains |chapter=A Short History and Ethnography of the Tembien Tigrayans |series=GeoGuide |date=2019 |publisher=Springer Nature |pages=63\u201378 |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-04955-3_4 |isbn=978-3-030-04954-6 }}</ref> The allied [[EPDM]] party used caves in [[Melfa (Dogu'a Tembien)]].\n[[File:Signboard for Melfa headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|Signboard for EPDM/ANLF headquarters in [[Melfa (Dogu'a Tembien)]] during the [[Ethiopian Civil War]]]]\n\nThe TPLF succeeded in turning the catastrophic famine 1984\u201385 to its overall advantage. In early 1985 it organized a march of over 200,000 famine victims from Tigray to Sudan to draw international attention to the plight of Tigray. Its humanitarian branch, the [[Relief Society of Tigray]] (REST), established in 1978, received large amounts of international humanitarian aid for famine victims and small-scale development projects in liberated Tigray.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nIn July 1985 a congress of a few hundred selected cadres established the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist League of Tigray|Marxist-Leninist League of Tigray]] (MLLT). The MLLT was conceived to be the nucleus of the future [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist-Leninst]] vanguard part for the whole of Ethiopia. The MLLT invited the genuine revolutionaries within the ranks of ''Derg'' regime, which was then busy [[Commission for Organizing the Party of the Working People of Ethiopia|organizing its own communist party]], the [[Ethiopian Workers' Party]], to join it.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAfter the congress, the TPLF and its mass organizations were ruthlessly brought under the control of the MLLT, dissenting cadres among them TPLF-co-founders Gidey and Berhu, were purged.\n\nIn December 1988 the TPLF and [[Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement]] (EPDM, a TPLF-loyal splinter group from the EPRP, founded in 1980) founded the EPRDF as the nucleus of the envisaged United Democratic Front. In spring 1989 first the MLLT and then the TPLF held a congress. Abbay was elected Chairman of both but towards the end of 1989 Meles became the chairman of both organizations. In May 1989 the EPDM established the Ethiopian Marxist-Leninist Force (EMLF). In July 1989 MLLT and EMLF created the Union of Ethiopian Proletarian Organizations. In April 1990 the TPLF formed the Ethiopian Democratic Officers Movement from politically re-educated captured Ethiopian officers to undercut the Free Officers Movement formed in 1987 by exiled Ethiopian officers in opposition to the ''Derg''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Generation: The history of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party, Part 2: Ethiopia-Transformation and Conflict|last=Tadesse|first=Kiflu|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=Lanham|pages=}}</ref> In May 1990 Oromo-members of the EPDM and politically re-educated Oromo-Prisoners-of-War founded the [[Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organization|Oromo People's Democratic Organization]] (OPDO) to deny the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] the claim to be the exclusive representative of the Ethiopian Oromo.<ref name=\":1\" /> In November 1990 an Oromo Marxist-Leninist Movement was established within the OPDO. Also in 1990 the TPLF created the Afar Democratic Union to undercut the Afar movements. Before 1985 it had already helped to establish liberation fronts in Gambella and Benshangul.\n\nIn early 1988 both the EPLF and the TPLF went on the offensive. The developing situation in both Eritrea and Tigray but also the shifting international context after the demise of the Soviet bloc induced the TPLF and EPLF to put their differences aside and to resume military cooperation.

In February 1991 the EPRDF launched its final offensive against the ''[[PDRE]]'' regime assisted by a large EPLF contingent. When on 28 May 1991 the EPRDF entered Addis Ababa and took power as the [[Transitional Government of Ethiopia]], the TPLF had 80,000, the EPDM 8,000 and the OPDO 2,000 fighters.

The first recorded person of Dominican descent to migrate into what is now known as the [[United States]], outside of [[New Spain]], was sailor-turned-merchant [[Juan (Jan) Rodriguez|Juan Rodr\u00edguez]]. He arrived on [[Manhattan]] in 1613 from his home in [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]], which makes him the first non-[[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] person to spend substantial time in the island.

Many of the 1,150 Dominicans immigrating to the United States between 1931 and 1940, came as secondary labor migrants from [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Panama]].<ref name=\"Dominican immigrants\">{{Cite web | url=http://immigrationtounitedstates.org/465-dominican-immigrants.html | title=Dominican immigrants}}</ref>\n\nA larger wave of Dominicans began after 1950, during a time when cracks began to appear in the Trujillo regime. Dominican immigrants during this period where largely classified as anti-Trujilo political exiles. During that decade, the United States admitted an average of 990 Dominican nationals per year.<ref name=\"Dominican immigrants\"/>\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century there were three significant waves of immigration to the [[United States]]. The first period began in 1961, when a coalition of high-ranking Dominicans, with assistance from the [[CIA]], assassinated General [[Rafael Trujillo]], the nation's military dictator.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/family_jewels_wilderotter.pdf |title=Justice Department Memo, 1975 |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] }}</ref> In the wake of his death, fear of retaliation by Trujillo's allies, and political uncertainty in general, spurred migration from the island. In 1965, the United States began a military [[Operation Power Pack|occupation of the Dominican Republic]] and eased travel restrictions, making it easier for Dominicans to obtain American visas.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2546161 |jstor=2546161|title=International Migration in the Dominican Republic: Implications for Development Planning|journal=International Migration Review|volume=16|issue=4|pages=819|year=1982|last1=Morrison|first1=Thomas K.|last2=Sinkin|first2=Richard}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1966 to 1978, the exodus continued, fueled by high unemployment and political repression. Communities established by the first wave of immigrants to the U.S. created a network that assisted subsequent arrivals. In the early 1980s, unemployment, inflation, and the rise in value of the dollar all contributed to the third and largest wave of emigration from the island nation, this time mostly from the lower-class. Today, emigration from the Dominican Republic remains high, facilitated by the social networks of now-established Dominican communities in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learner.org/channel/libraries/socialstudies/9_12/weir/background.html|title=Social Studies In Action: Migration From Latin America|website=www.learner.org|access-date=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913152855/http://www.learner.org/channel/libraries/socialstudies/9_12/weir/background.html|archive-date=September 13, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\nAlmost half of all the Dominican Americans today arrived since the 1990s, especially in the early part of that decade.

Traditional cuisine is very colorful with red and green peppers and cilantro.  Traditional cuisine consists of rice, beans, [[tostones]] (known as ''fritos'') and a meat like chicharr\u00f3n de pollo (deep-fried chicken), [[Mang\u00fa (dish)|Mang\u00fa]] (mashed green plantains served with saut\u00e9ed onion), slices of avocado, fried eggs, salami, empanadas and pastelitos (fried meat pies), and sancocho (stew of meats, potatoes, and vegetables).<ref name=\"test\">[Stone, John H.

Dominican Americans take pride in their food from their homeland and they use it as a symbol in times of celebration.  For example, when the Dominican Republic won the World Cup of Baseball, Dominican Americans cheered carrying plantains.<ref name=\"test1\" />\n\nThe experience of Dominican-American cuisine goes beyond the consumption of the food, however.

The first recorded person of Dominican descent to migrate into what is now known as the [[United States]], outside of [[New Spain]], was sailor-turned-merchant [[Juan (Jan) Rodriguez|Juan Rodr\u00edguez]]. He arrived on [[Manhattan]] in 1613 from his home in [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]], which makes him the first non-[[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] person to spend substantial time in the island. He also became the first Dominican, the first [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] and the first person with [[ethnic groups in Europe|European]] (specifically [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]) and [[ethnic groups of Africa|African]] ancestry to settle in what is present day [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voicesofny.org/tag/juan-rodriguez/|title=Juan Rodriguez Archives - Voices of NY|work=Voices of NY|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\nDominican emigration to the United States continued throughout the centuries. Receent studies from the [[CUNY]] Dominican studies Institute identified 5,000 Dominican nationals who were processed through [[Ellis Island]] between 1892 and 1924.<ref name=\"cunydsi.typepad.com\"/>\n\nDuring the 1930s and 40s, the flow of Dominicans to the United States fluctuated after [[Rafael Trujillo]], who rose to power in 1930, imposed heavy restrictions on the outward migration of his citizens. Many of the 1,150 Dominicans immigrating to the United States between 1931 and 1940, came as secondary labor migrants from [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Panama]].<ref name=\"Dominican immigrants\">{{Cite web | url=http://immigrationtounitedstates.org/465-dominican-immigrants.html | title=Dominican immigrants}}</ref>\n\nA larger wave of Dominicans began after 1950, during a time when cracks began to appear in the Trujillo regime. Dominican immigrants during this period where largely classified as anti-Trujilo political exiles. During that decade, the United States admitted an average of 990 Dominican nationals per year.<ref name=\"Dominican immigrants\"/>\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century there were three significant waves of immigration to the [[United States]]. The first period began in 1961, when a coalition of high-ranking Dominicans, with assistance from the [[CIA]], assassinated General [[Rafael Trujillo]], the nation's military dictator.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/family_jewels_wilderotter.pdf |title=Justice Department Memo, 1975 |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] }}</ref> In the wake of his death, fear of retaliation by Trujillo's allies, and political uncertainty in general, spurred migration from the island. In 1965, the United States began a military [[Operation Power Pack|occupation of the Dominican Republic]] and eased travel restrictions, making it easier for Dominicans to obtain American visas.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2546161 |jstor=2546161|title=International Migration in the Dominican Republic: Implications for Development Planning|journal=International Migration Review|volume=16|issue=4|pages=819|year=1982|last1=Morrison|first1=Thomas K.|last2=Sinkin|first2=Richard}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1966 to 1978, the exodus continued, fueled by high unemployment and political repression. Communities established by the first wave of immigrants to the U.S. created a network that assisted subsequent arrivals. In the early 1980s, unemployment, inflation, and the rise in value of the dollar all contributed to the third and largest wave of emigration from the island nation, this time mostly from the lower-class. Today, emigration from the Dominican Republic remains high, facilitated by the social networks of now-established Dominican communities in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learner.org/channel/libraries/socialstudies/9_12/weir/background.html|title=Social Studies In Action: Migration From Latin America|website=www.learner.org|access-date=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913152855/http://www.learner.org/channel/libraries/socialstudies/9_12/weir/background.html|archive-date=September 13, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\nAlmost half of all the Dominican Americans today arrived since the 1990s, especially in the early part of that decade.

It is normal in the Dominican American community to work in the United States and later invest the money in a house and business back in Dominican Republic.

Traditional cuisine is very colorful with red and green peppers and cilantro.  Traditional cuisine consists of rice, beans, [[tostones]] (known as ''fritos'') and a meat like chicharr\u00f3n de pollo (deep-fried chicken), [[Mang\u00fa (dish)|Mang\u00fa]] (mashed green plantains served with saut\u00e9ed onion), slices of avocado, fried eggs, salami, empanadas and pastelitos (fried meat pies), and sancocho (stew of meats, potatoes, and vegetables).<ref name=\"test\">[Stone, John H.

Desserts include flan, bread pudding, rice pudding, and tres leches.  Dominican restaurant owners in the diasporic community really aim to conserve the taste of the mainland as they feel that is what immigrants seek out when looking for authentic Dominican cuisine.<ref name=\"test1\">[\"Health, Culture and Cuisine in the Dominican American Community.\" Personal interview. March 27, 2013.</ref>\n\nAchieving that taste is not hard in the United States as most grocery stores stock Dominican, Puerto Rican and other Latin American products made by [[Goya Foods]].  Dominican Americans take pride in their food from their homeland and they use it as a symbol in times of celebration.  For example, when the Dominican Republic won the World Cup of Baseball, Dominican Americans cheered carrying plantains.<ref name=\"test1\" />\n\nThe experience of Dominican-American cuisine goes beyond the consumption of the food, however. It is vitally integrated into the everyday culture of the Dominican-American community.

The term ''Schwarz'' (black) pointed out the ideological distance of the company from the large peasant army at that time, which called itself the ''Heller Haufen'' (''Hell'' meaning \"light-colored\"). The German word ''[[Haufen]]'' was the name the peasants gave to their armed companies.\n\nIt was never used again for an army, possibly because the word ''Haufen'' means \"heap\" in German and was used to refer to loosely organised armed rabbles.\n\n==Formation==\nThe Black Company was formed in 1525 in [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber|Rothenburg]], out of local, home guard farmers - maybe 600 men - and a company of mercenary [[knights]].\n\nThe leader of the Black Company, at least nominally, was nobleman [[Florian Geyer]].\n\nGeyer managed to shape the Black Company into something like a company of real soldiers, instead of just an armed mob. Some of the knights were probably his [[vassal]]s.\n\n==History==\nAfter the Company took over the area around Rothenburg, it proceeded to [[Swabia]] to destroy fortified monasteries and castles and prevent their becoming strongholds of the [[Swabian League]]. Those who didn't attack the Black Company were left unharmed during these actions. But in [[Sweinsburg]], Swabia, another company, led by peasant leader [[:de:J\u00e4cklein Rohrbach|Jaecklein Rohrbach]], executed about 50 local knights after they had opened fire on two negotiators. Geyer disapproved of this slaughtering and moved his troops back to [[Franconia]] to continue the fight. But Rohrbach's action had sealed the fate of captured peasants and of Geyer's men. From that time on, the ''Truchsess'' (\"[[Steward (office)|Steward]]\") of [[Waldburg]], commander of the Swabian League, showed little mercy to the Black Company and hunted them down ruthlessly throughout Swabia. Rohrbach himself was [[burned alive]] when he was captured in 1525.\n\nIn the Battle of Ingolstadt, in May 1525, the Black Company found itself alone against the forces of the [[Swabian League]] after its allies had been destroyed.  The Black Company fought its way back to [[Ingolstadt]] and occupied the ruins of the castle, the main buildings of which the members of the Company had themselves burned down some months before. The troops of the League encircled the castle and started their attack. The castle's occupants fought off two assaults but during the third attack, and after the League's heavy artillery breached the massive walls, they were killed.\n\nGeyer himself wasn't there during the last battle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} He waited for an escort in Rothenburg, but was banned from the city before it arrived. Geyer traveled North and was robbed and killed by two servants of his brother-in-law [[Wilhelm von Grumbach]]  in the night of June 9\u201310 in the forest near [[Rimpar]].\n\n==Legacy==\nThe Black Company has remained very popular to the present day, although Swabian rulers did everything to nullify its fame in the years after the uprising, through publishing a number of  \"facts\" about the crimes the peasants supposedly had committed.\n\nThe song \"''Wir sind des Geyers schwarzer Haufen''{{-\"}} (\"We Are Geyer's Black Company\") is still found in many German songbooks today.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Peasants' Revolt|Peasants' Revolt, England, 1381]]\n*[[Popular revolt in late-medieval Europe]]\n*[[List of peasant revolts]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{no footnotes|date=February 2015}}\n*[[Friedrich Engels|Engels, Friedrich]].

However, restoration work in 1904\u20131905 caused the removal of overpainting that revealed a hand holding [[sheet music]]. This indicated that the sitter may be a musician, a theory that is widely accepted today.\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary accounts or even records of a [[commission (art)|commission]] of any kind exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured him at least a partial attribution. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff, rigid and lifeless qualities of the figure's body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars have explainsd this to be because most of the body was likely done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait represents the distinct dark background portrait style of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has sat in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672.\n\nThe uncertainty over who the subject is has caused many Italian musicians and politicians to be proposed as the young man. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor at the time of the painting's creation.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} The portrait depicts a young man in a bust length, three-quarter position while his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]], from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}\n\n===The musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|350px|Detail of the musical score]]\nThe man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} He wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint]]ed brownish-orange [[Academic stole|stole]].{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}} The mouth hints at the start of a smile or suggests that perhaps the man is about to sing or has just sung.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. The light causes both eyes to be dilated but the left eye to a far greater extent than the right, something that is not humanly possible. Some defend Leonardo, claiming that this is simply for dramatic effect, so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=239}}\n\n===The musical score===\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper is held in an odd and delicate manner and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}} But since comparisons of Leonardo's notation of music from drawings{{#tag:ref|Drawings that are kept in the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]], to be exact.|group=n}} does not resemble that of the painting, he is probably not the author, leaving the author and the significance of the music, unknown.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and date===\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.{{sfn|Kemp|2003}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}} This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Wallace}} But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|left|200px|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician''.]]\t\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].{{sfnRef|Kemp|2003}} The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this refined and articulate dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}}\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to stay in Milan and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before then are unknown but the portrait bears the description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but was thought to be a portrait by Leonardo, of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} These assumptions were taken to be true without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding some kind of [[sheet music|musical score]],{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.{{sfn|Z\u00f6llner|2015|p=45}} Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Possible subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''. Left by [[Francesco Napoletano|Napoletano]] and right by [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]].}}\nAfter [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding some kind of [[sheet music|musical score]],{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} the man was widely declared to be a musician of some sort.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}}{{sfn|Z\u00f6llner|2015|p=45}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} While the subject's identity is uncertain, the subject himself may appear in other works. Scholars at the [[National Gallery]] have suggested that [[Francesco Napoletano]]'s drawing of ''Portrait of a Youth in Profile'' and Leonardo's drawing of a ''Bust of a Youth in Profile'' depict the same figure as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|National Gallery|2011|p=5}} However the identity of the sitter himself remains unknown and not only have various candidates been proposed but even the idea that the subject is simply anonymous has also been explored.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n===Franchinus Gaffurius===\nThroughout the 20th century, the leading candidate, suggested by [[Luca Beltrami]] in 1906, was [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], priest, music theorist, court musician for [[Ludovico Sforza]] and after January 1848, ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' of [[Milan Cathedral]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} Gaffurius and Leonardo were known to have been friends, both entering the Duke's service only a year or two apart from each other. In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=31}} Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This has been suggested to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} The issues that have since discredited this theory are the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no physical descriptions from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Also, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to be the young man of the painting.{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\n\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\nSince Pietro C. Marani's suggestion in 2000,{{sfn|Marani|2000|p=165}} [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[lute|lutist]], actor, lyricist and singer, has been the most widely accepted identity of the musician.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} In 1482, Migliarotti and Leonardo left [[Florence]] together for [[Milan]] to serve in the court of [[Ludovico Sforza]], the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]].{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} Furthermore, Leonardo is thought to have taught Migliarotti the [[lute]] and [[lyre]] and known to be friends.{{sfn|Harr\u00e1n|2001}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{#tag:ref|This was claimed by [[Anonimo Gaddiano]], one of the earliest biographers of Leonardo Da Vinci.|group=n}} During the painting's conception, Migliarotti would have been in his late teens or early twenties{{#tag:ref|His age being 19\u201324 depending on the accepted year as 1485\u20131490.|group=n}} making him a fitting candidate to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, in a 1482 inventory from the [[Codex Atlanticus]]{{#tag:ref|Folio 888 recto (ex 324 recto) to be exact.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}} Leonardo listed \"a portrait of Atalante with his face raised.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{#tag:ref|Alternatively translated as: \"a portrait of Atalante with his upturned face.\"{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} or \"a head portrayed from Atalante who raises his face.\"{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}|group=n}} This has been considered by many to have been some kind of study or start of the later ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} The only issues with this theory are that the subject's face is not raised, as Leonardo wrote in his notes, and this note was written 3 years prior to the earliest estimated date of completion{{#tag:ref|The earliest being 1485 with the latest at 1490.|group=n}} for the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} However, these are by no means outstanding issues, as Leonardo was known to often make numerous revisions and take many years to complete a painting{{#tag:ref|Often, like ''The Portrait of a Musician'', not even finishing his paintings.{{sfn|Cotter|2019}}|group=n}} therefore, since the widespread rejection of Franchinus Gaffurius as the leading candidate, Migliarotti is now considered the most likely.{{sfn|Kalb|2019}}{{sfn|Selvaggio|2018}}{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}\n\n===Josquin des Prez===\nIn 1972, [[Josquin des Prez]], French singer and composer, was suggested as the subject by [[Belgian]] musicologist, Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Josquin worked in the service of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] during various periods of the 1480s,{{#tag:ref|Either 1483 or 1484 as well as 1489.{{sfn|Macey|2001}} consequently working at the same time as Leonardo.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune proposed that the words on the [[sheet music|musical score]] where the abbreviations of \"Cont,\" \"Cantuz,\" and \"A Z\" appear in reference to the words \"[[Contratenor]],\" \"Cantuz\" and [[Alto|Altuz]]. She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}{{#tag:ref|With Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix'' suggested as a piece that exemplifies this.|group=n}} This theory has since been strongly discredited due to the notation in the painting being largely illegible and the fact that many composers of the time were writing the same forms in the same manner that was suggested to indicate specifically Josquin.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues as those of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making the young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]] unlikely to be Josquin.{{sfnRef|Macey|2001}}\n\n===Gaspar Van Weerbeke===\nLaure Fagnart suggested most recently in 2019 that the sitter's identity is, [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, where they likely knew each other due to their shared employer.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}} This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is too vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n===Other candidates===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}} [[Francesco Canova da Milano]], an Italian [[lute]]nist and composer, has also been suggested as the subject since he was an important musician also working in [[Milan]] when Leonardo was there. However, there is no uncircumstantial evidence to support this claim.{{sfn|Wallace}} [[Siegfried Woldhek]], a Dutch illustrator, has claimed that ''Portrait of a Musician'' is one of three self portraits by Leonardo.{{sfn|Woldhek|2008}}\nIt is worth noting that this claim is considered highly improbable.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nWhile the lack of contemporary records of the portrait have prevented the understanding of the origin and purpose of the painting, scholars have proposed various theories. \n\nVarious scholars propose that the tension in the subject's face is due to intense thought on music that was either just performed, about to be performed or being performed.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} The painting has also been proposed as representative of Leonardo's self proclaimed ideology in the superiority of painting over other art forms like [[poetry]], [[sculpture]] and [[music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}} Leonardo famously declared in the beginning of his uncompleted ''[[A Treatise on Painting|Libro de pittura]]'', \n\n{{Quote\n|text=How Music Ought to be Called the Sister and Junior to Painting. Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThe preceding excerpt disapproves of music for its inability to stay in existence after a performance, unlike painting where once a painting is crafted it is seemingly there forever. This theory would suggest that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}}\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was a personal gift for a close friend.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commission a portrait himself.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n'''Books'''\n*{{cite book\n |last1=Clark\n |first1=Kenneth\n |authorlink1=Kenneth Clark\n |last2=Kemp\n |first2=Martin\n |authorlink2=Martin Kemp (art historian)\n |year=1989\n |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Revised Edition\n |edition=2nd\n |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]]\n |language=English\n |location=City of Westminster, London, England\n |isbn=978-0140169829\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXifCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PR99&dq=martin%20kemp%20%22portrait%20of%20a%20musician%22&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false\n |ref={{sfnRef|Clark|1989}}\n }}\n\n*{{cite book\n |last=Fagnart\n |first=Laure\n |editor-first1=Lindmayr-Brandl\n |editor-last1=Andrea\n |editor-last2=Kolb\n |editor-first2=Paul\n |year=2019\n |chapter=Gaspar Depicted?

However, restoration work in 1904\u20131905 caused the removal of overpainting that revealed a hand holding [[sheet music]]. This indicated that the sitter may be a musician, a theory that is widely accepted today.\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary accounts or even records of a [[commission (art)|commission]] of any kind exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured him at least a partial attribution. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff, rigid and lifeless qualities of the figure's body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars have explainsd this to be because most of the body was likely done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait represents the distinct dark background portrait style of Leonardo's time in Milan. [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]] are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has sat in the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672.\n\nThe uncertainty over who the subject is has caused many Italian musicians and politicians to be proposed as the young man. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor at the time of the painting's creation.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} The portrait depicts a young man in a bust length, three-quarter position while his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]], from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}\n\n===The musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|350px|Detail of the musical score]]\nThe man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} He wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint]]ed brownish-orange [[Academic stole|stole]].{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}} The mouth hints at the start of a smile or suggests that perhaps the man is about to sing or has just sung.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. The light causes both eyes to be dilated but the left eye to a far greater extent than the right, something that is not humanly possible. Some defend Leonardo, claiming that this is simply for dramatic effect, so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=239}}\n\n===The musical score===\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper is held in an odd and delicate manner and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} The notes are also undoubtedly in measural notation and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}} But since comparisons of Leonardo's notation of music from drawings{{#tag:ref|Drawings that are kept in the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]], to be exact.|group=n}} does not resemble that of the painting, he is probably not the author, leaving the author and the significance of the music, unknown.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and date===\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.{{sfn|Kemp|2003}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}} This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Wallace}} But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|left|200px|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician''.]]\t\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and [[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]] respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as [[Lady with an Ermine]] and [[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]].{{sfnRef|Kemp|2003}} The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the Portrait of a Musician is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later Lady with an Ermine, from 1489-1490, is representative of this refined and articulate dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such [[Virgin of the Rocks]] and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}}\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to stay in Milan and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before then are unknown but the portrait bears the description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]] but was thought to be a portrait by Leonardo, of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} These assumptions were taken to be true without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding some kind of [[sheet music|musical score]],{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.{{sfn|Z\u00f6llner|2015|p=45}} Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Possible subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

Scholars at the [[National Gallery]] have suggested that [[Francesco Napoletano]]'s drawing of ''Portrait of a Youth in Profile'' and Leonardo's drawing of a ''Bust of a Youth in Profile'' depict the same figure as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|National Gallery|2011|p=5}} However the identity of the sitter himself remains unknown and not only have various candidates been proposed but even the idea that the subject is simply anonymous has also been explored.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n===Franchinus Gaffurius===\nThroughout the 20th century, the leading candidate, suggested by [[Luca Beltrami]] in 1906, was [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], priest, music theorist, court musician for [[Ludovico Sforza]] and after January 1848, ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' of [[Milan Cathedral]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} Gaffurius and Leonardo were known to have been friends, both entering the Duke's service only a year or two apart from each other. In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=31}} Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This has been suggested to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} The issues that have since discredited this theory are the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no physical descriptions from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Also, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to be the young man of the painting.{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\n\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\nSince Pietro C.

She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}{{#tag:ref|With Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix'' suggested as a piece that exemplifies this.|group=n}} This theory has since been strongly discredited due to the notation in the painting being largely illegible and the fact that many composers of the time were writing the same forms in the same manner that was suggested to indicate specifically Josquin.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues as those of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making the young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]] unlikely to be Josquin.{{sfnRef|Macey|2001}}\n\n===Gaspar Van Weerbeke===\nLaure Fagnart suggested most recently in 2019 that the sitter's identity is, [[Gaspar Van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, where they likely knew each other due to their shared employer.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}} This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is too vague to defiantly link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n===Other candidates===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freeart.com/artwork/art-print/leonardo-da-vinci-portrait-of-unknown_fan22837019.html |title=Leonardo da Vinci, portrait of unknown musician, perhaps Franchino Gaffurio or Galeazzo di Sanseverino.

Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a har-mony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-92)\n}}\n\nThe preceding excerpt disapproves of music for its inability to stay in existence after a performance, unlike painting where once a painting is crafted it is seemingly there forever. This theory would suggest that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}}\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, is that it was a personal gift for a close friend.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commission a portrait himself.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n'''Books'''\n*{{cite book\n |last1=Clark\n |first1=Kenneth\n |authorlink1=Kenneth Clark\n |last2=Kemp\n |first2=Martin\n |authorlink2=Martin Kemp (art historian)\n |year=1989\n |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Revised Edition\n |edition=2nd\n |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]]\n |language=English\n |location=City of Westminster, London, England\n |isbn=978-0140169829\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXifCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PR99&dq=martin%20kemp%20%22portrait%20of%20a%20musician%22&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false\n |ref={{sfnRef|Clark|1989}}\n }}\n\n*{{cite book\n |last=Fagnart\n |first=Laure\n |editor-first1=Lindmayr-Brandl\n |editor-last1=Andrea\n |editor-last2=Kolb\n |editor-first2=Paul\n |year=2019\n |chapter=Gaspar Depicted?

Intrigued, he decided to teach her to communicate through pictures and writing letters in the dirt.<ref name=\"Alice Cogswell: An Inspiration\">{{cite web|last=Jay|first=Michelle|title=Alice Cogswell: An Inspiration|url=http://ifmyhandscouldspeak.wordpress.com/2009/05/27/alice-cogswell-an-inspiration/|work=If My Hands Could Speak|publisher=Start ASL|accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref>  He and Alice's father, Dr. [[Mason Fitch Cogswell|Mason Cogswell]], decided that a formal school would be best for her, but no such school existed in the United States. Gallaudet went to Europe for 15 months, bringing [[Laurent Clerc]] back with him upon his return. During the time of his absence, Alice attended a hearing school and somewhat furthered her education, though the situation was not ideal. She was very lively, and enjoyed reading, sewing, and dancing. She was reportedly very good at mimicking others, and was fascinated by the concept of music.<ref name=\"Alice Cogswell | Deaf Is\">{{cite web|title=Alice Cogswell|url=http://www.deafis.org/history/who/alice.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211223650/http://www.deafis.org/history/who/alice.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 February 2008|work=Deaf Is|publisher=American School for the Deaf|accessdate=22 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlice Cogswell and six other deaf students (Alice Cogswell, George Loring, Wilson Whiton, Abigail Dillingham, Otis Waters, John Brewster, and Nancy Orr.) entered the school that would become the American School for the Deaf in April 1817.\n\nCogswell died at the age of twenty-five on December 30, 1830, twenty days after the death of her father.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Thomas and Alice, Gallaudet University.jpg|thumb|right|\"Thomas and Alice\" at Gallaudet University|<center>\"Thomas and Alice\" at Gallaudet University</center>]]\nOn the campus of the [[American School for the Deaf]] at Hartford stands a statue of Gallaudet and Cogswell.
