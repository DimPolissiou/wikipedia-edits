He was the leader of Germany, holding the titles [[Chancellor of Germany#Chancellor of the Third Reich (1933\u20131945)|Chancellor of Germany]] from 1933 to 1945, and served as [[head of state]] as ''[[F\u00fchrer]] und Reichskanzler'' from 1934 to 1945. He is noted for his central role in the rise of [[nazism]] in Germany, provoking the start of [[World War II]], and the death of millions of people in [[the Holocaust]].\n\nThe family has long been of interest to historians and [[genealogist]]s because of the biological uncertainty of Hitler's paternal grandfather as well as the family's inter-relationships and their psychological effect on Hitler during his childhood and later life.\n\n==Etymology==\nBefore the birth of Adolf Hitler the [[German name#Nachname|family surname]] had many variations that were often used almost interchangeably. Some of the common variants were Hitler, Hiedler, H\u00fcttler, Hytler, and Hittler. The name may be a spelling variation of the name ''Hiedler'', meaning one who resides by a ''Hiedl''\u2014in [[Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian dialects]] a term for a subterranean fountain or river.<ref>Udolph, J\u00fcrgen Udolph & Fitzek, Sebastian (2005) ''Professor Udolphs Buch der Namen: Woher sie kommen, was sie bedeuten'' Munich: C.

This couple had at least three children, Lorenz (1800\u20131861), Johann Georg (baptised 28 February 1792 \u2013 9 February 1857), and Johann Nepomuk (19 March 1807 \u2013 17 September 1888). Johann Georg was the stepfather of Alois Hitler, who was Adolf Hitler's father, and Johan Nepomuk was the future F\u00fchrer's maternal great-grandfather. There is no additional information about Lorenz Hiedler.<ref name=TreeExamples/> The Hiedlers were from [[Weitra#Geography|Spital]], part of [[Weitra]] in Austria.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=3\u20135}}\n\n===Johann Georg and Johann Nepomuk===\nBrothers [[Johann Georg Hiedler|Johann Georg]] and [[Johann Nepomuk Hiedler]] are associated with Adolf Hitler in several ways, although the biological relationship is disputed.\n\nJohann Georg was legitimized and considered the officially accepted paternal grandfather of Hitler by [[Nazi Germany]]. Whether he was actually Hitler's biological paternal grandfather remains unknown.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=4}} He married his first wife in 1824, but she died in childbirth five months later. In 1842, he married [[Maria Schicklgruber|Maria Anna Schicklgruber]] (15 April 1795 \u2013 7 January 1847) and became the legal stepfather to her illegitimate five-year-old son, [[Alois Hitler|Alois]].\n\nAround age 10, near the time of his mother's death, Alois went to live with Johann Nepomuk on his farm.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=5}} Johann Nepomuk Hiedler (also known as Johann Nepomuk H\u00fcttler) was named after a [[Bohemian]] [[saint]], [[John of Nepomuk|Johann von Nepomuk]], an important saint for Bohemians of both German and [[Czech people|Czech]] ethnicity. Johann Nepomuk became a relatively prosperous farmer and was married to Eva Maria Decker (1792\u20131873), who was fifteen years his senior.\n\nThe Nazis issued a pamphlet during the 1932 second elections campaign titled \"Facts and Lies about Hitler\" which refuted the rumour spread by the S.P.D. and Center Party that Hitler had Czech ancestors.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/tatsachenundluegen.htm |title= Facts and Lies about Hitler |publisher= Nazi party |year= 1932}}</ref> There is no evidence that any of Hitler's known ancestors were of Czech origin.<ref>Hitler's Vienna: A Portrait of the Tyrant as a Young Man By Brigitte Hamann, page 42.</ref>\n\n===Father of Alois Hitler===\n[[File:Alois Hitler.jpeg|thumb|[[Alois Hitler]], Adolf's father.]]\n\nThe identity of the [[Alois Hitler#Biological father|biological father of Alois]] is disputed. Legally, [[Johann Georg Hiedler]], an itinerant miller, was the step-father of Alois Schicklgruber (later Alois Hitler), and Johann Georg's brother Johann Nepomuk Hiedler was therefore the step-uncle of Alois.<ref>Toland (1976), p.4</ref> Johann Nepomuk adopted Alois informally during Alois' childhood and raised him. It is possible that he was, in fact, the natural father of Alois but could not acknowledge this publicly due to his marriage. A perhaps simpler explanation is that he pitied the ten-year-old Alois after the death of the boy's mother [[Maria Anna Schicklgruber|Maria]], as it could hardly have been a suitable life for a ten-year-old child to be raised by an itinerant miller. Johann Nepomuk died on 17 September 1888 and willed Alois a considerable portion of his life savings.\n\nIt was later claimed that Johann Georg had fathered Alois prior to his marriage to Maria, although Alois had been declared illegitimate on his birth certificate and baptism papers. The claim that Johann Georg was the true father of Alois was not made during the lifetime of either Johann Georg or Maria. In 1877, 20 years after the death of Johann Georg and almost 30 years after the death of Maria, Alois was legally declared to have been Johann Georg's son. Johann Nepomuk arranged to change the surname of Alois to \"Hitler\" and to have Johann Georg declared the biological father of Alois in 1876. Johann Nepomuk collected three witnesses (his son-in-law and two others) who testified before a notary in Weitra that Johann Georg had several times stated in their presence that he was the actual father of Alois and wanted to make Alois his legitimate son and heir. The parish priest in [[D\u00f6llersheim]], where the original birth certificate of Alois resided, altered the birth register. Alois was 39 years old at the time and was well-known in the community as Alois Schicklgruber.<ref group=notes>Toland (1976), pp.4\u20135</ref>\n\nAccordingly, Johann Georg Hiedler is one of three people often cited as having possibly been the biological grandfather of Adolf Hitler. The other two are Johann Nepomuk and a [[Graz]] Jew by the name of Leopold Frankenberger (rumored by ex-Nazi [[Hans Frank]] during the [[Nuremberg Trials]]). In the 1950s, the third possibility became popular among historians, but modern historians have concluded that Frank's speculation has no factual support. Frank said that Maria came from \"Leonding near Linz\", when in fact she came from the hamlet of Strones, near the village of D\u00f6llersheim. No evidence has ever been found that a \"Frankenberger\" lived in the area; the Jews were expelled from Styria (which includes Graz) during the 15th century and were not permitted to return until the 1860s, several decades after the birth of Alois.<ref name=\"HamannMommsen2010\">{{cite book|author1=Hamann, Brigitte|author2=Mommsen, Hans|lastauthoramp=yes|authorlink1=Brigitte Hamann|authorlink2=Hans Mommsen|title=Hitler's Vienna: A Portrait of the Tyrant As a Young Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUBhhKDkn1sC&pg=PA50|date=3 August 2010|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|isbn=978-1-84885-277-8|pages=50\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"McKale2011\">{{cite book|author=McKale, DOnald|title=Nazis After Hitler: How Perpetrators of the Holocaust Cheated Justice and Truth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=paOLRR7q15wC&pg=PA147|date=16 December 2011|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-1318-0|pages=147\u2013}}</ref><ref group=notes>See Toland (1976), pp.246\u201347; Kershaw (1999), pp.8\u20139.

Kershaw concludes that, whoever the actual father of Alois may have been, he was not a Jew from Graz.</ref> Although Alois was legitimized and Johann Georg was considered the officially accepted paternal grandfather of Hitler by the Third Reich, whether he was Hitler's biological grandfather remains unknown, which has caused speculation.<ref group=notes>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41757713.html |title= Hitler \u2013 No proof of Aryan descent |work=Der Spiegel |quote=It is clear that Adolf Hitler could hardly have been able to provide proof of Aryan ancestry, which he demanded of most Germans, for his own person.

She lived her entire life there and was married to Johann Baptist P\u00f6lzl (1825\u20131901), a farmer and son of Johann P\u00f6lzl and Juliana (Walli) P\u00f6lzl. Johanna and Johann had 5 sons and 6 daughters, of whom 2 sons and 3 daughters survived into adulthood, the 3 daughters being [[Klara Hitler|Klara]], Johanna, and Theresia. Klara's brothers' identities are unknown.\n\n===1870s===\n{{main|Alois Hitler}}\nAt the age of 36, Alois Hitler was married for the first time, to Anna Glasl-H\u00f6rer, who was a wealthy, 50-year-old daughter of a customs official. She was sick when Alois married her and was either an invalid or became one soon afterwards. Not long after marrying her, Alois Hitler began an affair with 19-year-old Franziska \"Fanni\" Matzelsberger, one of the young female servants employed at the Pommer Inn, house No. 219, in the city of [[Braunau am Inn]], where he was renting the top floor as a lodging. Smith states that Alois had numerous affairs during the 1870s, resulting in his wife initiating legal action; on 7 November 1880 Alois and Anna separated by mutual agreement. Matzelsberger became the 43-year-old Hitler's girlfriend, but the two could not marry since by [[Roman Catholic]] canon law divorce is not permitted.\n\n===1880s===\n[[File:Klara Polz Hitler.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Klara Hitler|Klara P\u00f6lzl Hitler]], third wife of Alois and mother of Adolf.]]\n\nOn 13 January 1882, Matzelsberger gave birth to Hitler's illegitimate son, also named Alois, but since they were not married, the child was Alois Matzelsberger. Hitler remained with Matzelsberger while his wife, Anna, grew sicker and died on 6 April 1883. The next month, on 22 May at a ceremony in Braunau with fellow customs officials as witnesses, Hitler, age 45, married Matzelsberger, age 21.

When she was still only 23 years old, she acquired a lung disorder and became too ill to function. She was relocated to Ranshofen, a small village near Braunau.\n\nIn 1876, three years after Alois married Anna Glasl-H\u00f6rer, he hired [[Klara P\u00f6lzl]] as a household servant. She was the 16-year-old granddaughter of his step-uncle (and possible biological uncle or father) Johann Nepomuk Hiedler. Matzelsberger demanded that the \"servant girl\" Klara find another job, and Hitler sent P\u00f6lzl away. During the last months of Matzelsberger's life, Klara P\u00f6lzl returned to the home of Alois to care for the invalid and their two children.<ref name=Langer114>Langer, Walter (1972). ''The Mind of Adolf Hitler'', New York, p. 114</ref> Matzelsberger died in Ranshofen on 10 August 1884 at the age of 23. After her death, P\u00f6lzl remained in Hitler's home as housekeeper.<ref name=Langer114/>\n\nP\u00f6lzl was soon pregnant by Alois. If Johann Georg Hiedler was the  father of Alois, she was the first cousin once removed of Alois; if Johann Nepomuk was the father of Alois, Klara was the half-niece of Alois. Smith writes that if Alois had been free to do as he wished, he would have married P\u00f6lzl immediately, but because of the affidavit concerning his paternity, Hitler was now legally P\u00f6lzl's first cousin once removed, too close to marry. He submitted an appeal to the church for a humanitarian waiver.<ref group=notes>Alois petitioned the church for an episcopal dispensation citing \"bilateral affinity in the third degree touching the second\" to describe his rather complicated family relationship to Klara. The local bishop apparently believed this relationship was too close to approve on his own authority, so he forwarded the petition to Rome on behalf of Alois, seeking instead a papal dispensation, which was approved before the birth of the couple's first child. ''See'' [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/r/rosenbaum-hitler.html Rosenblum article].</ref> Permission was granted, and on 7 January 1885 a wedding was performed in Hitler's rented rooms on the top floor of the Pommer Inn. A meal was served for the few guests and witnesses. Hitler then went to work for the rest of the day. Even Klara found the wedding to be a brief ceremony. Throughout the marriage, she continued to call him ''uncle''.\n\nOn 17 May 1885, five months after the wedding, the new Frau Klara Hitler gave birth to her first child, Gustav. A year later, on 25 September 1886, she gave birth to a daughter, Ida. During the winter of 1887\u20138, [[diphtheria]] caused the deaths of both Gustav (8 December) and Ida (2 January). Klara and Alois had been married for three years, and all their children were dead, but Alois still had the children from his relationship with Matzelsberger, Alois Jr. and Angela. On 20 April 1889, Klara gave birth to Adolf.\n\n===1890s===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0322-506, Adolf Hitler, Kinderbild.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Infant Adolf, son of Alois and Klara.]]\nAdolf was a sickly child, and his mother fretted over him. Alois, who was 51 years old when Adolf was born, had little interest in child rearing and left it to his wife. When not at work he was typically either in a tavern or busy with his hobby: [[apiculture|keeping bees]]. \n\nResearch during 2016 proved that Otto Hitler, a brother long thought to have been born before Adolf in 1887,<ref>{{cite book | last = Kershaw | first = Ian | title = Hitler: A Biography | publisher = W.

He was 55, Klara 32, Alois Jr. 10, Angela 9, and Adolf 3 years old. In 1894, Alois Hitler was reassigned to [[Linz]]. Klara gave birth to their fifth child, Edmund, on 24 March 1894, and it was decided that she and the children would stay in Passau for the time being.\n\nDuring February 1895, Alois Hitler purchased a house on a 3.6 hectare (9-acre) plot in Hafeld near [[Lambach]], approximately 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of [[Linz]]. The farm was called the Rauscher Gut. He relocated his family to the farm and retired on 25 June 1895 at the age of 58 after 40 years in the customs service. He found farming difficult; he lost money, and the value of the property decreased. On 21 January 1896, his daughter [[Paula Hitler|Paula]] was born. Alois was often home with his family. He had five children ranging in age from infancy to 14; Smith suggests he yelled at the children frequently and made long visits to the local tavern. Robert G. L. Waite noted, \"Even one of his closest friends admitted that Alois was 'awfully rough' with his wife Klara and hardly ever spoke a word to her at home. If Hitler was in a bad mood, he picked on the older children or Klara herself, in front of the rest.\"\n\nAfter Alois and Alois Jr had a violent argument, Alois Jr left home at 14, and the elder Alois swore he would never give the boy any inheritance more than what the law required. Apparently Alois Jr's relations with his stepmother Klara were also difficult. After working as an apprentice waiter in the [[Shelbourne Hotel]] in Dublin, Ireland, Alois Jr was arrested for theft and served a five-month sentence during 1900, followed by a nine-month sentence during 1902.\n\n===1900s===\nEdmund, the youngest Hitler boy, died of [[measles]] on 2 February 1900. Alois wanted his son Adolf to seek a career with the civil service. According to various interpretations, Adolf disliked the thought of a career spent enforcing petty rules, and was perhaps so alienated from his father that he was repulsed by whatever Alois wanted. Alois tried to intimidate his son into obedience, but Adolf refused.\n\nAlois Hitler died in 1903, leaving Klara a government pension. She sold the house in [[Leonding]] and relocated with young Adolf and Paula to an apartment in [[Linz]], where they lived frugally. By 1907, Klara had become very ill due to breast cancer. Adolf wept when told by her doctor [[Eduard Bloch]] that his mother \"had little chance of surviving\".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=13, 14}} Despite continued medical treatment by Dr. Bloch, Klara's condition did not improve and in October, he told Adolf her condition was hopeless. Klara died at home in Linz on 21 December 1907. Adolf and Paula were left with some financial assistance from their mother's pension and her modest estate of about 2,000 Kronen, after the medical and funeral costs were paid.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=15, 16}} Klara was buried in [[Leonding]]. Hitler had a good relationship with his mother during her lifetime. He was distraught by her death and possibly grieved for the rest of his life. Speaking of Hitler, Bloch later recalled that after Klara's death he had never seen \"anyone so prostrate with grief\". Hitler wrote years later that his mother's death was a \" 'dreadful blow' \".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=15, 16}}\n\nOn 14 September 1903<ref>{{Cite book | last=Hauner | first=Milan | author2= | title=Hitler: a chronology of his life and time | year=1983 | publisher=Macmillan | location=London | isbn=0-333-30983-9 | pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Zdral | first=Wolfgang | author2= | title=Die Hitlers | date= | publisher=Campus Verlag GmbH | location= | isbn=3-593-37457-9 | page=104}}</ref> Angela Hitler, Adolf's half-sister, married Leo Raubal (11 June 1879 \u2013 10 August 1910), a junior tax inspector, and on 12 October 1906 she gave birth to a son, [[Leo Rudolf Raubal Jr|Leo]].

They eloped to London and married on 3 June 1910. William Dowling, Bridget's father, threatened to have Alois arrested for [[kidnapping]], but Bridget dissuaded him. The couple settled in [[Liverpool]], where their son [[William Patrick Hitler]] was born in 1911. The family lived in a flat at 102 Upper Stanhope Street. The house was destroyed in the last German [[Liverpool Blitz|air-raid on Liverpool]] on 10 January 1942. Nothing remains of the house or those that surrounded it, and the area was eventually cleared and grassed over. Bridget Dowling's memoirs claim Hitler lived with them in Liverpool from 1912 to 1913 while he was on the run to avoid being [[conscription|conscripted]] in his native [[Austria-Hungary]], but most historians dismiss this story as a fiction invented to make the book more appealing to publishers.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060410154654/http://www.iol.ie/~irishrts/Sample%20Hitler%20His%20Irish%20Relatives.htm \"Hitler: His Irish Relatives\"], by Tony McCarthy in ''Irish Roots'' magazine.

His older son, [[William Patrick Hitler|William Patrick]], stayed with Alois and his new family during his early trips to [[Weimar Republic]] Germany in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nWhen Adolf was confined in [[Landsberg Prison|Landsberg]], Angela travelled from Vienna to visit him. Angela's daughters, Geli and Elfriede, accompanied their mother when she became Hitler's housekeeper in 1925; [[Geli Raubal]] was 17 at the time and would spend the next six years in close contact with her half-uncle.{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=393}} Her mother was given a job as housekeeper at the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] villa near [[Berchtesgaden]] in 1928.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=177}} Geli relocated into Hitler's [[Munich]] apartment in 1929 when she enrolled in the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilian University]] to study medicine.

Angela and Adolf became estranged after she disapproved of Adolf's relationship with Eva Braun, but eventually re-established communication during the war. Angela was his intermediary to the rest of the family, because Adolf did not want communication with them. During 1941, she sold her memoirs of her years with Hitler to the [[Eher Verlag]], which brought her 20,000 [[Reichsmark]]. Meanwhile, Alois Jr. continued to manage his restaurant throughout the duration of the war. He was arrested later by the British, but released when it became evident he had no role in his brother's regime.\n\nA couple of Adolf's relatives served in Nazi Germany during the war. Adolf's nephew Heinz was a member of the Nazi Party. He attended an elite military academy, the [[National Political Institutes of Education]] (Napola) in [[Ballenstedt]]/[[Saxony-Anhalt]]{{ref label|interrogation|1|b}}. Aspiring to be an officer, Heinz joined the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|''Heer'' (army)]] as a signals NCO with the 23rd Potsdamer Artillery Regiment in 1941, and he participated with the invasion of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], [[Operation Barbarossa]].

He was dictator of Germany, holding the titles [[Chancellor of Germany#Chancellor of the Third Reich (1933\u20131945)|Chancellor of Germany]] from 1933 to 1945, and served as [[head of state]] as ''[[F\u00fchrer]] und Reichskanzler'' from 1934 to 1945. He is noted for his central role in the rise of [[nazism]] in Germany, provoking the start of [[World War II]], and the death of millions of people in [[the Holocaust]].\n\nThe family has long been of interest to historians and [[genealogist]]s because of the biological uncertainty of Hitler's paternal grandfather as well as the family's inter-relationships and their psychological effect on Hitler during his childhood and later life.\n\n==Etymology==\nBefore the birth of Adolf Hitler the [[German name#Nachname|family surname]] had many variations that were often used almost interchangeably. Some of the common variants were Hitler, Hiedler, H\u00fcttler, Hytler, and Hittler. The name may be a spelling variation of the name ''Hiedler'', meaning one who resides by a ''Hiedl''\u2014in [[Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian dialects]] a term for a subterranean fountain or river.<ref>Udolph, J\u00fcrgen Udolph & Fitzek, Sebastian (2005) ''Professor Udolphs Buch der Namen: Woher sie kommen, was sie bedeuten'' Munich: C. Bertelsmann.</ref> Or the ''Hitler'' surname may be based on \"one who lives in a hut\" (German ''H\u00fctte'' for \"hut\").<ref>Jetzinger, Franz (1976) [1956]. ''Hitler's Youth''. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, p.32. {{ISBN|978-0-8371-8617-7}}.</ref>  [[Alois Schicklgruber]] (Adolf's father) changed his surname on 7 January 1877 to \"Hitler\", which was the only form of the last name that Adolf used.<ref name=TreeExamples>''See, e.g.,'' Adolf Hitler's online family tree (1998, drawn by Jennifer Rosenberg) at about.com, [http://history1900s.about.com/library/holocaust/nhitanc.htm Online Family Tree]. Family trees can also be found in various Hitler biographies; e.g. see Toland (1976), pp.10\u201311; Kershaw (1999), p.5.</ref>\n\n==Family history==\n===Earliest family members===\nThe known beginning of the Hitler family is with Stefan Hiedler (born 1672) and Agnes Capeller, whose grandson Martin Hiedler (17 November 1762 \u2013 10 January 1829) married Anna Maria G\u00f6schl (23 August 1760 \u2013 7 December 1854). This couple had at least three children, Lorenz (1800\u20131861), Johann Georg (baptised 28 February 1792 \u2013 9 February 1857), and Johann Nepomuk (19 March 1807 \u2013 17 September 1888). Johann Georg was the stepfather of Alois Hitler, who was Adolf Hitler's father, and Johan Nepomuk was the future F\u00fchrer's maternal great-grandfather. There is no additional information about Lorenz Hiedler.<ref name=TreeExamples/> The Hiedlers were from [[Weitra#Geography|Spital]], part of [[Weitra]] in Austria.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=3\u20135}}\n\n===Johann Georg and Johann Nepomuk===\nBrothers [[Johann Georg Hiedler|Johann Georg]] and [[Johann Nepomuk Hiedler]] are associated with Adolf Hitler in several ways, although the biological relationship is disputed.\n\nJohann Georg was legitimized and considered the officially accepted paternal grandfather of Hitler by [[Nazi Germany]]. Whether he was actually Hitler's biological paternal grandfather remains unknown.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=4}} He married his first wife in 1824, but she died in childbirth five months later. In 1842, he married [[Maria Schicklgruber|Maria Anna Schicklgruber]] (15 April 1795 \u2013 7 January 1847) and became the legal stepfather to her illegitimate five-year-old son, [[Alois Hitler|Alois]].\n\nAround age 10, near the time of his mother's death, Alois went to live with Johann Nepomuk on his farm.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=5}} Johann Nepomuk Hiedler (also known as Johann Nepomuk H\u00fcttler) was named after a [[Bohemian]] [[saint]], [[John of Nepomuk|Johann von Nepomuk]], an important saint for Bohemians of both German and [[Czech people|Czech]] ethnicity. Johann Nepomuk became a relatively prosperous farmer and was married to Eva Maria Decker (1792\u20131873), who was fifteen years his senior.\n\nThe Nazis issued a pamphlet during the 1932 second elections campaign titled \"Facts and Lies about Hitler\" which refuted the rumour spread by the S.P.D. and Center Party that Hitler had Czech ancestors.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/tatsachenundluegen.htm |title= Facts and Lies about Hitler |publisher= Nazi party |year= 1932}}</ref> There is no evidence that any of Hitler's known ancestors were of Czech origin.<ref>Hitler's Vienna: A Portrait of the Tyrant as a Young Man By Brigitte Hamann, page 42.</ref>\n\n===Father of Alois Hitler===\n[[File:Alois Hitler.jpeg|thumb|[[Alois Hitler]], Adolf's father.]]\n\nThe identity of the [[Alois Hitler#Biological father|biological father of Alois]] is disputed. Legally, [[Johann Georg Hiedler]], an itinerant miller, was the step-father of Alois Schicklgruber (later Alois Hitler), and Johann Georg's brother Johann Nepomuk Hiedler was therefore the step-uncle of Alois.<ref>Toland (1976), p.4</ref> Johann Nepomuk adopted Alois informally during Alois' childhood and raised him. It is possible that he was, in fact, the natural father of Alois but could not acknowledge this publicly due to his marriage. A perhaps simpler explanation is that he pitied the ten-year-old Alois after the death of the boy's mother [[Maria Anna Schicklgruber|Maria]], as it could hardly have been a suitable life for a ten-year-old child to be raised by an itinerant miller. Johann Nepomuk died on 17 September 1888 and willed Alois a considerable portion of his life savings.\n\nIt was later claimed that Johann Georg had fathered Alois prior to his marriage to Maria, although Alois had been declared illegitimate on his birth certificate and baptism papers. The claim that Johann Georg was the true father of Alois was not made during the lifetime of either Johann Georg or Maria. In 1877, 20 years after the death of Johann Georg and almost 30 years after the death of Maria, Alois was legally declared to have been Johann Georg's son. Johann Nepomuk arranged to change the surname of Alois to \"Hitler\" and to have Johann Georg declared the biological father of Alois in 1876. Johann Nepomuk collected three witnesses (his son-in-law and two others) who testified before a notary in Weitra that Johann Georg had several times stated in their presence that he was the actual father of Alois and wanted to make Alois his legitimate son and heir. The parish priest in [[D\u00f6llersheim]], where the original birth certificate of Alois resided, altered the birth register. Alois was 39 years old at the time and was well-known in the community as Alois Schicklgruber.<ref group=notes>Toland (1976), pp.4\u20135</ref>\n\nAccordingly, Johann Georg Hiedler is one of three people often cited as having possibly been the biological grandfather of Adolf Hitler. The other two are Johann Nepomuk and a [[Graz]] Jew by the name of Leopold Frankenberger (rumored by ex-Nazi [[Hans Frank]] during the [[Nuremberg Trials]]). In the 1950s, the third possibility became popular among historians, but modern historians have concluded that Frank's speculation has no factual support. Frank said that Maria came from \"Leonding near Linz\", when in fact she came from the hamlet of Strones, near the village of D\u00f6llersheim. No evidence has ever been found that a \"Frankenberger\" lived in the area; the Jews were expelled from Styria (which includes Graz) during the 15th century and were not permitted to return until the 1860s, several decades after the birth of Alois.<ref name=\"HamannMommsen2010\">{{cite book|author1=Hamann, Brigitte|author2=Mommsen, Hans|lastauthoramp=yes|authorlink1=Brigitte Hamann|authorlink2=Hans Mommsen|title=Hitler's Vienna: A Portrait of the Tyrant As a Young Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AUBhhKDkn1sC&pg=PA50|date=3 August 2010|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|isbn=978-1-84885-277-8|pages=50\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"McKale2011\">{{cite book|author=McKale, DOnald|title=Nazis After Hitler: How Perpetrators of the Holocaust Cheated Justice and Truth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=paOLRR7q15wC&pg=PA147|date=16 December 2011|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-1318-0|pages=147\u2013}}</ref><ref group=notes>See Toland (1976), pp.246\u201347; Kershaw (1999), pp.8\u20139.

Kershaw concludes that, whoever the actual father of Alois may have been, he was not a Jew from Graz.</ref> Although Alois was legitimized and Johann Georg was considered the officially accepted paternal grandfather of Hitler by the Third Reich, whether he was Hitler's biological grandfather remains unknown, which has caused speculation.<ref group=notes>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41757713.html |title= Hitler \u2013 No proof of Aryan descent |work=Der Spiegel |quote=It is clear that Adolf Hitler could hardly have been able to provide proof of Aryan ancestry, which he demanded of most Germans, for his own person.

She lived her entire life there and was married to Johann Baptist P\u00f6lzl (1825\u20131901), a farmer and son of Johann P\u00f6lzl and Juliana (Walli) P\u00f6lzl. Johanna and Johann had 5 sons and 6 daughters, of whom 2 sons and 3 daughters survived into adulthood, the 3 daughters being [[Klara Hitler|Klara]], Johanna, and Theresia. Klara's brothers' identities are unknown.\n\n===1870s===\n{{main|Alois Hitler}}\nAt the age of 36, Alois Hitler was married for the first time, to Anna Glasl-H\u00f6rer, who was a wealthy, 50-year-old daughter of a customs official. She was sick when Alois married her and was either an invalid or became one soon afterwards. Not long after marrying her, Alois Hitler began an affair with 19-year-old Franziska \"Fanni\" Matzelsberger, one of the young female servants employed at the Pommer Inn, house No. 219, in the city of [[Braunau am Inn]], where he was renting the top floor as a lodging. Smith states that Alois had numerous affairs during the 1870s, resulting in his wife initiating legal action; on 7 November 1880 Alois and Anna separated by mutual agreement. Matzelsberger became the 43-year-old Hitler's girlfriend, but the two could not marry since by [[Roman Catholic]] canon law divorce is not permitted.\n\n===1880s===\n[[File:Klara Polz Hitler.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Klara Hitler|Klara P\u00f6lzl Hitler]], third wife of Alois and mother of Adolf.]]\n\nOn 13 January 1882, Matzelsberger gave birth to Hitler's illegitimate son, also named Alois, but since they were not married, the child was Alois Matzelsberger. Hitler remained with Matzelsberger while his wife, Anna, grew sicker and died on 6 April 1883. The next month, on 22 May at a ceremony in Braunau with fellow customs officials as witnesses, Hitler, age 45, married Matzelsberger, age 21.

When she was still only 23 years old, she acquired a lung disorder and became too ill to function. She was relocated to Ranshofen, a small village near Braunau.\n\nIn 1876, three years after Alois married Anna Glasl-H\u00f6rer, he hired [[Klara P\u00f6lzl]] as a household servant. She was the 16-year-old granddaughter of his step-uncle (and possible biological uncle or father) Johann Nepomuk Hiedler. Matzelsberger demanded that the \"servant girl\" Klara find another job, and Hitler sent P\u00f6lzl away. During the last months of Matzelsberger's life, Klara P\u00f6lzl returned to the home of Alois to care for the invalid and their two children.<ref name=Langer114>Langer, Walter (1972). ''The Mind of Adolf Hitler'', New York, p. 114</ref> Matzelsberger died in Ranshofen on 10 August 1884 at the age of 23. After her death, P\u00f6lzl remained in Hitler's home as housekeeper.<ref name=Langer114/>\n\nP\u00f6lzl was soon pregnant by Alois. If Johann Georg Hiedler was the  father of Alois, she was the first cousin once removed of Alois; if Johann Nepomuk was the father of Alois, Klara was the half-niece of Alois. Smith writes that if Alois had been free to do as he wished, he would have married P\u00f6lzl immediately, but because of the affidavit concerning his paternity, Hitler was now legally P\u00f6lzl's first cousin once removed, too close to marry. He submitted an appeal to the church for a humanitarian waiver.<ref group=notes>Alois petitioned the church for an episcopal dispensation citing \"bilateral affinity in the third degree touching the second\" to describe his rather complicated family relationship to Klara. The local bishop apparently believed this relationship was too close to approve on his own authority, so he forwarded the petition to Rome on behalf of Alois, seeking instead a papal dispensation, which was approved before the birth of the couple's first child. ''See'' [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/r/rosenbaum-hitler.html Rosenblum article].</ref> Permission was granted, and on 7 January 1885 a wedding was performed in Hitler's rented rooms on the top floor of the Pommer Inn. A meal was served for the few guests and witnesses. Hitler then went to work for the rest of the day. Even Klara found the wedding to be a brief ceremony. Throughout the marriage, she continued to call him ''uncle''.\n\nOn 17 May 1885, five months after the wedding, the new Frau Klara Hitler gave birth to her first child, Gustav. A year later, on 25 September 1886, she gave birth to a daughter, Ida. During the winter of 1887\u20138, [[diphtheria]] caused the deaths of both Gustav (8 December) and Ida (2 January). Klara and Alois had been married for three years, and all their children were dead, but Alois still had the children from his relationship with Matzelsberger, Alois Jr. and Angela. On 20 April 1889, Klara gave birth to Adolf.\n\n===1890s===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0322-506, Adolf Hitler, Kinderbild.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Infant Adolf, son of Alois and Klara.]]\nAdolf was a sickly child, and his mother fretted over him. Alois, who was 51 years old when Adolf was born, had little interest in child rearing and left it to his wife. When not at work he was typically either in a tavern or busy with his hobby: [[apiculture|keeping bees]]. \n\nResearch during 2016 proved that Otto Hitler, a brother long thought to have been born before Adolf in 1887,<ref>{{cite book | last = Kershaw | first = Ian | title = Hitler: A Biography | publisher = W.

He was 55, Klara 32, Alois Jr. 10, Angela 9, and Adolf 3 years old. In 1894, Alois Hitler was reassigned to [[Linz]]. Klara gave birth to their fifth child, Edmund, on 24 March 1894, and it was decided that she and the children would stay in Passau for the time being.\n\nDuring February 1895, Alois Hitler purchased a house on a 3.6 hectare (9-acre) plot in Hafeld near [[Lambach]], approximately 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of [[Linz]]. The farm was called the Rauscher Gut. He relocated his family to the farm and retired on 25 June 1895 at the age of 58 after 40 years in the customs service. He found farming difficult; he lost money, and the value of the property decreased. On 21 January 1896, his daughter [[Paula Hitler|Paula]] was born. Alois was often home with his family. He had five children ranging in age from infancy to 14; Smith suggests he yelled at the children frequently and made long visits to the local tavern. Robert G. L. Waite noted, \"Even one of his closest friends admitted that Alois was 'awfully rough' with his wife Klara and hardly ever spoke a word to her at home. If Hitler was in a bad mood, he picked on the older children or Klara herself, in front of the rest.\"\n\nAfter Alois and Alois Jr had a violent argument, Alois Jr left home at 14, and the elder Alois swore he would never give the boy any inheritance more than what the law required. Apparently Alois Jr's relations with his stepmother Klara were also difficult. After working as an apprentice waiter in the [[Shelbourne Hotel]] in Dublin, Ireland, Alois Jr was arrested for theft and served a five-month sentence during 1900, followed by a nine-month sentence during 1902.\n\n===1900s===\nEdmund, the youngest Hitler boy, died of [[measles]] on 2 February 1900. Alois wanted his son Adolf to seek a career with the civil service. According to various interpretations, Adolf disliked the thought of a career spent enforcing petty rules, and was perhaps so alienated from his father that he was repulsed by whatever Alois wanted. Alois tried to intimidate his son into obedience, but Adolf refused.\n\nAlois Hitler died in 1903, leaving Klara a government pension. She sold the house in [[Leonding]] and relocated with young Adolf and Paula to an apartment in [[Linz]], where they lived frugally. By 1907, Klara had become very ill due to breast cancer. Adolf wept when told by her doctor [[Eduard Bloch]] that his mother \"had little chance of surviving\".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=13, 14}} Despite continued medical treatment by Dr. Bloch, Klara's condition did not improve and in October, he told Adolf her condition was hopeless. Klara died at home in Linz on 21 December 1907. Adolf and Paula were left with some financial assistance from their mother's pension and her modest estate of about 2,000 Kronen, after the medical and funeral costs were paid.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=15, 16}} Klara was buried in [[Leonding]]. Hitler had a good relationship with his mother during her lifetime. He was distraught by her death and possibly grieved for the rest of his life. Speaking of Hitler, Bloch later recalled that after Klara's death he had never seen \"anyone so prostrate with grief\". Hitler wrote years later that his mother's death was a \" 'dreadful blow' \".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=15, 16}}\n\nOn 14 September 1903<ref>{{Cite book | last=Hauner | first=Milan | author2= | title=Hitler: a chronology of his life and time | year=1983 | publisher=Macmillan | location=London | isbn=0-333-30983-9 | pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Zdral | first=Wolfgang | author2= | title=Die Hitlers | date= | publisher=Campus Verlag GmbH | location= | isbn=3-593-37457-9 | page=104}}</ref> Angela Hitler, Adolf's half-sister, married Leo Raubal (11 June 1879 \u2013 10 August 1910), a junior tax inspector, and on 12 October 1906 she gave birth to a son, [[Leo Rudolf Raubal Jr|Leo]]. On 4 June 1908 Angela gave birth to a daughter [[Geli Raubal|Geli]] and in 1910 to a second daughter, Elfriede (Elfriede Maria Hochegger, 10 January 1910 \u2013 24 September 1993).\n\n===1910s===\nIn 1909, Alois Hitler Jr. met an Irishwoman by the name of [[Bridget Dowling]] at the [[Dublin Horse Show]]. They eloped to London and married on 3 June 1910. William Dowling, Bridget's father, threatened to have Alois arrested for [[kidnapping]], but Bridget dissuaded him. The couple settled in [[Liverpool]], where their son [[William Patrick Hitler]] was born in 1911. The family lived in a flat at 102 Upper Stanhope Street. The house was destroyed in the last German [[Liverpool Blitz|air-raid on Liverpool]] on 10 January 1942. Nothing remains of the house or those that surrounded it, and the area was eventually cleared and grassed over. Bridget Dowling's memoirs claim Hitler lived with them in Liverpool from 1912 to 1913 while he was on the run to avoid being [[conscription|conscripted]] in his native [[Austria-Hungary]], but most historians dismiss this story as a fiction invented to make the book more appealing to publishers.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060410154654/http://www.iol.ie/~irishrts/Sample%20Hitler%20His%20Irish%20Relatives.htm \"Hitler: His Irish Relatives\"], by Tony McCarthy in ''Irish Roots'' magazine.

Alois Jr. left his family in May 1914 and he returned alone to the [[German Empire]] to establish himself in the safety-razor business.\n\nPaula had relocated to [[Vienna]], where she worked as a secretary. She did not communicate with Hitler during the period comprising his difficult years as a painter in Vienna and later [[Munich]], military service during the [[First World War]] and early political activities back in Munich.

It is likely Hitler was accepted into the Bavarian army either simply because nobody had asked him whether he was a German citizen when he first volunteered or because the recruiting authorities were happy to accept any volunteer and simply did not care what Hitler's nationality was, or because he might have told the Bavarian authorities that he intended to become a German citizen.{{sfn|Weber|2010|p=16}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1974-082-44, Adolf Hitler im Ersten Weltkrieg.jpg|left|thumb|Hitler (sitting far right) with his army comrades of the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (c.&nbsp;1914\u20131918).]]\nHe served as a dispatch [[runner (soldier)|runner]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in France and Belgium,{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=53}} spending nearly half his time well behind the front lines.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=54}}{{sfn|Weber|2010|p=100}} He was present at the [[First Battle of Ypres]], the [[Battle of the Somme]], the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] and the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], and was wounded at the Somme.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=30}}\n\nHe was decorated for bravery, receiving the [[Iron Cross]], Second Class, in 1914.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=30}} Recommended by [[Hugo Gutmann]], he received the Iron Cross, First Class, on 4 August 1918,{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=59}} a decoration rarely awarded to one of Hitler's rank (''[[Gefreiter]]'').

{"title_page": "Izola Forrester", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}\n[[Image:Izola Forrester 1898.jpg|thumb|Izola Forrester, 1898.]]\n\n'''Izola Forrester''' (November 15, 1878 \u2013 March 6, 1944) was an [[United States|American]] author who was born '''Izola Louise Wallingford'''.\n\nForrester was a pioneer journalist in the heyday of magazine and newspaper publishing in the early part of the 20th century. She was also one of the early women screenwriters of silent films, drawing on her books and stories for their plots, as well as the dramas she was familiar with as a child performer in the 1880s, trouping with her mother [[Ogarita Booth Henderson]] (Oct. 23, 1859 \u2013 April 12, 1892). Ogarita was a stage actress who believed herself to be the daughter of [[John Wilkes Booth]]. \nForrester's father was [[George Wallingford Hills]] (Nov. 9, 1853 \u2013 Feb. 22, 1923), a [[Harvard]]-educated travel writer, but she was brought up by a stepfather, Alexander Henderson, a director of light operas, and later by newspaperman George Forrester and his wife Harriet, who formally adopted her on January 6, 1893, after her mother's death. Izola had one sister, [[Beatrice Henderson Colony]], also a child actress, who became a vaudeville performer, a radio host, and the founder-producer of the [[Keene, New Hampshire|Keene]] Summer Theater in [[New Hampshire]].\n\nForrester's career as a writer and editor began at the age of 15 in [[Chicago]], where she met banner artist [[Ruben Robert Merrifield]] (Sept. 21, 1860 \u2013 April 13, 1932). They married on October 29, 1899 in Chicago. She was hired as a feature writer for the ''[[New York World]]'', specializing in women's interest stories about public figures, from the leaders of the [[suffrage movement]] to the stars of stage and film. She was a regular contributor to many periodicals such as ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[McClure's]]'' under Managing Editor [[Willa Cather]], as well as the author of over twenty books including the popular Greenacre Girls and Polly Page fiction series. During the period 1907\u201314, she contributed numerous stories to the [[pulp magazine]]s, including ''[[The Ocean (magazine)|The Ocean]]'', its successor ''[[The Live Wire (magazine)|The Live Wire]]'', and ''[[The All-Story]]''.<ref>Locke, John; editor. ''The Ocean: 100th Anniversary Collection'', Off-Trail Publications, 2008. Book includes profile of Forrester and her story, \"Devereux's Last Smoke,\" from the March 1907 ''[[The Ocean (magazine)|The Ocean]]''. {{ISBN|978-1-935031-03-1}}.</ref>\n\nForrester's body of work propelled her into a career as a [[screenwriter]] in [[Hollywood]] with her second husband, playwright Mann Page, Jr. (May 29, 1888 \u2013 March 15, 1961).

She was also one of the early women screenwriters of silent films, drawing on her books and stories for their plots, as well as the dramas she was familiar with as a child performer in the 1880s, trouping with her mother [[Ogarita Booth Henderson]] (Oct. 23, 1859 \u2013 April 12, 1892). Ogarita was a stage actress who believed herself to be the daughter of [[John Wilkes Booth]\nForrester's father was [[George Wallingford Hills]] (Nov. 9, 1853 \u2013 Feb. 22, 1923), a [[Harvard]]-educated travel writer, but she was brought up by a stepfather, Alexander Henderson, a director of light operas, and later by newspaperman George Forrester and his wife Harriet, who formally adopted her on January 6, 1893, after her mother's death. Izola had one sister, [[Beatrice Henderson Colony]], also a child actress, who became a vaudeville performer, a radio host, and the founder-producer of the [[Keene, New Hampshire|Keene]] Summer Theater in [[New Hampshire]].\n\nForrester's career as a writer and editor began at the age of 15 in [[Chicago]], where she met banner artist [[Ruben Robert Merrifield]] (Sept. 21, 1860 \u2013 April 13, 1932). They married on October 29, 1899 in Chicago. She was hired as a feature writer for the ''[[New York World]]'', specializing in women's interest stories about public figures, from the leaders of the [[suffrage movement]] to the stars of stage and film. She was a regular contributor to many periodicals such as ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[McClure's]]'' under Managing Editor [[Willa Cather]], as well as the author of over twenty books including the popular Greenacre Girls and Polly Page fiction series. During the period 1907\u201314, she contributed numerous stories to the [[pulp magazine]]s, including ''[[The Ocean (magazine)|The Ocean]]'', its successor ''[[The Live Wire (magazine)|The Live Wire]]'', and ''[[The All-Story]]''.<ref>Locke, John; editor.

This variation can cause significant changes in the [[duty cycle]] and [[slew rate]] of [[digital logic|digital]] signals, and can sometimes result in [[catastrophic failure]] of the entire system.\n\nVariation may occur for many reasons, such as minor changes in the humidity or temperature changes in the [[clean-room]] when wafers are transported, or due to the position of the [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] relative to the center of the wafer.\n\n==Types of corners==\nWhen working in the schematic domain, we usually only work with [[front end of line]] (FEOL) process corners as these corners will affect the performance of devices. But there is an orthogonal set of process parameters that affect [[back end of line]] (BEOL) parasitics.\n\n=== FEOL corners ===\nOne naming convention for process corners is to use two-letter designators, where the first letter refers to the N-channel [[MOSFET]] ([[NMOS logic|NMOS]]) corner, and the second letter refers to the P channel ([[PMOS logic|PMOS]]) corner. In this naming convention, three corners exist: '''typical''', '''fast''' and '''slow'''. '''Fast''' and '''slow''' corners exhibit [[carrier mobility|carrier mobilities]] that are higher and lower than normal, respectively. For example, a corner designated as '''FS''' denotes fast NFETs and slow PFETs.\n\nThere are therefore five possible corners: typical-typical (TT) (not really a corner of an n vs. p mobility graph, but called a corner, anyway), fast-fast (FF), slow-slow (SS), fast-slow (FS), and slow-fast (SF). The first three corners (TT, FF, SS) are called even corners, because both types of devices are affected evenly, and generally do not adversely affect the logical correctness of the circuit. The resulting devices can function at slower or faster clock frequencies, and are often [[product binning|binned]] as such. The last two corners (FS, SF) are called \"skewed\" corners, and are cause for concern. This is because one type of FET will switch much faster than the other, and this form of imbalanced switching can cause one edge of the output to have much less slew than the other edge. [[Latch (electronics)|Latching]] devices may then record incorrect values in the logic chain.\n\n=== BEOL corners <ref>http://abelite-da.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/C8.png</ref> ===\nIn addition to the [[FET]]s themselves, there are more on-chip variation (OCV) effects that manifest themselves at smaller [[Die shrink|technology nodes]]. These include process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variation effects on on-chip interconnect, as well as via structures.\n\nExtraction tools often have a '''nominal''' corner to reflect the nominal cross section of the process target. Then the corners '''cbest''' and '''cworst''' were created to model the smallest and largest cross sections that are in the allowed process variation. A simple thought experiment shows that the smallest cross section with the largest vertical spacing will produce the smallest coupling capacitance. CMOS Digital circuits were more sensitive to capacitance than resistance so this variation was initially acceptable. As processes evolved and resistance of wiring became more critical, the additional '''rcbest''' and '''rcworst''' were created to model the minimum and maximum cross sectional areas for resistance. But the one change is that cross sectional resistance is not dependent on oxide thickness (vertical spacing between wires) so for '''rcbest''' the largest is used and for '''rcworst''' the smallest is used. In lower process nodes (16 nm and below), double pattern in lower metal layers leads to extra capacitance and this extra capacitance is modeled by CCworst and CCbest. So in lower technology nodes, you will often find cworst_CCworst, rcworst_CC_worst, cbest_CCbest and rcbest_CCbest.\n\n==Accounting for corners==\nTo combat these variation effects, modern [[90nm|technology processes]] often supply [[SPICE]] or [[BSIM]] [[simulation]] models for all (or, at the least, TT, FS, and SF) process corners, which enables circuit designers to detect corner [[skew lines|skew]] effects before the design is [[Integrated circuit layout|laid out]], as well as post-layout (through [[circuit extraction|parasitics extraction]]), before it is [[tapeout|taped out]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.google.com/patents?id=EKwOAAAAEBAJ US Patent# 6606729 - Corner simulation methodology]\n\n[[Category:Integrated circuits]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = April 2019}}\n{{Short description|variations of semiconductor layouts based on variations of fabrication processes}}\nIn [[semiconductor]] manufacturing, a '''process corner''' is an example of a [[Design of experiments|design-of-experiments (DoE)]] technique that refers to a variation of fabrication parameters used in applying an [[integrated circuit]] design to a semiconductor [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]].

Chuck tries to break through his emotional block. Unknowingly, Nate is persuaded by the ruthless maneater Diana to cross moral lines while interviewing a couple at the [[Jenny Packham]] fashion show. Lily is finally released from house arrest and attends the fashion show with Rufus, despite the fact that her social life is in shambles. After learning that Ivy stole some of Charlie's trust fund money for herself, Carol Rhodes tracks down Ivy to New York where Ivy threatens to reveal their scam, as well as implicate Serena and the entire Van Der Woodsen family, if Carol does not back away. Elsewhere, a very reluctant Blair decides she does not want to learn who the father of her unborn child is, but is later seen telling Chuck that she is pregnant with Louis' baby, but adds \"Part of me wished it was yours\". He is both amazed and hurt. When Blair tells Louis that she is pregnant, he is ecstatic, but at the end Blair is seen hiding the test results in a drawer.

Nate does not receive a character description, but is joined with Eric (a younger, gay character with political relatives). Chuck is described as being lonely, cynical and without any friends or family. The book talks about Blair and Dan having sex, and when Louis reads it he says he cannot trust Blair anymore. Blair is afraid she will have to raise the baby on her own if he leaves and finally tells Serena. Louis apologizes for his behavior and agrees to trust Blair. Even Rufus becomes angry and alienated with Dan when he says he had never regretted leaving the music industry to have a family, until upon reading the book, which portrays him as marrying Lily just for money. Meanwhile, Diana makes the connection of Ivy and Charlie being the same person and forces Charlie to work for her at ''The Spectator''.

The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. In 1957, after MGM dissolved their animation department, they co-founded [[Hanna-Barbera]], which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, producing programs such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Yogi Bear Show|Yogi Bear]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?|Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Top Cat]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show|Huckleberry Hound]]'', and ''[[The Jetsons]]''.
