On March 27, 1814, [[United States]] forces and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] allies under Major General [[Andrew Jackson]]<ref>[http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/warof1812/p/battle-of-horseshoe-bend.htm Creek War: Horseshoe Bend]</ref> defeated the [[Red Sticks]], a part of the [[Creek people|Creek]] Indian tribe who opposed American expansion, effectively ending the [[Creek War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}\nThe [[Creek people|Creek Indians]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and the eastern part of the [[Mississippi Territory]] had become divided into two factions: the Upper booty tang \nCreek (or [[Red Sticks]]), a majority who opposed American expansion and sided with the [[British Army|British]] and the colonial authorities of [[Spanish Florida]] during the War of 1812; and the Lower Creek, who were more assimilated into the [[English American|Anglo]] culture, had a stronger relationship with the U.S. [[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]], and sought to remain on good terms with the Americans.\n\nThe [[Shawnee]] war leader [[Tecumseh]] visited Creek and other [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] Indian towns in 1811\u20131812 to recruit warriors to join his war against American territorial encroachment. The Red Sticks, young men who wanted to revive traditional religious and cultural practices, were already forming, resisting assimilation.  They began to raid American frontier settlements.  When the Lower Creek helped U.S. forces to capture and punish leading raiders, the Lower Creek were punished in turn by the Red Sticks.\n\nIn 1813, militia troops intercepted a Red Stick party returning from obtaining arms in (Spanish colonial) [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]]. While they were looting the material, the Red Sticks returned and defeated them, at what became known as the [[Battle of Burnt Corn]]. Red Sticks' raiding of enemy settlements continued; and in August 1813 they [[Fort Mims massacre|attacked]] an American outpost at [[Fort Mims]].\n\nAfter the Fort Mims massacre, frontier settlers appealed to the government for help. Since Federal military forces were committed to waging the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], the governments of [[Tennessee]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and the [[Mississippi Territory]] organized [[Militia (United States)|militia]] forces, which together with Lower Creek and Cherokee allies, fought against the Red Sticks.\n\nAfter leaving [[Fort Williams (Alabama)|Fort Williams]] in the spring of 1814, Jackson's army cut its way through the forest to within six miles (10&nbsp;km) of Chief [[Menawa|Menawa's]] Red Stick camp ''Tehopeka'', near a bend in the [[Tallapoosa River]] called \"Horseshoe Bend\"\u2014located in what is now central [[Alabama]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} east of present-day [[Alexander City, Alabama|Alexander City]].  Jackson sent General [[John Coffee]] with the [[mounted infantry]] and the Indian allies south across the river to surround the Red Sticks' camp, while Jackson stayed with the rest of the 2,000 [[infantry]] north of the camp.<ref name=\"Robert Remini 1977\">Robert Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and the Course of American Empire, 1767-1821,'' (1977) ch. 13</ref> Added to the militia units were the [[39th United States Infantry]] and about 600 [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], and Lower Creek, fighting against the Red Stick Creek warriors.\n\n===American Forces===\nWest Tennessee Militia: Major General Andrew Jackson<ref>[https://sos.tn.gov/products/tsla/regimental-histories-tennessee-units-during-war-1812 Tennessee Unites during War of 1812]</ref><ref>[https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:War_of_1812_Tennessee War of 1812: Tennessee]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=25% | Brigade\n!

From this vantage point, Jackson would begin his attack on the Red Stick fortification.<ref name=\"Mackenzie\">{{cite web|last=Mackenzie|first=George|title=The Indian Breastwork in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend: Its Size, Location, and Construction|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/54horseshoe/54facts3.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=16 July 2012}}</ref>  At 6:30am, he split his troops and sent roughly 1,300 men to cross the Tallapoosa River and surround the Creek village.  Then, at 10:30&nbsp;a.m., Jackson's remaining troops began an artillery barrage which consisted of two cannons firing for about two hours. Little damage was caused to the Red Sticks or their 400-yard-long, log-and-dirt fortifications.<ref name=\"Mackenzie\"/>  In fact, Jackson was quite impressed with the measures the Red Sticks took to protect their position. As he later wrote:\n\n{{quote|It is impossible to conceive a situation more eligible for defence than the one they had chosen and the skill which they manifested in their breastwork was really astonishing. It extended across the point in such a direction as that a force approaching would be exposed to a double fire, while they lay entirely safe behind it. It would have been impossible to have raked it with cannon to any advantage even if we had had possession of one extremity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Andrew|title=The Jackson Papers|publisher=Library of Congress}}</ref>}}\n\nSoon, Jackson ordered a [[bayonet]] charge. The 39th U.S. Infantry, led by Colonel [[John Williams (Tennessee)|John Williams]],<ref name=heiskell>Samuel G. Heiskell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HuwTAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=heiskell+andrew+jackson&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false Andrew Jackson and Early Tennessee History]'' (Nashville: Ambrose Printing Company, 1918), pp. 356-359.</ref> charged the breastworks and engaged the Red Sticks in hand-to-hand combat. [[Sam Houston]] (the future statesman and leader of [[Texas]]) served as a third lieutenant in Jackson's army.  Houston was one of the first to make it over the log barricade alive and received a wound from a Creek arrow that troubled him for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"Robert Remini 1977\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the troops under the command of General [[John Coffee]] had successfully crossed the river and surrounded the encampment.  They joined the fight and gave Jackson a great advantage.  The Creek warriors refused to surrender, though, and the battle lasted for more than five hours.  At the end, roughly 800 of the 1,000 Red Stick warriors present at the battle were killed.<ref>Heidler, p. 135</ref>  In contrast, Jackson lost fewer than 50 men during the fight and reported 154 wounded.\n\nAfter the battle, Jackson's troops made bridle reins from skin taken from Indian corpses, conducted a body count by cutting off the tips of their noses, and sent their clothing as souvenirs to the \"ladies of Tennessee.\"<ref>Ronald Takaki, A Different Mirror, (Little, Brown 1993), p. 85</ref>\n\nChief Menawa was severely wounded but survived; he led about 200 of the original 1,000 warriors across the river and toward safety, to join the [[Seminole]] tribe in [[Spanish Florida]].\n\n==Results==\nOn August 9, 1814, Andrew Jackson forced the Creek to sign the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]]. The [[Creek Nation]] was forced to cede {{convert|23|e6acre|km2}}\u2014half of central Alabama and part of southern Georgia\u2014to the [[Government of the United States|United States government]]; this included territory of the Lower Creek, who had been allies of the United States. Jackson had determined the areas from his sense of security needs. Of the {{convert|23|e6acre|km2}} Jackson forced the Creek to cede {{convert|1.9|e6acre|km2}}, which was claimed by the [[Cherokee Nation (1794\u20131907)|Cherokee Nation]], which had also allied with the United States.<ref>Ehle p. 123</ref> Jackson was promoted to Major General after getting agreement to the treaty.\n\n=== Capture of Pensacola, Battle of New Orleans ===\nAfter the battle, Jackson sent his friend and trusted scout, [[John Gordon (Captain of the Spies, Tennessee pioneer)|John Gordon]], Captain of the Spies, to secretly go to the Spanish fort at [[Battle of Pensacola (1814)|Pensacola]] to find out if the British were using it as a base to arm the rebellious red stick Creeks. Gordon travelled through hundreds of miles of hostile Creek territory to find the British flag flying at Pensacola and British officers arming and training Creeks. Jackson, with this knowledge, took Pensacola, a controversial move which led ultimately to further battle against the British in New Orleans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/captainjohngordo00wool#page/n17/mode/2up|title=\"Captain John Gordon, of the spies\"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>\n\nThis victory, along with that at the [[Battle of New Orleans]], greatly contributed to Jackson's favorable national reputation and his popularity.  He was well known when he ran successfully for [[President of the United States|President]] in 1828.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe battlefield is preserved in the [[Horseshoe Bend National Military Park]].<ref>{{cite web|title=If you visited Horseshoe Bend battlefield today|url=http://www.scottmanning.com/content/if-you-visited-horseshoe-bend-battlefield-today/|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Active Regular Army units with campaign credit for the War of 1812|Two currently active battalions of the Regular Army]] (2nd and 3rd Battalions of the [[7th Infantry Regiment (United States)|7th Infantry Regiment]]) perpetuate the lineage of the old [[39th Infantry Regiment (United States)#Other units called .2239th Infantry Regiment.22|39th Infantry Regiment]], which fought at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.\n\n==In fiction==\n[[Eric Flint]] has written a series of [[alternate history]] novels, ''[[1812: The Rivers of War|Trail of Glory]],'' that begin with the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.

On March 27, 1814, [[United States]] forces and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] allies under Major General [[Andrew Jackson]]<ref>[http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/warof1812/p/battle-of-horseshoe-bend.htm Creek War: Horseshoe Bend]</ref> defeated the [[Red Sticks]], a part of the [[Creek people|Creek]] Indian tribe who opposed American expansion, effectively ending the [[Creek War]].\n\n==Background==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}\nThe [[Creek people|Creek Indians]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and the eastern part of the [[Mississippi Territory]] had become divided into two factions: the Upper Creek (or [[Red Sticks]]), a majority who opposed American expansion and sided with the [[British Army|British]] and the colonial authorities of [[Spanish Florida]] during the War of 1812; and the Lower Creek, who were more assimilated into the [[English American|Anglo]] culture, had a stronger relationship with the U.S. [[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]], and sought to remain on good terms with the Americans.\n\nThe [[Shawnee]] war leader [[Tecumseh]] visited Creek and other [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] Indian towns in 1811\u20131812 to recruit warriors to join his war against American territorial encroachment. The Red Sticks, young men who wanted to revive traditional religious and cultural practices, were already forming, resisting assimilation.  They began to raid American frontier settlements.  When the Lower Creek helped U.S. forces to capture and punish leading raiders, the Lower Creek were punished in turn by the Red Sticks.\n\nIn 1813, militia troops intercepted a Red Stick party returning from obtaining arms in (Spanish colonial) [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]]. While they were looting the material, the Red Sticks returned and defeated them, at what became known as the [[Battle of Burnt Corn]]. Red Sticks' raiding of enemy settlements continued; and in August 1813 they [[Fort Mims massacre|attacked]] an American outpost at [[Fort Mims]].\n\nAfter the Fort Mims massacre, frontier settlers appealed to the government for help. Since Federal military forces were committed to waging the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], the governments of [[Tennessee]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and the [[Mississippi Territory]] organized [[Militia (United States)|militia]] forces, which together with Lower Creek and Cherokee allies, fought against the Red Sticks.\n\nAfter leaving [[Fort Williams (Alabama)|Fort Williams]] in the spring of 1814, Jackson's army cut its way through the forest to within six miles (10&nbsp;km) of Chief [[Menawa|Menawa's]] Red Stick camp ''Tehopeka'', near a bend in the [[Tallapoosa River]] called \"Horseshoe Bend\"\u2014located in what is now central [[Alabama]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} east of present-day [[Alexander City, Alabama|Alexander City]].  Jackson sent General [[John Coffee]] with the [[mounted infantry]] and the Indian allies south across the river to surround the Red Sticks' camp, while Jackson stayed with the rest of the 2,000 [[infantry]] north of the camp.<ref name=\"Robert Remini 1977\">Robert Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and the Course of American Empire, 1767-1821,'' (1977) ch. 13</ref> Added to the militia units were the [[39th United States Infantry]] and about 600 [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], and Lower Creek, fighting against the Red Stick Creek warriors.\n\n===American Forces===\nWest Tennessee Militia: Major General Andrew Jackson<ref>[https://sos.tn.gov/products/tsla/regimental-histories-tennessee-units-during-war-1812 Tennessee Unites during War of 1812]</ref><ref>[https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:War_of_1812_Tennessee War of 1812: Tennessee]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=25% | Brigade\n!

From this vantage point, Jackson would begin his attack on the Red Stick fortification.<ref name=\"Mackenzie\">{{cite web|last=Mackenzie|first=George|title=The Indian Breastwork in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend: Its Size, Location, and Construction|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/54horseshoe/54facts3.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=16 July 2012}}</ref>  At 6:30am, he split his troops and sent roughly 1,300 men to cross the Tallapoosa River and surround the Creek village.  Then, at 10:30&nbsp;a.m., Jackson's remaining troops began an artillery barrage which consisted of two cannons firing for about two hours. Little damage was caused to the Red Sticks or their 400-yard-long, log-and-dirt fortifications.<ref name=\"Mackenzie\"/>  In fact, Jackson was quite impressed with the measures the Red Sticks took to protect their position. As he later wrote:\n\n{{quote|It is impossible to conceive a situation more eligible for defence than the one they had chosen and the skill which they manifested in their breastwork was really astonishing. It extended across the point in such a direction as that a force approaching would be exposed to a double fire, while they lay entirely safe behind it. It would have been impossible to have raked it with cannon to any advantage even if we had had possession of one extremity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Andrew|title=The Jackson Papers|publisher=Library of Congress}}</ref>}}\n\nSoon, Jackson ordered a [[bayonet]] charge. The 39th U.S. Infantry, led by Colonel [[John Williams (Tennessee)|John Williams]],<ref name=heiskell>Samuel G.

[[Sam Houston]] (the future statesman and leader of [[Texas]]) served as a third lieutenant in Jackson's army.  Houston was one of the first to make it over the log barricade alive and received a wound from a Creek arrow that troubled him for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"Robert Remini 1977\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the troops under the command of General [[John Coffee]] had successfully crossed the river and surrounded the encampment.  They joined the fight and gave Jackson a great advantage.  The Creek warriors refused to surrender, though, and the battle lasted for more than five hours.  At the end, roughly 800 of the 1,000 Red Stick warriors present at the battle were killed.<ref>Heidler, p. 135</ref>  In contrast, Jackson lost fewer than 50 men during the fight and reported 154 wounded.\n\nAfter the battle, Jackson's troops made bridle reins from skin taken from Indian corpses, conducted a body count by cutting off the tips of their noses, and sent their clothing as souvenirs to the \"ladies of Tennessee.\"<ref>Ronald Takaki, A Different Mirror, (Little, Brown 1993), p. 85</ref>\n\nChief Menawa was severely wounded but survived; he led about 200 of the original 1,000 warriors across the river and toward safety, to join the [[Seminole]] tribe in [[Spanish Florida]].\n\n==Results==\nOn August 9, 1814, Andrew Jackson forced the Creek to sign the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]]. The [[Creek Nation]] was forced to cede {{convert|23|e6acre|km2}}\u2014half of central Alabama and part of southern Georgia\u2014to the [[Government of the United States|United States government]]; this included territory of the Lower Creek, who had been allies of the United States. Jackson had determined the areas from his sense of security needs. Of the {{convert|23|e6acre|km2}} Jackson forced the Creek to cede {{convert|1.9|e6acre|km2}}, which was claimed by the [[Cherokee Nation (1794\u20131907)|Cherokee Nation]], which had also allied with the United States.<ref>Ehle p. 123</ref> Jackson was promoted to Major General after getting agreement to the treaty.\n\n=== Capture of Pensacola, Battle of New Orleans ===\nAfter the battle, Jackson sent his friend and trusted scout, [[John Gordon (Captain of the Spies, Tennessee pioneer)|John Gordon]], Captain of the Spies, to secretly go to the Spanish fort at [[Battle of Pensacola (1814)|Pensacola]] to find out if the British were using it as a base to arm the rebellious red stick Creeks. Gordon travelled through hundreds of miles of hostile Creek territory to find the British flag flying at Pensacola and British officers arming and training Creeks. Jackson, with this knowledge, took Pensacola, a controversial move which led ultimately to further battle against the British in New Orleans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/captainjohngordo00wool#page/n17/mode/2up|title=\"Captain John Gordon, of the spies\"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>\n\nThis victory, along with that at the [[Battle of New Orleans]], greatly contributed to Jackson's favorable national reputation and his popularity.  He was well known when he ran successfully for [[President of the United States|President]] in 1828.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe battlefield is preserved in the [[Horseshoe Bend National Military Park]].<ref>{{cite web|title=If you visited Horseshoe Bend battlefield today|url=http://www.scottmanning.com/content/if-you-visited-horseshoe-bend-battlefield-today/|accessdate=March 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Active Regular Army units with campaign credit for the War of 1812|Two currently active battalions of the Regular Army]] (2nd and 3rd Battalions of the [[7th Infantry Regiment (United States)|7th Infantry Regiment]]) perpetuate the lineage of the old [[39th Infantry Regiment (United States)#Other units called .2239th Infantry Regiment.22|39th Infantry Regiment]], which fought at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.\n\n==In fiction==\n[[Eric Flint]] has written a series of [[alternate history]] novels, ''[[1812: The Rivers of War|Trail of Glory]],'' that begin with the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.

From the 16th century onwards, it was divided into the political entities of the [[Regency of Algiers]], [[Tunis Province, Ottoman Empire|Tunis]], and [[Tripolitania]] ([[Tripoli]]).

Powerful Berber dynasties such as the [[Almohad]]s (12th century) and briefly thereafter the [[Hafsids]], occasionally unified it for short periods. From a European perspective, Tripoli in modern-day [[Libya]] was considered its ''capital'' or chief city, though [[Marrakesh]] in Morocco was the largest and most important Berber city at the time.

These actions finally provoked the [[Barbary Wars]] of the early 19th century.<ref>{{Cite news| first=Robert| last=Carver| title=Not so easy alliances: Two Faiths, One Banner: when Muslims marched with Christians across Europe\u2019s battlegrounds (book review)| url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/review/442| publisher=The Tablet| pages=24| date=25 April 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620191835/http://www.thetablet.co.uk/review/442| archive-date=2017-06-20| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ex Voto of a Naval Battle between a Turkish ship from Alger and a ship of the Order of Malta under Langon 1719.jpg|thumb|[[Ex-Voto]] of a naval battle between a Turkish ship from [[Algiers]] (front) and a ship of the [[Order of Malta]] under [[Langon, Ille-et-Vilaine|Langon]], 1719.]]\n\n''Barbary'' was not always a unified political entity. From the 16th century onwards, it was divided into the political entities of the [[Regency of Algiers]], [[Tunis Province, Ottoman Empire|Tunis]], and [[Tripolitania]] ([[Tripoli]]). Major rulers and petty monarchs during the times of the Barbary states' plundering parties included the [[Pasha]] or [[Dey]] of [[Algiers]], the [[Bey]] of [[Tunis]] and the [[Bey]] of [[Tripoli]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Barbary Pirates|volume=3|pages=383\u2013384}}</ref>\n\nBefore then, the territory was usually divided between [[Ifriqiya]], Morocco, and a west-central Algerian state centered on [[Tlemcen]] or [[Tiaret]]. Powerful Berber dynasties such as the [[Almohad]]s (12th century) and briefly thereafter the [[Hafsids]], occasionally unified it for short periods. From a European perspective, Tripoli in modern-day [[Libya]] was considered its ''capital'' or chief city, though [[Marrakesh]] in Morocco was the largest and most important Berber city at the time. Some{{by whom|date=February 2015}} saw Algiers in Algeria or [[Tangiers]] in Morocco as the ''capital''.\n\n[[File:Purchase of Christian captives from the Barbary States.jpg|thumb|Purchase of Christian captives in the Barbary States.]]\nThe first [[United States]] military land action overseas, executed by the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]], was the [[Battle of Derna (1805)|Battle of Derna]], Tripoli (a coastal town in modern eastern Libya) in April 1805. It formed part of an effort to destroy all of the Barbary pirates, to free American slaves in captivity, and to put an end to [[piracy]] acts between these warring tribes on the part of the Barbary states, which were themselves member states of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The opening line of the ''[[Marines' Hymn]]'' refers to this action: \"From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli...\" This was the first time the [[United States Marine Corps]] took part in offensive actions outside of the United States.\n\nThe modern word ''[[razzia (disambiguation)|razzia]]'' is, via Italian and French, from [[Algerian Arabic]] ''[[Ghazw|ghaziya]]'' (\u063a\u0632\u064a\u0629 \"raiding\"){{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}, originally  referring to [[slave raid]]s conducted by [[Barbary pirates]].\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Ottoman Algeria}}\n* {{annotated link|Ottoman Tripolitania}}\n* {{annotated link|Ottoman Tunisia}}\n* {{annotated link|Tunisian navy (1705-1881)}}\n* {{annotated link|Turkish Abductions}}\n* {{annotated link|Republic of Sal\u00e9}}\n*{{annotated link|History of Morocco#Alaouite dynasty (since 1666)|Sharifan Empire}}\n* {{annotated link|Langue de Barbarie}}\n* {{annotated link|Barbary duck}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation | surname = London | given = Joshua E. | author-link =  | year = 2005 | title = Victory in Tripoli: How America's War with the Barbary Pirates Established the U.S. Navy and Shaped a Nation | place = New Jersey | publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Inc. | isbn = 0-471-44415-4 | URL =  | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/victoryintripoli00lond }}\n* LAFI (Nora), ''[http://www.harmattan.fr/index.asp?navig=catalogue&obj=livre&no=4980 Une ville du Tamazgha entre ancien r\u00e9gime et r\u00e9formes ottomanes].

It was introduced as the WWE Women's Championship on April 3, 2016 at [[WrestleMania 32]] to replace the [[WWE Divas Championship|Divas Championship]] and has a unique title history separate from the original [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWE Women's Championship]]. As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft|2016 draft]], the championship became exclusive to Raw with a subsequent rename and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] created the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship|SmackDown Women's Championship]] as a counterpart title.\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champion was [[Charlotte Flair]], then known simply as Charlotte, who won the title at WrestleMania 32. [[Becky Lynch]] is the current champion in her first reign. She won the title by defeating [[Ronda Rousey]] and SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Winner takes all match|winner takes all]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination match|triple threat match]] to win both titles at [[WrestleMania 35]] on April 8, 2019 (though lost the SmackDown title [[Money in the Bank (2019)|the following month]]).\n\nOverall, there have been 15 reigns between 7 champions. Charlotte Flair is tied with [[Sasha Banks]] for the most reigns at four. [[Becky Lynch]]'s current reign is the longest at {{age in days nts|April 8, 2019}}+ days whiles Banks' fourth reign is the shortest at 8 days (9 days as recognized by WWE). [[Alexa Bliss]] has the longest combined reign at 398 days (396 days as recognized by WWE). [[Nia Jax]] is the oldest champion, winning the title at the age of 33, while Banks is the youngest, first winning the title at 24.\n\n== Title history ==\n=== Names ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Years\n|-\n|WWE Women's Championship\n|April 3, 2016 \u2013 September 4, 2016\n|-\n|'''WWE Raw Women's Championship'''\n|September 5, 2016 \u2013 present\n|}\n\n=== Reigns ===\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|dayless=yes|unrecognized=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|sort number = 0.5\n|type = promotion\n|name = [[WWE]] (unbranded)\n}}{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname||Charlotte|Charlotte Flair}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|April 3, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|April 3, 2016|July 25, 2016}}\n|days2    = yes\n|location = [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington, TX]]\n|event    = [[WrestleMania 32]]\n|notes    = On the WrestleMania 32 Kickoff pre-show, the title was established as the WWE Women's Championship to replace the [[WWE Divas Championship]], which was originally to be defended in this match.

It was introduced as the WWE Women's Championship on April 3, 2016 at [[WrestleMania 32]] to replace the [[WWE Divas Championship|Divas Championship]] and has a unique title history separate from the original [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWE Women's Championship]]. As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft|2016 draft]], the championship became exclusive to Raw with a subsequent rename and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] created the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship|SmackDown Women's Championship]] as a counterpart title.\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champion was [[Charlotte Flair]], then known simply as Charlotte, who won the title at WrestleMania 32. [[Becky Lynch]] is the current champion in her first reign. She won the title by defeating [[Ronda Rousey]] and SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Winner takes all match|winner takes all]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination match|triple threat match]] to win both titles at [[WrestleMania 35]] on April 8, 2019 (though lost the SmackDown title [[Money in the Bank (2019)|the following month]]).\n\nOverall, there have been 15 reigns between 7 champions. Charlotte Flair is tied with [[Sasha Banks]] for the most reigns at four. [[Becky Lynch]]'s current reign is the longest at {{age in days nts|April 8, 2019}}+ days whiles Banks' fourth reign is the shortest at 8 days (9 days as recognized by WWE). [[Alexa Bliss]] has the longest combined reign at 398 days (396 days as recognized by WWE). [[Nia Jax]] is the oldest champion, winning the title at the age of 33, while Banks is the youngest, first winning the title at 24.\n\n== Title history ==\n=== Names ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Years\n|-\n|WWE Women's Championship\n|April 3, 2016 \u2013 September 4, 2016\n|-\n|'''WWE Raw Women's Championship'''\n|September 5, 2016 \u2013 present\n|}\n\n=== Reigns ===\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|dayless=yes|unrecognized=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|sort number = 0.5\n|type = promotion\n|name = [[WWE]] (unbranded)\n}}{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname||Charlotte|Charlotte Flair}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|April 3, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|April 3, 2016|July 25, 2016}}\n|days2    = yes\n|location = [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington, TX]]\n|event    = [[WrestleMania 32]]\n|notes    = On the WrestleMania 32 Kickoff pre-show, the title was established as the WWE Women's Championship to replace the [[WWE Divas Championship]], which was originally to be defended in this match.
