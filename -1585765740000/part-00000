In 1910, he entered the [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] in [[Dresden]], now the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]], where [[Richard Guhr]] was among his teachers. At that time the school was not a school for the fine arts but rather an academy that concentrated on applied arts and crafts.<ref>''Intransigent Realism: Otto Dix between the World Wars''. Ed. Olaf Peters. (New York: Prestel, 2010) 14</ref>\n\nThe majority of Dix\u2019s early works concentrated on landscapes and portraits which were done in a stylized realism that later shifted to expressionism.<ref>Fritz L\u00f6ffler, ''Otto Dix Life and Work'' (New York: Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers, Inc., 1982) pp 14</ref>\n\n===World War I service===\n[[Image:'Stormtroops Advancing Under Gas', etching and aquatint by Otto Dix, 1924.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Stormtroopers Advancing Under Gas'', etching and [[aquatint]] by Otto Dix, 1924]]\nWhen the First World War erupted, Dix volunteered for the German Army. He was assigned to a [[field artillery]] regiment in Dresden.<ref name=\"Karcher_251\"/> In the autumn of 1915 he was assigned as a [[non-commissioned officer]] of a machine-gun unit on the Western front and took part in the [[Battle of the Somme]]. In November 1917, his unit was transferred to the Eastern front until the end of hostilities with Russia, and in February 1918 he was stationed in Flanders. Back on the western front, he fought in the German [[Spring Offensive]]. He earned the [[Iron Cross]] (second class) and reached the rank of ''[[vizefeldwebel]]''. In August of that year he was wounded in the neck, and shortly after he took pilot training lessons.\n\nHe took part in a ''Fliegerabwehr-Kurs'' (\"Defense Pilot Course\") in Tongern, was promoted to Vizefeldwebel and after passing the medical tests transferred to Aviation Replacement Unit Schneidem\u00fchl in Posen. He was discharged from service on 22 December 1918 and was home for Christmas.<ref>Norbert Wolf, Uta Grosenick (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MbOdSrOFfpEC&pg=PA36 ''Expressionism''], Taschen, p. 34. {{ISBN|3-8228-2126-8}}</ref>\n\nDix was profoundly affected by the sights of the war, and later described a recurring nightmare in which he crawled through destroyed houses. He represented his [[PTSD|traumatic experiences]] in many subsequent works, including a portfolio of fifty [[etching]]s called [[The War (Dix engravings)|''Der Krieg'']], published in 1924.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/may/14/first-world-war-german-art-otto-dix|title=The first world war in German art: Otto Dix's first-hand visions of horror|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|date=2014-05-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>  Subsequently, he referred again to the war in [[The War (Dix triptych)|The War Triptych]], painted from 1929-1932.\n\n===Post-war artwork===\n[[File:Otto Dix Sy von Harden.jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of the Journalist [[Sylvia von Harden]]'', 1926, mixed media on wood, 120 x 88 cm, Paris, [[Centre Georges Pompidou]]]]\nAt the end of 1918 Dix returned to Gera, but the next year he moved to [[Dresden]], where he studied at the [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Bildende K\u00fcnste Dresden|Hochschule f\u00fcr Bildende K\u00fcnste]].

In 1910, he entered the [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] in [[Dresden]], now the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]], where [[Richard Guhr]] was among his teachers.

In November 1917, his unit was transferred to the Eastern front until the end of hostilities with Russia, and in February 1918 he was stationed in Flanders. Back on the western front, he fought in the German [[Spring Offensive]]. He earned the [[Iron Cross]] (second class) and reached the rank of ''[[vizefeldwebel]]''. In August of that year he was wounded in the neck, and shortly after he took pilot training lessons.\n\nHe took part in a ''Fliegerabwehr-Kurs'' (\"Defense Pilot Course\") in Tongern, was promoted to Vizefeldwebel and after passing the medical tests transferred to Aviation Replacement Unit Schneidem\u00fchl in Posen.

A neophyte to both rodeos and public event organizing, he visited major rodeos across the country and acquainted himself with Howard Harris III, one of the most highly regarded stock contractors. Through Harris, Lazin secured endorsement from the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association to hold a sanctioned American Bicentennial Rodeo in Philadelphia. The rodeo took place at JFK Stadium in late June through early July 1976. It included six competitions over five days with Congressman [[Clem McSpadden]], the voice of American rodeos, announcing. Five of the six 1975 world champions and top competitors in the women's barrel racing participated. Each rodeo also featured Buffalo Bill Cody's grandson riding an Appaloosa horse, an antique stagecoach that traveled between Cheyenne and Deadwood City, Wyoming, a performance by the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma, and a race between the Philadelphia mounted police unit and the Cheyenne Sheriff's Posse.<ref>The American Bicentennial Rodeo.  23 June 1976.

A18.</ref> Under his leadership, the corporation won the rights from Philadelphia to develop five piers in the central waterfront district. It rehabilitated a 180,000-square-foot pier for entertainment use, built a 90,000-square-foot parking deck where charred pilings once stood and constructed a 15,000-square-foot outdoor entertainment deck. The corporation also rehabilitated another 70,000-square-foot pier for servicing boats and developed Philadelphia's first full-service marina with 300 slips.\n\nOther companies initiated projects in the area; however, the district lacked sufficient infrastructure to accommodate and enhance the development. Lazin founded and was elected chair of the Philadelphia Waterfront Developers Council (1986-1989),<ref>Warner, Susan. \"Developer's Group Picks New Leader.\" ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', 19 June 1989, p. 7-C.</ref> which created a plan to redesign and rebuild the then dilapidated Delaware Avenue into a waterfront boulevard and successfully lobbied for access ramps to and from Interstate 95.\n\n=== Benjamin Franklin Bridge Lighting ===\nIn 1985 when few buildings in Philadelphia were lit at night, Lazin conceived the notion to light the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.<ref>Ott, Dwight. \"Company Sues to Get Ben Franklin Bridge Lighting Repossessed\". ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 21 January 1989, p. 1 and 2B.</ref> He presented the idea to the mayors of Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey, and helped organize a bi-state development committee to undertake the project.<ref>Cohn, Roger. \"Installation of Bridge Lights Set.\" ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 16 June 1987, p.

The lit bridge has become an iconic Philadelphia landmark.\n\n=== Washington Square ===\nIn 1989, with support from U.S. Senators John Heinz III and Arlen Specter, Lazin organized and chaired the Washington Square Committee.<ref>Klibanoff, Hank. \"Vice President's Visit Sparks Hope for Park.\" ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 11 May 1989 p. 24.</ref> Its purpose was to secure inclusion of Washington Square into Independence National Historical Park (INHP) and to have an honorary military guard posted at the Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldier. Situated across from Independence Hall, the area is the largest Revolutionary War burial ground.\n\nLazin successfully led a nearly two-decades-long campaign for the historical site. In 1992, Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujon signed a Memorandum of Understanding whereby the Department of the Interior committed to incorporate Washington Square into INHP, if the site could be brought up to National Park Service standards.\n\nAfter a 13-year undertaking to fund improvements and meet requirements, Washington Square was made part of Independence National Historical Park, which thereafter has overseen management and guided tours.<ref>Harris, Linda K. \"Washington Square's Face-Lift is Almost Done\u2014The National Park Service Will Soon Oversee the Resting Place of 2,000 American Soldiers.\" ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 27 October 2002, p.

U.S. Senator Specter and representatives from Philadelphia, the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of the Interior participated in the event.\n\nLazin continues to chair the Washington Square Committee (as of 2002), with the goal of having an honorary military guard posted at the Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldier.<ref>Salisbury, Stephen. \"Washington Square Gets New Leader.\" ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 12 November 2002, p.

By 1996, what was now PrideFest America had become a week-long event, including 60 regional, state and national organizations. In 1999, PrideFest named Lazin its first executive director.

Beginning in 2004, it included a Featured Nation.\n \nThe annual Equality Forum employed groundbreaking strategy: It framed gay issues as civil rights, it championed bisexual and transgender inclusion, it created the longest-standing role model award, it presented the first annual LGBT art exhibit, it embraced religious programming, and it encompassed international LGBT civil rights by annually exploring the conditions of a featured country or region, including Germany, Russia, Canada, China, Israel, and the Muslim world.\n\n=== LGBT History Month ===\nIn 2006, at Lazin's initiative, Equality Forum assumed responsibility for LGBT History Month.<ref>Bellino, Vince. \"Malcolm Lazin talks about this year's Equality Forum.\" ''Philadelphia Weekly'', 26 July 2016.</ref> Celebrated in October, LGBT History Month honors 31 Icons, one each day, with a video, bio, bibliography and other online resources.

A neophyte to both rodeos and public event organizing, he visited major rodeos across the country and acquainted himself with Howard Harris III, one of the most highly regarded stock contractors. Through Harris, Lazin secured endorsement from the Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association to hold a sanctioned American Bicentennial Rodeo in Philadelphia. The rodeo took place at JFK Stadium in late June through early July 1976. It included six competitions over five days with Congressman [[Clem McSpadden]], the voice of American rodeos, announcing. Five of the six 1975 world champions and top competitors in the women's barrel racing participated. Each rodeo also featured Buffalo Bill Cody's grandson riding an Appaloosa horse, an antique stagecoach that traveled between Cheyenne and Deadwood City, Wyoming, a performance by the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma, and a race between the Philadelphia mounted police unit and the Cheyenne Sheriff's Posse.<ref>The American Bicentennial Rodeo.  23 June 1976.

A18.</ref> Under his leadership, the corporation won the rights from Philadelphia to develop five piers in the central waterfront district. It rehabilitated a 180,000-square-foot pier for entertainment use, built a 90,000-square-foot parking deck where charred pilings once stood and constructed a 15,000-square-foot outdoor entertainment deck. The corporation also rehabilitated another 70,000-square-foot pier for servicing boats and developed Philadelphia's first full-service marina with 300 slips.\n\nOther companies initiated projects in the area; however, the district lacked sufficient infrastructure to accommodate and enhance the development. Lazin founded and was elected chair of the Philadelphia Waterfront Developers Council (1986-1989),<ref>Warner, Susan. \"Developer's Group Picks New Leader.\" ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', 19 June 1989, p. 7-C.</ref> which created a plan to redesign and rebuild the then dilapidated Delaware Avenue into a waterfront boulevard and successfully lobbied for access ramps to and from Interstate 95.\n\n=== Benjamin Franklin Bridge Lighting ===\nIn 1985 when few buildings in Philadelphia were lit at night, Lazin conceived the notion to light the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.<ref>Ott, Dwight. \"Company Sues to Get Ben Franklin Bridge Lighting Repossessed\".

In 1992, Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujon signed a Memorandum of Understanding whereby the Department of the Interior committed to incorporate Washington Square into INHP, if the site could be brought up to National Park Service standards.\n\nAfter a 13-year undertaking to fund improvements and meet requirements, Washington Square was made part of Independence National Historical Park, which thereafter has overseen management and guided tours.<ref>Harris, Linda K. \"Washington Square's Face-Lift is Almost Done\u2014The National Park Service Will Soon Oversee the Resting Place of 2,000 American Soldiers.\" ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 27 October 2002, p.

Prior to that, local able-bodied male citizens were required to report for night duty as special constables for a fixed number of nights per year on pain of fine or imprisonment, in a system known as \"watch and ward\".<ref name=formidable>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianbooks.org/crime/cph3.htm |title=Toronto Police in 1834 \u2013 1860 \"Formidable Engines of Oppression\" |publisher=Russianbooks.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\n\nThe Toronto Police is one of the English-speaking world's oldest modern municipal police departments; it is older than, for example, the [[New York City Police Department]], which was formed in 1845, or the [[Boston Police Department]], which was established in 1839. The London [[Metropolitan Police]] of 1829 is generally recognized as the first modern municipal police department. In 1835, Toronto retained five full-time constables\u2014a ratio of about one officer for every 1,850 citizens. Their daily pay was set at 5 shillings for day duty and 7 shillings, 6 pence, for night duty. In 1837, the constables\u2019 annual pay was fixed at \u00a375 per annum, a lucrative city position when compared to the mayor's annual pay of \u00a3250 at the time.<ref name=\"russianbooks.org\">{{cite web |title=HISTORY OF THE TORONTO POLICE PART 2: 1850-1859 |url=http://www.russianbooks.org/crime/cph4.htm |website=www.russianbooks.org |quote=TORONTO POLICE IN THE 1850s    The Gangs of Toronto and the Call For Reform}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1834 to 1859, the Toronto Police was a corrupt and notoriously political force, with its constables loyal to the local aldermen who personally appointed police officers in their own wards for the duration of their incumbency. Toronto constables on numerous occasions suppressed opposition candidate meetings and took sides during bitter sectarian violence between [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] and [[Irish Catholic]] radical factions in the city. A provincial government report in 1841 described the Toronto Police as \"formidable engines of oppression\". Although constables were issued uniforms in 1837, one contemporary recalled that the Toronto Police was \"without uniformity, except in one respect\u2014they were uniformly slovenly.\"  After an excessive outbreak of street violence involving Toronto Police misconduct, including an episode where constables brawled with Toronto's firemen in one incident, and stood by doing nothing in another incident while enraged firemen burned down a visiting circus when its clowns jumped a lineup at a local brothel, the entire Toronto Police force, along with its chief, were fired in 1859.<ref name=formidable/>\n\n====1859 to 1900====\nThe new force was removed from Toronto City Council jurisdiction (except for the setting of the annual budget and manpower levels) and placed under the control of a provincially mandated Board of Police Commissioners. Under its new Chief, William Stratton Prince, a former infantry captain, standardized training, hiring practices and new strict rules of discipline and professional conduct were introduced. Today's Toronto Police Service directly traces its ethos, constitutional lineage and Police Commission regulatory structure to the 1859 reforms.<ref name=\"russianbooks.org\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=HISTORY OF THE TORONTO POLICE PART 3: 1859 - 1875 |url=http://www.russianbooks.org/crime/cph5.htm |website=www.russianbooks.org |quote=TORONTO POLICE IN 1859 -1875    The Militarization of the Constables}}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, the Toronto Police mostly focused on the suppression of rebellion in the city\u2014particularly during the [[Fenian]] threats of 1860 to 1870. The Toronto Police were probably Canada's first security intelligence agency when they established a network of spies and informants throughout [[Province of Canada|Canada West]] in 1864 to combat [[United States Army|US Army]] recruiting agents attempting to induce [[British Army]] soldiers stationed in Canada to desert to serve in the [[Union Army]] in the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The Toronto Police operatives later turned to spying on the activities of the Fenians and filed reports to the [[Chief Constable]] from as far as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]] and [[New York City]].

Thirteen armed Toronto Police officers, along with constables from Barrie, were dispatched to Manitoulin Island to assist the government in retaking the fishery operation, but were forced back when the natives advanced now armed with rifles.

They were almost entirely focused on arresting drunks, prostitutes, disorderlies, and violators of Toronto's ultra-strict Sunday \"[[blue law]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianbooks.org/crime/cph6.htm |title=History of the Toronto Police Part 4: 1875 \u2013 1920 |publisher=Russianbooks.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\n\nIn the days before public social services, the force functioned as a social services mega-agency. Prior the creation of the Toronto Humane Society in 1887 and the Children's Aid Society in 1891, the police oversaw animal and child welfare, including the enforcement of child support payments. They operated the city's ambulance service and acted as the Board of Health. Police stations at the time were designed with space for the housing of [[homeless]], as no other public agency in Toronto dealt with this problem. Shortly before the Great Depression, in 1925, the Toronto Police housed 16,500 [[homeless]] people.\n\nThe Toronto Police regulated street-level business: cab drivers, street vendors, corner grocers, tradesmen, rag men, junk dealers, and laundry operators. Under public order provisions, the Toronto Police was responsible for the licensing and regulation of dance halls, pool halls, theatres, and later movie houses. It was responsible for censoring the content of not only theatrical performances and movies, but of all literature in the city ranging from books and magazines to posters and advertising.\n\nThe Toronto Police also suppressed [[labour movement]]s which were perceived as [[anarchism|anarchist]] threats. The establishment of the mounted unit is directly related to the four-month Toronto streetcar strike of 1886, when authorities called on the Governor General's Horse Guard Regiment to assist in suppressing the strike.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Toronto Railway Co. streetcar, Yonge and Adelaide streets.jpg|thumb|A constable overlooks construction for [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar lines]] on Adelaide and [[Yonge Street]], 1911.]]\nAs for serious criminal investigations, the Toronto Police frequently (but not always) contracted with private investigators from the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton's Detective Agency]] until the 20th century, when it developed its own internal investigation and intelligence capacity.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, the Toronto Police under [[Chief Constable]] [[Dennis Draper|Dennis \"Deny\" Draper]], a retired [[Brigadier General]] and former [[Conservative Party of Canada (historic)|Conservative]] candidate, returned to its function as an agency to suppress political dissent. Its notorious \"[[Red Squad]]\" brutally dispersed demonstrations by labour unions and by unemployed and homeless people during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Suspicious of \"foreigners\", the police lobbied the city of Toronto to pass legislation banning public speeches in languages other than English, curtailing union organization among Toronto's vast immigrant populations working in sweat shops.\n\nAfter several scandals, including a call by Chief Draper to have reporters \"shot\" and his being arrested driving drunk, the city appointed in 1948 a new Police Chief from its own ranks for the first time in the department's history: [[John Chisholm (police chief)|John Chisholm]], a very able senior police inspector. In 1955, the Metropolitan Toronto Board of Police Commissioners was formed in preparation for the amalgamation of the 13 police forces in the municipality, [[Metropolitan Toronto]], into a unified police force with Chisholm as chief of the unified force. Unfortunately, Chisholm was not up to the politics of the Chief's office, especially in facing off with [[Fred Gardiner|Fred \"Big Daddy\" Gardiner]], who engineered almost single-handedly the formation of [[Metropolitan Toronto]] in the 1950s.\n\nOn January 1, 1957, the Toronto Police merged with the other municipal forces in the metropolitan area to form the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force:<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Amendment Act, 1956|abbr =S.O.|year =1956|chapter =53|section =18|link=https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1956onta#page/246/mode/2up}}</ref>\n[[File:East York Police and Fire Departments.jpg|thumb|An East York Police and Fire Station.

In 1958, after a number of conflicts with Gardiner and members of the newly expanded [[Toronto Police Services Board|Metropolitan Toronto Board of Police Commissioners]], Chief Chisholm drove to High Park on the city's west end, parked his car and committed suicide with his service revolver.

It was set up under a social purist pretext of policing people's everyday behaviours so that Toronto might live up to Howland's moniker. Among the offences, though not necessarily crimes, that morality officers policed were gambling, \"[[blue law]]s\" or \"Sabbath laws\", being an absentee father, drug dealing, interracial relationships, homosexuality, bootlegging and alcoholism, [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]], family abuse and prostitution.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.blogto.com/city/2011/01/nostalgia_tripping_torontos_morality_police/|title=Nostalgia Tripping: Toronto's Morality Police|work=blogTO|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://torontopubliclibrary.typepad.com/trl/2017/04/vice-virtue-policing-morality.html|title=Vice & Virtue: Policing Morality in Toronto|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}</ref> The people in power who wrote these laws, such as Howland, and created the morality department said that they were there to protect moral and good people from the evils of the city. However, when examining the direct implementation/enforcement of these laws, and the effects they had on civilian life,  the larger purpose of the morality department was to prevent working-class people from socializing or coming together, and thereby to keep them in a generally less powerful position.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.russianbooks.org/crime/cph6.htm|title=HISTORY OF THE TORONTO POLICE PART 4: 1875 - 1920|website=www.russianbooks.org|access-date=2018-03-09}}</ref>\n\n===== Context =====\nThe roots of this social purity doctrine can be traced back to the belief in the good of British colonialism, ideas still holding strong in the late 19th century in Canada, as Canada's national identity was still strongly linked to British ideals. The assumption is that bad people behave objectively badly, and that these people need to made good by a sovereign government.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Jabbar|first=Naheem|date=2012-12-01|title=Policing native pleasures: a colonial history|journal=The British Journal of Sociology|language=en|volume=63|issue=4|pages=704\u2013729|doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2012.01433.x|pmid=23240839|issn=1468-4446}}</ref> This government does so by limiting the civilian population's freedoms and regulating their social interactions to ensure that people remain \"moral and good\", and thereby can make a new generation of \"moral and good\" people. Of course everyone would fall under these practices who was not seen to be morally, or socially, good, but women and people of colour were seen by the government as inherently lesser or more susceptible to temptation or sin, and so they were policed far more heavily than their white or male counterparts. The resulting system of social governing, was easily abused to keep a divide between classes wide, through methods like disproportionately enforcing the laws when the accused were of lower classes, making special exemptions for people who lived or served those who lived in the higher classes.<ref name=\":3\" /> And, once again, since women and people of colour were seen as inherently more susceptible to temptation, they were automatically made targets of the system's efforts to socially reform people.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===== Methods and effectiveness =====\nThe officers' methods often, called for them to threaten fines or jail time rather than arrest all offenders, which made them popular among people as a social service. People knew that they probably would not be arrested or get the unwanted publicity that goes along with being arrested and going through the public courts. In this way, these officers became regulators of the community. Ordinary people  interacted with them, and thereby came to trust them. As a result, these officers had many people willing to give them information on who might be a suspected drug dealer, prostitute, gambler or absentee father.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===== Prostitution =====\nThe primary focus of the anti-prostitution laws was to make prostitution unprofitable so that women would instead pursue legitimate ways to make money. In essence, the people who put these laws in place were attempting to save women from a life of prostitution. The legitimate forms of employment were few and far between; maid, secretary and factory worker were the only plentiful options, and each of those put women in a position where they were constantly subordinate to another.<ref name=\":1\" /> Prostitution had a much wider definition to the social purists of the time than it does now. For example, if a man bought a woman dinner and the woman then went home with him, that was considered prostitution. Thus, any women, and especially working-class women without social standing, who sought out men were persecuted, though not prosecuted. Seemingly innocuous behaviours, such as walking alone at night, might also get a woman arrested for prostitution.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===== Sabbath laws =====\nThe Sabbath laws (alternatively known as \"blue laws\") were a series of laws designed to prevent people from working on the [[Sabbath]], commonly known as Sunday, to respect the [[God in Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic God]]'s day of rest. They, like most laws enforced by the morality department, disproportionately affected working-class people and favoured the upper class. One of the best examples of this was the fact that taxis used by the public to get around were not allowed to work on Sunday, but private chauffeurs of the wealthy were. Beyond preventing many forms of work, they also prevented people from doing certain leisure activities that could be interpreted as work. Similar to the taxi driver\u2013chauffeur contradiction, ball games for children in public on Sundays but still allowing for games of golf at private clubs. Such contradictions led people to believe that these laws were put in place to prevent working-class people from consorting with each other, to keep them separate and easy to manage.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===== Absentee fathers =====\nFor most of their operating time, the majority of their work was finding absentee fathers from Canada, the U.S. and Great Britain, and then coercing them into paying maintenance payments. These maintenance payments would go towards supporting their wives and children. This re-enforced a family structure where the father was a provider and the mother was unable to support herself or her family. As attitudes towards policing among the upper ranks moved away from social management and into crime and punishment in the 1920s, it came to be that the police and social activist groups alike agreed that this work was no longer a job for the police. In 1929, the newly established family court system took over the management of these payments.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===== First women on the force=====\nMorality officer was one of the first roles within the police force, not including secretary, that women were allowed to fulfill. In the early 1910s, they were brought in under the idea that they would be better suited to deal with young women who had been acting immorally, and that they would themselves be a moralizing influence in the police service. Also, the existence of policewomen was an encouragement for women to come forward with assault charges against their abusive husbands. Women would trust that if they went to a police officer who was also female, then something would be more likely to get done.<ref name=\":0\" /> Yet, the majority of their duties included arresting and searching female suspects, and interviewing female suspects and victims. As well, rather than being on the beat in dangerous parts of town, they would be searching for people, though mostly women, acting immorally, particularly in places where men and women came together. They were never tasked the same duties as their male counterparts, and so were seen more as social workers within the police force than actual members of the force. Through the 1920s, feminists argued that these policewomen were taken on by police for show more than to be actual policewomen, and interest from the upper ranks in policewomen faded along with their interest in social management, since the upper ranks saw the two as being deeply connected. Few more women were taken on until after [[World War II]], and those that were there gained little ground for women in the police force.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====School crossing guards====\nAdult crossing guards at various intersections and crosswalks are employed and paid by the Toronto Police Service. They are under charge by various division across the city. Besides wearing the reflective vest (yellow and orange), crossing guards are supplied with police issue jackets. The jackets have a patch similar to those of the Toronto Police Service, but it has a white background and identification as school crossing guards. A winter hat similar to the [[Ushanka]] is worn in cold weather.\n\n==Ranks==\nThe rank insignia of the Toronto Police Service is similar to that used by police services elsewhere in Canada and in the United Kingdom, except that the usual \"pips\" are replaced by maple leaves.

The initial training is three weeks, followed by 12 weeks at the [[Ontario Police College]] in [[Aylmer, Ontario]] and then nine weeks of final training at Toronto Police College. [[Charles O. Bick College]] was closed in July 2009. In August 2018, TPS acquired TTC Orion VII buses 7900-7905 for purposes such as roadblocks, mass transport and training. These units are now numbered ES-0 through ES-5. ES stands for Events Support. The following units were painted black prior to being sent to TPS. In November 2018, these units were repainted in a gray and white livery similar to the LFLRV livery on TTC vehicles. The following units are maintained and stored by the TTC. They are currently stored at Birchmount Garage in Scarborough.\n\n==Uniform==\n[[File:Torontos finest.jpg|thumb|A members of the Toronto Police bicycle unit (wearing a yellow reflective jacket) with another officer dressed in typical winter dress (centre), which includes a fur trim Yukon hat.]]\nFront line officers wear dark navy blue shirts, cargo pants (with red stripe) and boots. Winter jackets are either dark navy blue jacket design\u2013[[Eisenhower jacket|Eisenhower]] style, single-breasted front closing, two patch type breast pockets, shoulder straps, gold buttons\u2014or yellow windbreaker style with the word POLICE in reflective silver and black at the back (generally worn by the bicycle and traffic services units). All ranks shall wear dark navy blue clip on ties when wearing long-sleeve uniforms.\n\nHats can be styled after [[baseball cap]]s, [[combination cap]]s, or fur trim Yukon (similar to the [[Ushanka]]) hats for winter. Motorcycle units have white helmets. Black or reflective yellow gloves are also provided to officers with Traffic Services. Front line officers usually wear combination caps since that is the location of their badge. Prior to the 1990s, female officers wore bowler caps instead of combination caps. Auxiliary officers wear combination caps with a checkered red and black band. The Mounted Unit wear black [[Canadian military fur wedge cap]] during the winter months and [[custodian helmet]] for ceremonial use.\n\nAs is the case with all Ontario law enforcement officers, uniformed officers wear name tags. They are in the style of \"A. Example\" where the first letter of the first name is written and the last name next to it. Name tags are usually stitched on with white stitching on a black background, but they also have pin-styled with black lettering on a gold plate.\n\nSenior officers wear white shirts and a black Eisenhower style jacket. Auxiliary officers wear light blue shirts (long sleeve for winter and short for summer), with the badging of auxiliary on the bottom of the crest. Originally front line officer also wore light blue shirts but changed to the current navy blue shirts in the Fall of 2000.\n\n==Logo==\nThe Toronto Police Service logo is very similar to the old Metropolitan Toronto Police logo, and it includes the following components:\n* winged wheels of industry on the top part of the shield, representing transportation\n* a crown commemorating the coronation year of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953\n* two books representing education or knowledge\n* a [[caduceus]] (herald's staff), which is associated with Mercury, the protector of commerce\n* a chevron for housing\n* on either side of the shield, a sheaf with a [[White Rose of York|York Rose]], representing [[York County, Ontario]], which Toronto served as county seat from 1834 to 1953\n* a circular ribbon with the words \"Toronto Police\"\n* a beaver representing industry and/or Canada, from the old and new [[coat of arms of Toronto]]\n\nThe shield in the Toronto Police Service logo is the same as the [[coat of arms]] of the former Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.<ref>{{cite web |title= Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto arms |url= http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=1527&ProjectElementID=5122 |website= Official website of the Governor General |access-date= 29 January 2018}}</ref> The TPS logo is also similar to the emblem of the former [[Toronto District School Board#Metropolitan Toronto School Board and the Toronto District School Board|Metropolitan Toronto School Board]]. Prior to the formation of the Metropolitan Toronto Police, the Toronto Police Department officers wore a generic Scully badge on their caps, a common shield used by Canadian police forces in the 19th century and early 20th century. This featured a metallic maple leaf with a beaver and crown.\n\n==Fleet==\nPolice cars, also known as police ''cruisers'', are the standard equipment used by Toronto Police officers for transportation. The vehicles would include a rotator lightbar as its emergency vehicle lighting, which is still popular with the TPS. They seem to not plan to change the lightbar, although some vehicles include a non-rotating lightbar. The vehicles are numbered in regards to their division and car number. For example, 3322 represents that the vehicle is from 33 Division, and the following 22 is the vehicle designation number.\n\nCurrent fleet have a white base with red and blue markings and stealth vehicles are grey with reflective markings. Beginning in 2016, the Toronto Police Service is planning to replace the current colour scheme with grey or blue base with white reflective markings.<ref name=\"thestar.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/09/20/why-toronto-police-are-changing-the-colour-of-their-cruisers.html|title=Why Toronto police are changing the colour of their scout cars - The Star|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nPrevious scheme was yellow base with blue lettering.\n\nOther fleet numbering patterns include:\n{{col div}}\n* All Terrain Vehicle \u2014 ##ATVXX (## would be the Division number)\n* Area Field Command Unit \u2014 AFCXX\n* Bail Compliance Unit \u2014 BCUXX\n* Bike Patrol Unit \u2014 ##BXX (## would be the Division number)\n* Central Field Command \u2014 CFCXX\n* Chief of Police \u2014 CHIEF\n* Command Vehicles \u2014 COMDXX\n* Court Services \u2014 CRTXX\n* Courier \u2014 RMSXX\n* Duty Officer (highest ranking inspector on shift) - DUTYXX\n* Emergency Task Force \u2014 ETFXX\n* Forensic Identification Services \u2014 FISXX\n* Information Technology Services \u2014 ITSXX\n* Marine Unit \u2014 MUXX\n* Mounted Unit Services \u2014 MTDXX\n* Parking Enforcement \u2014 PKEXX (East) / PKWXX (West)\n* Police Dog Services \u2014 PDSXX\n* Primary Response Group \u2014 87XX\n* Public Safety Response Team (replaced TAVIS) \u2014 PSRTXX\n* Public Safety Unit \u2014 PSUXX\n* School Resource Officer \u2014 SROXX\n* (Marine) Service Vehicle \u2014 SRVX\n* Spare Vehicles \u2014 7XX\n* Supervisor Vehicles \u2014 ##SX (## would be the Division number or Unit Identifier)\n* Toronto Police Tow Trucks \u2014 8XX\n* Traffic Services \u2014 6XXX / 80XX (Stealth)\n* Video Services Unit \u2014 VSUXX\n{{col div end}}\n\n===Motor vehicles===\n[[File:PSRT02 Toronto.jpg|thumb|A Toronto Police uses a number of vehicles including the [[Ford Explorer#Ford Police Interceptor Utility|Ford Explorer Interceptor]] (left) and a [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)#Police Interceptor Sedan|Ford Taurus Interceptor]] (right).]]\nThe Toronto Police Service has about 500 vehicles in their fleet.<ref name=\"thestar.com\"/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |\n|-\n!Make/model\n!Type\n!Origin\n|-\n| Chevrolet [[Chevrolet Cavalier|Cavalier]]\n| Parking Enforcement, Document Services Section\n| {{MEX}}/{{USA}}\n|-\n| Chevrolet [[Chevrolet Malibu|Malibu]] (2001\u20132005)\n| Community Sweeper Unit car\n| {{USA}}\n|-\n| Chevrolet Malibu (2006)\n| Parking Enforcement Unit\n| {{CAN}}\n|-\n| Dodge [[Dodge Neon|Neon]]\n| Parking Enforcement, Document Services Section\n| {{USA}}\n|-\n| [[Smart fortwo]]\n| Parking Enforcement car\n| {{FRA}}\n|-\n| [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Crown Victoria]]\n| (marked) General police vehicle, Traffic Services, Community Sweeper Unit\n| {{CAN}}\n|-\n| [[Ford]] [[Ford Focus (North America)|Focus]]\n| Parking Enforcement car\n| {{USA}}\n|-\n| Ford [[Ford Interceptor Sedan (sixth generation)#Police Interceptor Sedan]]\n| (marked) General police vehicle\n| {{USA}}\n|-\n| [[Ford Interceptor Utility]]\n| (marked) Supervisor Truck, Traffic Services, Special Operations\n| {{USA}}\n|-\n| [[Volkswagen]] [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]]\n| Safety Bug car\n| {{MEX}}\n|-\n| [[Honda]] [[Honda Civic|Civic]]/[[Civic Hybrid]]\n| Parking Enforcement car\n| {{CAN}}/{{JPN}}\n|-\n| [[Harley-Davidson]] [[Harley-Davidson FLHTP|FLHTP]]\n| motorcycle\n| {{USA}}\n|}\n\n===Watercraft===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |\n|-\n!Unit #\n!Make\n!Type\n|-\n| Marine Unit 1\n| [[Hike Metal Products|Hike Industry]] (Wheatley ON)\n|Dive Platform & Command Vessel marine boat with [[Volvo Penta]] Turbo Chargd {{convert|350|hp|abbr=on}} engines and crane.\n|-\n| Marine Unit 3\n| Tyler Nelson design built by Bristol Marine (Port Credit ON)\n| 400&nbsp;hp Long Range Search and Rescue Vessel\n|-\n| Marine Unit 4\n| [[Hike Metal Products|Hike Industry]]\n| patrol boat\n|-\n| Marine Unit MTB 5\n| James J.

Established in 1834, it was the first [[municipal police]] service created in North America and is one of the oldest police services in the English-speaking world. It is the largest municipal police service in Canada and third largest police force in Canada after the [[Ontario Provincial Police]] (OPP) and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP).\n\nWith a budget of over $1&nbsp;billion, it ranks second to the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] in the budgetary expenses of the [[City of Toronto government]].<ref>[http://voiceoftoronto.com/wp/2010/02/toronto%E2%80%99s-balanced-budget-protects-city-services-supports-residents-and-business/ Policing costs skyrocketing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717232504/http://voiceoftoronto.com/wp/2010/02/toronto%E2%80%99s-balanced-budget-protects-city-services-supports-residents-and-business/ |date=July 17, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\n====1834 to 1859 reforms====\nThe Toronto Police Service was founded in 1834, when the city of Toronto was first created from the town of York. Prior to that, local able-bodied male citizens were required to report for night duty as special constables for a fixed number of nights per year on pain of fine or imprisonment, in a system known as \"watch and ward\".<ref name=formidable>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianbooks.org/crime/cph3.htm |title=Toronto Police in 1834 \u2013 1860 \"Formidable Engines of Oppression\" |publisher=Russianbooks.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\n\nThe Toronto Police is one of the English-speaking world's oldest modern municipal police departments; it is older than, for example, the [[New York City Police Department]], which was formed in 1845, or the [[Boston Police Department]], which was established in 1839. The London [[Metropolitan Police]] of 1829 is generally recognized as the first modern municipal police department. In 1835, Toronto retained five full-time constables\u2014a ratio of about one officer for every 1,850 citizens. Their daily pay was set at 5 shillings for day duty and 7 shillings, 6 pence, for night duty. In 1837, the constables\u2019 annual pay was fixed at \u00a375 per annum, a lucrative city position when compared to the mayor's annual pay of \u00a3250 at the time.<ref name=\"russianbooks.org\">{{cite web |title=HISTORY OF THE TORONTO POLICE PART 2: 1850-1859 |url=http://www.russianbooks.org/crime/cph4.htm |website=www.russianbooks.org |quote=TORONTO POLICE IN THE 1850s    The Gangs of Toronto and the Call For Reform}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1834 to 1859, the Toronto Police was a corrupt and notoriously political force, with its constables loyal to the local aldermen who personally appointed police officers in their own wards for the duration of their incumbency. Toronto constables on numerous occasions suppressed opposition candidate meetings and took sides during bitter sectarian violence between [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] and [[Irish Catholic]] radical factions in the city. A provincial government report in 1841 described the Toronto Police as \"formidable engines of oppression\". Although constables were issued uniforms in 1837, one contemporary recalled that the Toronto Police was \"without uniformity, except in one respect\u2014they were uniformly slovenly.\"  After an excessive outbreak of street violence involving Toronto Police misconduct, including an episode where constables brawled with Toronto's firemen in one incident, and stood by doing nothing in another incident while enraged firemen burned down a visiting circus when its clowns jumped a lineup at a local brothel, the entire Toronto Police force, along with its chief, were fired in 1859.<ref name=formidable/>\n\n====1859 to 1900====\nThe new force was removed from Toronto City Council jurisdiction (except for the setting of the annual budget and manpower levels) and placed under the control of a provincially mandated Board of Police Commissioners. Under its new Chief, William Stratton Prince, a former infantry captain, standardized training, hiring practices and new strict rules of discipline and professional conduct were introduced. Today's Toronto Police Service directly traces its ethos, constitutional lineage and Police Commission regulatory structure to the 1859 reforms.<ref name=\"russianbooks.org\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=HISTORY OF THE TORONTO POLICE PART 3: 1859 - 1875 |url=http://www.russianbooks.org/crime/cph5.htm |website=www.russianbooks.org |quote=TORONTO POLICE IN 1859 -1875    The Militarization of the Constables}}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, the Toronto Police mostly focused on the suppression of rebellion in the city\u2014particularly during the [[Fenian]] threats of 1860 to 1870. The Toronto Police were probably Canada's first security intelligence agency when they established a network of spies and informants throughout [[Province of Canada|Canada West]] in 1864 to combat [[United States Army|US Army]] recruiting agents attempting to induce [[British Army]] soldiers stationed in Canada to desert to serve in the [[Union Army]] in the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The Toronto Police operatives later turned to spying on the activities of the Fenians and filed reports to the [[Chief Constable]] from as far as [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]] and [[New York City]]. When in December 1864, the Canada West secret frontier police was established under [[Stipendiary Magistrate]] Gilbert McMicken, some of the Toronto Police agents were reassigned to this new agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianbooks.org/crime/cph5a.htm |title=Military-Intelligence Functions of the Toronto Police During the U.S. Civil War Era and the Fenian Threat |publisher=Russianbooks.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 1863, Toronto Police officers were also used as \"Indian fighters\" during the Manitoulin Island Incident, when some fifty natives armed with knives forced the fishery inspector William Gibbard and a fishery operation to withdraw from unceded tribal lands on Lake Huron. Thirteen armed Toronto Police officers, along with constables from Barrie, were dispatched to Manitoulin Island to assist the government in retaking the fishery operation, but were forced back when the natives advanced now armed with rifles. The police withdrew but were later reinforced and eventually arrested the entire band, but not before William Gibbard was killed by unknown parties.<ref>{{cite book |last= Harring|first= Sidney L.|year= 1998|title= White Man's Law:  Native People in Nineteenth-Century Canadian Jurisprudence|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/White_Man_s_Law.html?id=hDogK-SCOmYC|location= Toronto|publisher= University of Toronto Press|pages= 152{{endash}}153|isbn= 978-0-80200503-8|accessdate= }}</ref>\n[[File:TorontoPolice19thCentury.jpg|thumb|left|Constables of the Toronto Police Department, 1883]]\nIn the 1870s, as the Fenian threat began to gradually wane and the Victorian moral reform movement gained momentum, Toronto police primarily functioned in the role of \"urban missionaries\" whose function it was to regulate unruly and immoral behaviour among the \"lower classes\". They were almost entirely focused on arresting drunks, prostitutes, disorderlies, and violators of Toronto's ultra-strict Sunday \"[[blue law]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianbooks.org/crime/cph6.htm |title=History of the Toronto Police Part 4: 1875 \u2013 1920 |publisher=Russianbooks.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\n\nIn the days before public social services, the force functioned as a social services mega-agency. Prior the creation of the Toronto Humane Society in 1887 and the Children's Aid Society in 1891, the police oversaw animal and child welfare, including the enforcement of child support payments. They operated the city's ambulance service and acted as the Board of Health. Police stations at the time were designed with space for the housing of [[homeless]], as no other public agency in Toronto dealt with this problem. Shortly before the Great Depression, in 1925, the Toronto Police housed 16,500 [[homeless]] people.\n\nThe Toronto Police regulated street-level business: cab drivers, street vendors, corner grocers, tradesmen, rag men, junk dealers, and laundry operators. Under public order provisions, the Toronto Police was responsible for the licensing and regulation of dance halls, pool halls, theatres, and later movie houses. It was responsible for censoring the content of not only theatrical performances and movies, but of all literature in the city ranging from books and magazines to posters and advertising.\n\nThe Toronto Police also suppressed [[labour movement]]s which were perceived as [[anarchism|anarchist]] threats. The establishment of the mounted unit is directly related to the four-month Toronto streetcar strike of 1886, when authorities called on the Governor General's Horse Guard Regiment to assist in suppressing the strike.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Toronto Railway Co. streetcar, Yonge and Adelaide streets.jpg|thumb|A constable overlooks construction for [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar lines]] on Adelaide and [[Yonge Street]], 1911.]]\nAs for serious criminal investigations, the Toronto Police frequently (but not always) contracted with private investigators from the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton's Detective Agency]] until the 20th century, when it developed its own internal investigation and intelligence capacity.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, the Toronto Police under [[Chief Constable]] [[Dennis Draper|Dennis \"Deny\" Draper]], a retired [[Brigadier General]] and former [[Conservative Party of Canada (historic)|Conservative]] candidate, returned to its function as an agency to suppress political dissent. Its notorious \"[[Red Squad]]\" brutally dispersed demonstrations by labour unions and by unemployed and homeless people during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Suspicious of \"foreigners\", the police lobbied the city of Toronto to pass legislation banning public speeches in languages other than English, curtailing union organization among Toronto's vast immigrant populations working in sweat shops.\n\nAfter several scandals, including a call by Chief Draper to have reporters \"shot\" and his being arrested driving drunk, the city appointed in 1948 a new Police Chief from its own ranks for the first time in the department's history: [[John Chisholm (police chief)|John Chisholm]], a very able senior police inspector. In 1955, the Metropolitan Toronto Board of Police Commissioners was formed in preparation for the amalgamation of the 13 police forces in the municipality, [[Metropolitan Toronto]], into a unified police force with Chisholm as chief of the unified force. Unfortunately, Chisholm was not up to the politics of the Chief's office, especially in facing off with [[Fred Gardiner|Fred \"Big Daddy\" Gardiner]], who engineered almost single-handedly the formation of [[Metropolitan Toronto]] in the 1950s.\n\nOn January 1, 1957, the Toronto Police merged with the other municipal forces in the metropolitan area to form the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force:<ref>{{Cite canlaw|short title  =The Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Amendment Act, 1956|abbr =S.O.|year =1956|chapter =53|section =18|link=https://archive.org/stream/statutesofprovin1956onta#page/246/mode/2up}}</ref>\n[[File:East York Police and Fire Departments.jpg|thumb|An East York Police and Fire Station.

In 1958, after a number of conflicts with Gardiner and members of the newly expanded [[Toronto Police Services Board|Metropolitan Toronto Board of Police Commissioners]], Chief Chisholm drove to High Park on the city's west end, parked his car and committed suicide with his service revolver.

It was set up under a social purist pretext of policing people's everyday behaviours so that Toronto might live up to Howland's moniker. Among the offences, though not necessarily crimes, that morality officers policed were gambling, \"[[blue law]]s\" or \"Sabbath laws\", being an absentee father, drug dealing, interracial relationships, homosexuality, bootlegging and alcoholism, [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]], family abuse and prostitution.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.blogto.com/city/2011/01/nostalgia_tripping_torontos_morality_police/|title=Nostalgia Tripping: Toronto's Morality Police|work=blogTO|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://torontopubliclibrary.typepad.com/trl/2017/04/vice-virtue-policing-morality.html|title=Vice & Virtue: Policing Morality in Toronto|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}</ref> The people in power who wrote these laws, such as Howland, and created the morality department said that they were there to protect moral and good people from the evils of the city. However, when examining the direct implementation/enforcement of these laws, and the effects they had on civilian life,  the larger purpose of the morality department was to prevent working-class people from socializing or coming together, and thereby to keep them in a generally less powerful position.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.russianbooks.org/crime/cph6.htm|title=HISTORY OF THE TORONTO POLICE PART 4: 1875 - 1920|website=www.russianbooks.org|access-date=2018-03-09}}</ref>\n\n===== Context =====\nThe roots of this social purity doctrine can be traced back to the belief in the good of British colonialism, ideas still holding strong in the late 19th century in Canada, as Canada's national identity was still strongly linked to British ideals. The assumption is that bad people behave objectively badly, and that these people need to made good by a sovereign government.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Jabbar|first=Naheem|date=2012-12-01|title=Policing native pleasures: a colonial history|journal=The British Journal of Sociology|language=en|volume=63|issue=4|pages=704\u2013729|doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2012.01433.x|pmid=23240839|issn=1468-4446}}</ref> This government does so by limiting the civilian population's freedoms and regulating their social interactions to ensure that people remain \"moral and good\", and thereby can make a new generation of \"moral and good\" people. Of course everyone would fall under these practices who was not seen to be morally, or socially, good, but women and people of colour were seen by the government as inherently lesser or more susceptible to temptation or sin, and so they were policed far more heavily than their white or male counterparts. The resulting system of social governing, was easily abused to keep a divide between classes wide, through methods like disproportionately enforcing the laws when the accused were of lower classes, making special exemptions for people who lived or served those who lived in the higher classes.<ref name=\":3\" /> And, once again, since women and people of colour were seen as inherently more susceptible to temptation, they were automatically made targets of the system's efforts to socially reform people.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===== Methods and effectiveness =====\nThe officers' methods often, called for them to threaten fines or jail time rather than arrest all offenders, which made them popular among people as a social service. People knew that they probably would not be arrested or get the unwanted publicity that goes along with being arrested and going through the public courts. In this way, these officers became regulators of the community. Ordinary people  interacted with them, and thereby came to trust them. As a result, these officers had many people willing to give them information on who might be a suspected drug dealer, prostitute, gambler or absentee father.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===== Prostitution =====\nThe primary focus of the anti-prostitution laws was to make prostitution unprofitable so that women would instead pursue legitimate ways to make money. In essence, the people who put these laws in place were attempting to save women from a life of prostitution. The legitimate forms of employment were few and far between; maid, secretary and factory worker were the only plentiful options, and each of those put women in a position where they were constantly subordinate to another.<ref name=\":1\" /> Prostitution had a much wider definition to the social purists of the time than it does now. For example, if a man bought a woman dinner and the woman then went home with him, that was considered prostitution. Thus, any women, and especially working-class women without social standing, who sought out men were persecuted, though not prosecuted. Seemingly innocuous behaviours, such as walking alone at night, might also get a woman arrested for prostitution.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===== Sabbath laws =====\nThe Sabbath laws (alternatively known as \"blue laws\") were a series of laws designed to prevent people from working on the [[Sabbath]], commonly known as Sunday, to respect the [[God in Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic God]]'s day of rest. They, like most laws enforced by the morality department, disproportionately affected working-class people and favoured the upper class. One of the best examples of this was the fact that taxis used by the public to get around were not allowed to work on Sunday, but private chauffeurs of the wealthy were. Beyond preventing many forms of work, they also prevented people from doing certain leisure activities that could be interpreted as work. Similar to the taxi driver\u2013chauffeur contradiction, ball games for children in public on Sundays but still allowing for games of golf at private clubs. Such contradictions led people to believe that these laws were put in place to prevent working-class people from consorting with each other, to keep them separate and easy to manage.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===== Absentee fathers =====\nFor most of their operating time, the majority of their work was finding absentee fathers from Canada, the U.S. and Great Britain, and then coercing them into paying maintenance payments. These maintenance payments would go towards supporting their wives and children. This re-enforced a family structure where the father was a provider and the mother was unable to support herself or her family. As attitudes towards policing among the upper ranks moved away from social management and into crime and punishment in the 1920s, it came to be that the police and social activist groups alike agreed that this work was no longer a job for the police. In 1929, the newly established family court system took over the management of these payments.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===== First women on the force=====\nMorality officer was one of the first roles within the police force, not including secretary, that women were allowed to fulfill. In the early 1910s, they were brought in under the idea that they would be better suited to deal with young women who had been acting immorally, and that they would themselves be a moralizing influence in the police service. Also, the existence of policewomen was an encouragement for women to come forward with assault charges against their abusive husbands. Women would trust that if they went to a police officer who was also female, then something would be more likely to get done.<ref name=\":0\" /> Yet, the majority of their duties included arresting and searching female suspects, and interviewing female suspects and victims. As well, rather than being on the beat in dangerous parts of town, they would be searching for people, though mostly women, acting immorally, particularly in places where men and women came together. They were never tasked the same duties as their male counterparts, and so were seen more as social workers within the police force than actual members of the force. Through the 1920s, feminists argued that these policewomen were taken on by police for show more than to be actual policewomen, and interest from the upper ranks in policewomen faded along with their interest in social management, since the upper ranks saw the two as being deeply connected. Few more women were taken on until after [[World War II]], and those that were there gained little ground for women in the police force.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====School crossing guards====\nAdult crossing guards at various intersections and crosswalks are employed and paid by the Toronto Police Service. They are under charge by various division across the city. Besides wearing the reflective vest (yellow and orange), crossing guards are supplied with police issue jackets. The jackets have a patch similar to those of the Toronto Police Service, but it has a white background and identification as school crossing guards. A winter hat similar to the [[Ushanka]] is worn in cold weather.\n\n==Ranks==\nThe rank insignia of the Toronto Police Service is similar to that used by police services elsewhere in Canada and in the United Kingdom, except that the usual \"pips\" are replaced by maple leaves. The St. Edward's Crown is found on insignia of staff sergeant, all superintendent ranks and all commanding officer ranks.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Rank\n! colspan=\"2\" |Commanding officers\n! colspan=\"4\" |Senior officers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Police officers\n!Officer in training\n|-\n!Chief of police\n!Deputy chief of police\n!Staff superintendent\n!Superintendent\n!Staff inspector\n!Inspector\n!Staff sergeant\n!Sergeant\n!Constable\n!Cadet\n|-\n!Insignia\n(Slip-on)\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Chief of Police.png|center|frameless|129x129px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Deputy Chief of Police.png|center|frameless|129x129px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Staff Superintendent.png|center|frameless|129x129px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Superintendent.png|center|frameless|129x129px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Staff Inspector.png|center|frameless|129x129px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Inspector.png|center|frameless|129x129px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Staff Sergeant.png|center|frameless|129x129px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Sergeant.png|center|frameless|129x129px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Constable.png|center|frameless|129x129px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Cadet.png|center|frameless|129x129px]]\n|-\n!Insignia\n(Shoulder board)\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Chief of Police (SB).png|center|frameless|187x187px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Deputy Chief of Police (SB).png|center|frameless|187x187px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Staff Superintendent (SB).png|center|frameless|187x187px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Superintendent (SB).png|center|frameless|187x187px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Staff Inspector (SB).png|center|frameless|187x187px]]\n|[[File:Toronto Police - Inspector (SB).png|center|frameless|187x187px]]\n| colspan=\"4\" |Shoulder boards not used for these ranks\n|}\n\n===Commanding officers===\nBesides the chief of police, the other command officers are the deputy chiefs.

The initial training is three weeks, followed by 12 weeks at the [[Ontario Police College]] in [[Aylmer, Ontario]] and then nine weeks of final training at Toronto Police College. [[Charles O. Bick College]] was closed in July 2009. In August 2018, TPS acquired TTC Orion VII buses 7900-7905 for purposes such as roadblocks, mass transport and training. These units are now numbered ES-0 through ES-5. ES stands for Events Support. The following units were painted black  prior to being sent to TPS. In November 2018, these units were repainted in a gray and white livery similar to the LFLRV livery on TTC vehicles. The following units are maintained and stored by the TTC. They are currently stored at Birchmount Garage in Scarborough.\n\n==Uniform==\n[[File:Torontos finest.jpg|thumb|A members of the Toronto Police bicycle unit (wearing a yellow reflective jacket) with another officer dressed in typical winter dress (centre), which includes a fur trim Yukon hat.]]\nFront line officers wear dark navy blue shirts, cargo pants (with red stripe) and boots. Winter jackets are either dark navy blue jacket design\u2013[[Eisenhower jacket|Eisenhower]] style, single breasted front closing, two patch type breast pockets, shoulder straps, gold buttons\u2014or yellow windbreaker style with the word POLICE in reflective silver and black at the back (generally worn by the bicycle and traffic services units). All ranks shall wear dark navy blue clip on ties when wearing long-sleeve uniforms.\n\nHats can be styled after [[baseball cap]]s, [[combination cap]]s, or fur trim Yukon (similar to the [[Ushanka]]) hats for winter. Motorcycle units have white helmets. Black or reflective yellow gloves are also provided to officers with Traffic Services. Front line officers usually wear combination caps since that is the location of their badge. Prior to the 1990s, female officers wore bowler caps instead of combination caps. Auxiliary officers wear combination caps with a checkered red and black band. The Mounted Unit wear black [[Canadian military fur wedge cap]] during the winter months and [[custodian helmet]] for ceremonial use.\n\nAs is the case with all Ontario law enforcement officers, uniformed officers wear name tags. They are in the style of \"A. Example\" where the first letter of the first name is written and the last name next to it. Name tags are usually stitched on with white stitching on a black background, but they also have pin-styled with black lettering on a gold plate.\n\nSenior officers wear white shirts and a black Eisenhower style jacket. Auxiliary officers wear light blue shirts (long sleeve for winter and short for summer), with the badging of auxiliary on the bottom of the crest. Originally front line officer also wore light blue shirts but changed to the current navy blue shirts in the Fall of 2000.\n\n==Logo==\nThe Toronto Police Service logo is very similar to the old Metropolitan Toronto Police logo, and it includes the following components:\n* winged wheels of industry on the top part of the shield, representing transportation\n* a crown commemorating the coronation year of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953\n* two books representing education or knowledge\n* a [[caduceus]] (herald's staff), which is associated with Mercury, the protector of commerce\n* a chevron for housing\n* on either side of the shield, a sheaf with a [[White Rose of York|York Rose]], representing [[York County, Ontario]], which Toronto served as county seat from 1834 to 1953\n* a circular ribbon with the words \"Toronto Police\"\n* a beaver representing industry and/or Canada, from the old and new [[coat of arms of Toronto]]\n\nThe shield in the Toronto Police Service logo is the same as the [[coat of arms]] of the former Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.<ref>{{cite web |title= Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto arms |url= http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=1527&ProjectElementID=5122 |website= Official website of the Governor General |access-date= 29 January 2018}}</ref> The TPS logo is also similar to the emblem of the former [[Toronto District School Board#Metropolitan Toronto School Board and the Toronto District School Board|Metropolitan Toronto School Board]]. Prior to the formation of the Metropolitan Toronto Police, the Toronto Police Department officers wore a generic Scully badge on their caps, a common shield used by Canadian police forces in the 19th century and early 20th century. This featured a metallic maple leaf with a beaver and crown.\n\n==Fleet==\nPolice cars, also known as police ''cruisers'', are the standard equipment used by Toronto Police officers for transportation. The vehicles would include a rotator lightbar as it's Emergency vehicle lighting, which is still popular with the TPS. They seem to not plan to change the lightbar, although some vehicles include a non-rotating lightbar. The vehicles are numbered in regards to their division and car number. For example, 3322 represents that the vehicle is from 33 Division, and the following 22 is the vehicle designation number.\n\nCurrent fleet have a white base with red and blue markings and stealth vehicles are grey with reflective markings. Beginning in 2016, the Toronto Police Service is planning to replace the current colour scheme with grey or blue base with white reflective markings.<ref name=\"thestar.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/09/20/why-toronto-police-are-changing-the-colour-of-their-cruisers.html|title=Why Toronto police are changing the colour of their scout cars - The Star|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nPrevious scheme was yellow base with blue lettering.\n\nOther fleet numbering patterns include:\n{{col div}}\n* All Terrain Vehicle \u2014 ##ATVXX (## would be the Division number)\n* Area Field Command Unit \u2014 AFCXX\n* Bail Compliance Unit \u2014 BCUXX\n* Bike Patrol Unit \u2014 ##BXX (## would be the Division number)\n* Central Field Command \u2014 CFCXX\n* Chief of Police \u2014 CHIEF\n* Command Vehicles \u2014 COMDXX\n* Court Services \u2014 CRTXX\n* Courier \u2014 RMSXX\n* Duty Officer (highest ranking inspector on shift) - DUTYXX\n* Emergency Task Force \u2014 ETFXX\n* Forensic Identification Services \u2014 FISXX\n* Information Technology Services \u2014 ITSXX\n* Marine Unit \u2014 MUXX\n* Mounted Unit Services \u2014 MTDXX\n* Parking Enforcement \u2014 PKEXX (East) / PKWXX (West)\n* Police Dog Services \u2014 PDSXX\n* Primary Response Group \u2014 87XX\n* Public Safety Response Team (replaced TAVIS) \u2014 PSRTXX\n* Public Safety Unit \u2014 PSUXX\n* School Resource Officer \u2014 SROXX\n* (Marine) Service Vehicle \u2014 SRVX\n* Spare Vehicles \u2014 7XX\n* Supervisor Vehicles \u2014 ##SX (## would be the Division number or Unit Identifier)\n* Toronto Police Tow Trucks \u2014 8XX\n* Traffic Services \u2014 6XXX / 80XX (Stealth)\n* Video Services Unit \u2014 VSUXX\n{{col div end}}\n\n===Motor vehicles===\n[[File:PSRT02 Toronto.jpg|thumb|A Toronto Police uses a number of vehicles including the [[Ford Explorer#Ford Police Interceptor Utility|Ford Explorer Interceptor]] (left) and a [[Ford Taurus (sixth generation)#Police Interceptor Sedan|Ford Taurus Interceptor]] (right).]]\nThe Toronto Police Service has about 500 vehicles in their fleet.<ref name=\"thestar.com\"/>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |\n|-\n!Make/model\n!Type\n!Origin\n|-\n| Chevrolet [[Chevrolet Cavalier|Cavalier]]\n| Parking Enforcement, Document Services Section\n| {{MEX}}/{{USA}}\n|-\n| Chevrolet [[Chevrolet Malibu|Malibu]] (2001\u20132005)\n| Community Sweeper Unit car\n| {{USA}}\n|-\n| Chevrolet Malibu (2006)\n| Parking Enforcement Unit\n| {{CAN}}\n|-\n| Dodge [[Dodge Neon|Neon]]\n| Parking Enforcement, Document Services Section\n| {{USA}}\n|-\n| [[Smart fortwo]]\n| Parking Enforcement car\n| {{FRA}}\n|-\n| [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Crown Victoria]]\n| (marked) General police vehicle, Traffic Services, Community Sweeper Unit\n| {{CAN}}\n|-\n| [[Ford]] [[Ford Focus (North America)|Focus]]\n| Parking Enforcement car\n| {{USA}}\n|-\n| Ford [[Ford Interceptor Sedan (sixth generation)#Police Interceptor Sedan]]\n| (marked) General police vehicle\n| {{USA}}\n|-\n| [[Ford Interceptor Utility]]\n| (marked) Supervisor Truck, Traffic Services, Special Operations\n| {{USA}}\n|-\n| [[Volkswagen]] [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]]\n| Safety Bug car\n| {{MEX}}\n|-\n| [[Honda]] [[Honda Civic|Civic]]/[[Civic Hybrid]]\n| Parking Enforcement car\n| {{CAN}}/{{JPN}}\n|-\n| [[Harley-Davidson]] [[Harley-Davidson FLHTP|FLHTP]]\n| motorcycle\n| {{USA}}\n|}\n\n===Watercraft===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |\n|-\n!Unit #\n!Make\n!Type\n|-\n| Marine Unit 1\n| [[Hike Metal Products|Hike Industry]] (Wheatley ON)\n|Dive Platform & Command Vessel marine boat with [[Volvo Penta]] Turbo Chargd {{convert|350|hp|abbr=on}} engines and crane.\n|-\n| Marine Unit 3\n| Tyler Nelson design built by Bristol Marine (Port Credit ON)\n| 400&nbsp;hp Long Range Search and Rescue Vessel\n|-\n| Marine Unit 4\n| [[Hike Metal Products|Hike Industry]]\n| patrol boat\n|-\n| Marine Unit MTB 5\n| James J.

Since he left no explanation for the move{{efn|Mainwaring gives the cryptic explanation that since he had to earn a living from his profession, he had to find a place less distant than Berlin.

Burrows believes that the answer can be found by untangling Mainwaring's confused chronology of the trip to Berlin. Burrows dates this trip to 1702 or 1703 (after his father's death) and concluded that since Handel (through a \"friend and relation\" at the Berlin court) turned down Frederick's offer to subsidize his musical education in Italy (with the implicit understanding that he would become a court musician on his return), Handel was no longer able to expect preferment (whether as musician, lawyer or otherwise) within Brandenburg-Prussia. And since he was attracted to secular, dramatic music (by meeting the Italians Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti and through the influence of Telemann), Hamburg, a free city with an established opera company, was the logical choice.{{sfn|Burrows|1994|pp=11\u201313}} The question remains, however, why Handel rejected the King's offer, given that Italy was the center of opera. Lang suggests that, influenced by the teachings of Thomasius, Handel's character was such that he was unable to make himself subservient to anyone, even a king. Lang sees Handel as someone who could not accept class distinctions that required him to regard himself as a social inferior. \"What Handel craved was personal freedom to raise himself out of his provincial milieu to a life of culture.\"{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=26}} Burrows notes that like his father, Handel was able to accept royal (and aristocratic) favors without considering himself a court servant.{{sfn|Burrows|1994|p=12}} And so given the embarrassed financial condition of his mother,{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|p=29}} Handel set off for Hamburg to obtain experience while supporting himself.\n\nIn 1703 he accepted a position as violinist and harpsichordist in the orchestra of the Hamburg [[Oper am G\u00e4nsemarkt]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=18}}</ref> There he met the composers [[Johann Mattheson]], [[Christoph Graupner]] and [[Reinhard Keiser]].

It is unclear whether Handel directed these performances.\n\n[[File:Teatro niccolini 11.JPG|thumb|upright|Entrance of Teatro del Cocomero in Florence]]\nAccording to Mainwaring, in 1706 Handel travelled to Italy at the invitation of [[Ferdinando (III) de' Medici|Ferdinando de' Medici]]. Other sources say Handel was invited by [[Gian Gastone de' Medici]], whom Handel had met in 1703\u20131704 in Hamburg.{{sfn|Harris|2001|p=37}} De' Medici {{which|date=October 2019}}, who had a keen interest in opera, was trying to make Florence Italy's musical capital by attracting the leading talents of his day. In Italy Handel met [[librettist]] [[Antonio Salvi]], with whom he later collaborated. Handel left for Rome and, since opera was (temporarily) banned in the [[Papal States]], composed sacred music for the Roman clergy. His famous ''[[Dixit Dominus (Handel)|Dixit Dominus]]'' (1707) is from this era.

Among the works with opus numbers published and popularised in his lifetime are the [[Organ concertos, Op. 4 (Handel)|Organ concertos Op. 4]] and [[Organ concertos, Op. 7 (Handel)|Op. 7]], together with the [[Concerti Grossi, Op. 3 (Handel)|Opus 3]] and [[Concerti grossi, Op. 6 (Handel)|Opus 6 Concerti grossi]]; the latter incorporate an earlier organ concerto ''The Cuckoo and the Nightingale'' in which birdsong is imitated in the upper registers of the organ. Also notable are his 16 keyboard suites, especially ''[[The Harmonious Blacksmith]]''.\n\nHandel introduced previously uncommon musical instruments in his works: the [[viola d'amore]] and [[violetta marina]] (''Orlando''), the lute (''Ode for St. Cecilia's Day''), three trombones (''Saul''), clarinets or small high cornetts (''Tamerlano''), [[theorbo]], French horn (''[[Water Music]]''), lyrichord, [[double bassoon]], [[viola da gamba]], [[carillon]] (bell chimes), [[positive organ]], and harp (''Giulio Cesare'', ''Alexander's Feast'').<ref>Textbook in CD ''Sacred Arias with Harp & Harp Duets by Rachel Ann Morgan & Edward Witsenburg.</ref>\n\n=== Catalogues ===\nThe first published catalogue of Handel's works appeared as an appendix to Mainwaring's ''Memoirs''.{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|pp=145\u201355}} Between 1787 and 1797 [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]] compiled a 180-volume collection of Handel's works\u2014however, it was far from complete.{{sfn|Dean|1982|p=116}} Also incomplete was the collection produced between 1843 and 1858 by the English Handel Society (founded by [[George Alexander Macfarren|Sir George Macfarren]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.handel-edition.com/history.htm |title=A short history of editing Handel |author=The Halle Handel Edition |accessdate=3 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303114021/http://www.handel-edition.com/history.htm |archivedate=3 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe 105-volume ''[[H\u00e4ndel-Gesellschaft]]'' (\"Handel Society\") edition was published between 1858 and 1902 \u2013 mainly due to the efforts of [[Friedrich Chrysander]]. For modern performance, the realisation of the basso continuo reflects 19th century practice. Vocal scores drawn from the edition were published by [[Novello & Co|Novello]] in London, but some scores, such as the vocal score to ''Samson'', are incomplete.\n\nThe continuing ''[[Hallische H\u00e4ndel-Ausgabe]]'' edition was first inaugurated in 1955 in the [[Halle (region)|Halle]] region in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], Eastern Germany. It did not start as a critical edition, but after heavy criticism of the first volumes, which were performing editions without a critical apparatus (for example, the opera ''Serse'' was published with the title character recast as a tenor, reflecting pre-war German practice), it repositioned itself as a critical edition. Influenced in part by cold-war realities, editorial work was inconsistent: misprints are found in abundance and editors failed to consult important sources. In 1985 a committee was formed to establish better standards for the edition. The unification of Germany in 1990 removed communication problems, and the volumes issued have since shown a significant improvement in standards.{{sfn|Hicks|2013}}\n\nBetween 1978 and 1986 the German academic [[Bernd Baselt]] catalogued Handel's works in his ''[[H\u00e4ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis]]'' publication. The catalogue has achieved wide acceptance and is used as the modern numbering system, with each of Handel's works designated an \"HWV\" number, for example ''Messiah'' is catalogued as \"HWV 56\".\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Masquerade at the King's Theatre Haymarket c1724.jpg|thumb|A Masquerade at the King's Theatre, Haymarket (c. 1724)]]\nHandel's works were collected and preserved by two men: [[Sir Samuel Hellier]], a country squire whose musical acquisitions form the nucleus of the Shaw-Hellier Collection,<ref>Best, Terence, ed.

The oratorios continued to be performed but not long after Handel's death they were thought to need some modernisation, and Mozart orchestrated German versions of ''Messiah'' and other works. Throughout the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, particularly in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries, his reputation rested primarily on his English oratorios, which were customarily performed by choruses of amateur singers on solemn occasions.  The centenary of his death, in 1859, was celebrated by a performance of ''Messiah'' at [[The Crystal Palace]], involving 2,765 singers and 460 instrumentalists, who played for an audience of about 10,000 people.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blyth|first1=Alan|authorlink=Alan Blyth|title=Choral Music on Record|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=82}}</ref>\n{{Listen\n|type=music\n|filename=Handel - Zadok the Priest.ogg\n|title=Zadok the Priest (1727)\n|description=Composed for the coronation of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] in 1727, ''[[Zadok the Priest]]'' has been performed at every subsequent [[British coronation]]}}\nRecent decades have revived his secular cantatas and what one might call 'secular oratorios' or 'concert operas'. Of the former, ''[[Ode for St. Cecilia's Day]]'' (1739) (set to texts by [[John Dryden]]) and ''[[Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne]]'' (1713) are noteworthy. For his secular oratorios, Handel turned to classical mythology for subjects, producing such works as ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'' (1719), ''[[Hercules (Handel)|Hercules]]'' (1745) and ''[[Semele (Handel)|Semele]]'' (1744). These works have a close kinship with the sacred oratorios, particularly in the vocal writing for the English-language texts. They also share the lyrical and dramatic qualities of Handel's Italian operas. As such, they are sometimes fully staged as operas. With the rediscovery of his theatrical works, Handel, in addition to his renown as instrumentalist, orchestral writer, and melodist, is now perceived as being one of opera's great musical dramatists.\n\nThe original form of his name, Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel, is generally used in Germany and elsewhere, but he is known as \"Haendel\" in France. A different composer, Jacob Handl or H\u00e4ndl (1550\u20131591) is usually known by the Latin form [[Jacobus Gallus]] that appears in his publications.\n\n=== Reception ===\nHandel has generally been accorded high esteem by fellow composers, both in his own time and since.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/01_january/13/composer6.shtml |title=BBC Press Release |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=13 January 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127140028/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/01_january/13/composer6.shtml |archivedate=27 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] attempted, unsuccessfully, to meet Handel while he was visiting [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dent|2004|p=23}}</ref> [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] is reputed to have said of him, \"Handel understands [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] better than any of us.

Summarising the field in 2005, [[Richard Taruskin]] wrote that Handel \"seems to have been the champion of all [[Parody music|parodists]], adapting both his own works and those of other composers in unparalleled numbers and with unparalleled exactitude.\"<ref>[[Richard Taruskin]], ''The Oxford History of Western Music'', Oxford University Press, 2005, vol. 2, chapter 26, p. 329, {{ISBN|0195222717}}</ref> Among the composers whose music has been shown to have been re-used by Handel are [[Alessandro Stradella]], [[Gottlieb Muffat]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]]<ref>Alexander Silbiger, \"Scarlatti Borrowings in Handel's Grand Concertos\", ''[[The Musical Times]]'', v. 125, 1984, pp. 93\u201394</ref> [[Giacomo Carissimi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Carl Heinrich Graun]], [[Leonardo Vinci]], [[Jacobus Gallus]], [[Francesco Antonio Urio]], [[Reinhard Keiser]], [[Francesco Gasparini]], [[Giovanni Bononcini]], [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]], [[Henry Lawes]], [[Michael Wise]], [[Agostino Steffani]], Franz Johann Habermann, and numerous others.<ref>A comprehensive bibliography through 2005 can be found in Mary Anne Parker, ''G.

Roberts demonstrated that Handel's borrowings were unusually frequent even for his own era, enough to have been criticised by contemporaries (notably [[Johann Mattheson]]); Roberts suggested several reasons for Handel's practice, including Handel's attempts to make certain works sound more up-to-date and more radically, his \"basic lack of facility in inventing original ideas\" \u2013 though Roberts took care to argue that this does not \"diminish Handel's stature\", which should be \"judged not by his methods, still less by his motives in employing them, but solely by the effects he achieves.\"<ref>John H.

The first movement from [[Louis Spohr]]'s ''Symphony No. 6'', Op. 116, \"The Age of Bach and Handel\", resembles two melodies from Handel's ''Messiah''. In 1797 [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] published the ''12 Variations in G major on \u2018See the conqu\u2019ring hero comes\u2019 from Judas Maccabaeus by Handel'', for cello and piano. In 1822 Beethoven composed ''[[The Consecration of the House]]'' overture, which also bears the influence of Handel. Guitar virtuoso [[Mauro Giuliani]] composed his ''Variations on a Theme by Handel, Op. 107'' for guitar, based on Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major, HWV 430, for harpsichord.\n[[File:Handel-Westminster.png|thumb|left|upright|Handel's monument in Westminster Abbey with the plaque recording his [[Handel Commemoration|commemoration]] in 1784]]\nIn 1861, using a theme from the second of Handel's harpsichord suites, [[Johannes Brahms]] wrote the ''[[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel]]'', Op. 24, one of his most successful works (praised by [[Richard Wagner]]).  Several works by the French composer [[F\u00e9lix-Alexandre Guilmant]] use Handel's themes, for example his ''March on a Theme by Handel'' uses a theme from ''Messiah''. French composer and flautist [[Philippe Gaubert]] wrote his ''Petite marche'' for flute and piano based on the fourth movement of Handel's Trio Sonata, Op. 5, No. 2, HWV 397. [[Argentine people|Argentine]] composer Luis Gianneo composed his ''Variations on a Theme by Handel'' for piano. In 1911, Australian-born composer and pianist [[Percy Grainger]] based one of his most famous works on the final movement of Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major (just like Giuliani). He first wrote some variations on the theme, which he titled ''Variations on Handel's 'The Harmonious Blacksmith' ''. Then he used the first sixteen bars of his set of variations to create ''Handel in the Strand'', one of his most beloved pieces, of which he made several versions (for example, the piano solo version from 1930). [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra in B-flat major (1933) was composed after Handel's Concerto Grosso, Op. 6/7.<ref>Auner Joseph H.

In the [[Calendar of saints (Lutheran)|Lutheran Calendar of Saints]] Handel and Bach share that date with [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], and Handel and Bach are commemorated in the calendar of saints prepared by the [[Order of Saint Luke]] for the use of the [[United Methodist Church]].<ref>''For All the Saints: A Calendar of Commemorations for United Methodists'', ed. by Clifton F.

Handel received important training in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and worked as a composer in [[Hamburg]] and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he [[Handel's Naturalisation Act 1727|became a naturalised British subject in 1727]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/parliamentary-archives/archives-highlights/handel-and-naturalisation/ |title=British Citizen by Act of Parliament: George Frideric Handel |publisher=Parliament.uk |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504101508/http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/parliamentary-archives/archives-highlights/handel-and-naturalisation/ |archivedate=4 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the [[Italian Baroque]] and by the middle-German [[polyphony|polyphonic]] choral tradition.\n\nWithin fifteen years, Handel had started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera. Musicologist [[Winton Dean]] writes that his operas show that \"Handel was not only a great composer; he was a dramatic genius of the first order.\"{{sfn|Dean|1969|p=19}} As ''[[Alexander's Feast (Handel)|Alexander's Feast]]'' (1736) was well received, Handel made a transition to English choral works. After his success with ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) he never composed an Italian opera again. Almost blind, and having lived in England for nearly fifty years, he died in 1759, a respected and rich man. His funeral was given full state honours, and he was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] in London.\n\nBorn the same year as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Domenico Scarlatti]], Handel is regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Baroque era, with works such as ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', ''[[Water Music]]'', and ''[[Music for the Royal Fireworks]]'' remaining steadfastly popular.{{sfn|Buelow|2004|p=476}} One of his four [[Coronation Anthems (Handel)|coronation anthems]], ''[[Zadok the Priest]]'' (1727), composed for the coronation of [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], has been performed at every subsequent [[Coronation of the British monarch|British coronation]], traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. Another of his English oratorios, ''[[Solomon (Handel)|Solomon]]'' (1748), has also remained popular, with the Sinfonia that opens act 3 (known more commonly as \"The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba\") featuring at the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2012 London Olympics opening ceremony]]. Handel composed more than forty [[opera seria]]s in over thirty years, and since the late 1960s, with the revival of baroque music and [[historically informed performance|historically informed musical performance]], interest in Handel's operas has grown.\n\n== Early years ==\n\n=== Family ===\n[[File:George Frideric Handel baptismal register.jpg|thumb|Handel's baptismal registration (Marienbibliothek in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]])]]\n\nHandel was born in 1685 in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], [[Duchy of Magdeburg]] (then part of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]), to [[Georg H\u00e4ndel]] and Dorothea Taust.<ref>{{harvnb|Deutsch|1955|p=1}}</ref> His father, aged sixty-three when George Frideric was born, was an eminent barber-surgeon who served the court of [[Saxe-Weissenfels]] and the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].{{sfn|Adams|Hofest\u00e4dt|2005|pp=144\u201346}}\n\nGeorg H\u00e4ndel was the son of a [[coppersmith]], Valentin H\u00e4ndel (1582\u20131636), who had emigrated from [[Eisleben]] in 1608 with his first wife Anna Belching, the daughter of a master coppersmith. They were Protestants and chose reliably Protestant Saxony over [[Silesia]], a [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] possession, as religious tensions mounted in the years before the [[Thirty Years War]].{{sfn|Adams|Hofest\u00e4dt|2005|p=144}} Halle was a relatively prosperous city, home of a salt-mining industry and center of trade (and member of the [[Hanseatic League]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Adams|Hofest\u00e4dt|2005|p=144}}; {{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=1}}.</ref> The Margrave of Brandenburg became the administrator of the archiepiscopal territories of [[Mainz]], including [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]] when they converted, and by the early 17th century held his court in Halle, which attracted renowned musicians.{{efn|Among the court musicians of Halle were [[Samuel Scheidt]] (who also was organist at the Moritzkirche), [[William Brade]] and [[Michael Praetorius]].{{sfn|Burrows|1994|p=1}}}} Even the smaller churches all had \"able organists and fair choirs\",{{efn|Halle also was noted for the quality of its organ-builders.

Georg H\u00e4ndel (senior) was born at the beginning of the war, and was apprenticed to a barber in Halle at the age of 14, after his father died.{{efn|This barber, Andreas Berger, happened to be the son-in-law of English ''\u00e9migr\u00e9'' William Brade, court musician to Augustus in Weissenfels.{{sfn|Adams|Hofest\u00e4dt|2005|p=144}}}} When he was 20, he married the widow of the official barber-surgeon of a suburb of Halle, inheriting his practice. With this, Georg determinedly began the process of becoming self-made; by dint of his \"conservative, steady, thrifty, unadventurous\" lifestyle,{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=10}} he guided the five children he had with Anna who reached adulthood into the medical profession (except his youngest daughter, who married a government official).{{sfn|Adams|Hofest\u00e4dt|2005|pp=144\u201345}} Anna died in 1682.

Mainwaring is the source for almost all information (little as it is) of Handel's childhood, and much of that information came from J.C. Smith, Jr., Handel's confidant and copyist.<ref>{{harvnb|Landon|1984|p=10}}; {{harvnb|Schoelcher|1857|p=7 n.1}}.</ref> Whether it came from Smith or elsewhere, Mainwaring frequently relates misinformation.{{efn|Both Landon and Hogwood point out and to the extent possible correct the more obvious misstatements of facts and dates and inconsistencies of Mainwaring. ''See'' {{harvnb|Landon|1984|pp=9\u201319}}; {{harvnb|Hogwood|1984|pp=11\u201317}}.}} It is from Mainwaring that the portrait comes of Handel's father as implacably opposed to any musical education. Mainwaring writes that Georg H\u00e4ndel was \"alarmed\" at Handel's very early propensity for music,{{efn|[[Victor Sch\u0153lcher|Schoelcher]] suggests that Handel's \"doctor\" father observed Handel making musical sounds even before he could talk and this in the eyes of the son of a coppersmith \"discovered instincts of so low an order \u2026\"{{sfn|Schoelcher|1857|p=3}}}} \"took every measure to oppose it\", including forbidding any musical instrument in the house and preventing Handel from going to any house where they might be found.{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|pp=4\u20135}} This did nothing to dampen young Handel's inclination; in fact, it did the reverse. Mainwaring tells the story of Handel's secret attic [[spinet]]: Handel \"found means to get a little [[clavichord]] privately convey'd to a room at the top of the house. To this room he constantly stole when the family was asleep\".{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|p=5}} Although both [[John Hawkins (author)|John Hawkins]] and [[Charles Burney]] credited this tale, Schoelcher found it nearly \"incredible\" and a feat of \"poetic imagination\"{{sfn|Schoelcher|1857|p=4}} and Lang considers it one of the unproven \"romantic stories\" that surrounded Handel's childhood.{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=11}} But Handel had to have had some experience with the keyboard to have made the impression in Weissenfels that resulted in his receiving formal musical training.{{sfn|Dent|2004|pp=3\u20134}}\n\n=== Musical education ===\nSometime between the ages of seven and nine, Handel accompanied his father to [[Weissenfels]] where he came under the notice of one whom Handel thereafter always regarded throughout life as his benefactor,{{sfn|Schoelcher|1857|p=5}} [[Johann Adolf I, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels|Duke Johann Adolf I]].{{efn|The year and purpose of the visit and why the meeting occurred is variously given.

Telemann recalled forty years later in an autobiography for Mattheson's ''Grundlage'': \"The writing of the excellent Johann Kuhnau served as a model for me in fugue and counterpoint; but in fashioning melodic movements and examining them Handel and I were constantly occupied, frequently visiting each other as well as writing letters.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|pp=10\u201311}} translating {{harvnb|Mattheson|1740|p=359}}.</ref>\n\n=== Halle compositions ===\nAlthough Mainwaring records that Handel wrote weekly when assistant to Zachow and as probationary organist at Domkirche part of his duty was to provide suitable music,{{efn|Handel was required by the terms of his appointment, among other things, \"to play the organ fittingly at Divine Service, and for this purpose to pre-intone the prescribed Psalms and Spiritual Songs, and to have due care to whatever might be needful to the support of beautiful harmony \u2026\"{{sfn|Deutsch|1955|p=9}}}} no sacred compositions from his Halle period can now be identified.{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=22 n.2}} Mattheson, however, summarized his opinion of Handel's church cantatas written in Halle: \"Handel in those days set very, very long arias and sheerly unending cantatas which, while not possessing the proper knack or correct taste, were perfect so far as harmony is concerned.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lang|1966|p=22}} translating {{harvnb|Mattheson|1740|p=93}}.</ref>\n\nEarly chamber works do exist, but it is difficult to date any of them to Handel's time in Halle. Many historians until recently followed Chrysander and designated the six trio sonatas for two oboes and basso continuo as his first known composition, supposedly written in 1696 (when Handel was 11).{{sfn|Deutsch|1955|p=4 n.1}} Lang doubts the dating based on a handwritten date of a copy (1700) and stylistic considerations. Lang writes that the works \"show thorough acquaintance with the distilled sonata style of the [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli school]]\" and are notable for \"the formal security and the cleanness of the texture.\"{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=23}} Hogwood considers all of the oboe trio sonatas spurious and even suggests that some parts cannot be performed on oboe.{{sfn|Hogwood|1984|p=21}}  That authentic manuscript sources do not exist and that Handel never recycled any material from these works make their authenticity doubtful.{{sfn|Best|1985|pp=486\u201389}} Other early chamber works were printed in Amsterdam in 1724 as opus 1, but it is impossible to tell which are early works in their original form, rather than later re-workings by Handel, a frequent practice of his.{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=23}}\n\n== From Halle to Italy ==\n[[File:Hamburgs Oper.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Hamburg State Opera|Hamburg Opera am G\u00e4nsemarkt]] in 1726]]\n\nHandel's probationary appointment to Domkirche expired in March 1703.

Since he left no explanation for the move{{efn|Mainwaring gives the cryptic explanation that since he had to earn a living from his profession, he had to find a place less distant than Berlin. Given that Hamburg's opera house was second only to Berlin's in repute, \"it was resolved to send him thither on his own bottom, and chiefly with a view to improvement.\"{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|pp=27\u201328}} The passage suggests that Handel had already determined on secular dramatic music as a career, but who it was \"to send him thither\" is not explained.}} biographers have offered their own speculation. Burrows believes that the answer can be found by untangling Mainwaring's confused chronology of the trip to Berlin. Burrows dates this trip to 1702 or 1703 (after his father's death) and concluded that since Handel (through a \"friend and relation\" at the Berlin court) turned down Frederick's offer to subsidize his musical education in Italy (with the implicit understanding that he would become a court musician on his return), Handel was no longer able to expect preferment (whether as musician, lawyer or otherwise) within Brandenburg-Prussia. And since he was attracted to secular, dramatic music (by meeting the Italians Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti and through the influence of Telemann), Hamburg, a free city with an established opera company, was the logical choice.{{sfn|Burrows|1994|pp=11\u201313}} The question remains, however, why Handel rejected the King's offer, given that Italy was the center of opera. Lang suggests that, influenced by the teachings of Thomasius, Handel's character was such that he was unable to make himself subservient to anyone, even a king. Lang sees Handel as someone who could not accept class distinctions that required him to regard himself as a social inferior. \"What Handel craved was personal freedom to raise himself out of his provincial milieu to a life of culture.\"{{sfn|Lang|1966|p=26}} Burrows notes that like his father, Handel was able to accept royal (and aristocratic) favors without considering himself a court servant.{{sfn|Burrows|1994|p=12}} And so given the embarrassed financial condition of his mother,{{sfn|Mainwaring|1760|p=29}} Handel set off for Hamburg to obtain experience while supporting himself.\n\nIn 1703 he accepted a position as violinist and harpsichordist in the orchestra of the Hamburg [[Oper am G\u00e4nsemarkt]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burrows|1994|p=18}}</ref> There he met the composers [[Johann Mattheson]], [[Christoph Graupner]] and [[Reinhard Keiser]].

Influenced in part by cold-war realities, editorial work was inconsistent: misprints are found in abundance and editors failed to consult important sources.

Of the former, ''[[Ode for St. Cecilia's Day]]'' (1739) (set to texts by [[John Dryden]]) and ''[[Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne]]'' (1713) are noteworthy. For his secular oratorios, Handel turned to classical mythology for subjects, producing such works as ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]'' (1719), ''[[Hercules (Handel)|Hercules]]'' (1745) and ''[[Semele (Handel)|Semele]]'' (1744). These works have a close kinship with the sacred oratorios, particularly in the vocal writing for the English-language texts. They also share the lyrical and dramatic qualities of Handel's Italian operas. As such, they are sometimes fully staged as operas.

I would uncover my head and kneel before his tomb.\"<ref name=\"YoungMM\" /> Beethoven emphasised above all the simplicity and popular appeal of Handel's music when he said, \"Go to him to learn how to achieve great effects, by such simple means.\"\n\n=== Borrowings ===\nSince 1831, when [[William Crotch]] raised the issue in his ''Substance of Several Lectures on Music,'' scholars have extensively studied Handel's \"borrowing\" of music from other composers. Summarising the field in 2005, [[Richard Taruskin]] wrote that Handel \"seems to have been the champion of all [[Parody music|parodists]], adapting both his own works and those of other composers in unparalleled numbers and with unparalleled exactitude.\"<ref>[[Richard Taruskin]], ''The Oxford History of Western Music'', Oxford University Press, 2005, vol. 2, chapter 26, p. 329, {{ISBN|0195222717}}</ref> Among the composers whose music has been shown to have been re-used by Handel are [[Alessandro Stradella]], [[Gottlieb Muffat]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]]<ref>Alexander Silbiger, \"Scarlatti Borrowings in Handel's Grand Concertos\", ''[[The Musical Times]]'', v. 125, 1984, pp. 93\u201394</ref> [[Giacomo Carissimi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Carl Heinrich Graun]], [[Leonardo Vinci]], [[Jacobus Gallus]], [[Francesco Antonio Urio]], [[Reinhard Keiser]], [[Francesco Gasparini]], [[Giovanni Bononcini]], [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]], [[Henry Lawes]], [[Michael Wise]], [[Agostino Steffani]], Franz Johann Habermann, and numerous others.<ref>A comprehensive bibliography through 2005 can be found in Mary Anne Parker, ''G. F. Handel: A Guide to Research'', Routledge, 2005, {{ISBN|1136783598}}, pp. 114\u2013135</ref>\n\nIn an essay published in 1985, John H. Roberts demonstrated that Handel's borrowings were unusually frequent even for his own era, enough to have been criticised by contemporaries (notably [[Johann Mattheson]]); Roberts suggested several reasons for Handel's practice, including Handel's attempts to make certain works sound more up-to-date and more radically, his \"basic lack of facility in inventing original ideas\" \u2013 though Roberts took care to argue that this does not \"diminish Handel's stature\", which should be \"judged not by his methods, still less by his motives in employing them, but solely by the effects he achieves.\"<ref>John H. Roberts, \"Why Did Handel Borrow?\", in ''Handel: Tercentary Collection'', edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[Anthony Hicks]], [[Royal Musical Association]], 1985, pp. 83\u201392, {{ISBN|0-8357-1833-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Homages ===\n[[File:Westminster-Handel-Commemoration-1784.png|thumb|upright|The chorus, orchestra and organ in [[Westminster Abbey]], London during the [[Handel Commemoration]] in 1784]]\nAfter Handel's death, many composers wrote works based on or inspired by his music. The first movement from [[Louis Spohr]]'s ''Symphony No. 6'', Op. 116, \"The Age of Bach and Handel\", resembles two melodies from Handel's ''Messiah''. In 1797 [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] published the ''12 Variations in G major on \u2018See the conqu\u2019ring hero comes\u2019 from Judas Maccabaeus by Handel'', for cello and piano. In 1822 Beethoven composed ''[[The Consecration of the House]]'' overture, which also bears the influence of Handel. Guitar virtuoso [[Mauro Giuliani]] composed his ''Variations on a Theme by Handel, Op. 107'' for guitar, based on Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major, HWV 430, for harpsichord.\n[[File:Handel-Westminster.png|thumb|left|upright|Handel's monument in Westminster Abbey with the plaque recording his [[Handel Commemoration|commemoration]] in 1784]]\nIn 1861, using a theme from the second of Handel's harpsichord suites, [[Johannes Brahms]] wrote the ''[[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel]]'', Op. 24, one of his most successful works (praised by [[Richard Wagner]]).  Several works by the French composer [[F\u00e9lix-Alexandre Guilmant]] use Handel's themes, for example his ''March on a Theme by Handel'' uses a theme from ''Messiah''. French composer and flautist [[Philippe Gaubert]] wrote his ''Petite marche'' for flute and piano based on the fourth movement of Handel's Trio Sonata, Op. 5, No. 2, HWV 397. [[Argentine people|Argentine]] composer Luis Gianneo composed his ''Variations on a Theme by Handel'' for piano. In 1911, Australian-born composer and pianist [[Percy Grainger]] based one of his most famous works on the final movement of Handel's Suite No. 5 in E major (just like Giuliani). He first wrote some variations on the theme, which he titled ''Variations on Handel's 'The Harmonious Blacksmith' ''. Then he used the first sixteen bars of his set of variations to create ''Handel in the Strand'', one of his most beloved pieces, of which he made several versions (for example, the piano solo version from 1930). [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s Concerto for String Quartet and Orchestra in B-flat major (1933) was composed after Handel's Concerto Grosso, Op. 6/7.<ref>Auner Joseph H. (1996), \"Schoenberg's Handel Concerto and the Ruins of Tradition\", ''[[Journal of the American Musicological Society]]'', 49: 264\u2013313</ref>\n\n=== Veneration ===\nHandel is honoured with a [[feast day]] on 28 July in the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church]], with [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Henry Purcell]]. In the [[Calendar of saints (Lutheran)|Lutheran Calendar of Saints]] Handel and Bach share that date with [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], and Handel and Bach are commemorated in the calendar of saints prepared by the [[Order of Saint Luke]] for the use of the [[United Methodist Church]].<ref>''For All the Saints: A Calendar of Commemorations for United Methodists'', ed. by Clifton F. Guthrie (Order of Saint Luke Publications, 1995, {{ISBN|1-878009-25-7}}) p. 161.</ref>\n\n=== Fictional depictions ===\n{{Main|:Category:George Frideric Handel in fiction}}\nIn 1942, Handel was the subject of the British [[biopic]] ''[[The Great Mr. Handel]]'' directed by [[Norman Walker (director)|Norman Walker]] and starring [[Wilfrid Lawson (actor)|Wilfrid Lawson]]. It was made at [[Denham Studios]] by the [[Rank Organisation]], and shot in [[Technicolor]]. He is also the central character in the television films ''[[God Rot Tunbridge Wells!]]'' (1985) and ''[[Handel's Last Chance]]'' (1996) and the stage play ''[[All the Angels]]'' (2015). Handel was portrayed by [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]] as the antagonist in the film ''[[Farinelli (film)|Farinelli]]'' (1994).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Classical music|Opera|Music|Biography}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel}}\n* [[Handel Reference Database]]\n* [[Letters and writings of George Frideric Handel]]\n* [[List of compositions by George Frideric Handel]]\n* [[List of operas by George Frideric Handel]]\n* [[Publications by Friedrich Chrysander]]\n* [[Valentine Snow]]\n* [[Will of George Frideric Handel]]\n* [[Drexel 5856]]\n\n== Notes, references and sources ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist|45em}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Aileen K.|last2=Hofest\u00e4dt|first2=B.|title=Georg H\u00e4ndel (1622\u201397): The Barber-Surgeon Father of George Frideric Handel (1685\u20131759)|journal=[[Journal of Medical Biography]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=142\u201349|date=August 2005|pmid=16059526|ref=harv|doi=10.1258/j.jmb.2005.04-49}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Best|first=Terence|title=Handel's Chamber Music: Sources, Chronology and Authenticity|journal=[[Early Music (journal)|Early Music]]|volume=13|pages=476\u2013499|number=4|date=November 1985|ref=harv|doi=10.1093/em/13.4.476|jstor = 3127226}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bone|first=Philip J.|title=The Guitar and Mandolin: Biographies of Celebrated Players and Composers for these Instruments|url=https://archive.org/details/guitarmandolinbi00bone|location=London|publisher=Schott & Co.|year=1914|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Buelow|first=George J.|title=A History of Baroque Music|location=Bloomington, Indiana|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-253-34365-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bukofzer|first=Manfred F.|authorlink=Manfred Bukofzer|title='Music in the Baroque Era \u2013 From Monteverdi To Bach|url=https://archive.org/details/musicinbaroqueer00buko|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=W.W.
