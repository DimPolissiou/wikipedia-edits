It was probably Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I ''Barbarossa'']] who founded the imperial mint and started the coining of the so-called ''[[Heller (money)|Heller]]''. Hall flourished through the production of salt and coins. Since 1204 it has been called a town.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nAfter the fall of the house of Hohenstaufen, Hall defended itself successfully against the claims of a noble family in the neighbourhood<ref name=\"History\"/> (the ''Schenken von Limpurg''). The conflict was finally settled in 1280 by [[Rudolph I of Habsburg]]; this allowed the undisturbed development into a [[Free Imperial City]] (''Reichsstadt'') of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV the Bavarian]] granted a constitution that settled internal conflicts (''Erste Zwietracht'') in 1340. After this, the city was governed by the inner council (''Innerer Rat'') which was composed by twelve noblemen, six \"middle burghers\" and eight craftsmen. The head of the council was the ''St\u00e4ttmeister'' (mayor). A second phase of internal conflicts 1510\u201312 (''Zweite Zwietracht'') brought the dominating role of the nobility to an end. The confrontation with the noble families was started by St\u00e4ttmeister ''Hermann B\u00fcschler'', whose daughter ''Anna B\u00fcschler'' is the subject of a popular book by Harvard professor [[Steven Ozment]] (\"The B\u00fcrgermeister's Daughter: Scandal in a sixteenth-century German town\"). The leading role was taken over by a group of families who turned into a new ruling class. Amongst them where the ''Bonh\u00f6ffers'', the ancestors of [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]].\n\n===Middle ages===\nFrom the 14th to the 16th centuries, Hall systematically acquired a large territory in the surrounding area, mostly from noble families and the [[Comburg]] monastery. The wealth of this era can still be seen in some [[gothic architecture|gothic]] buildings like St. Michael's Church (rebuilt 1427\u20131526) with its impressive stairway (1507). The town joined the [[Protestant Reformation]] very early. [[Johannes Brenz]], a follower of [[Martin Luther]], was made pastor of St. Michael's Church in 1522 and quickly began to reform the church and the school system along Lutheran lines.\n\nHall suffered severely during the [[Thirty Years' War]], though it was never [[siege|besieged]] or scene of a [[battle]]. However, it was forced to pay enormous sums to the armies of the various parties, especially to the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]], [[Sweden|Swedish]] and [[France|French]] troops, who also committed numerous atrocities and plundered the town and the surrounding area. Between 1634 and 1638 every fifth inhabitant died of hunger and diseases, especially from the [[bubonic plague]]. The war left the town an impoverished and economically ruined place. But with the help of reorganizations of salt production and trade and a growing [[wine]] trade, there was an astonishingly fast recovery.\n\n===17th century to early 20th century===\nFires were a constant threat to the mostly wooden houses of the town. The great fires of 1680 and especially of 1728 destroyed much of the city, which led to new buildings in the [[Baroque]] style, such as the city hall.\n[[File:Inbesitznahme der Reichsstadt Hall.jpg|thumb|The 1802 mediatization of Hall in contemporary imagery]]\nThe [[Napoleonic wars]] brought the history of Hall as a Free Imperial City to an end. Following the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] (1801), the duke of [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]] was allowed by [[Napoleon]] to occupy the town and several other minor states as a compensation for territories on the [[Left Bank of the Rhine]] that fell to France. This took place in 1802 \u2014 Hall lost its territory and its political independence and became a {{lang|de|Oberamtsstadt}} (seat of an {{lang|de|Ober[[Amt (country subdivision)|amt]]}}, comparable to a [[county]]). Ownership of the salt works was handed over to the state. A long economic crisis during the 19th century forced many citizens to move to other places in Germany or to emigrate overseas, mostly to the United States. While other towns like [[Heilbronn]] grew steadily due to the [[Industrial Revolution]], the population of Hall stagnated. The economic situation improved during the second half of the 19th century \u2014 a main factor was the [[railway]] line to Heilbronn (1862) \u2014 but was not followed by a significant growth of the town. It was not until the 1920s and 1930s that new settlements were built on the heights surrounding the old town. Hall also grew through the incorporation of Steinbach (1930) and Hessental (1936).\n\nIn 1827, a health spa was established on one of the islands in the Kocher river. Especially after the building of the railway (1862) it became a considerable economical factor. The well-preserved old town also brought a rising number of tourists. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Hall has developed many festivities. Especially well known are the theatre productions which are performed every year in the centre of the city on the steps of St. Michael.\n\n===Nazi Germany and World War II===\n{{further|Bombing of Schw\u00e4bisch Hall in World War II}}\nIn 1934, Hall was officially named ''Schw\u00e4bisch Hall''. During the [[Third Reich]] a [[Luftwaffe]] [[air base]] was built at Hessental.<ref name=\"History\"/> During [[Kristallnacht]] on 9 November 1938, local Nazis burned the synagogue in Steinbach and devastated shops and houses of Jewish citizens.<ref name=\"History\"/> Approximately 40 Jewish citizens of Schw\u00e4bisch Hall fell victim to the [[Holocaust]] in extermination camps in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"History\"/> In 1944 a [[concentration camp]] was established next to the train station Hall-Hessental. The train station at Hall was targeted by an American air raid on February 23, 1945, but the devastation was mostly limited to the suburbs of St. Katharina and Unterlimpurg.

It was probably Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I ''Barbarossa'']] who founded the imperial mint and started the coining of the so-called ''[[Heller (money)|Heller]]''. Hall flourished through the production of salt and coins. Since 1204 it has been called a town.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nAfter the fall of the house of Hohenstaufen, Hall defended itself successfully against the claims of a noble family in the neighbourhood<ref name=\"History\"/> (the ''Schenken von Limpurg''). The conflict was finally settled in 1280 by [[Rudolph I of Habsburg]]; this allowed the undisturbed development into a [[Free Imperial City]] (''Reichsstadt'') of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV the Bavarian]] granted a constitution that settled internal conflicts (''Erste Zwietracht'') in 1340. After this, the city was governed by the inner council (''Innerer Rat'') which was composed by twelve noblemen, six \"middle burghers\" and eight craftsmen. The head of the council was the ''St\u00e4ttmeister'' (mayor). A second phase of internal conflicts 1510\u201312 (''Zweite Zwietracht'') brought the dominating role of the nobility to an end. The confrontation with the noble families was started by St\u00e4ttmeister ''Hermann B\u00fcschler'', whose daughter ''Anna B\u00fcschler'' is the subject of a popular book by Harvard professor [[Steven Ozment]] (\"The B\u00fcrgermeister's Daughter: Scandal in a sixteenth-century German town\"). The leading role was taken over by a group of families who turned into a new ruling class. Amongst them where the ''Bonh\u00f6ffers'', the ancestors of [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]].\n\n===Middle ages===\nFrom the 14th to the 16th centuries, Hall systematically acquired a large territory in the surrounding area, mostly from noble families and the [[Comburg]] monastery. The wealth of this era can still be seen in some [[gothic architecture|gothic]] buildings like St. Michael's Church (rebuilt 1427\u20131526) with its impressive stairway (1507). The town joined the [[Protestant Reformation]] very early. [[Johannes Brenz]], a follower of [[Martin Luther]], was made pastor of St. Michael's Church in 1522 and quickly began to reform the church and the school system along Lutheran lines.\n\nHall suffered severely during the [[Thirty Years' War]], though it was never [[siege|besieged]] or scene of a [[battle]]. However, it was forced to pay enormous sums to the armies of the various parties, especially to the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]], [[Sweden|Swedish]] and [[France|French]] troops, who also committed numerous atrocities and plundered the town and the surrounding area. Between 1634 and 1638 every fifth inhabitant died of hunger and diseases, especially from the [[bubonic plague]]. The war left the town an impoverished and economically ruined place. But with the help of reorganizations of salt production and trade and a growing [[wine]] trade, there was an astonishingly fast recovery.\n\n===17th century to early 20th century===\nFires were a constant threat to the mostly wooden houses of the town. The great fires of 1680 and especially of 1728 destroyed much of the city, which led to new buildings in the [[Baroque]] style, such as the city hall.\n[[File:Inbesitznahme der Reichsstadt Hall.jpg|thumb|The 1802 mediatization of Hall in contemporary imagery]]\nThe [[Napoleonic wars]] brought the history of Hall as a Free Imperial City to an end. Following the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] (1801), the duke of [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]] was allowed by [[Napoleon]] to occupy the town and several other minor states as a compensation for territories on the [[Left Bank of the Rhine]] that fell to France. This took place in 1802 \u2014 Hall lost its territory and its political independence and became a {{lang|de|Oberamtsstadt}} (seat of an {{lang|de|Ober[[Amt (country subdivision)|amt]]}}, comparable to a [[county]]). Ownership of the salt works was handed over to the state. A long economic crisis during the 19th century forced many citizens to move to other places in Germany or to emigrate overseas, mostly to the United States. While other towns like [[Heilbronn]] grew steadily due to the [[Industrial Revolution]], the population of Hall stagnated. The economic situation improved during the second half of the 19th century \u2014 a main factor was the [[railway]] line to Heilbronn (1862) \u2014 but was not followed by a significant growth of the town. It was not until the 1920s and 1930s that new settlements were built on the heights surrounding the old town. Hall also grew through the incorporation of Steinbach (1930) and Hessental (1936).\n\nIn 1827, a health spa was established on one of the islands in the Kocher river. Especially after the building of the railway (1862) it became a considerable economical factor. The well-preserved old town also brought a rising number of tourists. Since the beginning of the 20th century, Hall has developed many festivities. Especially well known are the theatre productions which are performed every year in the centre of the city on the steps of St. Michael.\n\n===Nazi Germany and World War II===\n{{further|Bombing of Schw\u00e4bisch Hall in World War II}}\nIn 1934, Hall was officially named ''Schw\u00e4bisch Hall''. During the [[Third Reich]] a [[Luftwaffe]] [[air base]] was built at Hessental.<ref name=\"History\"/> During [[Kristallnacht]] on 9 November 1938, local Nazis burned the synagogue in Steinbach and devastated shops and houses of Jewish citizens.<ref name=\"History\"/> Approximately 40 Jewish citizens of Schw\u00e4bisch Hall fell victim to the [[Holocaust]] in extermination camps in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"History\"/> In 1944 a [[concentration camp]] was established next to the train station Hall-Hessental. The train station at Hall was targeted by an American air raid on February 23, 1945, but the devastation was mostly limited to the suburbs of St. Katharina and Unterlimpurg. The town was occupied by [[US Army]] troops on April 17, 1945 without serious resistance; though several buildings were destroyed or damaged, the historical old town suffered comparatively little.\n\n===Post World War II===\nIn 1960, Schw\u00e4bisch Hall reached the status of a {{lang|de|[[Gro\u00dfe Kreisstadt]]}}.<ref name=\"History\"/> This means that the city took over some tasks of the district.<ref name=\"History\"/>  From the end of World War II until the end of the Cold War, Dolan Barracks and Schw\u00e4bisch Hall Army Air Field was a [[kaserne]] which hosted a series of US Army aviation units and Ordinance units until it was turned back over to German control in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Elkins|first1=Walter|title=U.S. ARMY INSTALLATIONS - HEILBRONN|url=http://www.usarmygermany.com/Sont.htm?http&&&www.usarmygermany.com/USAREUR_Kasernes.htm|website=USARMYGERMANY.COM|accessdate=20 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of December 31, 2009, Schw\u00e4bisch Hall has a population of 36,799.
