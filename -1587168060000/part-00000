It was founded in 1921, was declared illegal in 1950 by the governing [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], and participated in the struggle to end the [[apartheid]] system. It is a partner of the [[Tripartite Alliance]] with the [[African National Congress]] and the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]] (COSATU) and through this it influences the South African government.\n\n== History ==\nThe Communist Party of South Africa was founded in 1921 by the joining together of the [[International Socialist League (South Africa)|International Socialist League]] and others under the leadership of [[William H. Andrews (unionist)|Willam H. Andrews]]. It first came to prominence during the [[Rand Revolt]], a strike by white miners in 1922. The large mining concerns, facing labour shortages and wage pressures, had announced their intention of engaging blacks in semi-skilled and some higher level jobs at low wage rates, compared to their white counterparts who enjoyed the monopoly of higher and well-paying occupations. The CPSA supported the strike as the struggle between the working class and the capitalist class but it distanced itself from racist slogans associated with the strike.<ref>\"Public Statement on the strike,\" issued by the CPSA on the occasion of the strike in 1922. ''South African Communists Speak'' (Inkululeko, 1981) contains this and other documents from the History of the South African Communist Party, 1915-1980.</ref> The party said in the statement a white South Africa was impossible, and that workers had to organise and unite regardless of their race to fight for a non-racial South Africa and better conditions for all workers.\n\nIn 1928, the Communist International adopted a resolution for the SACP to adopt the \"Native Republic\" thesis which stipulated that South Africa was a country belonging to the natives, that is, the blacks. The resolution was influenced by a delegation from South Africa. James la Guma, the party Chairperson from Cape Town, had met with the leadership of the Communist International.<ref>Dr. Raymond van Diemel. ''\"I have seen the new Jerusalem\": Revisiting and re-conceptualising Josiah T. Gumede and Jimmy La Guma's USSR visit of 1927'' (2001)</ref> The party thus reoriented itself at its 1924 Party Congress towards organising black workers and \"Africanising\" the party. By 1928, 1,600 of the party's 1,750 members were black. Contemporary scholars have argued that the party dismissed competing attempts at multiracial revolutionary organisations during this period, especially multiracial union organising by the [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]], and using revisionist history to claim that the party and its Native Republic policy was the only viable route to African liberation.<ref name=colorlines>{{cite journal |last1=Cole |first1=Peter |last2=van der Walt |first2=Lucien |date=January 2011 |title=Crossing the Color Lines, Crossing the Continents: Comparing the Racial Politics of the IWW in South Africa and the United States, 1905\u20131925 |url=http://abahlali.org/files/IWW.pdf |journal=Safundi: The Journal of South African and American Studies |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201396 |access-date=27 December 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004141911/http://abahlali.org/files/IWW.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Despite this, in 1929: the party adopted a \"strategic line\" which held that, \"The most direct line of advance to [[socialism]] runs through the mass struggle for [[majority rule]]\". By 1948, the Communist Party had officially abandoned the Native Republic policy.\n\nIn 1946, the CPSA along with the [[African National Congress]] participated in the general strike that was started by the [[1946 African Mine Workers' Union strike|African Mine Workers' Strike]] in 1946. Many party members, such as [[Bram Fischer]] were arrested.\n\n=== Apartheid ===\n{{Further|Soviet Union-Africa relations#South Africa}}\n\nAware that the National Party, elected to government in 1948, was about to ban the Communist Party, the SACP decided by a majority to dissolve itself.  A minority felt that the party should organise underground, but the majority apparently argued that this would be unnecessary; that support should be given to the African National Congress (ANC) in the drive to majority rule. After its voluntary dissolution, the CPSA was declared illegal in 1950. In 1953, a group of former CPSA members launched the ''South African Communist Party'' that remained \u2014 as had been the SACP \u2014 aligned with the Soviet Union. The ban on the party was lifted in 1990 when the ANC and other anti-apartheid organisations and individuals were also unbanned, and African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela was released from prison.\n\nThe CPSA/SACP was a particular target of the governing National Party. The [[Suppression of Communism Act, 1950|Suppression of Communism Act]] was used against all those dedicated to ending apartheid, but was obviously particularly targeted at the communists.\n\nFollowing the dissolution and subsequent banning of the CPSA, former party members and, after 1953, members of the SACP, adopted a policy of primarily working within the ANC in order to reorient that organisation's programme from a nationalist policy akin to the CPSA's former Native Republic policy towards a non-racial programme which declared that all ethnic groups residing in South Africa had equal rights to the country. While black members of the SACP were encouraged to join the ANC and seek leadership positions within that organisation, many of its white leading members formed the [[South African Congress of Democrats|Congress of Democrats]] which in turn allied itself with the [[African National Congress]] and other \"non-racial\" congresses in the [[Congress Alliance]] on the basis of multi-racialism. The Congress Alliance committed itself to a democratic, non-racial South Africa where the \"people shall govern\" through the [[Freedom Charter]]. The Freedom Charter was adopted by the ANC, the SACP and other partners in the Alliance in accordance with its evolution. The Charter has since remained the cornerstone of the Alliance, as its basic, shared programme to advance a national democratic revolution, both a process of struggle and transformation to achieve a non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous South Africa.\n\nThe SACP played a role in the development of the Freedom Charter through its cadres who were openly active in the Congress Alliance and in the Party's underground organisation. In the same vein the Party played an important role in the evolution of the Alliance and the development of the liberation movement in South Africa.\n\nAs the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] increased repression in response to increased black pressure and radicalism throughout the 1950s, the [[African National Congress|ANC]], previously committed to non-violence, turned towards the question of force. A new generation of leaders, led by [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Walter Sisulu]] recognised that the Nationalists were certain to ban the ANC and so make peaceful protest all but impossible.\n\nThey allied themselves with the communists to form [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (\"Spear of the Nation\") which began a campaign of economic bombing or 'armed propaganda'. However the leaders of Umkhonto were soon arrested and jailed and the liberation movement was left weak and with an exiled leadership. Communist [[Joe Slovo]] was Chief of Staff of Umkhonto, his wife and fellow SACP cadre [[Ruth First]] was perhaps the leading theoretician of the revolutionary struggle the ANC were engaged in. The ANC itself, though, remained broadly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] in outlook.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rita M. Byrnes, ed. |title=South Africa: A Country Study, 3rd addition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCN1AAAAMAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress|pages=272, 322}}</ref>\n\nIn exile, communist nations provided the ANC with funding and firearms. Gradual work by the ANC slowly rebuilt the organisation inside South Africa, and the ANC was able to capitalise on the wave of anger amongst young South Africans during and after the [[Soweto uprising]] of 1976.\n\nEventually external pressures and internal ferment made even many strong supporters of apartheid recognise that change had to come and a long process of negotiations began which resulted, in 1994, in the defeat of the National Party after forty-six years of rule.\n\n=== Post-apartheid ===\nWith victory a number of communists occupied prominent positions on the ANC benches in parliament. Most prominently, Nelson Mandela appointed [[Joe Slovo]] as Minister for Housing. This period also brought new strains in the ANC-SACP alliance when the ANC's programme did not threaten the existence of [[capitalism]] in South Africa and was heavily reliant on foreign investment and tourism. However, the Freedom Charter had been considered only as a blueprint for a future democratic and free South Africa. Joe Slovo recognised that Stalinism had failed in Eastern Europe and could not be regarded as a model for the SACP. In his [[autobiography]] ''[[Long Walk to Freedom]]'', [[Nelson Mandela]] famously remarked:\n<blockquote>\"The cynical have always suggested that the Communists were using us. But who is to say that we were not using them?\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mandela |first1=Nelson |title=Long Walk to Freedom: The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela |date=2008 |publisher=Little, Brown |isbn=978-0-7595-2104-9 |page=125 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=RHwLqVrnXgIC&pg=PT125 |accessdate=17 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter Mandela's death in 2013, the ANC confirmed that he had been a member of the SACP and served on its central committee.<ref>[http://www.anc.org.za/nelson/show.php?id=10658 THE PASSING OF CDE NELSON ROLIHLAHLA MANDELA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211025722/http://www.anc.org.za/nelson/show.php?id=10658 |date=2013-12-11 }}, ANC, 5 December 2013.</ref>\n\nThrough the Tripartite Alliance and the sitting of many SACP members on the ANC's [[National Executive Committee of the African National Congress|NEC]], the SACP has wielded influence from within the ANC, often serving as an ideological opposition against the presidency and socio-economic policies of [[Thabo Mbeki]] (1999\u20132008); this became most apparent with the ouster of Mbeki from the presidencies of both the party (2007, by vote) and the government (2008, by ANC party recall) and his eventual replacement in both offices with [[Jacob Zuma]], who was widely seen as being more conciliatory to the ideological demands of both the SACP and COSATU.\n\nInitially, the party did not contest elections under its own name. However, in December 2017, the party contested a number of local council by-elections in [[Metsimaholo Local Municipality|Metsimahalo]] in the [[Free State]], failing to win any [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] ward seats, but gaining three proportional representation seats. In total the SACP received 3,270 votes (6,3%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.za/content/pages/reports/ReportHandler.aspx?lReportID=1&lEEID=566&MunicipalityID=2224&bCouncilReport=0&sReportName=BYELEC_SeatCalculation&sFormat=PDF|title=FS204 - Metsimaholo 29 Nov 2017 By-Election Seat Calculation Detail|last=|first=|date=|website=Independent Electoral Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/free-state/sacp-fares-dismally-in-metsimaholo-by-elections-12215038 |title=SACP fares dismally in #Metsimaholo by-elections &#124; IOL News |website=www.iol.co.za |language=en |access-date=2019-01-12}}</ref>\n\n== General Secretaries ==\n:1921: [[William H.

The [[Suppression of Communism Act, 1950|Suppression of Communism Act]] was used against all those dedicated to ending apartheid, but was obviously particularly targeted at the communists.\n\nFollowing the dissolution and subsequent banning of the CPSA, former party members and, after 1953, members of the SACP, adopted a policy of primarily working within the ANC in order to reorient that organisation's programme from a nationalist policy akin to the CPSA's former Native Republic policy towards a non-racial programme which declared that all ethnic groups residing in South Africa had equal rights to the country. While black members of the SACP were encouraged to join the ANC and seek leadership positions within that organisation, many of its white leading members formed the [[South African Congress of Democrats|Congress of Democrats]] which in turn allied itself with the [[African National Congress]] and other \"non-racial\" congresses in the [[Congress Alliance]] on the basis of multi-racialism.

But who is to say that we were not using them?\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mandela |first1=Nelson |title=Long Walk to Freedom: The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela |date=2008 |publisher=Little, Brown |isbn=978-0-7595-2104-9 |page=125 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=RHwLqVrnXgIC&pg=PT125 |accessdate=17 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter Mandela's death in 2013, the ANC confirmed that he had been a member of the SACP and served on its central committee.<ref>[http://www.anc.org.za/nelson/show.php?id=10658 THE PASSING OF CDE NELSON ROLIHLAHLA MANDELA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211025722/http://www.anc.org.za/nelson/show.php?id=10658 |date=2013-12-11 }}, ANC, 5 December 2013.</ref>\n\nThrough the Tripartite Alliance and the sitting of many SACP members on the ANC's [[National Executive Committee of the African National Congress|NEC]], the SACP has wielded influence from within the ANC, often serving as an ideological opposition against the presidency and socio-economic policies of [[Thabo Mbeki]] (1999\u20132008); this became most apparent with the ouster of Mbeki from the presidencies of both the party (2007, by vote) and the government (2008, by ANC party recall) and his eventual replacement in both offices with [[Jacob Zuma]], who was widely seen as being more conciliatory to the ideological demands of both the SACP and COSATU.\n\nInitially, the party did not contest elections under its own name. However, in December 2017, the party contested a number of local council by-elections in [[Metsimaholo Local Municipality|Metsimahalo]] in the [[Free State]], failing to win any [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] ward seats, but gaining three proportional representation seats. In total the SACP received 3,270 votes (6,3%).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.za/content/pages/reports/ReportHandler.aspx?lReportID=1&lEEID=566&MunicipalityID=2224&bCouncilReport=0&sReportName=BYELEC_SeatCalculation&sFormat=PDF|title=FS204 - Metsimaholo 29 Nov 2017 By-Election Seat Calculation Detail|last=|first=|date=|website=Independent Electoral Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/free-state/sacp-fares-dismally-in-metsimaholo-by-elections-12215038 |title=SACP fares dismally in #Metsimaholo by-elections &#124; IOL News |website=www.iol.co.za |language=en |access-date=2019-01-12}}</ref>\n\n== General Secretaries ==\n:1921: [[William H.

In 1567, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary\u2019s]] short period of personal rule ended in recrimination, intrigue and disaster when, after her capture at [[battle of Carberry Hill|Carberry Hill]], she was forced to [[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|abdicate]] in favour of [[James VI]], her infant son.  Mary was imprisoned in [[Loch Leven Castle]], while her Protestant half-brother, [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|James Stewart, Earl of Moray]] was appointed [[Regent]] on behalf of his nephew.  In early May 1568 Mary escaped, heading west to the country of the Hamiltons, high among her remaining supporters, and the safety of [[Dumbarton Castle]] with the determination to restore her rights as queen. Mary was defeated and went into exile and captivity in England. The battle can be regarded as the start of the [[Marian civil war]].\n\n==Queen's Men==\n[[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|Mary's abdication]] had not been universally popular, even among sections of the Protestant nobility, and news of her escape were widely welcomed.  With an escort of fifty horse led by [[Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley|Lord Claud Hamilton]] she arrived in [[Lanarkshire]], soon to be joined by a wide cross-section of the nobility, including the Earls of [[Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll|Argyll]], [[Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis|Cassillis]], [[Andrew Leslie, 5th Earl of Rothes|Rothes]] and [[Earl of Eglinton|Eglinton]], the Lords [[Lord Somerville|Sommerville]], [[Lord Hay of Yester|Yester]], [[Lord Livingston|Livingston]], [[Lord Herries of Terregles|Herries]], [[Lord Fleming|Fleming]], [[James Ross, 4th Lord Ross|Ross]], numerous of the feudal barons and their followers.  Within a few days Mary had managed to gather a respectable force of some 6000 men.\n\nIt was openly declared that her abdication, and her consent to the coronation of James, had been extorted from her under threat of death.  An act of council was then passed, declaring the whole process by which Moray had been appointed as Regent to be [[treason]]able.  A [[Contract|bond]] was drawn up by those present for her restitution, signed by eight earls, nine bishops, eighteen lords, twelve abbots and nearly one hundred barons.\n\n==Mary's march==\nIt was Mary's intention to avoid battle if possible, retiring instead to [[Dumbarton Castle]], still held for her by [[John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming]]. Here she would be in a virtually impregnable position, well placed to receive the expected reinforcements from the north, and then recover her hold over the country by degrees. With the intention of by-passing Moray she marched to [[Rutherglen castle]] meeting loyal supporters and then on a wide circuit past Glasgow, intending to move by way of [[Langside]], [[Crookston, Glasgow|Crookston]] and [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] back towards the [[River Clyde]], and then on to Dumbarton on the north side of the Clyde estuary. Moray drew up his army on the moor close to the village of Langside, then several miles south of Glasgow but now well within the city. [[William Kirkcaldy of Grange|Kirkcaldy]], keeping an eye on the enemy movements, noted that they were keeping to the south of the River Cart, the Regent's army being on the opposite bank. In response he ordered hackbutters ([[musketeer]]s) to mount behind each of his horsemen, rapidly fording the river, and placing them among the cottages, hedges and gardens of the village, which bordered each side of a narrow lane, through which Mary's army must [[defile (geography)|defile]]. Meanwhile Moray continued to deploy the rest of the army, the [[Vanguard (military tactics)|vanguard]] under the command of the [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Earl of Morton]] leading the march across a nearby bridge. The whole army then deployed the right around the village. No sooner was this complete than the Queen's vanguard, commanded by Lord Hamilton, began its advance through the village. The battle was now under way.\n\n==Guns and pikes==\nMary's army was commanded by Argyll, who was to show little in the way of real military skill, seemingly hoping simply to push Moray aside by sheer force of numbers: it is even suggested in the sources that he fainted at one point, though this is almost certainly a rumour spread by his enemies.  With her army now engaged the Queen stood some distance to the rear, close to Cathcart Castle on a mound since named as the Court Knowe.  As Hamilton attempted to force a passage through Langside he was met by close fire from Grange's hackbutters.  Many in the front ranks were killed, throwing the remainder back on those following, and adding to the general confusion.  Hamilton pushed on, finally reaching the top of a hill, only to find the main enemy army drawn up in good order. Morton with the border pikemen advanced to intercept Mary's vanguard.  Both sides now met in '[[push of pike]]'.  The forest of inter-locked spears was now so thick it is said that if those behind threw their discharged pistols at the enemy the weapons simply rested on the shafts as on a carpet, rather than falling to the ground.\n\nGrange, whom Moray had allowed considerable leeway, continued to act with courage and distinction; \"...&nbsp;the Regent committed unto the laird of Grange, the special care, as an experienced captain, to oversee every danger, to ride to every wing and encourage and make help where the greatest height was.\"   The battle was now at its height and the outcome still doubtful, until Grange saw that the right wing of the Regent's army-consisting of the barons of [[Renfrewshire]]-was beginning to lose ground.  He immediately galloped to the main battalion and brought reinforcements.  This was done so effectively, and the counter-attack pressed with such force, that it broke the enemy ranks.  Moray, who hitherto had stood on the defensive, repulsing Mary's cavalry, now charged at the main enemy battalion, the fight now joined all along the line.  The Queen's men crumbled, the fugitives being closely pursued by a party of Highlanders.  The Battle of Langside, which had lasted for some forty-five minutes, was over.\n\n==Aftermath==\nMary's biographer, [[Antonia Fraser]], describes the Battle of Langside a \"colossal defeat\" for Mary.<ref>Fraser, Antonia, ''Mary Queen of Scots'', Orion, London, 1969</ref> Only one of Moray's men was killed, whereas over 100 of Mary's men were lost,<ref>Fraser, Antonia, ''Mary Queen of Scots'', Orion, London, 1969</ref> a figure that almost certainly would have been much higher but for Moray's decision to avoid further bloodshed by ordering a halt to the pursuit. Over 300 of Mary's men were taken prisoner, including [[George Seton, 7th Lord Seton|Lord Seton]] and Sir James Hamilton and many of his Clan.<ref>Fraser, Antonia, ''Mary Queen of Scots'', Orion, London, 1969</ref> Mary and her escort rode off, first trying to reach Dumbarton Castle, but then turning south, eventually arriving at [[Dundrennan Abbey]].  From here she left for England, never to see Scotland again.\n\nMary crossed the [[Solway Firth]] to [[Workington]] on 16 May 1568 at night with twenty companions. This unexpected event provoked a dispute amongst the English border officials. On the next day she moved to [[Cockermouth]] and was greeted by Richard Lowther, the deputy of [[Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton|Lord Scrope]] at [[Carlisle Castle]]. Lowther escorted Mary to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] on 18 May. Meanwhile, the [[Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] who was at [[Topcliffe, North Yorkshire|Topcliffe]] heard the news from Workington, which was in his jurisdiction. The Earl obtained a letter of authority from the Council of the North at York to be the Scottish Queen's host and to \"let none of them escape.\" When the Earl arrived at Carlisle on 22 May, Richard Lowther defied him, and the Vice-Chamberlain of England, [[Francis Knollys (the elder)|Francis Knollys]], upheld Lowther's actions.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 2 (1900), pp. 408-413</ref>\n\nOver the next five years Mary's supporters in Scotland continued a [[Marian civil war|civil war]] with the Regents of Scotland.\n\n==Queen and King's men==\nA contemporary list of leading supporters on both sides at the battle survives.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 2 (1900), p. 405, no. 653 TNA SP 52/15 f.28.</ref><br />'''For the Queen''':\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Earl of Argyll]]\n* [[Earl of Eglinton]]\n* [[Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis|Earl of Cassillis]]\n* [[Andrew Leslie, 5th Earl of Rothes|Earl of Rothes]]\n* [[George Seton, 7th Lord Seton|Lord Seton]]\n* [[Robert Seton, 1st Earl of Winton|Master of Seton]]\n* [[Lord Herries]]\n* [[Robert Boyd, 5th Lord Boyd|Lord Boyd]]\n* [[Lord Hay of Yester]]\n* [[Lord Ross]]\n* [[James Somerville, 6th Lord Somerville|Lord Somerville]]\n* [[Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley|Lord Claude Hamilton]]\n* Sir James Hamilton & the [[Clan Hamilton|Hamilton name]]\n}}\n'''Killed on Queen's side''':\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Captain Stewart, tutor of [[Castlemilk]]\n* The Goodman of Ormeston, Hamilton\n* John Hamilton of Milburn\n* John Hamilton of Leprevick\n* Laird of [[Hunterston]]\n* James Hamilton of [[Dalserf]]\n* John Hamilton of Garen\n* 60 to 80 gentleman of the Hamilton name, and others\n* A brother of the laird of Lambineton.\n}}\n'''For Regent Moray and the King''':\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Earl of Morton]]\n* [[Alexander Cunningham, 5th Earl of Glencairn|Earl of Glencairn]]\n* [[Earl of Menteith]]\n* [[Alexander Home, 5th Lord Home|Lord Home]]\n* [[Patrick Lindsay, 6th Lord Lindsay|Lord Lindsay]]\n* [[Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree|Lord Ochiltree]]\n* [[William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Lord Ruthven]]\n* Laird of Trawick (sic), John Stewart of [[Traquair]]\n* [[James Douglas, 7th Baron Drumlanrig|Laird of Drumlanrig]]\n* [[William Maitland of Lethington|Lord Secretary Maitland]]\n* [[Duke of Atholl|William Murray of Tullibardine]], Lord Comptroller\n* [[Robert Pitcairn (commendator)|Robert Pitcairn]], [[Abbot of Dunfermline]]\n* John Hay, [[Abbot of Balmerino]],\n* [[Robert Richardson (Lord Treasurer)|Robert Richardson]], [[Lord High Treasurer of Scotland|Lord Treasurer]]\n* [[James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich|Sir James Balfour]], Justice Clerk\n* [[James MacGill of Nether Rankeillour]]\n* Thomas Kennedy, laird of Bargany\n* Laird of [[Glengarnock]]\n* [[Clan MacFarlane|Andrew MacFarlane, laird of MacFarlane with his Highlandmen]]\n* Other great barons and Hamiltons\n}}\n'''Prisoners (taken by Regent Moray)''':\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Lord Seton\n* Master of Cassilis\n* Lord Ross\n* [[Earl of Eglinton|Master of Eglinton]]\n* [[Sheriff of Ayr]]\n* Sir James Hamilton (of Libberton}\n* The two sons of [[John Hamilton (archbishop of St Andrews)|Archbishop Hamilton]]\n* A son of [[Kilwinning Abbey|Lord Kilwinning]], Gavin Hamilton\n* Laird of [[Innerwick Castle|Innerwick]]\n* Laird of Tabroune\n* Laird of Balwearie\n* Laird of Preston younger\n* Laird of Lauchop\n* Laird of Mowe\n* Laird of Irnok\n* Laird of Camskeith\n* Laird of Hahill\n* Laird of Kneeland\n* Laird of Greenschellis\n* [[James Hamilton (assassin)|Goodman of Bothwellhaugh]]\n* Goodman of Pardovan\n* Many more Hamiltona and other  gentlemen\n}}\n\nFrom this list and other evidence, [[Gordon Donaldson]] analysed the allegiances of Scottish families during the 16th century to the cause of Mary, to English or French policy, and to the [[Scottish Reformation]], in his ''All the Queen's Men'' (1983).\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bain, Joseph, ''Calendar of Scottish Papers 1563-1569'', Edinburgh, 1900.\n* [[Antonia Fraser|Fraser, Antonia]], ''Mary Queen of Scots''Orion, London, 1969.\n* Melville, Sir James, ''Memoirs of His Own Life, 1549-1593'', 1827.\n* [[Patrick Fraser Tytler|Tytler, Patrick Fraser]] ''The History of Scotland'', vol.

From here she left for England, never to see Scotland again.\n\nMary crossed the [[Solway Firth]] to [[Workington]] on 16 May 1568 at night with twenty companions. This unexpected event provoked a dispute amongst the English border officials. On the next day she moved to [[Cockermouth]] and was greeted by Richard Lowther, the deputy of [[Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton|Lord Scrope]] at [[Carlisle Castle]]. Lowther escorted Mary to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] on 18 May. Meanwhile, the [[Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] who was at [[Topcliffe, North Yorkshire|Topcliffe]] heard the news from Workington, which was in his jurisdiction. The Earl obtained a letter of authority from the Council of the North at York to be the Scottish Queen's host and to \"let none of them escape.\" When the Earl arrived at Carlisle on 22 May, Richard Lowther defied him, and the Vice-Chamberlain of England, [[Francis Knollys (the elder)|Francis Knollys]], upheld Lowther's actions.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 2 (1900), pp. 408-413</ref>\n\nOver the next five years Mary's supporters in Scotland continued a [[Marian civil war|civil war]] with the Regents of Scotland.\n\n==Queen and King's men==\nA contemporary list of leading supporters on both sides at the battle survives.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 2 (1900), p. 405, no. 653 TNA SP 52/15 f.28.</ref><br />'''For the Queen''':\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Earl of Argyll]]\n* [[Earl of Eglinton]]\n* [[Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis|Earl of Cassillis]]\n* [[Andrew Leslie, 5th Earl of Rothes|Earl of Rothes]]\n* [[George Seton, 7th Lord Seton|Lord Seton]]\n* [[Robert Seton, 1st Earl of Winton|Master of Seton]]\n* [[Lord Herries]]\n* [[Robert Boyd, 5th Lord Boyd|Lord Boyd]]\n* [[Lord Hay of Yester]]\n* [[Lord Ross]]\n* [[James Somerville, 6th Lord Somerville|Lord Somerville]]\n* [[Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley|Lord Claude Hamilton]]\n* Sir James Hamilton & the [[Clan Hamilton|Hamilton name]]\n}}\n'''Killed on Queen's side''':\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Captain Stewart, tutor of [[Castlemilk]]\n* The Goodman of Ormeston, Hamilton\n* John Hamilton of Milburn\n* John Hamilton of Leprevick\n* Laird of [[Hunterston]]\n* James Hamilton of [[Dalserf]]\n* John Hamilton of Garen\n* 60 to 80 gentleman of the Hamilton name, and others\n* A brother of the laird of Lambineton.\n}}\n'''For Regent Moray and the King''':\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Earl of Morton]]\n* [[Alexander Cunningham, 5th Earl of Glencairn|Earl of Glencairn]]\n* [[Earl of Menteith]]\n* [[Alexander Home, 5th Lord Home|Lord Home]]\n* [[Patrick Lindsay, 6th Lord Lindsay|Lord Lindsay]]\n* [[Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree|Lord Ochiltree]]\n* [[William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Lord Ruthven]]\n* Laird of Trawick (sic), John Stewart of [[Traquair]]\n* [[James Douglas, 7th Baron Drumlanrig|Laird of Drumlanrig]]\n* [[William Maitland of Lethington|Lord Secretary Maitland]]\n* [[Duke of Atholl|William Murray of Tullibardine]], Lord Comptroller\n* [[Robert Pitcairn (commendator)|Robert Pitcairn]], [[Abbot of Dunfermline]]\n* John Hay, [[Abbot of Balmerino]],\n* [[Robert Richardson (Lord Treasurer)|Robert Richardson]], [[Lord High Treasurer of Scotland|Lord Treasurer]]\n* [[James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich|Sir James Balfour]], Justice Clerk\n* [[James MacGill of Nether Rankeillour]]\n* Thomas Kennedy, laird of Bargany\n* Laird of [[Glengarnock]]\n* [[Clan MacFarlane|Andrew MacFarlane, laird of MacFarlane with his Highlandmen]]\n* Other great barons and Hamiltons\n}}\n'''Prisoners (taken by Regent Moray)''':\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Lord Seton\n* Master of Cassilis\n* Lord Ross\n* [[Earl of Eglinton|Master of Eglinton]]\n* Sheriff of Ayr\n* Sir James Hamilton (of Libberton}\n* The two sons of [[John Hamilton (archbishop of St Andrews)|Archbishop Hamilton]]\n* A son of [[Kilwinning Abbey|Lord Kilwinning]], Gavin Hamilton\n* Laird of [[Innerwick Castle|Innerwick]]\n* Laird of Tabroune\n* Laird of Balwearie\n* Laird of Preston younger\n* Laird of Lauchop\n* Laird of Mowe\n* Laird of Irnok\n* Laird of Camskeith\n* Laird of Hahill\n* Laird of Kneeland\n* Laird of Greenschellis\n* [[James Hamilton (assassin)|Goodman of Bothwellhaugh]]\n* Goodman of Pardovan\n* Many more Hamiltona and other  gentlemen\n}}\n\nFrom this list and other evidence, [[Gordon Donaldson]] analysed the allegiances of Scottish families during the 16th century to the cause of Mary, to English or French policy, and to the [[Scottish Reformation]], in his ''All the Queen's Men'' (1983).\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bain, Joseph, ''Calendar of Scottish Papers 1563-1569'', Edinburgh, 1900.\n* [[Antonia Fraser|Fraser, Antonia]], ''Mary Queen of Scots''Orion, London, 1969.\n* Melville, Sir James, ''Memoirs of His Own Life, 1549-1593'', 1827.\n* [[Patrick Fraser Tytler|Tytler, Patrick Fraser]] ''The History of Scotland'', vol.

This is usually due to lack of compliance with postal regulations, an incomplete address and [[return address]], or the inability to [[mail forwarding|forward the mail]] when both correspondents move before the letter can be delivered. Largely based on the British model that emerged in the late eighteenth century, many countries developed similar systems for processing undeliverable mail.\n\nThe term 'dead mail' is perhaps a misnomer, and several jurisdictions have opted for the use of the term 'undeliverable mail' as more clearly representing the status of the item whose transmission has been impeded. As it is performed by internal departments within postal administrations, little information about the dead letter office function has ever been made public. A few journal articles and at least one recently published book (Canadian) dealing with this topic have appeared.<ref>{{cite book |last=Plain |first=Brian C. |title=The dead letter office in Canada, 1830-2002: an illustrated postal history |edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=British North America Philatelic Society |location=Surrey, BC   |isbn=0-919854-88-5 |oclc= 84985892|pages=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Allison  | first = Sue  | title = No Return Address | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/no-return-address-29982057/ | journal = Smithsonian  | volume = 31  | issue = 4  | date = July 2000  | accessdate = 2017-02-17 }}</ref>\n\nClassification as a dead letter is one of the few instances where postal personnel are allowed to violate [[secrecy of correspondence]], ostensibly to search for clues as to the letter's origin or destination. Countries must also set up regulations for the disposal of dead letters, particularly when they contain items of value.  Some very valuable items have turned up in undeliverable mail, including a stolen painting by [[Marc Chagall]] which turned up in a [[United States Postal Service]] sorting center in [[Topeka, Kansas]] in January, 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Real Chagall |work=USPS Memo to Mailers |publisher=[[USPS]] |date=March 2002 |url=http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |accessdate=2009-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606083631/http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |archivedate=2002-06-06 }}</ref>\n\nWith increased collection and study of the [[postal marking]]s originating from such offices, the body of literature on this obscure topic may grow.  Many countries, including [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], have issued special labels for envelopes that have travelled through the dead letter office.  Genuinely used examples are highly prized by collectors, although mint labels, because they have no postage value, are often fairly common.\n\nPeople interested in [[Mail|postal service]]s throughout the world sometimes deliberately send mail to fictional addresses throughout the world to see if a particular nation's postal authority would return the mail to the sender. Collectors of postal markings also use this method in order to receive uncommon postal markings seldom seen in everyday mail.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Dead letter office==\n{{about|the postal facility|the album by R.E.M.|Dead Letter Office (album)|the film|Dead Letter Office (film)|section=TRUE}}\n[[File:Dead letter office.png|right|thumb|Dead letter office, probably in [[Washington, D.C.]]; September 1922]]\n\nA '''dead letter office''' ('''DLO''') is a facility within a [[mail|postal system]] where [[Dead letter mail|undeliverable mail]] is processed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Patrick|first1=Douglas & Mary|title=The Musson Stamp Dictionary|date=1973|publisher=Musson Book Company|location=[[Toronto]]|isbn=0773700064|page=[https://archive.org/details/mussonstampdicti00doug/page/64 64]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mussonstampdicti00doug/page/64}}</ref> Mail is considered to be undeliverable when the address is invalid so it cannot be delivered to the addressee, and there is no [[return address]] so it cannot be returned to the sender.\n\nAt a DLO, mail is usually opened to try to find an address to forward to.

This is usually due to lack of compliance with postal regulations, an incomplete address and [[return address]], or the inability to [[mail forwarding|forward the mail]] when both correspondents move before the letter can be delivered. Largely based on the British model that emerged in the late eighteenth century, many countries developed similar systems for processing undeliverable mail.\n\nThe term 'dead mail' is perhaps a misnomer, and several jurisdictions have opted for the use of the term 'undeliverable mail' as more clearly representing the status of the item whose transmission has been impeded. As it is performed by internal departments within postal administrations, little information about the dead letter office function has ever been made public. A few journal articles and at least one recently published book (Canadian) dealing with this topic have appeared.<ref>{{cite book |last=Plain |first=Brian C. |title=The dead letter office in Canada, 1830-2002: an illustrated postal history |edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=British North America Philatelic Society |location=Surrey, BC   |isbn=0-919854-88-5 |oclc= 84985892|pages=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Allison  | first = Sue  | title = No Return Address | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/no-return-address-29982057/ | journal = Smithsonian  | volume = 31  | issue = 4  | date = July 2000  | accessdate = 2017-02-17 }}</ref>\n\nClassification as a dead letter is one of the few instances where postal personnel are allowed to violate [[secrecy of correspondence]], ostensibly to search for clues as to the letter's origin or destination. Countries must also set up regulations for the disposal of dead letters, particularly when they contain items of value.  Some very valuable items have turned up in undeliverable mail, including a stolen painting by [[Marc Chagall]] which turned up in a [[United States Postal Service]] sorting center in [[Topeka, Kansas]] in January, 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Real Chagall |work=USPS Memo to Mailers |publisher=[[USPS]] |date=March 2002 |url=http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |accessdate=2009-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606083631/http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |archivedate=2002-06-06 }}</ref>\n\nWith increased collection and study of the [[postal marking]]s originating from such offices, the body of literature on this obscure topic may grow.  Many countries, including [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], have issued special labels for envelopes that have travelled through the dead letter office.  Genuinely used examples are highly prized by collectors, although mint labels, because they have no postage value, are often fairly common.\n\nPeople interested in [[Mail|postal service]]s throughout the world sometimes deliberately send mail to fictional addresses throughout the world to see if a particular nation's postal authority would return the mail to the sender. Collectors of postal markings also use this method in order to receive uncommon postal markings seldom seen in everyday mail.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Dead letter office==\n{{about|the postal facility|the album by R.E.M.|Dead Letter Office (album)|the film|Dead Letter Office (film)|section=TRUE}}\n[[File:Dead letter office.png|right|thumb|Dead letter office, probably in [[Washington, D.C.]]; September 1922]]\n\nA '''dead letter office''' ('''DLO''') is a facility within a [[mail|postal system]] where [[Dead letter mail|undeliverable mail]] is processed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Patrick|first1=Douglas & Mary|title=The Musson Stamp Dictionary|date=1973|publisher=Musson Book Company|location=[[Toronto]]|isbn=0773700064|page=[https://archive.org/details/mussonstampdicti00doug/page/64 64]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mussonstampdicti00doug/page/64}}</ref> Mail is considered to be undeliverable when the address is invalid so it cannot be delivered to the addressee, and there is no [[return address]] so it cannot be returned to the sender.\n\nAt a DLO, mail is usually opened to try to find an address to forward to.

They then stopped their work and contacted the team of investigators from FBI headquarters who had handled the probe of Clinton's private email server. The investigators saw enough of the emails to decide that they seem pertinent to the Clinton server investigation and that they might be emails not seen before. Because they feel they need a warrant specific to Abedin's emails, officials have not been able to examine them further.\n\nAbedin is cooperating with the investigation, according to Justice Department and FBI officials.

Subsequently, he attended [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland, California]], where he studied with [[Luciano Berio]] and [[Darius Milhaud]] (1961\u20131963) and earned a master's degree in composition. At Mills, Reich composed ''Melodica'' for [[melodica]] and [[tape recorder|tape]], which appeared in 1986 on the three-LP release ''Music from Mills''.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r202182|pure_url=yes}} Music from Mills] at [[AllMusic]]</ref>\n\nReich worked with the [[San Francisco Tape Music Center]] along with [[Pauline Oliveros]], [[Ramon Sender]], [[Morton Subotnick]], [[Phil Lesh]] and [[Terry Riley]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bernstein|first=David|title=The San Francisco Tape Music Center|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24892-2}}</ref> He was involved with the premiere of Riley's ''[[In C]]'' and suggested the use of the eighth note pulse, which is now standard in performance of the piece.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 1960s ===\n\nReich's early forays into composition involved experimentation with [[twelve-tone composition]], but he found the rhythmic aspects of the number twelve more interesting than the pitch aspects.<ref>Malcolm Ball [http://www.oliviermessiaen.org/malcolmball/reich.htm on Steve Reich] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903103635/http://www.oliviermessiaen.org/malcolmball/reich.htm |date=September 3, 2018 }}</ref> Reich also composed film soundtracks for ''Plastic Haircut'' (1963), ''Oh Dem Watermelons'' (1965), and ''Thick Pucker'' (1965), three films by [[Robert Nelson (filmmaker)|Robert Nelson]]. The soundtrack of ''Plastic Haircut'', composed in 1963, was a short tape collage, possibly Reich's first. The ''Watermelons'' soundtrack used two 19th-century [[minstrel show|minstrel tunes]] as its basis, and used repeated phrasing together in a large five-part [[canon (music)|canon]]. The music for ''Thick Pucker'' arose from street recordings Reich made walking around San Francisco with Nelson, who filmed in black and white 16mm. This film no longer survives. A fourth film from 1965, about 25 minutes long and tentatively entitled \"Thick Pucker II\", was assembled by Nelson from outtakes of that shoot and more of the raw audio Reich had recorded. Nelson was not happy with the resulting film and never showed it.\n\nReich was influenced by fellow minimalist [[Terry Riley]], whose work ''[[In C]]'' combines simple musical patterns, offset in time, to create a slowly shifting, cohesive whole. Reich adopted this approach to compose his first major work, ''It's Gonna Rain''. Composed in 1965, the piece used a fragment of a [[sermon]] about the end of the world given by a black [[Pentecostal]] street-preacher known as Brother Walter. Reich built on his early tape work, transferring the last three words of the fragment, \"it's gonna rain!\", to multiple tape loops which gradually move out of phase with one another.\n\nThe 13-minute ''Come Out'' (1966) uses similarly manipulated recordings of a single spoken line given by Daniel Hamm, one of the falsely accused [[Harlem Six]], who was severely injured by police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/Occupied-Territory-Baldwin1966.htm|title=A Report from Occupied Territory|author=James Baldwin|publisher=mindfully.org|date=July 11, 1966|accessdate=April 28, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629144022/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/Occupied-Territory-Baldwin1966.htm|archivedate=June 29, 2013|author-link=James Baldwin}}</ref> The survivor, who had been beaten, punctured a bruise on his own body to convince police about his beating. The spoken line includes the phrase \"to let the bruise\u2019s blood come out to show them.\" Reich rerecorded the fragment \"come out to show them\" on two channels, which are initially played in unison. They quickly slip out of sync; gradually the discrepancy widens and becomes a reverberation. The two voices then split into four, looped continuously, then eight, and continues splitting until the actual words are unintelligible, leaving the listener with only the speech's rhythmic and tonal patterns. \n\n''Melodica'' (1966) takes the phase looping idea of his previous works and applies it to instrumental music. Steve Reich took a simple melody, which he played on a [[melodica]], then recorded it. He then sets the melody to two separate channels, and slowly moves them out of phase, creating an intricate interlocking melody. This piece is very similar to ''Come Out'' in rhythmic structure, and are an example of how one rhythmic process can be realized in different sounds to create two different pieces of music. Reich was inspired to compose this piece from a dream he had on May 22, 1966, and put the piece together in one day. ''Melodica'' was the last piece Reich composed solely for tape, and he considers it his transition from tape music to instrumental music.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Writings on Music, 1965\u20132000|last=Reich|first=Steve|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-511171-0|location=New York|pages=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nReich's first attempt at translating this phasing technique from recorded tape to live performance was the 1967 ''[[Piano Phase]]'', for two pianos. In ''Piano Phase'' the performers repeat a rapid twelve-note [[melody|melodic]] figure, initially in unison. As one player keeps tempo with robotic precision, the other speeds up very slightly until the two parts line up again, but one sixteenth note apart. The second player then resumes the previous tempo. This cycle of speeding up and then locking in continues throughout the piece; the cycle comes full circle three times, the second and third cycles using shorter versions of the initial figure. ''Violin Phase'', also written in 1967, is built on these same lines. ''Piano Phase'' and ''Violin Phase'' both premiered in a series of concerts given in New York art galleries.\n\nA similar, lesser known example of this so-called [[process music]] is ''Pendulum Music'' (1968), which consists of the sound of several microphones swinging over the loudspeakers to which they are attached, producing [[feedback]] as they do so. \"Pendulum Music\" has never been recorded by Reich himself, but was introduced to rock audiences by [[Sonic Youth]] in the late 1990s.\n\nReich also tried to create the phasing effect in a piece \"that would need no instrument beyond the human body\". He found that the idea of phasing was inappropriate for the simple ways he was experimenting to make sound. Instead, he composed ''[[Clapping Music]]'' (1972), in which the players do not phase in and out with each other, but instead one performer keeps one line of a 12-eighth-note-long (12-quaver-long) phrase and the other performer shifts by one [[eighth note]] beat every 12 bars, until both performers are back in unison 144 bars later.<ref>{{cite book|title=Writings on Music, 1965-2000|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tMgpu5gSIOMC&pg=PR13&dq=steve+reich#v=onepage&q=steve%20reich&f=false|accessdate=February 28, 2018|isbn = 9780195111712|last1 = Reich|first1 = Steve|date = April 11, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe 1967 prototype piece ''[[Slow Motion Sound]]'' was not performed although [[Chris Hughes (musician)|Chris Hughes]] performed it 27 years later as ''[[Slow Motion Blackbird]]'' on his Reich-influenced 1994 album ''[[Shift (Chris Hughes album)|Shift]]''. It introduced the idea of slowing down a recorded sound until many times its original length without changing pitch or timbre, which Reich applied to ''Four Organs'' (1970), which deals specifically with augmentation. The piece has [[maraca]]s playing a fast [[eighth note]] [[pulse (music)|pulse]], while the four organs stress certain eighth notes using an 11th chord. This work therefore dealt with [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and subtle rhythmic change. It is unique in the context of Reich's other pieces{{clarify|date=December 2016|post-text=How so \u2013 'unique'?}} in being linear as opposed to cyclic like his earlier works \u2013 the superficially similar ''[[Phase Patterns]]'', also for four organs but without maracas, is (as the name suggests) a phase piece similar to others composed during the period. ''Four Organs'' was performed as part of a [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] program, and was Reich's first composition to be performed in a large traditional setting.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n\nIn 1970, Reich embarked on a five-week trip to study music in Ghana, during which he learned from the master drummer Gideon Alorwoyie. Reich also studied Balinese [[gamelan]] in [[Seattle]] in 1973 and 1974.<ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Reich Biography|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=when+did+steve+reich+study+chinese+bamelan+in+seattle&rlz=1CAHPZP_enUS786US786&safe=active&ssui=on|publisher=Steve Reich|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}</ref>{{When|date=May 2016}}<!--This was in the summer of 1972, but this is a personal recollection and, as such, Original Research.--> From his African experience, as well as [[A. M. Jones]]'s ''[[Studies in African Music]]'' about the [[Ewe music|music of the Ewe]] people, Reich drew inspiration for his 90-minute piece ''[[Drumming (Reich)|Drumming]]'', which he composed shortly after his return. Composed for a nine-piece percussion ensemble with female voices and [[piccolo]], ''Drumming'' marked the beginning of a new stage in his career, for around this time he formed his ensemble, [[Steve Reich and Musicians]], and increasingly concentrated on composition and performance with them. Steve Reich and Musicians, which was to be the sole ensemble to interpret his works for many years, still remains active with many of its original members.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAfter ''Drumming'', Reich moved on from the \"phase shifting\" technique that he had pioneered, and began writing more elaborate pieces. He investigated other musical processes such as [[augmentation (music)|augmentation]] (the temporal lengthening of phrases and melodic fragments). It was during this period that he wrote works such as ''[[Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ]]'' (1973) and ''[[Six Pianos]]'' (1973).\n\nIn 1974, Reich began writing ''[[Music for 18 Musicians]]''. This piece involved many new ideas, although it also hearkened back to earlier pieces. It is based on a [[cycle (music)|cycle]] of [[chord progression|eleven chords]] introduced at the beginning (called \"Pulses\"), followed by a small section of music based on each [[chord (music)|chord]] (\"Sections I-XI\"), and finally a return to the original cycle (\"Pulses\"). This was Reich's first attempt at writing for larger [[musical ensemble|ensembles]]. The increased number of performers resulted in more scope for psychoacoustic effects, which fascinated Reich, and he noted that he would like to \"explore this idea further\". Reich remarked that this one work contained more harmonic movement in the first five minutes than any other work he had written. Steve Reich and Musicians made the premier recording of this work on [[ECM Records]].\n\nReich explored these ideas further in his frequently recorded pieces ''[[Music for a Large Ensemble]]'' (1978) and ''[[Octet (Reich)|Octet]]'' (1979). In these two works, Reich experimented with \"the human breath as the measure of musical duration ... the chords played by the trumpets are written to take one comfortable breath to perform\".<ref>Liner notes for ''Music for a Large Ensemble''</ref> Human voices are part of the musical palette in ''Music for a Large Ensemble'' but the wordless vocal parts simply form part of the texture (as they do in ''Drumming''). With ''Octet'' and his first orchestral piece ''[[Variations for Winds, Strings and Keyboards]]'' (also 1979), Reich's music showed the influence of Biblical [[cantillation]], which he had studied in [[Israel]] since the summer of 1977. After this, the human voice singing a text would play an increasingly important role in Reich's music.\n\n{{quote|The technique [...] consists of taking pre-existing melodic patterns and stringing them together to form a longer melody in the service of a holy text. If you take away the text, you're left with the idea of putting together small motives to make longer melodies \u2013 a technique I had not encountered before.<ref>Schwarz, K. Robert. ''Minimalists'', Phaidon Press, 1996, p.84 and p.86.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1974 Reich published the book ''Writings About Music'', containing essays on his philosophy, aesthetics, and musical projects written between 1963 and 1974. An updated and much more extensive collection, ''Writings On Music (1965\u20132000)'', was published in 2002.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\nReich's work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage. ''[[Tehillim (Reich)|Tehillim]]'' (1981), [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for ''[[psalm]]s'', is the first of Reich's works to draw explicitly on his Jewish background. The work is in four parts, and is scored for an ensemble of four women's voices (one high [[soprano]], two lyric sopranos and one [[alto]]), [[piccolo]], [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[English horn]], two [[clarinet]]s, six percussion (playing small tuned [[tambourine]]s without jingles, clapping, [[maraca]]s, [[marimba]], [[vibraphone]] and [[crotales]]), two [[electronic organ]]s, two violins, [[viola]], cello and [[double bass]], with amplified voices, strings, and winds. A setting of texts from Psalms 19:2\u20135 (19:1\u20134 in Christian translations), 34:13\u201315 (34:12\u201314), 18:26\u201327 (18:25\u201326), and 150:4\u20136, ''Tehillim'' is a departure from Reich's other work in its formal structure; the setting of texts several lines long rather than the fragments used in previous works makes melody a substantive element. Use of formal [[counterpoint]] and functional [[harmony]] also contrasts with the loosely structured minimalist works written previously.\n\n{{listen|type=music\n| filename   = Pat Metheny-Electric Counterpoint III Fast.ogg\n| title    = \"Electric Counterpoint III Fast\" (1989)\n| description = 25 seconds of \"Electric Counterpoint III Fast\" performed by Pat Metheny.

In ''Different Trains'', Reich compares and contrasts his childhood memories of his train journeys between New York and California in 1939\u20131941 with the very different trains being used to transport contemporaneous European children to their deaths under [[Nazism|Nazi]] rule. The [[Kronos Quartet]] recording of ''Different Trains'' was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition]] in 1990. The composition was described by [[Richard Taruskin]] as \"the only adequate musical response\u2014one of the few adequate artistic responses in any medium\u2014to [[the Holocaust]]\", and he credited the piece with earning Reich a place among the great composers of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D91F3FF937A1575BC0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |last=Taruskin |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Taruskin |title=A Sturdy Musical Bridge to the 21st Century |work=The New York Times |date=August 24, 1997 |accessdate=September 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nIn 1993, Reich collaborated with his wife, the video artist [[Beryl Korot]], on an opera, ''[[The Cave (opera)|The Cave]]'', which explores the roots of Judaism, Christianity and Islam through the words of Israelis, [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]], and Americans, echoed musically by the ensemble. The work, for percussion, voices, and strings, is a musical documentary, named for the [[Cave of Machpelah]] in [[Hebron]], where a mosque now stands and [[Abraham]] is said to have been buried.\n\nReich and Korot collaborated on the opera ''[[Three Tales (opera)|Three Tales]]'', which concerns the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]], the testing of [[nuclear weapon]]s on [[Bikini Atoll]], and other more modern concerns, specifically [[Dolly the sheep]], [[cloning]], and the [[technological singularity]].\n\nReich used sampling techniques for pieces like ''Three Tales'' and ''[[City Life (Reich)|City Life]]'' from 1994. Reich returned to composing purely instrumental works for the concert hall, starting with ''Triple Quartet'' in 1998 written for the Kronos Quartet that can either be performed by string quartet and tape, three string quartets or 36-piece string orchestra. According to Reich, the piece is influenced by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s and [[Alfred Schnittke]]'s string quartets, and [[Michael Gordon (composer)|Michael Gordon]]'s ''Yo Shakespeare''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevereich.com/articles/NY-VT.html |title=From New York to Vermont: Conversation with Steve Reich |publisher=Stevereich.com |accessdate=October 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nThe instrumental series for the concert hall continued with ''Dance Patterns'' (2002), ''[[Cello Counterpoint]]'' (2003), and sequence of works centered around Variations: ''You Are (Variations)'' (2004), a work which looks back to the vocal writing of works like ''Tehillim'' or ''The Desert Music'', ''[[Variations for Vibes, Pianos, and Strings]]'' in 2005, for the [[London Sinfonietta]] and ''Daniel Variations'' (2006).\n\nin 2002 Reich was invited by [[Walter Fink]] to the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenportr\u00e4t]] of the [[Rheingau Musik Festival]], as the 12th composer featured.\n\nIn an interview with ''The Guardian'', Reich stated that he continued to follow this direction with his piece ''Double Sextet'' (2007), which was commissioned by [[eighth blackbird]], an American ensemble consisting of the instrumental quintet (flute, clarinet, violin or viola, cello and piano) of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s piece ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' (1912) plus percussion.

Subsequently, he attended [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland, California]], where he studied with [[Luciano Berio]] and [[Darius Milhaud]] (1961\u20131963) and earned a master's degree in composition.

The soundtrack of ''Plastic Haircut'', composed in 1963, was a short tape collage, possibly Reich's first. The ''Watermelons'' soundtrack used two 19th-century [[minstrel show|minstrel tunes]] as its basis, and used repeated phrasing together in a large five-part [[canon (music)|canon]]. The music for ''Thick Pucker'' arose from street recordings Reich made walking around San Francisco with Nelson, who filmed in black and white 16mm. This film no longer survives. A fourth film from 1965, about 25 minutes long and tentatively entitled \"Thick Pucker II\", was assembled by Nelson from outtakes of that shoot and more of the raw audio Reich had recorded. Nelson was not happy with the resulting film and never showed it.\n\nReich was influenced by fellow minimalist [[Terry Riley]], whose work ''[[In C]]'' combines simple musical patterns, offset in time, to create a slowly shifting, cohesive whole. Reich adopted this approach to compose his first major work, ''It's Gonna Rain''. Composed in 1965, the piece used a fragment of a [[sermon]] about the end of the world given by a black [[Pentecostal]] street-preacher known as Brother Walter. Reich built on his early tape work, transferring the last three words of the fragment, \"it's gonna rain!\", to multiple tape loops which gradually move out of phase with one another.\n\nThe 13-minute ''Come Out'' (1966) uses similarly manipulated recordings of a single spoken line given by Daniel Hamm, one of the falsely accused [[Harlem Six]], who was severely injured by police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/Occupied-Territory-Baldwin1966.htm|title=A Report from Occupied Territory|author=James Baldwin|publisher=mindfully.org|date=July 11, 1966|accessdate=April 28, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629144022/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/Occupied-Territory-Baldwin1966.htm|archivedate=June 29, 2013|author-link=James Baldwin}}</ref> The survivor, who had been beaten, punctured a bruise on his own body to convince police about his beating. The spoken line includes the phrase \"to let the bruise\u2019s blood come out to show them.\" Reich rerecorded the fragment \"come out to show them\" on two channels, which are initially played in unison. They quickly slip out of sync; gradually the discrepancy widens and becomes a reverberation. The two voices then split into four, looped continuously, then eight, and continues splitting until the actual words are unintelligible, leaving the listener with only the speech's rhythmic and tonal patterns. \n\n''Melodica'' (1966) takes the phase looping idea of his previous works and applies it to instrumental music. Steve Reich took a simple melody, which he played on a [[melodica]], then recorded it. He then sets the melody to two separate channels, and slowly moves them out of phase, creating an intricate interlocking melody. This piece is very similar to ''Come Out'' in rhythmic structure, and are an example of how one rhythmic process can be realized in different sounds to create two different pieces of music. Reich was inspired to compose this piece from a dream he had on May 22, 1966, and put the piece together in one day. ''Melodica'' was the last piece Reich composed solely for tape, and he considers it his transition from tape music to instrumental music.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Writings on Music, 1965\u20132000|last=Reich|first=Steve|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-511171-0|location=New York|pages=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\nReich's first attempt at translating this phasing technique from recorded tape to live performance was the 1967 ''[[Piano Phase]]'', for two pianos. In ''Piano Phase'' the performers repeat a rapid twelve-note [[melody|melodic]] figure, initially in unison. As one player keeps tempo with robotic precision, the other speeds up very slightly until the two parts line up again, but one sixteenth note apart. The second player then resumes the previous tempo. This cycle of speeding up and then locking in continues throughout the piece; the cycle comes full circle three times, the second and third cycles using shorter versions of the initial figure. ''Violin Phase'', also written in 1967, is built on these same lines. ''Piano Phase'' and ''Violin Phase'' both premiered in a series of concerts given in New York art galleries.\n\nA similar, lesser known example of this so-called [[process music]] is ''Pendulum Music'' (1968), which consists of the sound of several microphones swinging over the loudspeakers to which they are attached, producing [[feedback]] as they do so. \"Pendulum Music\" has never been recorded by Reich himself, but was introduced to rock audiences by [[Sonic Youth]] in the late 1990s.\n\nReich also tried to create the phasing effect in a piece \"that would need no instrument beyond the human body\". He found that the idea of phasing was inappropriate for the simple ways he was experimenting to make sound. Instead, he composed ''[[Clapping Music]]'' (1972), in which the players do not phase in and out with each other, but instead one performer keeps one line of a 12-eighth-note-long (12-quaver-long) phrase and the other performer shifts by one [[eighth note]] beat every 12 bars, until both performers are back in unison 144 bars later.<ref>{{cite book|title=Writings on Music, 1965-2000|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tMgpu5gSIOMC&pg=PR13&dq=steve+reich#v=onepage&q=steve%20reich&f=false|accessdate=February 28, 2018|isbn = 9780195111712|last1 = Reich|first1 = Steve|date = April 11, 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe 1967 prototype piece ''[[Slow Motion Sound]]'' was not performed although [[Chris Hughes (musician)|Chris Hughes]] performed it 27 years later as ''[[Slow Motion Blackbird]]'' on his Reich-influenced 1994 album ''[[Shift (Chris Hughes album)|Shift]]''. It introduced the idea of slowing down a recorded sound until many times its original length without changing pitch or timbre, which Reich applied to ''Four Organs'' (1970), which deals specifically with augmentation. The piece has [[maraca]]s playing a fast [[eighth note]] [[pulse (music)|pulse]], while the four organs stress certain eighth notes using an 11th chord. This work therefore dealt with [[repetition (music)|repetition]] and subtle rhythmic change.

''Four Organs'' was performed as part of a [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] program, and was Reich's first composition to be performed in a large traditional setting.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n\nIn 1970, Reich embarked on a five-week trip to study music in Ghana, during which he learned from the master drummer Gideon Alorwoyie. Reich also studied Balinese [[gamelan]] in [[Seattle]] in 1973 and 1974.<ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Reich Biography|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=when+did+steve+reich+study+chinese+bamelan+in+seattle&rlz=1CAHPZP_enUS786US786&safe=active&ssui=on|publisher=Steve Reich|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}</ref>{{When|date=May 2016}}<!--This was in the summer of 1972, but this is a personal recollection and, as such, Original Research.--> From his African experience, as well as [[A. M. Jones]]'s ''[[Studies in African Music]]'' about the [[Ewe music|music of the Ewe]] people, Reich drew inspiration for his 90-minute piece ''[[Drumming (Reich)|Drumming]]'', which he composed shortly after his return. Composed for a nine-piece percussion ensemble with female voices and [[piccolo]], ''Drumming'' marked the beginning of a new stage in his career, for around this time he formed his ensemble, [[Steve Reich and Musicians]], and increasingly concentrated on composition and performance with them. Steve Reich and Musicians, which was to be the sole ensemble to interpret his works for many years, still remains active with many of its original members.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAfter ''Drumming'', Reich moved on from the \"phase shifting\" technique that he had pioneered, and began writing more elaborate pieces. He investigated other musical processes such as [[augmentation (music)|augmentation]] (the temporal lengthening of phrases and melodic fragments). It was during this period that he wrote works such as ''[[Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ]]'' (1973) and ''[[Six Pianos]]'' (1973).\n\nIn 1974, Reich began writing ''[[Music for 18 Musicians]]''. This piece involved many new ideas, although it also hearkened back to earlier pieces. It is based on a [[cycle (music)|cycle]] of [[chord progression|eleven chords]] introduced at the beginning (called \"Pulses\"), followed by a small section of music based on each [[chord (music)|chord]] (\"Sections I-XI\"), and finally a return to the original cycle (\"Pulses\"). This was Reich's first attempt at writing for larger [[musical ensemble|ensembles]]. The increased number of performers resulted in more scope for psychoacoustic effects, which fascinated Reich, and he noted that he would like to \"explore this idea further\". Reich remarked that this one work contained more harmonic movement in the first five minutes than any other work he had written. Steve Reich and Musicians made the premier recording of this work on [[ECM Records]].\n\nReich explored these ideas further in his frequently recorded pieces ''[[Music for a Large Ensemble]]'' (1978) and ''[[Octet (Reich)|Octet]]'' (1979). In these two works, Reich experimented with \"the human breath as the measure of musical duration ... the chords played by the trumpets are written to take one comfortable breath to perform\".<ref>Liner notes for ''Music for a Large Ensemble''</ref> Human voices are part of the musical palette in ''Music for a Large Ensemble'' but the wordless vocal parts simply form part of the texture (as they do in ''Drumming''). With ''Octet'' and his first orchestral piece ''[[Variations for Winds, Strings and Keyboards]]'' (also 1979), Reich's music showed the influence of Biblical [[cantillation]], which he had studied in [[Israel]] since the summer of 1977. After this, the human voice singing a text would play an increasingly important role in Reich's music.\n\n{{quote|The technique [...] consists of taking pre-existing melodic patterns and stringing them together to form a longer melody in the service of a holy text. If you take away the text, you're left with the idea of putting together small motives to make longer melodies \u2013 a technique I had not encountered before.<ref>Schwarz, K. Robert. ''Minimalists'', Phaidon Press, 1996, p.84 and p.86.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1974 Reich published the book ''Writings About Music'', containing essays on his philosophy, aesthetics, and musical projects written between 1963 and 1974. An updated and much more extensive collection, ''Writings On Music (1965\u20132000)'', was published in 2002.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\nReich's work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage. ''[[Tehillim (Reich)|Tehillim]]'' (1981), [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for ''[[psalm]]s'', is the first of Reich's works to draw explicitly on his Jewish background. The work is in four parts, and is scored for an ensemble of four women's voices (one high [[soprano]], two lyric sopranos and one [[alto]]), [[piccolo]], [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[English horn]], two [[clarinet]]s, six percussion (playing small tuned [[tambourine]]s without jingles, clapping, [[maraca]]s, [[marimba]], [[vibraphone]] and [[crotales]]), two [[electronic organ]]s, two violins, [[viola]], cello and [[double bass]], with amplified voices, strings, and winds. A setting of texts from Psalms 19:2\u20135 (19:1\u20134 in Christian translations), 34:13\u201315 (34:12\u201314), 18:26\u201327 (18:25\u201326), and 150:4\u20136, ''Tehillim'' is a departure from Reich's other work in its formal structure; the setting of texts several lines long rather than the fragments used in previous works makes melody a substantive element. Use of formal [[counterpoint]] and functional [[harmony]] also contrasts with the loosely structured minimalist works written previously.\n\n{{listen|type=music\n| filename   = Pat Metheny-Electric Counterpoint III Fast.ogg\n| title    = \"Electric Counterpoint III Fast\" (1989)\n| description = 25 seconds of \"Electric Counterpoint III Fast\" performed by Pat Metheny.

In ''Different Trains'', Reich compares and contrasts his childhood memories of his train journeys between New York and California in 1939\u20131941 with the very different trains being used to transport contemporaneous European children to their deaths under [[Nazism|Nazi]] rule. The [[Kronos Quartet]] recording of ''Different Trains'' was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition]] in 1990. The composition was described by [[Richard Taruskin]] as \"the only adequate musical response\u2014one of the few adequate artistic responses in any medium\u2014to [[the Holocaust]]\", and he credited the piece with earning Reich a place among the great composers of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D91F3FF937A1575BC0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |last=Taruskin |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Taruskin |title=A Sturdy Musical Bridge to the 21st Century |work=The New York Times |date=August 24, 1997 |accessdate=September 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nIn 1993, Reich collaborated with his wife, the video artist [[Beryl Korot]], on an opera, ''[[The Cave (opera)|The Cave]]'', which explores the roots of Judaism, Christianity and Islam through the words of Israelis, [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]], and Americans, echoed musically by the ensemble. The work, for percussion, voices, and strings, is a musical documentary, named for the [[Cave of Machpelah]] in [[Hebron]], where a mosque now stands and [[Abraham]] is said to have been buried.\n\nReich and Korot collaborated on the opera ''[[Three Tales (opera)|Three Tales]]'', which concerns the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]], the testing of [[nuclear weapon]]s on [[Bikini Atoll]], and other more modern concerns, specifically [[Dolly the sheep]], [[cloning]], and the [[technological singularity]].\n\nReich used sampling techniques for pieces like ''Three Tales'' and ''[[City Life (Reich)|City Life]]''  from 1994. Reich returned to composing purely instrumental works for the concert hall, starting with ''Triple Quartet'' in 1998 written for the Kronos Quartet that can either be performed by string quartet and tape, three string quartets or 36-piece string orchestra. According to Reich, the piece is influenced by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]]'s and [[Alfred Schnittke]]'s string quartets, and [[Michael Gordon (composer)|Michael Gordon]]'s ''Yo Shakespeare''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevereich.com/articles/NY-VT.html |title=From New York to Vermont: Conversation with Steve Reich |publisher=Stevereich.com |accessdate=October 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nThe instrumental series for the concert hall continued with ''Dance Patterns'' (2002), ''[[Cello Counterpoint]]'' (2003), and sequence of works centered around Variations: ''You Are (Variations)'' (2004), a work which looks back to the vocal writing of works like ''Tehillim'' or ''The Desert Music'', ''[[Variations for Vibes, Pianos, and Strings]]'' in 2005, for the [[London Sinfonietta]] and ''Daniel Variations'' (2006).\n\nin 2002 Reich was invited by [[Walter Fink]] to the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenportr\u00e4t]] of the [[Rheingau Musik Festival]], as the 12th composer featured.\n\nIn an interview with ''The Guardian'', Reich stated that he continued to follow this direction with his piece ''Double Sextet'' (2007), which was commissioned by [[eighth blackbird]], an American ensemble consisting of the instrumental quintet (flute, clarinet, violin or viola, cello and piano) of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s piece ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' (1912) plus percussion.

The concept has existed for centuries and research and development have continued into the modern era. EW has been used in battle by Japan and several other nations have developed and been accused of using an entomological warfare program. EW may employ insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a [[biological agent]], such as [[plague (disease)|plague]]. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a [[pathogen]] and then dispersing the insects over target areas.<ref name=\"sunshine\">\"[http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf An Introduction to Biological Weapons, Their Prohibition, and the Relationship to Biosafety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512163809/http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf |date=12 May 2013 }}\", ''[[The Sunshine Project]]'', April 2002.

The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=30 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archive-date= 7 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force. Note that these concerns generally do not apply to biologically-derived toxins - while classified as biological weapons, the organism that produces them is not used on the battlefield, so they present concerns similar to [[chemical weapons]]. \n\n===Anti-personnel===\n[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]\n\nIdeal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (the ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.\n\nThe primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage, and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.\n\nFor example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary [[influenza]]-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal [[hemorrhagic]] [[mediastinitis]] within 3\u20137 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |title=Anthrax Facts &#124; UPMC Center for Health Security |publisher=Upmc-biosecurity.org |access-date=2013-09-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302063353/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |archive-date=2 March 2013 }}</ref> Finally, friendly personnel and civilians can be protected with suitable [[antibiotic]]s.\n\nAgents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''[[Brucella]] spp.'', ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'', ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', some of the [[Rickettsiaceae]] (especially ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' and ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]''), ''[[Shigella]] spp.'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''.

These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as [[select agent]]s. In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s Select Agent Program.\n\nThe former [[US biological warfare program]] categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either '''Lethal Agents''' (''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Francisella tularensis'', Botulinum toxin) or '''Incapacitating Agents''' (''Brucella suis'', ''Coxiella burnetii'', Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).\n\n===Anti-agriculture===\n====Anti-crop/anti-vegetation/anti-fisheries====\n{{see also|United States herbicidal warfare research}}\nThe United States developed an anti-crop capability during the [[Cold War]] that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture. Biological weapons also target fisheries as well as water-based vegetation. It was believed that the destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart [[Sino-Soviet relations|Sino-Soviet]] aggression in a general war. Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotic (epidemics among plants).

Health care providers and public health officers are among the first lines of defense. In some countries private, local, and provincial (state) capabilities are being augmented by and coordinated with federal assets, to provide layered defenses against biological weapon attacks. During the [[first Gulf War]] the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, [[Task Force Scorpio]], to respond to any potential use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians.\n\nThe traditional approach toward protecting agriculture, food, and water: focusing on the natural or unintentional introduction of a disease is being strengthened by focused efforts to address current and anticipated future biological weapons threats that may be deliberate, multiple, and repetitive.\n\nThe growing threat of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism has led to the development of specific field tools that perform on-the-spot analysis and identification of encountered suspect materials. One such technology, being developed by researchers from the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), employs a \"sandwich immunoassay\", in which fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies aimed at specific [[pathogen]]s are attached to silver and gold nanowires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html|title=Physorg.com, \"Encoded Metallic Nanowires Reveal Bioweapons\", 12:50 EST, 10 August 2006.|access-date=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231844/http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html|archive-date=5 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the company [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] has designed [[BiosparQ|Bioaerosol Single Particle Recognition eQuipment]] (BiosparQ).

Biological weapons allow for the potential to create a level of destruction and loss of life far in excess of nuclear, chemical or conventional weapons, relative to their mass and cost of development and storage. Therefore, biological agents may be useful as strategic deterrents in addition to their utility as offensive weapons on the battlefield.<ref>[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/7/3/6/4/p73644_index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430190200/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/7/3/6/4/p73644_index.html|date=30 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs a tactical weapon for military use, a significant problem with a BW attack is that it would take days to be effective, and therefore might not immediately stop an opposing force. Some biological agents ([[smallpox]], [[pneumonic plague]]) have the capability of person-to-person [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] via [[Bioaerosol|aerosolized]] [[Droplet contact|respiratory droplets]]. This feature can be undesirable, as the agent(s) may be transmitted by this mechanism to unintended populations, including neutral or even friendly forces. Worse still, such a weapon could \"escape\" the laboratory where it was developed, even if there was no intent to use it - for example by infecting a researcher who then transmits it to the outside world before realizing that they were infected.

The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=30 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archive-date= 7 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force. Note that these concerns generally do not apply to biologically-derived toxins - while classified as biological weapons, the organism that produces them is not used on the battlefield, so they present concerns similar to [[chemical weapons]]. \n\n===Anti-personnel===\n[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]\n\nIdeal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (the ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.\n\nThe primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage, and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.\n\nFor example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary [[influenza]]-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal [[hemorrhagic]] [[mediastinitis]] within 3\u20137 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |title=Anthrax Facts &#124; UPMC Center for Health Security |publisher=Upmc-biosecurity.org |access-date=2013-09-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302063353/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |archive-date=2 March 2013 }}</ref> Finally, friendly personnel and civilians can be protected with suitable [[antibiotic]]s.\n\nAgents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''[[Brucella]] spp.'', ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'', ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', some of the [[Rickettsiaceae]] (especially ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' and ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]''), ''[[Shigella]] spp.'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. Many viral agents have been studied and/or weaponized, including some of the [[Bunyaviridae]] (especially [[Rift Valley fever|Rift Valley fever virus]]), [[Ebola]]virus, many of the [[Flaviviridae]] (especially [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese encephalitis virus]]), [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever|Machupo virus]], [[Marburg virus]], Variola virus, and [[Yellow fever|yellow fever virus]].

These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as [[select agent]]s. In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s Select Agent Program.\n\nThe former [[US biological warfare program]] categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either '''Lethal Agents''' (''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Francisella tularensis'', Botulinum toxin) or '''Incapacitating Agents''' (''Brucella suis'', ''Coxiella burnetii'', Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).\n\n===Anti-agriculture===\n====Anti-crop/anti-vegetation/anti-fisheries====\n{{see also|United States herbicidal warfare research}}\nThe United States developed an anti-crop capability during the [[Cold War]] that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture. Biological weapons also target fisheries as well as water-based vegetation. It was believed that the destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart [[Sino-Soviet relations|Sino-Soviet]] aggression in a general war. Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotic (epidemics among plants). When the United States renounced its offensive biological warfare program in 1969 and 1970, the vast majority of its biological arsenal was composed of these plant diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Franz|first=David|name-list-format=vanc|title=The U.S. Biological Warfare and Biological Defense Programs|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/medaspec/Ch-19electrv699.pdf|journal=Arizona University|access-date=14 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219221907/http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/medaspec/Ch-19electrv699.pdf|archive-date=19 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Enterotoxins and Mycotoxins were not affected by Nixon's order.\n\nThough herbicides are chemicals, they are often grouped with biological warfare and chemical warfare because they may work in a similar manner as [[biotoxin]]s or bioregulators.

The song was played during the [[Miss USA]] pageant in 1994, but not in full. It was widely advertised in news and trade magazines that a new song from Prince would be premiered at the pageant. The ads had Prince sitting in a chair with a hat pulled down over his face, and Garcia standing next to his chair. The song was officially released on February 24, 1994. It later appeared on ''[[The Gold Experience]]''.\n\nThe version on ''The Gold Experience'' is remixed. The drums are more crisp in the mix, and there are slight instrumental changes. There are also added sound effects and instrumental breaks in the second version. The bridge is slightly more robust as well. The song is still based in light [[guitar]], [[Electronic keyboard|keyboards]] and live [[Drum kit|drums]]. Although most of the song is sung in falsetto with Prince reaching some extremely high notes, the final bridge has him using his regular voice as well as a lower baritone range in one small segment.\n\nThe song was a worldwide hit and established Prince's ability to succeed commercially under his new name, peaking at No. 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] and sold 700,000 copies domestically.<ref>{{cite certification|region=United States|artist=Prince|title=The Most Beautiful Girl in the World}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA57|title=Best-Selling Records of 1994|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=BPI Communications|date=January 21, 1995|page=57|issn=0006-2510|volume=107|number=3}}</ref> However, the song was his last top 10 hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 during his lifetime.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Trust |first1=Gary |title=Desiigner Holds Off Drake Atop Hot 100, Prince & Beyonce Hit Top 10 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7350427/desiigner-drake-hot-100-prince-beyonce-top-10 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard.com]] |accessdate=2017-12-09 |date=2016-05-02}}</ref> \n\nIt became his first and only United Kingdom No. 1 single under any name as a performer.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=David|title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|year=2006|isbn=1-904994-10-5|edition=19th|location=London|page=565}}</ref> He did have two other United Kingdom number ones as a songwriter: the 1984 hit single \"[[I Feel for You]]\" covered by [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]]'s 1990 cover of \"[[Nothing Compares 2 U]]\".

In his singles chronology, it was his third major release since changing his stage name to \"The Artist Formerly Known As Prince\" or \"TAFKAP.\" In his albums chronology, it along with the EP was his second release after changing his name. With the consent of Prince's usual record distributor [[Warner Bros. Records]], \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World\" was released by [[NPG Records]] and [[Edel Music]], and independently distributed by [[Bellmark Records]], under the control and guidance of [[Music of Life]], as a one-off single, topping five different charts.\n\nThe single was released in February 1994 in the United Kingdom, and remains Prince's only number one single in the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location= London|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=565}}</ref> and was shortly followed by an [[Extended play|EP]] of [[remix]]es titled ''[[The Beautiful Experience]]'' that also charted on #18 in the chart in the United Kingdom. The version that was released on ''The Gold Experience'' is a different mix of the song.\n\nThere has been a long running copyright dispute since 1995 and a court in Italy ruled that Prince had plagiarized the song, giving writing credit to those other than Prince. <ref> https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7445762/princes-italian-plagiarism-case</ref>\n\n==Development==\nThe original track is a slow-grooving [[ballad]] that serenades a beautiful woman, his soon-to-be fianc\u00e9, [[Mayte Garcia]]. The song was played during the [[Miss USA]] pageant in 1994, but not in full. It was widely advertised in news and trade magazines that a new song from Prince would be premiered at the pageant. The ads had Prince sitting in a chair with a hat pulled down over his face, and Garcia standing next to his chair. The song was officially released on February 24, 1994. It later appeared on ''[[The Gold Experience]]''.\n\nThe version on ''The Gold Experience'' is remixed. The drums are more crisp in the mix, and there are slight instrumental changes. There are also added sound effects and instrumental breaks in the second version. The bridge is slightly more robust as well. The song is still based in light [[guitar]], [[Electronic keyboard|keyboards]] and live [[Drum kit|drums]]. Although most of the song is sung in falsetto with Prince reaching some extremely high notes, the final bridge has him using his regular voice as well as a lower baritone range in one small segment.\n\nThe song was a worldwide hit and established Prince's ability to succeed commercially under his new name, peaking at No. 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].
