Many of these bus companies also operated coach services and these were initially branded as ''National''. The ''National Express'' brand was first used in 1974 although the coach services continued to be operated by the individual companies.<ref name=history>[http://www.nationalexpressgroup.com/aboutus/ourhistory.aspx National Express Group: Our History] National Express</ref><ref name=MMC0294>[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm24/2468/2468.pdf National Express Group PLC and Saltire Holdings Ltd] Monopolies & Mergers Commission February 1994 page 3</ref>\n\nCoach services were deregulated under the [[Transport Act 1980]], and buses by the [[Transport Act 1985]].

A number of operators attempted to compete with the company after deregulation in 1980, the largest being the [[British Coachways]] consortium, but most had ceased to compete by the end of the decade.<ref>{{cite book |last=Townsin |first=Alan |title=The British Bus Story \u2013 The Early '80s: The Die is Cast |publisher=The Transport Publishing Company |year=1992 |chapter=Coach deregulation arrives |pages=22\u201324 |isbn=978-0-86317-170-3}}</ref> However, in 2003, [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] introduced [[Megabus (Europe)|Megabus]], a [[no-frills]] service whose \u00a31 fares sparked a price war with National Express in autumn 2004. The competition intensified in 2007 when Megabus transferred its London terminus from the [[Green Line Coach Station]] into the main [[Victoria Coach Station]].\n\nIn November 2007 National Express announced plans to re-brand all its operations under a new unified National Express identity.<ref>[http://www.nationalexpressgroup.com/media/corporatenews.aspx?newsyear=2007&newsitem=66 New Identity for National Express Group] National Express 15 November 2007</ref> As part of this the coach operation received a slightly different livery, retaining the red, white and blue theme, but with a new lower-case logo. Coaches started appearing in the new livery from December 2007.\n\n==National network==\nA national network links more than 540 locations, including 59 of the UK mainland's 64 cities, with 1,800 plus services operating every day, increasing to over 1,900 on Fridays. Over 1,000 airport services a day run direct to the terminal for all major UK airports.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Operations==\n[[File:National Express old livery.jpg|thumb|[[Plaxton Premiere]] bodied [[Volvo B10M]] at [[Manchester Airport]] in April 2003]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Yorkshire 53034.JPG|thumb|[[Stagecoach Yorkshire]] [[Plaxton Panther]] bodied [[Volvo B12B]] in the 2003 livery at [[Southampton]] in 2008]]\n[[File:Plaxton Elite YN10 FKM Selwyns National Express.jpg|thumb|Selwyn's [[Plaxton Elite]] bodied [[Volvo B9R]] in [[Liverpool]]]]\nNational Express offers many routes to destinations across the country. In addition, shuttle and airport services are also operated, although there is no obvious difference to the passenger between a standard, shuttle or airport service with regard to branding.\n\nMany National Express coach routes pass through several town centres, which increases journey times for longer journeys considerably. A smaller number of shuttle services operate at least once an hour over faster direct routes.\n\nNational Express operates coach services direct to the terminal for all major UK airports, 24 hours a day, with 1,100 airport services every day, including [[East Midlands Airport|East Midlands]], [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]], [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[Luton Airport|Luton]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]]. The ''Airport'' brand was created in 2003 when the National Express image brand was updated, merging the former Airlink, Flightlink, Jetlink and Speedlink brands. In the 2007 re-brand, the ''Airport'' branding was dropped, although the 'Airport' coding is still used on tickets.\n\n===Accessible travel===\n99% of the National Express fleet are fitted with wheelchair lifts. Wheelchair users are not required to book in advance but a dedicated Assisted Travel Team are available to help with booking and can advise on wheelchair compatibility and accessible stops.\n\nNational Express coaches are modern and comfortable with reclining leather seats, air conditioning, free entertainment via VUER (a complimentary onboard entertainment app offering films, TV and magazines), free wifi, power sockets and toilets.\n\n=== Franchised operators ===\nThe majority of National Express services are contracted on long-term agreements to local coach companies, known as Partner Operators. As part of the contract, operators are required to use coaches in full National Express livery. On occasion, an operator will use its own branded vehicle due to lack of availability, but will be penalised financially for doing so. A wider list of additional operators are also available to 'bid' for occasional work on the network \u2013 usually providing a one-off duplicate service to meet demand. Whilst still having to meet strict criteria, these coaches are usually not in National Express livery.\n\nNational Express operates some services itself, primarily those between [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]], [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] and [[Luton Airport|Luton]] airports, and [[Victoria Coach Station]], [[Liverpool Street railway station|London Liverpool Street]] and [[Woking railway station|Woking]].\n\nBelow is a list of partner operators:{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n* Ambassador Travel,Great Yarmouth\n* Bennetts Coaches,Gloucester\n* Bruce's Coaches,Salsburgh\n* Chalfont Coaches, [[Southall]]\n* Edwards Coaches Llantwit Fardre & Avonmouth Bristol\n* East Yorkshire Motor Services Kingston upon Hull\n* [[Galloway European]], [[Mendlesham]]\n* [[Go North East]], [[Chester-Le-Street]]\n* [[Go South Coast]], [[Poole]]\n* [[Go Whippet]], [[Swavesey]]\n* Johnson Bros Tours, [[Worksop]]\n* [[Lucketts Travel]], [[Fareham]]\n* Llew Jones International, [[Llanrwst]]\n* [[National Express West Midlands]] (Walsall Garage)\n* Park's Motor Group|Park's,Hamilton, South Lanarkshire Hamilton\n* [[Reading Buses]], [[Reading, Berkshire]]\n* [[Selwyns Travel]], [[Runcorn]]\n* [[Skills Coaches]], [[Nottingham]]\n* [[Stotts Coaches]], [[Huddersfield]]\n* [[Stagecoach Yorkshire]], [[Barnsley]]\n* [[The Kings Ferry]], [[Deal, Kent|Deal]]\n* Travelstar European, [[Walsall]]\n* [[Travel de Courcey]], [[Coventry]]\n* [[Wilts & Dorset]], [[Salisbury]]\n* [[Yellow Buses]], [[Bournemouth]]\n* Yeomans Canyon Travel, [[Hereford]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Fares==\nNational Express tickets are available through a variety of methods, including on-line and telephone booking, and varied pricing structures. Traditionally, tickets are sold through National Express ticket offices at coach stations, or by third-party agents at bus stations and travel agents. These sell tickets generally at the 'Standard Fare' or the 'Advance Fare' when booking in advance. A similar ticketing structure applies with the telephone booking service. Since 2013, tickets have also been available for purchase from the [[Post Office Ltd|Post Office]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postoffice.co.uk/national-express-tickets|title=National Express Tickets - Post Office|author=|date=|website=www.postoffice.co.uk|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the introduction of competition from [[Megabus (Europe)|Megabus]], more competitive internet-only ''Funfares'' were introduced. These often have stricter conditions imposed, such as being non-refundable, and are restricted to certain corridors.\n\nOther ticket types include 'Season Tickets' and 'Multi-rides', aimed at frequent travellers, although in many cases FunFares are cheaper; and BritXplorer, which allows foreign tourists unlimited travel for a specified period.\n\n;Coachcards\n\nNational Express offers several discounts to customers. \n*'''Young Persons Coachcard''' \u2013 Available to people aged 16\u201326. This card gives a third off standard and fully flexible fares, plus 15% off events services.\n*'''Senior Coachcard''' \u2013 Following the Government's scrapping of the concessionary half-price fares for the over-60s in October 2011, National Express introduced a Senior Coachcard. Available to over-60s, this gives a third off standard and fully flexible fares.\n*'''Disabled Coachcard''' \u2013 Following the government's scrapping of the concessionary half-price fares for disabled people in October 2011, National Express introduced a Disabled Coachcard. Available to adults registered as disabled, this gives a third off standard and fully flexible fares.\n\n==Fleet==\n[[File:National Express Selwyns Caetano Levante coach FN62 CDE Widnes.jpg|thumb|Selwyn's [[Caetano Levante]] bodied [[Volvo B9R]] in [[Widnes]]]]\n[[File:Bristol Coach Station - Edwards BV66WPN.JPG|thumb|A Caetano Boa Vista at [[Bristol bus station|Bristol]] on a service franchised to Edward's Coaches]]\nNational Express and its franchisees operate a number of vehicle types.\n\nThe primary coach type on the network is the [[Caetano Levante]], which may have 2 or 3 axles. This has been the main vehicle of choice since 2006. The most recent Levante III was introduced onto the network in July 2018.\n\nOther branded vehicles used on the network include (in order of quantity):\n*[[Plaxton Elite]] (2 and 3 axle versions)\n*Caetano Boa Vista (double decker)\n\nHaving withdrawn all its double deck coaches after an [[National Express January 2007 coach crash|accident in January 2007]], in October 2016 National Express placed six Caetano bodied [[Scania K-series|Scania K410s]] into service.<ref>[http://www.route-one.net/articles/Coach%20routes/National_Express_dips_toe_in_double_decker_coach_market National Express dips toe in double-deck coach market] ''Route One'' 26 October 2016</ref>\n\n==On-board services==\nIn the mid-1980s during the ''Rapide'' era, an on-board tea service and on-board televisions were in operation. These were given extensive advertising campaigns as shown on the [[BBC Three]] documentary ''History of the Coach''.\n\nIn April 2001 National Express phased out its on-board catering service, having already phased out its on-board television service in the 1990s. However, in late 2004 National Express launched ''NXTV'' or ''National Xpress Television''. Rather than showing a whole film as on an aircraft, ''NXTV'' would instead show various episodes of British television series such as ''[[A Touch of Frost]]'', ''[[My Family]]'' and ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', all of which were commissioned by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and the [[BBC]]. The service was displayed on small monitors situated above the overhead luggage compartments, powered by a motor to move downwards and upwards while the programming would be played from a DVD drive at the driver's dashboard.\n\nThe service was phased out in the summer of 2006, due to a lack of interest in purchasing headphones, available at vending machines in the major stations and also via on-board vendors before a journey. The reason for the service's failure was that the headphone jack was compatible with any headphone, removing any reason to buy those offered. Also, by the time ''NXTV'' was launched, the Apple [[iPod]] was already at its height of popularity, diverting interest away from it. Programming was also very limited, with many of the episodes being frequent repeats from terrestrial television. The headphones were later given away free when the service was about to be ceased. The advertising slogan was \"Television shows as you board the coach\".\n\nNational Express Coaches now offers free [[WiFi]] on most coaches. Passengers can connect to a digital entertainment service, VUER, and watch hours of films and TV for free. \n\n==Accidents==\nSince National Express started operating, incidents include:\n* 26 July 1974: Three killed and over 30 injured when a double-decker overturned on the M1 near [[Luton]] after swerving to avoid an earlier collision.\n* 17 August 1983: Three killed on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Swindon]] when a lorry careered into the side of a coach.\n* 3 August 1985: One killed and 40 injured when a double-decker overturned on the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] in [[County Durham]] after swerving to avoid a sheep on the carriageway.{{Citation needed|reason=Feb 2010|date=February 2010}}\n* In 2007, two coaches were involved in separate fatal accidents, in [[National Express January 2007 coach crash|January]] and [[National Express September 2007 coach crash|September]].\n* On 4 September 2009 at [[Gatwick Airport]], a car collided with and ended up underneath a National Express coach. The single occupant of the car was killed instantly. The coach driver was taken to hospital and treated for shock. One coach passenger suffered a minor injury. <ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8238872.stm |title=Crash Leads to Gatwick Congestion |work=BBC News |date=4 September 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/cardiff-news/2009/09/07/bus-crash-victim-melanie-wisden-s-family-describe-their-heartbreak-91466-24622441/ |title=Bus crash victim Melanie Wisden's family describe their heartbreak |date=7 September 2009 |work=Wales Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8240341.stm |title=Gatwick crash woman's lift favour |work=BBC News |date=6 September 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref>\n* On 17 April 2018 a coach travelling from [[Manchester]] to [[Birmingham]] was involved in a crash on the [[M6 motorway]] near [[Crewe]]; two people on board were injured and taken to hospital.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of bus operators of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Coach transport in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[ALSA (bus company)|ALSA]], another bus & coach subsidiary of National Express\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline}}\n*{{official website}}\n\n{{NEXG|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Coach operators in England]]\n[[Category:Coach operators in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Coach operators in Wales]]\n[[Category:Former nationalised industries of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:National Express companies]]\n[[Category:1972 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Airport bus services]]\n\n[[cs:National Express]]\n[[fi:National Express]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the United Kingdom long distance coach company|its parent company|National Express}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Infobox Bus transit\n|name            =\n|logo            = National Express Logo.svg\n|logo_size       = 250\n|parent          = [[National Express]]\n|founded         = 1972\n|headquarters    = [[Birmingham]]\n|MD              = Chris Hardy\n|service_area    = [[Great Britain]]\n|service_type    = [[Intercity bus service|Intercity]] and InterRegional [[Coach (bus)|coach]] services\n|destinations    =\n|hubs            = [[Birmingham Coach Station|Birmingham]]<br>[[Victoria Coach Station|London]]<br>[[Manchester Chorlton Street coach station|Manchester]]<br>[[Gatwick Airport]]<br>[[Heathrow Central bus station|Heathrow Airport]]<br>[[Southampton]]<br>[[Leeds City bus station|Leeds]]\n|fleet           =\n|operator        =\n|md              = Chris_Hardy\n|website         = {{url|http://www.nationalexpress.com/}}}}\n\n'''National Express'''<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/00232767 Companies House extract company no 232767] National Express Limited</ref> is an [[Intercity bus service|intercity]] and Inter-regional coach operator providing services throughout [[Great Britain]].

Traditionally, tickets are sold through National Express ticket offices at coach stations, or by third-party agents at various bus stations and travel agents. These sell tickets generally at the 'Standard Fare' or at 'Advance Fares' when booking in advance. A similar ticketing structure also applies with the telephone booking service. Since 2013, tickets have also been available for purchase from the [[Post Office Ltd|Post Office]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postoffice.co.uk/national-express-tickets|title=National Express Tickets - Post Office|author=|date=|website=www.postoffice.co.uk|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the introduction of competition from [[Megabus (Europe)|Megabus]], more competitive internet-only ''Funfares'' were introduced. These often have stricter conditions imposed, such as being non-refundable, and are restricted to certain corridors only.\n\nOther ticket types include 'Season Tickets' and 'Multi-rides', aimed at frequent travellers, although in many cases FunFares are cheaper; and BritXplorer, which allows foreign tourists unlimited travel for a specified period.\n\n;Coachcards\nNational Express currently offers a range of coachcards to customers which allow discounts on travel. \n*'''Young Person Coachcard''' \u2013 Available to young people aged 16 - 26. This discount card allows a third off standard and fully flexible fares, plus 15% off events services.\n*'''Senior Coachcard''' \u2013 Following the Government's scrapping of the concessionary half price fares for the over 60s in October 2011, National Express introduced a Senior Coachcard. Available to over 60s, this allows one third off standard and fully flexible fares. \n*'''Disabled Coachcard''' \u2013 Following the government's scrapping of the concessionary half-price fares for disabled people in October 2011, National Express introduced a Disabled Coachcard. Available to adults registered as disabled, this allows one third off standard and fully flexible fares. \n\n==Fleet==\n[[File:National Express Selwyns Caetano Levante coach FN62 CDE Widnes.jpg|thumb|Selwyn's [[Caetano Levante]] bodied [[Volvo B9R]] in [[Widnes]]]]\n[[File:Bristol Coach Station - Edwards BV66WPN.JPG|thumb|A Caetano Boa Vista at [[Bristol bus station|Bristol]] on a service franchised to Edward's Coaches]]\nNational Express and its franchises operate a number of different vehicle types.\n\nThe primary coach type on the network is the [[Caetano Levante]] (which is used on both 2 and 3 axles). This has been the main vehicle of choice since 2006. The most recent Levante III was introduced onto the network in July 2018.\n\nOther branded vehicles used on the network include (in order of quantity):\n*[[Plaxton Elite]] (2 and 3 axle versions)\n*Caetano Boa Vista (double decker)\n\nHaving withdrawn all its double deck coaches after an [[National Express January 2007 coach crash|accident in January 2007]], in October 2016 National Express placed six Caetano bodied [[Scania K-series|Scania K410s]] into service.<ref>[http://www.route-one.net/articles/Coach%20routes/National_Express_dips_toe_in_double_decker_coach_market National Express dips toe in double-deck coach market] ''Route One'' 26 October 2016</ref>\n\n==On-board services==\nIn the mid-1980s during the ''Rapide'' era, an on-board tea service and on-board televisions were in operation. These were given extensive advertising campaigns as profiled on the [[BBC Three]] documentary ''History of the Coach'', profiling various uses the public makes of such public transport systems.\n\nIn April 2001 National Express phased out its on-board catering service, having already phased out its on-board television service in the 1990s. However, in late 2004 National Express launched ''NXTV'' or ''National Xpress Television''. Rather than showing a whole film as on an aircraft, ''NXTV'' would instead show various episodes of British television series such as ''[[A Touch of Frost]]'', ''[[My Family]]'' and ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', all of which were commissioned by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and the [[BBC]]. The service would be displayed on small monitors situated above the overhead luggage compartments, powered by a motor to move downwards and upwards while the programming would be played from a DVD drive situated at the drivers dashboard.\n\nThe service was quickly phased out in the summer of 2006, due to a lack of interest in purchasing headphones, available at vending machines in the major stations and also via on-board vendors before a journey. The reasons for the service's failure was that the headphone jack was compatible with any headphone, removing any reason to buy those offered. Also, by the time ''NXTV'' was launched, the Apple [[iPod]] was already at its height of popularity, diverting interest away from it. Programming was also very limited, with many of the episodes being frequent repeats from terrestrial television. The headphones were later given away free when the service was finally about to be ceased. The advertising slogan was \"Television shows as you board the coach\".\n\nNational Express Coaches now offers free [[WiFi]] on most coaches. Passengers can connect to a digital entertainment service, VUER, and watch hours of movies and TV for free. \n\n==Accidents==\nSince National Express started operating, there have been few crashes involving its coaches, including:\n* 26 July 1974: Three killed and over 30 injured when a double-decker overturned on the M1 near [[Luton]] after swerving to avoid an earlier collision.\n* 17 August 1983: Three killed on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Swindon]] when a lorry careered into the side of a coach.\n* 3 August 1985: One killed and 40 injured when a double-decker overturned on the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] in [[County Durham]] after swerving to avoid a sheep on the carriageway.{{Citation needed|reason=Feb 2010|date=February 2010}}\n* In 2007, two coaches were involved in separate fatal accidents, in [[National Express January 2007 coach crash|January]] and [[National Express September 2007 coach crash|September]].\n* On 4 September 2009 at [[Gatwick Airport]], a car collided with and ended up underneath a National Express coach. The single occupant of the car was killed instantly. The coach driver was taken to hospital and treated for shock. One coach passenger suffered a minor injury. <ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/8238872.stm |title=Crash Leads to Gatwick Congestion |work=BBC News |date=4 September 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/cardiff-news/2009/09/07/bus-crash-victim-melanie-wisden-s-family-describe-their-heartbreak-91466-24622441/ |title=Bus crash victim Melanie Wisden's family describe their heartbreak |date=7 September 2009 |work=Wales Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8240341.stm |title=Gatwick crash woman's lift favour |work=BBC News |date=6 September 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref>\n* On 17 April 2018 a coach travelling from [[Manchester]] to [[Birmingham]] was involved in a crash on the [[M6 motorway]] near [[Crewe]], two people on-board were injured and taken to hospital.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of bus operators of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Scottish Citylink]]\n*[[Coach transport in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[ALSA (bus company)|ALSA]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline}}\n*{{official website|http://www.nationalexpress.com}}\n\n{{NEXG|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Coach operators in England]]\n[[Category:Coach operators in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Coach operators in Wales]]\n[[Category:Former nationalised industries of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:National Express companies]]\n[[Category:1972 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Airport bus services]]\n\n[[cs:National Express]]\n[[fi:National Express]]\n", "name_user": "Wire723", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor copyedit throughout", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Express_Coaches"}

For most puzzles, solving entails performing a series of moves that alters a scrambled puzzle into a state in which every face of the puzzle is a single, solid color. Some puzzles have different requirements to be considered solved, such as the [[Rubik's Clock|Clock]], for which all the dials must be moved into the 12 'o clock position.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#10h1|title=WCA Regulations|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\nThe standard puzzle sizes are [[Pocket Cube|2x2x2]], [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]], [[Rubik's Revenge|4x4x4]], [[Professor's Cube|5x5x5]], [[V-Cube 6|6x6x6]], and [[V-Cube 7|7x7x7]]. There are also different shapes of the famous puzzles, including [[Pyraminx]], [[Megaminx]], [[Skewb]], and [[Square-1 (puzzle)|Square-1]]. An individual who competes in speedcubing is known as a '''speedcuber'''.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rubik's Cube]] was invented in 1974 by [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] professor of [[architecture]], [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]]. A widespread international interest in the cube began in 1979, which soon developed into a global craze.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/history-rubiks-cube/important-dates-timeline/|title=The history of the Rubik's Cube - Timeline with important dates|website=ruwix.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> On June 5, 1982, the first world championship was held in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. 19 people competed in the event and the American [[Minh Thai]] won with a single solve time of 22.95 seconds. Other notable attendees include [[Jessica Fridrich]] and [[Lars Petrus]], two people who would later be influential in the development of solving methods and the speedcubing community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_World_Rubik%27s_Cube_Championship|title=1982 Rubik's Cube World Championship Wikipedia page|last=|first=|date=11 August 2019|website=Wikipedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=19 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} The height of the Rubik's Cube craze began to fade away after 1983,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/30/business/rubik-s-cube-a-craze-ends.html|title=NYTimes End of the Rubik's Cube Craze|last=|first=|date=30 October 1982|website=New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=19 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref> but with the advent of the [[Internet]], [[Website|sites]] relating to speedcubing began to surface. Simultaneously spreading effective speedsolving methods and teaching people new to the cube to solve it for the first time, these sites brought in a new generation of cubers, created a growing international online community, and raised the profile of the art. \n\nPeople prominent in this online community, such as [[Ron van Bruchem]], [[Tyson Mao]], [[Chris Hardwick (speedcuber)|Chris Hardwick]], and Ton Dennenbroek, eventually wanted to meet in person and compete. So twenty years after the first world championship, they orchestrated a second championship in [[Toronto]] in 2003 and another smaller competition in the [[Netherlands]] later that same year. This revival of competition sparked a new wave of organized speedcubing events, which include regular national and international competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions|title=Competitions|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> There were twelve competitions in 2004, 58 more from 2005 to 2006, over 100 in 2008, and over 1150 in 2018. Since [[Budapest]]'s 1982 competition, there have been nine further World Championships traditionally held every other year, the most recent in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. This new wave of speedcubing competitions have been and still are organised by the [[World Cube Association]] (WCA), founded by [[Ron van Bruchem]] and [[Tyson Mao]].\n\nSince the rise of speedcubing in popularity, numerous businesses have opened up, specialising in either the making or selling of speedcubes. Rubik's is no longer the only company making cubes. There are now dozens of companies making their own cubes, with improved technology to allow faster solving. This has helped to launch speedcubing onto the global scene, not only as a sport and hobby, but a worldwide business.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Solving methods==\nThe standard [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]] can be solved using a number of methods, not all of which are intended for speedcubing. Although some methods (such as CFOP) employ a layer-by-layer system and algorithms, other significant (though less widely used) methods include corners-first methods and the [[Gilles Roux|Roux]] method. [[CFOP method]], Roux, ZZ, and [[Lars Petrus|Petrus]] are often referred to as the \"big four\" methods, as they are the most popular and can be used to achieve faster times than the others. The [[CFOP method]] is used by most speedcubers.\n\n===CFOP method===\n{{main article|CFOP method}}\nThe CFOP (Cross \u2013 F2L \u2013 OLL \u2013 PLL) method, also known as the [[Fridrich method]], was named after one of its inventors, [[Jessica Fridrich]], who finished second in the 2003 Rubik's Cube World Championships. While it is known as the Fridrich method, its origins are actually credited to [[David Singmaster]], who was one of the first to publish a layer by layer method of solving in 1980,<ref>{{Cite web|title = David Singmaster Solution|url = http://van-ness.com/Kurt/Hobbies/RubiksCube/3x3x3/DavidSingmasterSolution.htm|website = Van Ness Web|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> and Guus Razoux Schultz, who built upon this and developed a more efficient system for the first two layers (F2L).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Guus Razoux Schultz|url = https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Guus_Razoux_Schultz|website = Speedsolving.com Wiki|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> Jessica Fridrich then finished developing the method and published it online in 1997,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Speed Cubing|url = http://www.rubiks.com/speed-cubing|website = Rubik's Official Website|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> an event that was very influential in the revival of competitive speedcubing. The first step of the method is to solve a cross-shaped arrangement of edge pieces on the first layer. The remainder of the first layer and all of the second layer are then solved together in what are referred to as \"corner-edge pairs\", or slots. Finally, the last layer is solved in two steps \u2014 first, all of the pieces in the layer are oriented to form a solid color (but without the individual pieces always being in their correct places on the cube). This step is referred to as orientation and is usually performed with a single set of algorithms known as OLL (Orientation of Last Layer). Then, all of those pieces are permuted to their correct spots. This is also usually performed as a single set of algorithms known as PLL (Permutation of Last Layer).\n\nThe [[CFOP method]] can be used as a less-advanced method by dividing the steps into more steps, reducing the number of algorithms you need to learn but sacrifices time. Most people start learning CFOP with 4LLL (Four-Look Last Layer), which is the less advanced, slower, and algorithm-reducing way to learn CFOP. The 4 steps are divided into Edge Orientation, Corner Orientation, Corner Permutation, and Edge Permutation. Later on, you can learn Full PLL which replaces the permutation of the edges and corners, making the solve more efficient and therefore faster. Even later, you can learn Full OLL which will replace the Orientation of the corners and edges, again making the solve faster.\n\nThe CFOP method is a widely used speedcubing method. Its popularity stems from the speed at which it can be easily performed. Many advanced speedcubers such as two-time Former World Champion [[Feliks Zemdegs]] have also learned additional sets of algorithms for the last slot and layer, such as Corners of Last Layer (COLL), which orients and permutes the corners when the edges are oriented.\n\n===Roux method===\nThe Roux method was invented by [[French people|French]] speedcuber [[Gilles Roux]]. The first step of the Roux method is to form a 3\u00d72\u00d71 block usually placed in the lower portion of the left layer. The second step is to create another 3\u00d72\u00d71 on the opposite side, such that each block is sharing a bottom color. The remaining four corners are then solved using a set of algorithms known as CMLL (Corners of the Last Layer, without regard to the M-slice), which leaves six edges and four centers that are solved in the last step, L6E or LSE (Last Six Edges).\n\nThis method is not as dependent on algorithm memorization as the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]] since all but the third step is done with intuition as opposed to predefined sets of algorithms. The Roux method can be performed without rotations (unlike the CFOP method) which means it is easier to look ahead (solving a collection of pieces while at the same time looking for the solution to the next step) while solving. It is also considered one of the most efficient speedsolving methods with its average move count being in between 45 and 50 moves for experienced solvers. However, the Roux method of speedcubing has been criticized over the years because, unlike CFOP, ZZ or Petrus, Roux requires M (middle) slices to solve the LSE. Using M slice moves makes it harder to achieve higher TPS (turns per second) because the fingertricks are almost always flicks which makes it a lot harder to turn faster (although higher TPS can be achieved through practice).\n\nOne of the users of this method, [[Kian Mansour]], broke the one-handed (OH) world-record average with the time of 9.54 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCfLsh5vDt0&t=56s |title= The video of Kian Monsour breaking the 3x3 OH world Record |publisher= Kian Monsour |accessdate= 27 May 2018}}</ref>\nSean Patrick Villanueva is the first Roux user to achieve a Sub-6 average of five in competition. He also podiumed in 3x3 at Worlds 2019 (2nd Place).\n\n===ZZ method===\nThe ZZ method (short for \"Zbigniew Zborowski\") is a modern speedcubing method originally proposed by Zbigniew Zborowski in 2006. The method was designed specifically to achieve high turning speed by focusing on move ergonomics, and is the combination of a block-building method and a layer-by-layer method. The initial pre-planned step is called EOLine, and is the most distinctive hallmark of the ZZ method. It involves orienting all edges while placing two oppositely placed down-face edges aligned with the correspondingly colored center. The next step solves the remaining first two layers using only left, right, top and bottom face turns, one of the advantages of ZZ. On completion of the first two layers, the last layer's edges are all correctly oriented because of edge pre-orientation during EOLine. The last layer may be completed using a number of techniques including those used in the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. An expert variant of this method (ZZ-a) allows the last layer to be completed in a single step with an average of just over 12 moves and knowledge of at least 494 algorithms.<ref name=\"Bernard Helmstetter's Move Count Statistics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/|title=Rubik's Cube: Algorithms for the last layer|publisher=Universit\u00e9 Paris 8|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Petrus method===\nThe Petrus method, named after its inventor [[Lars Petrus]], is considered to be more intuitive than the structured [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. The first step of the Petrus method is to solve a 2\u00d72\u00d72 block of the cube. This block is then extended to a solved 2\u00d72\u00d73 block. All edges that are unoriented are then oriented, and then the first and second layers are completed using only turns of the right layer and the upper layer. Next, the top corners are put in the right place and the layer is oriented correctly (all stickers facing up) and finally the last edges are permuted (moved around). [[Lars Petrus]] developed this method to address what he felt were inherent inefficiencies in layer-by-layer approaches.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://lar5.com/cube/|title=Solving Rubik's Cube for speed|last=Petrus|first=Lars|accessdate=13 Jan 2017}}</ref> This method is often used as the basis of a method for fewest moves competitions.\n\n===Corners-first methods===\nCorners-first methods involve solving the corners then finishing the edges with slice turns. Corners-first solutions were common in the 1980s, and was one of the most popular methods that 1982 world champion [[Minh Thai]] used. Currently corners-first solutions are rarely used among speedsolvers. [[Dutch people|Dutch]] cuber Marc Waterman created a corners-first method in the cube craze, and averaged 18 seconds in the mid-late 1980s.\n\n==Competitions==\n[[File:Estonian Open 2009 - Anssi Vanhala.JPG|thumb|Anssi Vanhala solving a 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube with his feet in 36.72 seconds, at the 2009 Estonian Open.]]\n\n===World Cube Association===\nSince 2003, speedcubing competitions have been held regularly. The [[World Cube Association]] (WCA) was formed in 2004 to govern all official competitions. For a competition to be official, it must be approved by the WCA and follow the WCA regulations. Included in the regulations is the necessity of having one or more [[World Cube Association#WCA Delegates|WCA delegate]] in attendance. A delegate's main role is to ensure all regulations are followed during the competition. Once the competition has finished, the results are uploaded on to the WCA [[website]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Format===\nThe majority of puzzle competitions are held using a [[Truncated mean|trimmed mean]] of 5 format. This involves the competitor executing 5 solves in the round in question, after which the fastest and slowest solve are disregarded and the [[mean]] of the remaining 3 is used. The 6\u00d76\u00d76 and 7\u00d77\u00d77 events are ranked by straight mean of 3\u200a\u2014\u200aonly three solves, none of which are disregarded. In 3\u00d73\u00d73 blindfolded and 3\u00d73\u00d73 fewest moves challenges, either straight mean of 3 or best of 3 is used, while 4\u00d74\u00d74 blindfolded, 5\u00d75\u00d75 blindfolded, and multiple blindfolded challenges are ranked using best of 1, 2 or 3, depending on the competition.\n\nWhen a round begins, competitors hand in the puzzle they will use. Puzzles are scrambled using a computer-generated scramble. Each round, five, three or one (depending on the format, mentioned above) scrambles are used. Every competitor in the round will receive each scramble once. Before starting a solve, a competitor has up to 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle (inspection is removed for blindfolded events). This is monitored by a judge with a stopwatch. Once the solve is complete, the judge records the time on the competitor's scorecard and it is signed by both. If the puzzle is unsolved and the timer is stopped, the time is recorded as \"DNF\" (Did Not Finish). There are also numerous reasons why the solve can receive a two-second addition to the solve time, such as a face being more than 45 degrees off, or the competitor going over the allowed inspection time. A competitor can also receive an extra solve to replace the one just completed, for example having a timer malfunction or being deliberately distracted by another person.\n\nThe official timer used in competitions is the [[StackMat timer]].

For a more complete list of speedcubing terminology, see the [http://www.cubefreak.net/other/glossary.php cubefreak.net glossary].\n\n;{{visible anchor|1LLL}} : A set of 3915 algorithms to solve every possible state that the last layer could be in after completing F2L.  The average move count is 12.58.\n;[[Algorithm]] : A predefined sequence of moves used to effect a specific change on the cube. Often referred to as ''alg'' or (less commonly) an ''algo''.\n;BLD : Blindfolded solving, i.e. memorize, put on blindfold, then solve.\n;Center piece : One of the centers of the faces of the cube. The centers never move relative to each other on an NxNxN cube, where N is odd. On NxNxN cubes where N>3, every piece with only one sticker is referred to as a 'center piece', including those pieces that can move relative to each other.\n;CLL : Corners of the Last Layer. This is the first of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube. In the process, edges may be unoriented. This is used in Corners First methods for the last layer, in which first all corners are solved, followed by the edges (see ELL). CLL is also commonly used to solve the last layer of a 2x2x2 cube in one step.\n;[[Commutator]] : A commutator is a sequence of the form X Y X' Y' (also represented as [X:Y] or [X,Y]) which affects only specific portions of the cube, leaving the rest untouched. This is used in Blindfolded solving and Fewest Moves Competition.\n;Corner piece : One of the 8 pieces with exactly three stickers, called a \"corner\" piece because a corner is exposed.\n;CR : Short for Continental Record (e.g. Record for a continent). Can also be \"Continental Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;Cuber : Someone who solves a Rubik's cube, any of its other sizes, and/or other shaped puzzles.\n;{{visible anchor|Cubie}} : One of the mechanically independent pieces that make up a puzzle. The cubies do not include fixed center pieces, the central axis to which they are attached, or any other internal pieces (Such as the internal edges of a 4x4 or 2x2).\n;Cycle : To rotate pieces' positions on the cube. e.g. a 3-cycle would make cubie set A-B-C become C-A-B.\n;{{visible anchor|DNF}} : Initialism for Did Not Finish, used in competitions and self-timing. e.g. when a piece pop occurs and the competitor decides not to continue solving the puzzle, or when the solver stops the timer and the puzzle is 2 or more turns away from being solved.\n;{{visible anchor|DNS}} : Did Not Start, used in competition when the competitor does not begin a solve, either by opting to skip it (common in Blindfold Cubing), by not showing up when he or she is called, or not qualifying for the remaining (usually three) solves of a certain round.\n;Edge piece : One of the 12 pieces with exactly two stickers, called an \"edge\" piece because only one edge is exposed.\n;{{visible anchor|ELL}} : Edges of the Last Layer. The second of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube, solving the edge pieces without disturbing the corner pieces (see CLL).\n;{{visible anchor|EPLL}} : Edge Permutation of the Last Layer, specifically refers to the PLL cases in which only edges must be permuted to solve the cube.\n;Explode : When, during a solve, multiple cubies come out of contact with the puzzle, usually causing the puzzle to be unstable, in which, upon turning, more pieces may become loose and possibly pop out too.\n;{{visible anchor|F2B}} : First two blocks. This is used in the Roux method.\n;F2L : First two layers. This is used in the CFOP (Fridrich), Petrus, and ZZ methods.\n;Layer : One section of a cube consisting of a number of cubies that turn as a unit. (e.g. A standard [[Rubik's Cube]] has 3 ''layers''.)\n;LL : Last Layer. Usually refers to the top layer of the cube, but for the Roux method can refer to the middle layer between the left and right faces.\n;Method : A combination of steps that can be used to solve a cube.\n;Move : A turn of one of the sides of a puzzle or knobs in the case of the clock.\n;''N''-look, also known as ''X''-Look: Refers to the maximum number of iterations of algorithms necessary to complete a step in a particular solving method, often the last layer, e.g. '4-look LL'.\n;NR : Short for National Record (e.g. a record for a country). Can also be \"National Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;OH : Short for One-Handed, it is the event or practice of solving a cube with one hand, left or right.\n;OLL : Orientation of the Last Layer, usually used in reference to the respective step of the CFOP and ZZ methods.\n;{{visible anchor|OLLCP}} : Orientation of the Last Layer with Corner Permutation.  An advanced technique where multiple algorithms are learned for one OLL case, in order to use one that will solve the case while also permuting the corners, which results in an easy PLL case.\n;Orient : To change the orientation of a piece.\n;PB :Personal Best \u2013 personal record time to solve a puzzle. This can either be a single attempt or a [[Truncated mean|trimmed average]], depending on context.\n;'''PR''' :Personal Record \u2013 the personal record time to solve a puzzle achieved in competition.\n;[[Permutation|Permute]] : To relocate certain pieces in a way to achieve the desired result.\n;PLL : Permutation of the Last Layer. Usually used in reference to the respective step of the [[CFOP method|CFOP]] and ZZ methods, in which case it would follow the OLL step.\n;Pop : When, during a solve, one or more cubies come out of contact with the puzzle, usually causing the puzzle to be unstable, in which, upon turning, more pieces may become loose and possibly pop out too.\n;Prime : A counter-clockwise move popularly denoted with a ', e.g. 'R-Prime', denoted as R', R-, <math>R^{-1}</math>, or Ri. Also (less commonly) known as \"inverse\" or \"inverted\".\n;Slice : The four center pieces and four edge pieces between two opposite layers of the cube.  On a cube with four or more layers, it refers to any of the layers of the puzzle that don't have corner pieces. Also refers '/' moves in Square-1 puzzles.\n;Stickerless : A puzzle that uses colored plastic instead of stickers to indicate color. Most stickerless puzzles were forbidden in competitions prior to a 2015 update of WCA regulations. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/thewca/wca-regulations/compare/official-2014-04-03...official-2015-07-01?short_path=7487711|title=Comparing official-2014-04-03...official-2015-07-01 \u00b7 thewca/wca-regulations|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n;{{visible anchor|Summer Variation}} : A subset of algorithms for F2L that allows the user to force all upper-face corners to be oriented correctly, or an OLL-Skip, while the last F2L pair can be solved with R U R' or L' U' L.\n;SQ-1 : Abbreviation for Square-1. Sometimes used as 'Squan'.\n;{{visible anchor|TPS}} : Turns per second \u2013 the number count of turns per second indicating how fast the cuber turns.\n;Two-Second Penalty, also known as +2 : A penalty of 2 seconds which is added to a solving time in official competitions when the cube is placed back on the timing pad with one or more faces misaligned 45 degrees or more. It can also be given in other cases, such as when the competitor starts the timer too slow or does not correctly stop the timer after finishing the solve.\n;UWR :Unofficial World Record.\n\n;{{visible anchor|VLS}} : Valk Last Slot. A set of 432 algorithms (216 if mirrors are not counted), that solves together the last F2L pair and all of OLL when this last F2L pair is already joined.\n;'''WCA''' : [[World Cube Association]], the international governing body for official cube competitions.\n;{{visible anchor|Winter Variation}}, also known as WV :A subset of algorithms for VLS that allows the user to force all upper-face corners to be oriented correctly, or an OLL-Skip, while the last F2L pair is already formed. It is used when the last F2L pair (One corner and its corresponding edge correctly positioned relative to each other) to be inserted is in the top layer, with the 3 top-layer edges oriented correctly.

For most puzzles, solving entails performing a series of moves that alters a scrambled puzzle into a state in which every face of the puzzle is a single, solid color. Some puzzles have different requirements to be considered solved, such as the [[Rubik's Clock|Clock]], for which all the dials must be moved into the 12 'o clock position.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#10h1|title=WCA Regulations|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\nThe standard puzzle sizes are [[Pocket Cube|2x2x2]], [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]], [[Rubik's Revenge|4x4x4]], [[Professor's Cube|5x5x5]], [[V-Cube 6|6x6x6]], and [[V-Cube 7|7x7x7]]. There are also different shapes of the famous puzzles, including [[Pyraminx]], [[Megaminx]], [[Skewb]], and [[Square-1 (puzzle)|Square-1]]. An individual who competes in speedcubing is known as a '''speedcuber'''.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rubik's Cube]] was invented in 1974 by [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] professor of [[architecture]], [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]]. A widespread international interest in the cube began in 1979, which soon developed into a global craze.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/history-rubiks-cube/important-dates-timeline/|title=The history of the Rubik's Cube - Timeline with important dates|website=ruwix.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> On June 5, 1982, the first world championship was held in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. 19 people competed in the event and the American [[Minh Thai]] won with a single solve time of 22.95 seconds. Other notable attendees include [[Jessica Fridrich]] and [[Lars Petrus]], two people who would later be influential in the development of solving methods and the speedcubing community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_World_Rubik%27s_Cube_Championship|title=1982 Rubik's Cube World Championship Wikipedia page|last=|first=|date=11 August 2019|website=Wikipedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=19 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} The height of the Rubik's Cube craze began to fade away after 1983,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/10/30/business/rubik-s-cube-a-craze-ends.html|title=NYTimes End of the Rubik's Cube Craze|last=|first=|date=30 October 1982|website=New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=19 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref> but with the advent of the [[Internet]], [[Website|sites]] relating to speedcubing began to surface. Simultaneously spreading effective speedsolving methods and teaching people new to the cube to solve it for the first time, these sites brought in a new generation of cubers, created a growing international online community, and raised the profile of the art. \n\nPeople prominent in this online community, such as [[Ron van Bruchem]], [[Tyson Mao]], [[Chris Hardwick (speedcuber)|Chris Hardwick]], and Ton Dennenbroek, eventually wanted to meet in person and compete. So twenty years after the first world championship, they orchestrated a second championship in [[Toronto]] in 2003 and another smaller competition in the [[Netherlands]] later that same year. This revival of competition sparked a new wave of organized speedcubing events, which include regular national and international competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions|title=Competitions|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> There were twelve competitions in 2004, 58 more from 2005 to 2006, over 100 in 2008, and over 1150 in 2018. Since [[Budapest]]'s 1982 competition, there have been nine further World Championships traditionally held every other year, the most recent in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. This new wave of speedcubing competitions have been and still are organised by the [[World Cube Association]] (WCA), founded by [[Ron van Bruchem]] and [[Tyson Mao]].\n\nSince the rise of speedcubing in popularity, numerous businesses have opened up, specialising in either the making or selling of speedcubes. Rubik's is no longer the only company making cubes. There are now dozens of companies making their own cubes, with improved technology to allow faster solving. This has helped to launch speedcubing onto the global scene, not only as a sport and hobby, but a worldwide business.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Solving methods==\nThe standard [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]] can be solved using a number of methods, not all of which are intended for speedcubing. Although some methods (such as CFOP) employ a layer-by-layer system and algorithms, other significant (though less widely used) methods include corners-first methods and the [[Gilles Roux|Roux]] method. [[CFOP method]], Roux, ZZ, and [[Lars Petrus|Petrus]] are often referred to as the \"big four\" methods, as they are the most popular and can be used to achieve faster times than the others. The [[CFOP method]] is used by most speedcubers.\n\n===CFOP method===\n{{main article|CFOP method}}\nThe CFOP (Cross \u2013 F2L \u2013 OLL \u2013 PLL) method, also known as the [[Fridrich Method]], was named after one of its inventors, [[Jessica Fridrich]], who finished second in the 2003 Rubik's Cube World Championships. While it is known as the Fridrich method, its origins are actually credited to [[David Singmaster]], who was one of the first to publish a layer by layer method of solving in 1980,<ref>{{Cite web|title = David Singmaster Solution|url = http://van-ness.com/Kurt/Hobbies/RubiksCube/3x3x3/DavidSingmasterSolution.htm|website = Van Ness Web|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> and Guus Razoux Schultz, who built upon this and developed a more efficient system for the first two layers (F2L).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Guus Razoux Schultz|url = https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Guus_Razoux_Schultz|website = Speedsolving.com Wiki|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> Jessica Fridrich then finished developing the method and published it online in 1997,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Speed Cubing|url = http://www.rubiks.com/speed-cubing|website = Rubik's Official Website|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> an event that was very influential in the revival of competitive speedcubing. The first step of the method is to solve a cross-shaped arrangement of edge pieces on the first layer. The remainder of the first layer and all of the second layer are then solved together in what are referred to as \"corner-edge pairs\", or slots. Finally, the last layer is solved in two steps \u2014 first, all of the pieces in the layer are oriented to form a solid color (but without the individual pieces always being in their correct places on the cube). This step is referred to as orientation and is usually performed with a single set of algorithms known as OLL (Orientation of Last Layer). Then, all of those pieces are permuted to their correct spots. This is also usually performed as a single set of algorithms known as PLL (Permutation of Last Layer).\n\nThe [[CFOP method]] can be used as a less-advanced method by dividing the steps into more steps, reducing the number of algorithms you need to learn but sacrifices time. Most people start learning CFOP with 4LLL (Four-Look Last Layer), which is the less advanced, slower, and algorithm-reducing way to learn CFOP. The 4 steps are divided into Edge Orientation, Corner Orientation, Corner Permutation, and Edge Permutation. Later on, you can learn Full PLL which replaces the permutation of the edges and corners, making the solve more efficient and therefore faster. Even later, you can learn Full OLL which will replace the Orientation of the corners and edges, again making the solve faster.\n\nThe CFOP method is a widely used speedcubing method. Its popularity stems from the speed at which it can be easily performed. Many advanced speedcubers such as two-time Former World Champion [[Feliks Zemdegs]] have also learned additional sets of algorithms for the last slot and layer, such as Corners of Last Layer (COLL), which orients and permutes the corners when the edges are oriented.\n\n===Roux method===\nThe Roux method was invented by [[French people|French]] speedcuber [[Gilles Roux]]. The first step of the Roux method is to form a 3\u00d72\u00d71 block usually placed in the lower portion of the left layer. The second step is to create another 3\u00d72\u00d71 on the opposite side, such that each block is sharing a bottom color. The remaining four corners are then solved using a set of algorithms known as CMLL (Corners of the Last Layer, without regard to the M-slice), which leaves six edges and four centers that are solved in the last step, L6E or LSE (Last Six Edges).\n\nThis method is not as dependent on algorithm memorization as the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]] since all but the third step is done with intuition as opposed to predefined sets of algorithms. The Roux method can be performed without rotations (unlike the CFOP method) which means it is easier to look ahead (solving a collection of pieces while at the same time looking for the solution to the next step) while solving. It is also considered one of the most efficient speedsolving methods with its average move count being in between 45 and 50 moves for experienced solvers. However, the Roux method of speedcubing has been criticized over the years because, unlike CFOP, ZZ or Petrus, Roux requires M (middle) slices to solve the LSE. Using M slice moves makes it harder to achieve higher TPS (turns per second) because the fingertricks are almost always flicks which makes it a lot harder to turn faster (although higher TPS can be achieved through practice).\n\nOne of the users of this method, [[Kian Mansour]], broke the one-handed (OH) world-record average with the time of 9.54 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCfLsh5vDt0&t=56s |title= The video of Kian Monsour breaking the 3x3 OH world Record |publisher= Kian Monsour |accessdate= 27 May 2018}}</ref>\nSean Patrick Villanueva is the first Roux user to achieve a Sub-6 average of five in competition. He also podiumed in 3x3 at Worlds 2019 (2nd Place).\n\n===ZZ method===\nThe ZZ method (short for \"Zbigniew Zborowski\") is a modern speedcubing method originally proposed by Zbigniew Zborowski in 2006. The method was designed specifically to achieve high turning speed by focusing on move ergonomics, and is the combination of a block-building method and a layer-by-layer method. The initial pre-planned step is called EOLine, and is the most distinctive hallmark of the ZZ method. It involves orienting all edges while placing two oppositely placed down-face edges aligned with the correspondingly colored center. The next step solves the remaining first two layers using only left, right, top and bottom face turns, one of the advantages of ZZ. On completion of the first two layers, the last layer's edges are all correctly oriented because of edge pre-orientation during EOLine. The last layer may be completed using a number of techniques including those used in the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. An expert variant of this method (ZZ-a) allows the last layer to be completed in a single step with an average of just over 12 moves and knowledge of at least 494 algorithms.<ref name=\"Bernard Helmstetter's Move Count Statistics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/|title=Rubik's Cube: Algorithms for the last layer|publisher=Universit\u00e9 Paris 8|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Petrus method===\nThe Petrus method, named after its inventor [[Lars Petrus]], is considered to be more intuitive than the structured [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. The first step of the Petrus method is to solve a 2\u00d72\u00d72 block of the cube. This block is then extended to a solved 2\u00d72\u00d73 block. All edges that are unoriented are then oriented, and then the first and second layers are completed using only turns of the right layer and the upper layer. Next, the top corners are put in the right place and the layer is oriented correctly (all stickers facing up) and finally the last edges are permuted (moved around). [[Lars Petrus]] developed this method to address what he felt were inherent inefficiencies in layer-by-layer approaches.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://lar5.com/cube/|title=Solving Rubik's Cube for speed|last=Petrus|first=Lars|accessdate=13 Jan 2017}}</ref> This method is often used as the basis of a method for fewest moves competitions.\n\n===Corners-first methods===\nCorners-first methods involve solving the corners then finishing the edges with slice turns. Corners-first solutions were common in the 1980s, and was one of the most popular methods that 1982 world champion [[Minh Thai]] used. Currently corners-first solutions are rarely used among speedsolvers. [[Dutch people|Dutch]] cuber Marc Waterman created a corners-first method in the cube craze, and averaged 18 seconds in the mid-late 1980s.\n\n==Competitions==\n[[File:Estonian Open 2009 - Anssi Vanhala.JPG|thumb|Anssi Vanhala solving a 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube with his feet in 36.72 seconds, at the 2009 Estonian Open.]]\n\n===World Cube Association===\nSince 2003, speedcubing competitions have been held regularly. The [[World Cube Association]] (WCA) was formed in 2004 to govern all official competitions. For a competition to be official, it must be approved by the WCA and follow the WCA regulations. Included in the regulations is the necessity of having one or more [[World Cube Association#WCA Delegates|WCA delegate]] in attendance. A delegate's main role is to ensure all regulations are followed during the competition. Once the competition has finished, the results are uploaded on to the WCA [[website]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Format===\nThe majority of puzzle competitions are held using a [[Truncated mean|trimmed mean]] of 5 format. This involves the competitor executing 5 solves in the round in question, after which the fastest and slowest solve are disregarded and the [[mean]] of the remaining 3 is used. The 6\u00d76\u00d76 and 7\u00d77\u00d77 events are ranked by straight mean of 3\u200a\u2014\u200aonly three solves, none of which are disregarded. In 3\u00d73\u00d73 blindfolded and 3\u00d73\u00d73 fewest moves challenges, either straight mean of 3 or best of 3 is used, while 4\u00d74\u00d74 blindfolded, 5\u00d75\u00d75 blindfolded, and multiple blindfolded challenges are ranked using best of 1, 2 or 3, depending on the competition.\n\nWhen a round begins, competitors hand in the puzzle they will use. Puzzles are scrambled using a computer-generated scramble. Each round, five, three or one (depending on the format, mentioned above) scrambles are used. Every competitor in the round will receive each scramble once. Before starting a solve, a competitor has up to 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle (inspection is removed for blindfolded events). This is monitored by a judge with a stopwatch. Once the solve is complete, the judge records the time on the competitor's scorecard and it is signed by both. If the puzzle is unsolved and the timer is stopped, the time is recorded as \"DNF\" (Did Not Finish). There are also numerous reasons why the solve can receive a two-second addition to the solve time, such as a face being more than 45 degrees off, or the competitor going over the allowed inspection time. A competitor can also receive an extra solve to replace the one just completed, for example having a timer malfunction or being deliberately distracted by another person.\n\nThe official timer used in competitions is the [[StackMat timer]]. This device has touch-sensitive pads that are triggered by the user lifting one or both of their hands to start the time and placing both their hands back on the pads after releasing the puzzle to stop the timer.\n\nOfficial competitions are currently being held in several categories.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

For a more complete list of speedcubing terminology, see the [http://www.cubefreak.net/other/glossary.php cubefreak.net glossary].\n\n;{{visible anchor|1LLL}} : A set of 3915 algorithms to solve every possible state that the last layer could be in after completing F2L.  The average move count is 12.58.\n;[[Algorithm]] : A predefined sequence of moves used to effect a specific change on the cube. Often referred to as ''alg'' or (less commonly) an ''algo''.\n;BLD : Blindfolded solving, i.e. memorize, put on blindfold, then solve.\n;Center piece : One of the centers of the faces of the cube. The centers never move relative to each other on an NxNxN cube, where N is odd. On NxNxN cubes where N>3, every piece with only one sticker is referred to as a 'center piece', including those pieces that can move relative to each other.\n;CLL : Corners of the Last Layer. This is the first of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube. In the process, edges may be unoriented. This is used in Corners First methods for the last layer, in which first all corners are solved, followed by the edges (see ELL). CLL is also commonly used to solve the last layer of a 2x2x2 cube in one step.\n;[[Commutator]] : A commutator is a sequence of the form X Y X' Y' (also represented as [X:Y] or [X,Y]) which affects only specific portions of the cube, leaving the rest untouched. This is used in Blindfolded solving and Fewest Moves Competition.\n;Corner piece : One of the 8 pieces with exactly three stickers, called a \"corner\" piece because a corner is exposed.\n;CR : Short for Continental Record (e.g. Record for a continent). Can also be \"Continental Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;Cuber : Someone who solves a Rubik's cube, any of its other sizes, and/or other shaped puzzles.\n;{{visible anchor|Cubie}} : One of the mechanically independent pieces that make up a puzzle. The cubies do not include fixed center pieces, the central axis to which they are attached, or any other internal pieces (Such as the internal edges of a 4x4 or 2x2).\n;Cycle : To rotate pieces' positions on the cube. e.g. a 3-cycle would make cubie set A-B-C become C-A-B.\n;{{visible anchor|DNF}} : Initialism for Did Not Finish, used in competitions and self-timing. e.g. when a piece pop occurs and the competitor decides not to continue solving the puzzle, or when the solver stops the timer and the puzzle is 2 or more turns away from being solved.\n;{{visible anchor|DNS}} : Did Not Start, used in competition when the competitor does not begin a solve, either by opting to skip it (common in Blindfold Cubing), by not showing up when he or she is called, or not qualifying for the remaining (usually three) solves of a certain round.\n;Edge piece : One of the 12 pieces with exactly two stickers, called an \"edge\" piece because only one edge is exposed.\n;{{visible anchor|ELL}} : Edges of the Last Layer. The second of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube, solving the edge pieces without disturbing the corner pieces (see CLL).\n;{{visible anchor|EPLL}} : Edge Permutation of the Last Layer, specifically refers to the PLL cases in which only edges must be permuted to solve the cube.\n;Explode : When, during a solve, multiple cubies come out of contact with the puzzle, usually causing the puzzle to be unstable, in which, upon turning, more pieces may become loose and possibly pop out too.\n;{{visible anchor|F2B}} : First two blocks. This is used in the Roux method.\n;F2L : First two layers. This is used in the CFOP (Fridrich), Petrus, and ZZ methods.\n;Layer : One section of a cube consisting of a number of cubies that turn as a unit. (e.g. A standard [[Rubik's Cube]] has 3 ''layers''.)\n;LL : Last Layer. Usually refers to the top layer of the cube, but for the Roux method can refer to the middle layer between the left and right faces.\n;Method : A combination of steps that can be used to solve a cube.\n;Move : A turn of one of the sides of a puzzle or knobs in the case of the clock.\n;''N''-look, also known as ''X''-Look: Refers to the maximum number of iterations of algorithms necessary to complete a step in a particular solving method, often the last layer, e.g. '4-look LL'.\n;NR : Short for National Record (e.g. a record for a country). Can also be \"National Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;OH : Short for One-Handed, it is the event or practice of solving a cube with one hand, left or right.\n;OLL : Orientation of the Last Layer, usually used in reference to the respective step of the CFOP and ZZ methods.\n;{{visible anchor|OLLCP}} : Orientation of the Last Layer with Corner Permutation.  An advanced technique where multiple algorithms are learned for one OLL case, in order to use one that will solve the case while also permuting the corners, which results in an easy PLL case.\n;Orient : To change the orientation of a piece.\n;PB :Personal Best \u2013 personal record time to solve a puzzle. This can either be a single attempt or a [[Truncated mean|trimmed average]], depending on context.\n;'''PR''' :Personal Record \u2013 the personal record time to solve a puzzle achieved in competition.\n;[[Permutation|Permute]] : To relocate certain pieces in a way to achieve the desired result.\n;PLL : Permutation of the Last Layer. Usually used in reference to the respective step of the [[CFOP method|CFOP]] and ZZ methods, in which case it would follow the OLL step.\n;Pop : When, during a solve, one or more cubies come out of contact with the puzzle, usually causing the puzzle to be unstable, in which, upon turning, more pieces may become loose and possibly pop out too.\n;Prime : A counter-clockwise move popularly denoted with a ', e.g. 'R-Prime', denoted as R', R-, <math>R^{-1}</math>, or Ri. Also (less commonly) known as \"inverse\" or \"inverted\".\n;Slice : The four center pieces and four edge pieces between two opposite layers of the cube.  On a cube with four or more layers, it refers to any of the layers of the puzzle that don't have corner pieces. Also refers '/' moves in Square-1 puzzles.\n;Stickerless : A puzzle that uses colored plastic instead of stickers to indicate color. Most stickerless puzzles were forbidden in competitions prior to a 2015 update of WCA regulations. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/thewca/wca-regulations/compare/official-2014-04-03...official-2015-07-01?short_path=7487711|title=Comparing official-2014-04-03...official-2015-07-01 \u00b7 thewca/wca-regulations|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n;{{visible anchor|Summer Variation}} : A subset of algorithms for F2L that allows the user to force all upper-face corners to be oriented correctly, or an OLL-Skip, while the last F2L pair can be solved with R U R' or L' U' L.\n;SQ-1 : Abbreviation for Square-1. Sometimes used as 'Squan'.\n;{{visible anchor|TPS}} : Turns per second \u2013 the number count of turns per second indicating how fast the cuber turns.\n;Two-Second Penalty, also known as +2 : A penalty of 2 seconds which is added to a solving time in official competitions when the cube is placed back on the timing pad with one or more faces misaligned 45 degrees or more. It can also be given in other cases, such as when the competitor starts the timer too slow or does not correctly stop the timer after finishing the solve.\n;UWR :Unofficial World Record.\n\n;{{visible anchor|VLS}} : Valk Last Slot. A set of 432 algorithms (216 if mirrors are not counted), that solves together the last F2L pair and all of OLL when this last F2L pair is already joined.\n;'''WCA''' : [[World Cube Association]], the international governing body for official cube competitions.\n;{{visible anchor|Winter Variation}}, also known as WV :A subset of algorithms for VLS that allows the user to force all upper-face corners to be oriented correctly, or an OLL-Skip, while the last F2L pair is already formed. It is used when the last F2L pair (One corner and its corresponding edge correctly positioned relative to each other) to be inserted is in the top layer, with the 3 top-layer edges oriented correctly. There are a total of 27 cases. WV has an average lower move count than the standard OLL.\n;WR :World Record.\n;{{visible anchor|X-Cross}} : Completing one or multiple F2L pairs during the cross setup, used almost exclusively in the CFOP method.\n;YTUWR : YouTube Unofficial World Record, the fastest of something that is posted on YouTube.\n;{{visible anchor|ZBLL}} :ZBLL is a set of 177 algorithms (Not including mirrors and inverses) with 494 cases to recognize in order to solve the last layer in one look while all of the top edges are oriented with an average move count of ~12.08. Can be used in any layer-by-layer method that ends in N-Look LL, but will only really be efficient in ZZ and Petrus, as these methods keep edges oriented, whereas methods such as CFOP do not keep the edges oriented, becoming a sometimes 2LLL solve.\n\n==See also==\n*[[World Cube Association]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.speedsolving.com/ Speedsolving.com]\n*[http://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page Speedsolving.com Wiki]\n*[http://ws2.binghamton.edu/fridrich/system.html Fridrich Method]\n*[http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html Roux Method]\n*[http://cube.crider.co.uk/ ZZ Method]\n*[https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/ World Cube Association]\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCFOP method", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing"}

In 1997, [[Hapag-Lloyd]] purchased Hanseatic Tours, and she passed into their fleet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.simplonpc.co.uk/HamburgAtlantik.html |title=Hanseatic Tours |last=Boyle |first=Ian |work=Shimplon Postcards |accessdate=28 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Drydock fire===\nOn 13 June 2013, the ship was in [[drydock]] at the Bredo Shipyard in [[Bremerhaven]], Germany when a fire broke out in the shipyard. This caused a delay in drydock and additional repairs were required and so the 17 June and 4 July sailings were cancelled.\n\n===Insolvency===\n''RCGS Resolute'' was scheduled to conduct a cruise to the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, and Antarctica from 19 October 2019, through 6 November 2019, beginning and ending in Ushuaia.  A medical emergency occurred on the ship while it was en route to Ushuaia, which delayed the ship, so the passengers were flown to Buenos Aires to meet the ship.  The ship sailed from Buenos Aires on 19 October.  On 22 October, the ship entered the port at Puerto Madryn to refuel.  After sitting in port for two days, it was revealed that the fuel could not be obtained because of non-payment by the ship operator, One Ocean Expeditions.  The Antarctic expedition was cancelled and the ship sailed back to Buenos Aires with all its passengers.  Once in Buenos Aires, the passengers disembarked and were left on their own with no reimbursement or compensation.  The ship was subsequently arrested in Buenos Aires for non-payment of debts. <ref>https://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Rcgs-Resolute-9000168.html</ref> At last report, the ship was still under arrest in Buenos Aires, having missed the entire 2019-2020 Antarctic season. <ref>https://www.oneoceanexpeditions.com/dates-and-rates</ref>\n\n=== Collision with Venezuelan patrol boat ''Naiguat\u00e1'' ===\nIn the early hours of 30 March 2020 ''RCGS Resolute'' was drifting just over {{convert|13|nmi}} off the coast of Isla La Tortuga, a Venezuelan island situated some 60 miles off the country's northern coast, when the Venezuelan Coast Guard patrol boat  {{ship|Venezuelan patrol boat|Naiguat\u00e1||2}}, also known by its hull number GC-23, approached it. The Venezuelan ship ordered the cruise ship to follow it to Puerto Moreno on Isla De Margarita, located to the east, accusing it of violating the country's territorial waters. Gun shots were fired and, shortly thereafter, the navy vessel approached the starboard side at speed with an angle of 135\u00b0 and purposely collided with ''RCGS Resolute''. The navy vessel continued to ram the starboard bow in an apparent attempt to turn the ship's head towards Venezuelan territorial waters. While ''RCGS Resolute'' sustained minor damages, not affecting vessel's seaworthiness, the navy vessel suffered severe damages while making contact with the [[ice class|ice-strengthened]] [[bulbous bow]] of the expedition cruise vessel ''RCGS Resolute'' and started to take water.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.columbia-cs.com/statement-on-rcgs-resolute-incident/ |title=Statement on RCGS RESOLUTE incident |work=Columbia Cruise Services}}</ref>{{Better source|date=April 2020|reason=Primary source}} Ultimately ''Naiguat\u00e1'' sank, leaving the 44 naval personnel to be rescued by another vessel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fleetmon.com/maritime-news/2020/29297/cruise-ship-sunk-venezuelan-navy-ship-and-fled-pro/?fbclid=|title=Cruise Ship Sunk Venezuelan Navy Ship after being Fired at and Rammed.
