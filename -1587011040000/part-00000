Vance]]. The plot follows a mother who tries to help her addict son after he returns home from rehab.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 8, 2018, and was theatrically released on December 7, 2018, by [[LD Entertainment]], [[Roadside Attractions]], and [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Hedges and Roberts but was a [[box office bomb]] grossing just $10.1 million against its $13 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nDriving home with her kids on Christmas Eve, Holly Burns is startled to see her son Ben standing in the driveway. Ben has been in rehab for the past few months and is not supposed to be released yet. Ben tells them his sponsor said a trip home would be good for him. Though wary, Holly is happy to see him and says he can stay for 24 hours on the condition he does not leave her sight.\n\nHolly takes Ben out to do some holiday shopping and get him clothes for church. While at the mall Holly runs into Ben's former doctor, now an old man riddled with dementia. When his caregiver walks away Holly scolds him for getting her son hooked on painkillers after a snowboarding accident when he was younger. Ben also makes eye contact with someone who clearly recognizes him, leaving Ben looking worried. He tells Holly he needs to get to a [[support group]] meeting immediately.\n\nAt the meeting Ben shares the story of how he almost overdosed but his mom and dog saved him. After the meeting he is approached by a young girl. He doesn't recognize her, but she tells him he was her dealer and asks if he wants to get high with her one last time.\n\nBack shopping once again Holly finds drugs on Ben and he claims the girl at the meeting gave them to him. Holly takes the drugs and they go home and get ready for church. At church they see a distraught woman. Holly approaches her and gives her condolences for the loss of her daughter Maggie. It is implied that Maggie was the friend or girlfriend of Ben's and a fellow person with an addiction.\n\nThe family drives home from church that night to find that someone has broken into their home and kidnapped the family dog, Ponce. Realizing it has something to do with him, Ben runs off to retrieve the dog. Holly follows him in the car and they end up driving around trying to find the dog together. They first visit one of Ben's former high school teachers whom Holly is shocked to learn used to provide her son with drugs in exchange for sexual favors. Next they go to Maggie's father's apartment. Seeing him sleeping and no dog in sight they retreat to their car but he wakes and angrily smashes the car window screaming for Ben to leave.\n\nWhile eating at a diner Ben tells Holly he got Maggie hooked on drugs and is responsible for her death. He says that he lied to her telling her that the drugs were the best thing ever.  Holly explains at the time he believed this to be the truth, so it was not a lie.  Ben's childhood friend Spencer (the guy from the mall) shows up and after a physical confrontation, confirms Ben's fear: Clayton, a drug dealer he used to work for, is the one who took the dog.  Ben tries to get his mom to go home, telling her this will be dangerous and she should let him handle it. He also says he's a liar and not worth all the trouble but Holly refuses to leave him.\n\nBen is able to trick Holly at a gas station convenience store, leaving her stranded there while he goes to meet Clayton.  Ben tries to buy his dog back but Clayton says Ben must do one more job for him - handling a drug run. Meanwhile, Holly goes to Maggie's mom for help. Maggie's mom gives her a med kit for reviving a person who has suffered an overdose and the keys to her car to go find Ben. Holly tracks down Spencer, and gives him the drugs she confiscated from Ben earlier, in exchange for him telling her where Ben might be. Holly also goes to a drive-through pharmacy and tries to fill an old prescription, presumably for anti-overdose medication. The pharmacist refuses to fill the prescription, because the store does not want to encourage bad behavior.\n\nBen completes the mission and gets his dog back, but Clayton also gives him some drugs as a thank you. Ben goes to the same drive-through pharmacy, ironically receiving a syringe from the same person who previously denied Holly anti-overdose medication on the grounds of not wanting to encourage bad behavior. Ben drives out to an abandoned barn and parks on the side of the road. He leaves Ponce in the car with a note asking whoever finds it to call Holly.\n\nAfter wandering around all night, searching unsuccessfully for Ben, Holly finally goes to a police station. While screaming for someone to find and arrest her son, she gets a call from a guy who has found Ponce, and drives out to retrieve him. She follows Ponce down a nearby path that leads to an old barn where she finds Ben unconscious, having taken the drugs from Clayton. Holly uses the Naloxone kit from Maggie's mom and performs mouth-to-mouth on him, and finally is able to revive him as the movie cuts to ending credits.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Holly Burns-Beeby, Ben and Ivy's mother and Neal's wife\n* [[Lucas Hedges]] as Ben Burns, Holly's son, Ivy's brother and Neal's stepson\n* [[Courtney B.

In Indonesia lumpia is associated with [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine]] and commonly found in cities where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] settles. Although some local variants exist and the filling ingredients may vary, the most popular variant is ''Lumpia Semarang'', available in fried or unfried variants.\n\nUnlike its Philippines counterpart, Indonesian lumpia rarely uses minced [[pork]] as a filling. This was meant to cater to larger [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] clientele, thus popular fillings are usually chicken, shrimp, egg and vegetables. Indonesian lumpia is commonly filled with seasoned chopped ''rebung'' ([[bamboo shoot]]s) with minced chicken or prawns, served with fresh baby [[shallot]]s or [[leek]]s in sweet ''[[tauco]]'' (fermented soy) based sauce. Other than homemade, lumpia is also offered as street food sold by travelling vendor on carts, sold in foodstalls specializing on ''Lumpia Semarang'', or sold in traditional marketplaces as part of ''[[kue]]'' (Indonesian traditional snack) or ''jajan pasar'' (market munchies). Simpler and cheaper lumpia is sold as part of ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian fritters). Indonesians are noted for their fondness of hot and spicy food, and therefore spicy hot ''[[sambal]]'' chili sauce or fresh bird's eye chili are usually added as a dipping sauce or condiment.\n\n====Lumpia Semarang====\n[[File:Loenpia Gang Lombok Semarang.jpg|thumb|right|Lumpia Semarang, specialty of [[Semarang]] city, Central Java.]]\nNamed after the capital city of Central Java in Indonesia, [[Semarang]], where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] have settled, ''lumpia Semarang'' is perhaps the most popular lumpia variant in Indonesia. It has become associated with the city, and the spring rolls are often sought by the visitors in Semarang as food gift or souvenir. Originally made by Chinese immigrants, this lumpia is filled with [[bamboo shoots]], [[dried shrimp]], chicken, and/or prawns. It is served with a sweet chili sauce made from dried shrimp (optional), coconut sugar, red chili peppers, bird's eye chili peppers, ground white pepper, tapioca starch, water, and baby shallots. Lumpia Semarang is served either deep-fried or unfried, as the filling is already cooked.<ref name=\"IndoEats-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Surabaya====\nNamed after the city of [[Surabaya]] in East Java, where this lumpia was originally made.

They use various fillings inspired by local ingredients and dishes, and the later cuisines of Spain, China, and the United States. Filipino lumpia can be differentiated from other Asian spring roll versions in that they use a paper-thin wrapper made from just flour, water, and salt. They were also traditionally slender and long, with a shape roughly similar to that of [[cigar]]s or ''[[cigarillo]]s'', though modern versions can come in various shapes and sizes. The thinness of the cr\u00eape and the shape of the lumpia give them a relatively denser wrapping that nevertheless remain flaky and light in texture. They are also traditionally dipped in ''[[agre dulce]]'' (sweet and sour sauce), vinegar-based sauces, [[banana ketchup]], or [[sweet chili sauce]]. Fresh lumpia, however, have wrappers which are more [[cr\u00eape]]-like and thicker due to the addition of eggs (though still thinner than other Asian versions). They are closer in texture to the original Chinese versions and were traditionally made with rice flour which makes them chewier. Various kinds of lumpia, fried or fresh, are ubiquitous in Filipino celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Filipino Lumpia Recipe |url=http://chefpablos.com/recipe/filipino-lumpia-recipe/ |website=Chef Pablo's |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Dwyer\">{{cite web |last1=Dwyer |first1=A.E. |title=Everything you need to know about Asian egg rolls |url=https://thetakeout.com/asian-egg-rolls-cha-gio-spring-rolls-lumpia-1826717513 |website=The Takeout |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"santanachote\">{{cite web |last1=Santanachote |first1=Perry |title=Beyond Egg Rolls: 9 Spring Rolls Everyone Should Know About |url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/the-differences-between-egg-rolls-spring-rolls-popiah-and-lumpia |website=Thrillist |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nFilipino lumpia also have a unique and extremely popular [[dessert]] subcategory, the ''[[Turon (food)|turon]]''.

Egg is often used to hold the wrap together. The accompanying sauce is made from chicken or pork stock, a [[starch]] mixture, crushed roasted peanuts and fresh [[garlic]].

It is derived from the original Chinese [[popiah]].\n\n====Lumpiang Shanghai====\n{{Main|Lumpiang Shanghai}}\n''[[Lumpiang Shanghai]]'' is regarded as the most basic type of lumpia and is one of the most commonly served dishes in Filipino gatherings.

They have numerous variants that contain other ingredients like [[Pea#Types of pea|green pea]]s, ''kinchay'' ([[Chinese parsley]]) or raisins. ''Lumpiang Shanghai'' is commonly served with ''[[agre dulce]]'', but [[ketchup]] (tomato or [[ketchup|banana]]) and vinegar are popular alternatives. This variant is typically smaller than other lumpia.

A ball of dough is taken with one hand and smeared into a heated large flat metal plate greased with oil until a very thin circular film of it adheres to the pan and fries.

In Indonesia lumpia is associated with [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine]] and commonly found in cities where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] settles. Although some local variants exist and the filling ingredients may vary, the most popular variant is ''Lumpia Semarang'', available in fried or unfried variants.\n\nUnlike its Philippines counterpart, Indonesian lumpia rarely uses minced [[pork]] as a filling. This was meant to cater to larger [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] clientele, thus popular fillings are usually chicken, shrimp, egg and vegetables. Indonesian lumpia is commonly filled with seasoned chopped ''rebung'' ([[bamboo shoot]]s) with minced chicken or prawns, served with fresh baby [[shallot]]s or [[leek]]s in sweet ''[[tauco]]'' (fermented soy) based sauce. Other than homemade, lumpia is also offered as street food sold by travelling vendor on carts, sold in foodstalls specializing on ''Lumpia Semarang'', or sold in traditional marketplaces as part of ''[[kue]]'' (Indonesian traditional snack) or ''jajan pasar'' (market munchies). Simpler and cheaper lumpia is sold as part of ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian fritters). Indonesians are noted for their fondness of hot and spicy food, and therefore spicy hot ''[[sambal]]'' chili sauce or fresh bird's eye chili are usually added as a dipping sauce or condiment.\n\n====Lumpia Semarang====\n[[File:Loenpia Gang Lombok Semarang.jpg|thumb|right|Lumpia Semarang, specialty of [[Semarang]] city, Central Java.]]\nNamed after the capital city of Central Java in Indonesia, [[Semarang]], where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] have settled, ''lumpia Semarang'' is perhaps the most popular lumpia variant in Indonesia. It has become associated with the city, and the spring rolls are often sought by the visitors in Semarang as food gift or souvenir. Originally made by Chinese immigrants, this lumpia is filled with [[bamboo shoots]], [[dried shrimp]], chicken, and/or prawns. It is served with a sweet chili sauce made from dried shrimp (optional), coconut sugar, red chili peppers, bird's eye chili peppers, ground white pepper, tapioca starch, water, and baby shallots.

They use various fillings inspired by local ingredients and dishes, and the later cuisines of Spain, China, and the United States. Filipino lumpia can be differentiated from other Asian spring roll versions in that they use a paper-thin wrapper made from just flour, water, and salt. They were also traditionally slender and long, with a shape roughly similar to that of [[cigar]]s or ''[[cigarillo]]s'', though modern versions can come in various shapes and sizes. The thinness of the cr\u00eape and the shape of the lumpia give them a relatively denser wrapping that nevertheless remain flaky and light in texture. They are also traditionally dipped in ''[[agre dulce]]'' (sweet and sour sauce), vinegar-based sauces, [[banana ketchup]], or [[sweet chili sauce]]. Fresh lumpia, however, have wrappers which are more [[cr\u00eape]]-like and thicker due to the addition of eggs (though still thinner than other Asian versions). They are closer in texture to the original Chinese versions and were traditionally made with rice flour which makes them chewier. Various kinds of lumpia, fried or fresh, are ubiquitous in Filipino celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Filipino Lumpia Recipe |url=http://chefpablos.com/recipe/filipino-lumpia-recipe/ |website=Chef Pablo's |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Dwyer\">{{cite web |last1=Dwyer |first1=A.E. |title=Everything you need to know about Asian egg rolls |url=https://thetakeout.com/asian-egg-rolls-cha-gio-spring-rolls-lumpia-1826717513 |website=The Takeout |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"santanachote\">{{cite web |last1=Santanachote |first1=Perry |title=Beyond Egg Rolls: 9 Spring Rolls Everyone Should Know About |url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/the-differences-between-egg-rolls-spring-rolls-popiah-and-lumpia |website=Thrillist |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nFilipino lumpia also have a unique and extremely popular [[dessert]] subcategory, the ''[[Turon (food)|turon]]''.

For example, Arizona Rangers working court security or prisoner transportation duties are officers of the court, and have the same arrest authority as any sworn peace officer. The Arizona Rangers operate as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit agency.  \n\nThe original Arizona Rangers were created by the [[Arizona Territorial Legislature]] in 1901. The United States Congress denied the Arizona Territory's application to become a State, partly because there was no law and order. At that time, the Territory was a very dangerous place. Modeled after the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], the Arizona Rangers were tasked with hunting down and arresting [[outlaw]]s in the [[Arizona Territory]], especially along the [[United States-Mexican border|Mexican border]]. They were well trained, well equipped and very effective at apprehending even the most dangerous of outlaws.   \n\nBy 1908, most of the outlaws had been arrested, killed or had fled into Mexico. The Rangers brought law and order to the Arizona Territory. It was a safe place to live for the very first time. \n\nThe Rangers were disbanded for political reasons in 1909. Shortly after that, Arizona became the 48th state.  \n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Flagraise.gif|thumb|right|215px|Civil War-era Arizona Rangers raising the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]] in 1862 in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in the newly created [[Confederate Arizona|Confederate Territory of Arizona]].]]\n\n===First Arizona Rangers===\nThe first Territorial Rangers were organized to police the new gold boom towns and mining camps in the western half of the New Mexico Territory that arose after the first gold strike in 1858 in [[Gila City, Arizona|Gila City]]. In his history of the Territorial Rangers, stretching back to [[Company A, Arizona Rangers|1861]], Arizona State Historian Marshall Trimble revealed \"Arizona\u2019s first Ranger may have been one of the founders of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Jack Swilling]].\"\n\n===Civil War-era Confederate Arizona Rangers===\nAfter the establishment of the Confederate Arizona Territory, Territorial Governor [[John R. Baylor|John Robert Baylor]] decided he needed to supplement existing militia companies with a regiment of militarized Rangers modeled after the war-time [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]]. He intended this regiment to consist of several companies of cavalry. On January 25, 1862, the first Confederate ranger company, [[Company A, Arizona Rangers|Company A]] Baylor's Regiment of Arizona Rangers commanded by Captain [[Sherod Hunter]], was mustered into service at the town of Dona Ana located just north of present-day [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. Hunter's Company consisted of about 75 men for the most part residents of the newly created [[Confederate Territory of Arizona]]. \n\nThe Confederate Arizona Rangers were armed with revolvers and [[Springfield Model 1847|Springfield Model 1847 smoothbore musketoons]], probably taken from the Union [[Fort Fillmore]] after it surrendered in August 1861. The companies were enlisted for three years, or the duration of the war. They were picked for their skills and experience with the hardships of frontier life. \n\nOn February 10, 1862 Company A was ordered to occupy [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], the largest town in the western Confederate Territory of Arizona. Tucson was located along the [[Butterfield Overland Mail|Butterfield Overland Mail route]], the only one between [[California]] and the [[Rio Grande Valley|Rio Grande]] and [[Mesilla Valley|Mesilla valleys]], and an ideal location for an advanced post to observe and delay the advance of Union forces gathering under Colonel [[James Henry Carleton]] at [[Fort Yuma]]. By taking possession of Tucson, Baylor would also protect the citizens and secure the Confederate claim to possession of western Arizona, which had been abandoned by Union troops in 1861. Company A arrived in Tucson on February 28, with the loss of only one life; Corporal Benjamin Mayo who had died of exposure at [[San Simon, Arizona|San Simon stage station]] on the 25th.\n\nThe invasion of Arizona by the Union \"[[California Column]]\" would have come much sooner but for the tactics of Captain Hunter and Company A. After Hunter's Company A retreated from Tucson and arrived in Mesilla on May 27, 1862, it was organized with two Arizona militia companies, the [[Arizona Guards]] of [[Pinos Altos, Arizona|Pinos Altos]] and the Arizona Rangers of [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla,]], under Herbert's Battalion of Arizona Cavalry under the command of Lt. Colonel [[Philemon T. Herbert]]. It served as the rearguard to the remnants of the Confederate [[Army of New Mexico]] as it withdrew from [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] to [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], in July 1862. By the end of May 1863 the Arizona Battalion had been reduced by losses and it was disbanded. Company A still had enough men to continue as a viable company, and was kept in being but renamed as the independent [[Arizona Scout Company]], attached to [[Thomas Green (general)|Green's Brigade]]. The other two companies of the Battalion were disbanded and the men consolidated with those of Company A to form the Arizona Scout Company. \n\nAfter the [[Red River Campaign]], from March-May 1864, the Texas Cavalry Division, under Major General [[John A. Wharton]], was among the units ordered northward into [[Arkansas]]. The [[Arizona Scouts]], went with them and for the rest of 1864 fought minor skirmishes and conducted routine picket duty and scouting. In November 1864, Captain [[James Henry Tevis]] (who by that time had recovered from his wounds) returned to command of the Arizona Scouts until General [[Edmund Kirby Smith]], surrendered all Confederate forces west of the Mississippi River on May 26, 1865.\n\n===Late 19th Century Arizona Rangers===\nMarshall Trimble goes on to discuss the militia groups formed before Gov. Frederick Tritle authorized the first company of Rangers in Tombstone in 1882.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/jcontent/history/history/history-features/5295-the-arizona-rangers |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424040537/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/jcontent/history/history/history-features/5295-the-arizona-rangers |archivedate=April 24, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Early 20th Century Arizona Rangers===\nOriginally, only one company was authorized, consisting of a [[captain (land)|captain]], a [[sergeant]] and not more than twelve [[Private (rank)|private]]s, but, in 1903, the force was increased to twenty-six men. The Rangers, many of whom in the early years were veterans of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Rough Riders]], were skilled horsemen, trackers and marksmen.  Though originally intended to be covert, the group became widely publicized and conspicuous, sported their badges boldly, and were distinctively well-armed.\n\nIn addition to dealing with [[cattle raiding|rustlers]], and other outlaws, the Rangers were called on to deal with several large [[labor unrest|strike]]s by Mexican workers at [[Mining|mine]]s in Arizona and [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]]. During the [[Cananea strike|Cananea Riot]] in 1906, managers of the mine stampeded horses and fired shots into a crowd of striking Mexican miners, killing two. The Mexican's retaliated, burning a building with four Americans trapped inside. In response, and against the Governor's orders, Captain [[Thomas H. Rynning]] joined a civilian [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] of 275 men and rode to Cananea to assist Mexican Federal Troops and state mounted police. Tensions flared and shots were fired. When the smoke cleared, more than twenty-five good men, both Mexican and American lay dead.\n\nOn February 15, 1909, the Arizona legislature repealed the act establishing the Arizona Rangers.  During the seven years of its operations, 107 men served with the Rangers. The vote to disband was vetoed by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Territorial Governor of Arizona|Governor]] [[Joseph Henry Kibbey]], but the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated assembly overrode the veto, backed by political pressure from county sheriffs and district attorneys in northern Arizona.\n\nAfter the Arizona Rangers disbanded, many of the former Rangers stayed in law enforcement. [[Harry C. Wheeler]] was elected [[sheriff]] of [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] and Thomas Rynning became the [[prison warden]] in [[Yuma, Arizona]].\n\nSeven former Rangers reunited in 1940 to ride together in the Prescott Rodeo Parade. In 1955, the Arizona legislature authorized a $100 monthly [[pension]] for former Rangers who had served at least six months and who still lived in Arizona. Five men qualified for this pension.\n\n[[William MacLeod Raine]] wrote the following about crime in Arizona Territory and the effectiveness of the Arizona Rangers in a 1905 edition of [[Pearson's Magazine]]:\n\n{{quotation| The work assigned to these Rangers was arduous and dangerous one. For many years sheriff's officers and vigilantes had found themselves entirely unable to cope with the lawless bands which made their headquarters in the bad lands. But the condition of affairs had grown unendurable. The temerity of the outlaws was not only a scourge to the community, but a menace to the good name of the Territory. No man's sheep or cattle were safe from the raids of the organized bands of outlaws, who would sweep down on a range, drive away the cattle, reach the mountain fastnesses long before the posse could be organized for pursuit. Raids and murders had become so common that they were scarcely noted. There were a dozen bands of the horse and cattle thieves, at the head of which were such man as [[Smith Gang|'Bill' Smith]], the notorious [[Augustine Chacon]], commonly called 'Pelelo', and the train robber, [[Burt Alvord]]. Yet within a year of the time of its organization, this little band of rangers, consisting of a captain, a sergeant and twelve privates, had practically cleared the territory of hundreds of bad characters. Many of them had paid for their lawlessness with their lives and the rest had been driven across the line into Mexico... The Rangers are recruited from old cow-boys and from the ranks of Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders. They have to be able to rope and ride anything on four legs, as their horses may be killed and remounts are at times absolutely necessary. Especially quick work is required in heading fugitives from the border. A crime is reported, the ranger slaps on the saddle and is away. To the credit of the ranger it may be said that nine times out of ten he brings back his man, dead or alive.<ref name=\"Raine, pg. 70-71\">{{cite book|last=Raine|first=William MacLeod|authorlink=|title=Pearson's Magazine: Carrying Law into the Mesquite|publisher=Pearson Publishing Co.|series=|year=1905|doi=|isbn=}}</ref>}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=March 2017}}\n===Modern-day Arizona Rangers===\nIn 1957 a nonprofit organization called the Arizona Rangers was organized, founded with the assistance of four former members of the agency. The modern Arizona Rangers were officially recognized by the state of Arizona in 2002, when Arizona Governor [[Jane Hull]] signed Legislative Act 41. The purpose of this act was \"to recognize the Arizona Rangers, who formed in 1901, disbanded in 1909 and reestablished in 1957 by original Arizona Rangers.\" The recognition by the State of Arizona gives no law enforcement authority to the organization.  Members of the organization receive 24 hours of initial training and then ongoing monthly training.  Rangers are required to qualify to Arizona Peace Officers Standard of Training (AZPOST) with their firearms, batons, handcuffs, and OC spray.\n\nThe present-day Arizona Rangers are an unpaid, all-volunteer, law enforcement support and assistance civilian nonprofit organization in the state of Arizona. They fulfill a three-point mission: 1. Law Enforcement support, by working co-operatively at the request of and under the direction, control, and supervision of established law enforcement officials and officers; 2. Government and non-profit security services; and 3. Youth support and community services.  All aspects of their mission preserves the tradition, honor, and history of the original Arizona Rangers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://azrangers.gov/our-mission/ |title=Our Mission |accessdate=August 28, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nThe Rangers operate throughout the State of Arizona, but use about 20 Companies that operated semi-independently as local geography and community needs dictate while operating within the operating guidelines of a statewide organization.  Each Company has a Captain who is a member of the Board of Governors and operationally reports to an Area Commander.  So while there is only one Arizona Rangers organization, the Company Captains have latitude to make adjustments as to how their Company fulfills the mission in their local area.\n\nWhen an applicant applies to become a Ranger, a full background check and a physical check are performed to ensure qualified candidates are processed.  When an applicant is accepted, they are placed on probation until they complete all requirements, which includes Arizona Ranger Training Academy, a minimum of 24 hours of supervised duty with a Field Training Officer, a minimum of 90 days of probation, and meet other requirements placed upon them by the Company.\n\n==Leadership==\nThe first Captain of the Arizona Rangers was [[Burton C. Mossman]] of [[Bisbee, Arizona]]. Mossman, who had previously been manager of the {{convert|2|e6acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Aztec Land and Cattle Company]] in northern Arizona, had some success in controlling [[Cattle rustling|rustling]] of his company's cattle.\n\nIn July 1902 after successfully recruiting and organizing the original Rangers, Mossman resigned to return to [[ranching]].  He was replaced by [[Thomas H. Rynning]]. The third and last commander of the Arizona Rangers was [[Harry C. Wheeler]].\n\nIn general, the men of the Arizona Rangers were extremely capable; their exploits were widely reported by the newspapers of the day.<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20F14FC3A591B728DDDA80894DE405B828CF1D3 \"RANGER'S LONG CHASE.; More than a Thousand Miles Over Deserts and Mountains\"], ''New York Times'', June 1, 1902</ref> Many of these reports are collected in the book, ''The Arizona Rangers,'' edited by Joseph Miller.\n\n{{Expand section|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Uniforms and insignia==\nArizona Rangers were not issued standardized uniforms, as they were originally intended to operate undercover.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Neal|first=Bill|title=The Arizona Rangers|year=1987|publisher=Eakin Press|location=Austin, TX|page=12}}</ref>\n\n[[Badge]]s of the Arizona Rangers, which were first issued in 1903 were solid silver five-pointed ball-tipped stars, lettered in blue enamel with engravings etched in blue, and are a valuable collectible. An officer's badge was engraved with the Ranger's name, while badges for enlisted men were numbered. Upon resignation, a Ranger returned his badge, which was then available to be assigned to a new Ranger.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Similar agencies==\nThe Arizona Rangers had been preceded by the organization of the Arizona Territorial Rangers in 1860.  This group was formed by the Provisional Territorial Government, principally to protect against [[Apache]] raids.  The intent was to have three companies of Territorial Rangers, two were formed in the mining camp of [[Pinos Altos, New Mexico|Pinos Altos]], known as the \"[[Arizona Guards]]\" and the \"[[Minute Men (Arizona Territorial Rangers)|Minute Men]]\", and another, the \"Arizona Rangers\", in [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla]] by Captain James Henry Tevis.<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/azbio/bios/TEVISJ.PDF2 Arizona State University Library, Hayden Pioneer Biographies Collection, biography of James Henry Tevis, p.1]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of Baylor's [[Confederate Army]] in [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla]] and his declaration of a [[Arizona Territory (Confederate States of America)|Confederate Territory of Arizona]] in early 1862, the Arizona Territorial Rangers were disbanded by Captain Tevis who joined [[San Elizario Spy Company]] in the Confederate Army.  The Confederate Territorial Governor, General Baylor eventually saw the need for the rangers also and formed [[Company A, Arizona Rangers]] as the first of three companies for the defense of Arizona Territory.  It was commanded by Captain [[Sherod Hunter]] and Second Lieutenant James Henry Tevis.  The Arizona Rangers were sent to [[Tucson]] to defend western Arizona Territory.  When the [[California Column]] drove the Confederates out of Arizona Territory, plans for organizing the Arizona Rangers were put off for years.\n\nIn the early 1880s, Arizona was not only having an [[Apache Wars#Geronimo's War|Indian war]], but border crimes and killings were making Arizona unfit to live in.  Upon taking office, Governor [[Frederick Augustus Tritle]] faced a problem of lawlessness within the territory caused by outlaw cowboys and hostile natives. On April 24, 1882 he authorized formation of the 1st Company of Arizona Rangers in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] making John H. Jackson its Captain.  They were to be similar to Texas Rangers and combat [[outlaw]]s and hostile Indians.  His first assignment to the Rangers was to scout near the border of the territory for Indians, and for those who recently killed a teamster there.  The Rangers Captain was only able to pay the first months wages, and the Governor despite his best efforts was never able to get them funded by the Territorial Legislature or Congress. On May 20, he wrote Johnston informing them they should continue until the end of the month when their pay ran out.  Following the [[Earp Vendetta Ride]] and the departure of the Earps lawlessness in the area seems to have quieted.<ref>Wagoner, Jay J., '''Arizona Territory 1863\u20131912: A Political history''', Tucson: University of Arizona Press, (1970). {{ISBN|0-8165-0176-9}}.pp. 194-200</ref>\n\nThe analogous agency in the [[Territory of New Mexico]], organized in 1905, was called the [[New Mexico Mounted Patrol]]. Across the Mexican border in northern [[Sonora]] was a similar law enforcement agency called the [[Guardia Rural]], colloquially known as the [[rurales]]. This group is often confused with another group often referred to with the same colloquialism, the Guardia Fiscal, which was commanded by a Russian, Colonel [[Emilio Kosterlitzky]], who cooperated closely with the Rangers.<ref>Vanderwood, P.

For example, Arizona Rangers working court security or prisoner transportation duties are officers of the court, and have the same arrest authority as any sworn peace officer. The Arizona Rangers operate as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit agency.  \n\nThe original Arizona Rangers were created by the [[Arizona Territorial Legislature]] in 1901. The United States Congress denied their application to become a State, partly because there was no law and order. At that time, the Arizona Territory was a very dangerous place. Modeled after the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], the Rangers were tasked with hunting down and arresting [[outlaw]]s in the [[Arizona Territory]], especially along the [[United States-Mexican border|Mexican border]]. They were well trained, well equipped and very effective at apprehending even the most dangerous of outlaws.   \n\nBy 1908, most of the outlaws had been arrested, killed or had fled into Mexico. The Rangers brought law and order to the Arizona Territory. It was a safe place to live for the very first time. \n\nThe Rangers were disbanded for political reasons in 1909. Shortly after that, Arizona became the 48th state.  \n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Flagraise.gif|thumb|right|215px|Civil War-era Arizona Rangers raising the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]] in 1862 in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in the newly created [[Confederate Arizona|Confederate Territory of Arizona]].]]\n\n===First Arizona Rangers===\nThe first Territorial Rangers were organized to police the new gold boom towns and mining camps in the western half of the New Mexico Territory that arose after the first gold strike in 1858 in [[Gila City, Arizona|Gila City]]. In his history of the Territorial Rangers, stretching back to [[Company A, Arizona Rangers|1861]], Arizona State Historian Marshall Trimble revealed \"Arizona\u2019s first Ranger may have been one of the founders of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Jack Swilling]].\"\n\n===Civil War-era Confederate Arizona Rangers===\nAfter the establishment of the Confederate Arizona Territory, Territorial Governor [[John R. Baylor|John Robert Baylor]] decided he needed to supplement existing militia companies with a regiment of militarized Rangers modeled after the war-time [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]]. He intended this regiment to consist of several companies of cavalry. On January 25, 1862, the first Confederate ranger company, [[Company A, Arizona Rangers|Company A]] Baylor's Regiment of Arizona Rangers commanded by Captain [[Sherod Hunter]], was mustered into service at the town of Dona Ana located just north of present-day [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. Hunter's Company consisted of about 75 men for the most part residents of the newly created [[Confederate Territory of Arizona]]. \n\nThe Confederate Arizona Rangers were armed with revolvers and [[Springfield Model 1847|Springfield Model 1847 smoothbore musketoons]], probably taken from the Union [[Fort Fillmore]] after it surrendered in August 1861. The companies were enlisted for three years, or the duration of the war. They were picked for their skills and experience with the hardships of frontier life. \n\nOn February 10, 1862 Company A was ordered to occupy [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], the largest town in the western Confederate Territory of Arizona. Tucson was located along the [[Butterfield Overland Mail|Butterfield Overland Mail route]], the only one between [[California]] and the [[Rio Grande Valley|Rio Grande]] and [[Mesilla Valley|Mesilla valleys]], and an ideal location for an advanced post to observe and delay the advance of Union forces gathering under Colonel [[James Henry Carleton]] at [[Fort Yuma]]. By taking possession of Tucson, Baylor would also protect the citizens and secure the Confederate claim to possession of western Arizona, which had been abandoned by Union troops in 1861. Company A arrived in Tucson on February 28, with the loss of only one life; Corporal Benjamin Mayo who had died of exposure at [[San Simon, Arizona|San Simon stage station]] on the 25th.\n\nThe invasion of Arizona by the Union \"[[California Column]]\" would have come much sooner but for the tactics of Captain Hunter and Company A. After Hunter's Company A retreated from Tucson and arrived in Mesilla on May 27, 1862, it was organized with two Arizona militia companies, the [[Arizona Guards]] of [[Pinos Altos, Arizona|Pinos Altos]] and the Arizona Rangers of [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla,]], under Herbert's Battalion of Arizona Cavalry under the command of Lt. Colonel [[Philemon T. Herbert]]. It served as the rearguard to the remnants of the Confederate [[Army of New Mexico]] as it withdrew from [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] to [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], in July 1862. By the end of May 1863 the Arizona Battalion had been reduced by losses and it was disbanded. Company A still had enough men to continue as a viable company, and was kept in being but renamed as the independent [[Arizona Scout Company]], attached to [[Thomas Green (general)|Green's Brigade]]. The other two companies of the Battalion were disbanded and the men consolidated with those of Company A to form the Arizona Scout Company. \n\nAfter the [[Red River Campaign]], from March-May 1864, the Texas Cavalry Division, under Major General [[John A. Wharton]], was among the units ordered northward into [[Arkansas]]. The [[Arizona Scouts]], went with them and for the rest of 1864 fought minor skirmishes and conducted routine picket duty and scouting. In November 1864, Captain [[James Henry Tevis]] (who by that time had recovered from his wounds) returned to command of the Arizona Scouts until General [[Edmund Kirby Smith]], surrendered all Confederate forces west of the Mississippi River on May 26, 1865.\n\n===Late 19th Century Arizona Rangers===\nMarshall Trimble goes on to discuss the militia groups formed before Gov. Frederick Tritle authorized the first company of Rangers in Tombstone in 1882.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/jcontent/history/history/history-features/5295-the-arizona-rangers |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424040537/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/jcontent/history/history/history-features/5295-the-arizona-rangers |archivedate=April 24, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Early 20th Century Arizona Rangers===\nOriginally, only one company was authorized, consisting of a [[captain (land)|captain]], a [[sergeant]] and not more than twelve [[Private (rank)|private]]s, but, in 1903, the force was increased to twenty-six men. The Rangers, many of whom in the early years were veterans of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Rough Riders]], were skilled horsemen, trackers and marksmen.  Though originally intended to be covert, the group became widely publicized and conspicuous, sported their badges boldly, and were distinctively well-armed.\n\nIn addition to dealing with [[cattle raiding|rustlers]], and other outlaws, the Rangers were called on to deal with several large [[labor unrest|strike]]s by Mexican workers at [[Mining|mine]]s in Arizona and [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]]. During the [[Cananea strike|Cananea Riot]] in 1906, managers of the mine stampeded horses and fired shots into a crowd of striking Mexican miners, killing two. The Mexican's retaliated, burning a building with four Americans trapped inside. In response, and against the Governor's orders, Captain [[Thomas H. Rynning]] joined a civilian [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] of 275 men and rode to Cananea to assist Mexican Federal Troops and state mounted police. Tensions flared and shots were fired. When the smoke cleared, more than twenty-five good men, both Mexican and American lay dead.\n\nOn February 15, 1909, the Arizona legislature repealed the act establishing the Arizona Rangers.  During the seven years of its operations, 107 men served with the Rangers. The vote to disband was vetoed by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Territorial Governor of Arizona|Governor]] [[Joseph Henry Kibbey]], but the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated assembly overrode the veto, backed by political pressure from county sheriffs and district attorneys in northern Arizona.\n\nAfter the Arizona Rangers disbanded, many of the former Rangers stayed in law enforcement. [[Harry C. Wheeler]] was elected [[sheriff]] of [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] and Thomas Rynning became the [[prison warden]] in [[Yuma, Arizona]].\n\nSeven former Rangers reunited in 1940 to ride together in the Prescott Rodeo Parade. In 1955, the Arizona legislature authorized a $100 monthly [[pension]] for former Rangers who had served at least six months and who still lived in Arizona. Five men qualified for this pension.\n\n[[William MacLeod Raine]] wrote the following about crime in Arizona Territory and the effectiveness of the Arizona Rangers in a 1905 edition of [[Pearson's Magazine]]:\n\n{{quotation| The work assigned to these Rangers was arduous and dangerous one. For many years sheriff's officers and vigilantes had found themselves entirely unable to cope with the lawless bands which made their headquarters in the bad lands. But the condition of affairs had grown unendurable. The temerity of the outlaws was not only a scourge to the community, but a menace to the good name of the Territory. No man's sheep or cattle were safe from the raids of the organized bands of outlaws, who would sweep down on a range, drive away the cattle, reach the mountain fastnesses long before the posse could be organized for pursuit. Raids and murders had become so common that they were scarcely noted. There were a dozen bands of the horse and cattle thieves, at the head of which were such man as [[Smith Gang|'Bill' Smith]], the notorious [[Augustine Chacon]], commonly called 'Pelelo', and the train robber, [[Burt Alvord]]. Yet within a year of the time of its organization, this little band of rangers, consisting of a captain, a sergeant and twelve privates, had practically cleared the territory of hundreds of bad characters. Many of them had paid for their lawlessness with their lives and the rest had been driven across the line into Mexico... The Rangers are recruited from old cow-boys and from the ranks of Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders. They have to be able to rope and ride anything on four legs, as their horses may be killed and remounts are at times absolutely necessary. Especially quick work is required in heading fugitives from the border. A crime is reported, the ranger slaps on the saddle and is away. To the credit of the ranger it may be said that nine times out of ten he brings back his man, dead or alive.<ref name=\"Raine, pg. 70-71\">{{cite book|last=Raine|first=William MacLeod|authorlink=|title=Pearson's Magazine: Carrying Law into the Mesquite|publisher=Pearson Publishing Co.|series=|year=1905|doi=|isbn=}}</ref>}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=March 2017}}\n===Modern-day Arizona Rangers===\nIn 1957 a nonprofit organization called the Arizona Rangers was organized, founded with the assistance of four former members of the agency. The modern Arizona Rangers were officially recognized by the state of Arizona in 2002, when Arizona Governor [[Jane Hull]] signed Legislative Act 41. The purpose of this act was \"to recognize the Arizona Rangers, who formed in 1901, disbanded in 1909 and reestablished in 1957 by original Arizona Rangers.\" The recognition by the State of Arizona gives no law enforcement authority to the organization.  Members of the organization receive 24 hours of initial training and then ongoing monthly training.  Rangers are required to qualify to Arizona Peace Officers Standard of Training (AZPOST) with their firearms, batons, handcuffs, and OC spray.\n\nThe present-day Arizona Rangers are an unpaid, all-volunteer, law enforcement support and assistance civilian nonprofit organization in the state of Arizona. They fulfill a three-point mission: 1. Law Enforcement support, by working co-operatively at the request of and under the direction, control, and supervision of established law enforcement officials and officers; 2. Government and non-profit security services; and 3. Youth support and community services.  All aspects of their mission preserves the tradition, honor, and history of the original Arizona Rangers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://azrangers.gov/our-mission/ |title=Our Mission |accessdate=August 28, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nThe Rangers operate throughout the State of Arizona, but use about 20 Companies that operated semi-independently as local geography and community needs dictate while operating within the operating guidelines of a statewide organization.  Each Company has a Captain who is a member of the Board of Governors and operationally reports to an Area Commander.  So while there is only one Arizona Rangers organization, the Company Captains have latitude to make adjustments as to how their Company fulfills the mission in their local area.\n\nWhen an applicant applies to become a Ranger, a full background check and a physical check are performed to ensure qualified candidates are processed.  When an applicant is accepted, they are placed on probation until they complete all requirements, which includes Arizona Ranger Training Academy, a minimum of 24 hours of supervised duty with a Field Training Officer, a minimum of 90 days of probation, and meet other requirements placed upon them by the Company.\n\n==Leadership==\nThe first Captain of the Arizona Rangers was [[Burton C. Mossman]] of [[Bisbee, Arizona]]. Mossman, who had previously been manager of the {{convert|2|e6acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Aztec Land and Cattle Company]] in northern Arizona, had some success in controlling [[Cattle rustling|rustling]] of his company's cattle.\n\nIn July 1902 after successfully recruiting and organizing the original Rangers, Mossman resigned to return to [[ranching]].  He was replaced by [[Thomas H. Rynning]]. The third and last commander of the Arizona Rangers was [[Harry C. Wheeler]].\n\nIn general, the men of the Arizona Rangers were extremely capable; their exploits were widely reported by the newspapers of the day.<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20F14FC3A591B728DDDA80894DE405B828CF1D3 \"RANGER'S LONG CHASE.; More than a Thousand Miles Over Deserts and Mountains\"], ''New York Times'', June 1, 1902</ref> Many of these reports are collected in the book, ''The Arizona Rangers,'' edited by Joseph Miller.\n\n{{Expand section|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Uniforms and insignia==\nArizona Rangers were not issued standardized uniforms, as they were originally intended to operate undercover.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Neal|first=Bill|title=The Arizona Rangers|year=1987|publisher=Eakin Press|location=Austin, TX|page=12}}</ref>\n\n[[Badge]]s of the Arizona Rangers, which were first issued in 1903 were solid silver five-pointed ball-tipped stars, lettered in blue enamel with engravings etched in blue, and are a valuable collectible. An officer's badge was engraved with the Ranger's name, while badges for enlisted men were numbered. Upon resignation, a Ranger returned his badge, which was then available to be assigned to a new Ranger.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n==Similar agencies==\nThe Arizona Rangers had been preceded by the organization of the Arizona Territorial Rangers in 1860.  This group was formed by the Provisional Territorial Government, principally to protect against [[Apache]] raids.  The intent was to have three companies of Territorial Rangers, two were formed in the mining camp of [[Pinos Altos, New Mexico|Pinos Altos]], known as the \"[[Arizona Guards]]\" and the \"[[Minute Men (Arizona Territorial Rangers)|Minute Men]]\", and another, the \"Arizona Rangers\", in [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla]] by Captain James Henry Tevis.<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/azbio/bios/TEVISJ.PDF2 Arizona State University Library, Hayden Pioneer Biographies Collection, biography of James Henry Tevis, p.1]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of Baylor's [[Confederate Army]] in [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla]] and his declaration of a [[Arizona Territory (Confederate States of America)|Confederate Territory of Arizona]] in early 1862, the Arizona Territorial Rangers were disbanded by Captain Tevis who joined [[San Elizario Spy Company]] in the Confederate Army.  The Confederate Territorial Governor, General Baylor eventually saw the need for the rangers also and formed [[Company A, Arizona Rangers]] as the first of three companies for the defense of Arizona Territory.  It was commanded by Captain [[Sherod Hunter]] and Second Lieutenant James Henry Tevis.  The Arizona Rangers were sent to [[Tucson]] to defend western Arizona Territory.  When the [[California Column]] drove the Confederates out of Arizona Territory, plans for organizing the Arizona Rangers were put off for years.\n\nIn the early 1880s, Arizona was not only having an [[Apache Wars#Geronimo's War|Indian war]], but border crimes and killings were making Arizona unfit to live in.  Upon taking office, Governor [[Frederick Augustus Tritle]] faced a problem of lawlessness within the territory caused by outlaw cowboys and hostile natives. On April 24, 1882 he authorized formation of the 1st Company of Arizona Rangers in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] making John H. Jackson its Captain.  They were to be similar to Texas Rangers and combat [[outlaw]]s and hostile Indians.  His first assignment to the Rangers was to scout near the border of the territory for Indians, and for those who recently killed a teamster there.  The Rangers Captain was only able to pay the first months wages, and the Governor despite his best efforts was never able to get them funded by the Territorial Legislature or Congress. On May 20, he wrote Johnston informing them they should continue until the end of the month when their pay ran out.  Following the [[Earp Vendetta Ride]] and the departure of the Earps lawlessness in the area seems to have quieted.<ref>Wagoner, Jay J., '''Arizona Territory 1863\u20131912: A Political history''', Tucson: University of Arizona Press, (1970). {{ISBN|0-8165-0176-9}}.pp. 194-200</ref>\n\nThe analogous agency in the [[Territory of New Mexico]], organized in 1905, was called the [[New Mexico Mounted Patrol]]. Across the Mexican border in northern [[Sonora]] was a similar law enforcement agency called the [[Guardia Rural]], colloquially known as the [[rurales]]. This group is often confused with another group often referred to with the same colloquialism, the Guardia Fiscal, which was commanded by a Russian, Colonel [[Emilio Kosterlitzky]], who cooperated closely with the Rangers.<ref>Vanderwood, P.

A founding queen searches for a hollow tree, wall cavity, rock crevice, or even a mammal-made hole to build a nest. One colony cycle lasts for about 6\u201311 months and each colony cycle consists of around 3000\u20138000 larvae.\n\nThe extraordinary adaptation skills of ''V. vulgaris'' enable it to live in a wide range of habitats, from very humid areas to artificial environments such as gardens and human structures. This species, along with other wasp species such as ''V. germanica'', has impacted the ecosystem, especially those in New Zealand and Australia, where they were imported by humans, and frequently cause damage to fruit crops and endanger humans.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |url= |title=Variation in colour marking of German Wasps ''Vespula germanica'' (F.) and Common Wasps ''Vespula vulgaris'' (L.)

This species has many synonyms such as the \"common wasp\", \"European wasp\", ''Paravespula vulgaris'', or the \"common yellow jacket\".<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web |title=Vespular vulgaris |url=http://eol.org/pages/1032844/overview|website=Encyclopedia of Life |accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> However, a study from 2010 revealed that ''V. vulgaris'' and the American common yellow jacket are actually two different species, the latter now known as ''[[Vespula alascensis|V. alascensis]]''.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/> It is closely related to another wasp species, ''[[Vespula austriaca|V. austriaca]]'', and is considered a sister group.<ref name= \"Carpenter\">{{Cite journal |url= |title=Phylogenetic relationships and classification of the Vespinae (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|last=Carpenter |first=J.

It has [[aposematic]] colors of black and yellow; yellow pronotal bands which are almost parallel to each other and black dots and rings on its abdomen. The queens and females appear very similar to ''[[Vespula germanica]]''), except when they are seen head on, as the ''V. vulgaris'' face lacks the three black dots of ''V. germanica''. Instead, each has only one black mark on its [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|''clypeus'']], which is usually anchor or dagger-shaped. However, identification of this species may be difficult because the black mark on its ''clypeus'' can sometimes appear broken, making it again look similar to ''V. germanica''.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nStill more difficult to distinguish between species are the males. Almost undetectable with the naked eye, the only confident identification of ''V. vulgaris'' males is to seek the distinct ''[[aedeagus]]'' tip shapes and lateral processes of their [[genitalia]].<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''V. vulgaris'' is a [[Palearctic]] species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/> It was discovered in a wide range of countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, India, and China. It is invasive in New Zealand and Australia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Until 2010, it was thought to be in North America as well, but molecular and morphological data showed that specimens identified as ''V. vulgaris'' in North America were ''Vespula alascensis'', which had previously been considered a taxonomic synonym, but is now considered a separate species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' has high adaptation skills for environments. It flourishes in most types of habitats, including prairie, grassland, natural and planted forests, shrub lands, and even in urban zones such as gardens, orchards, and buildings. However, it does require the temperature to be moderately warm, because its [[foraging]] activity is temperature-dependent (above 2 \u00b0C).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Northern Hemisphere colony cycle==\nFive distinguishable stages occur in ''V. vulgaris'' colony cycle in the temperate parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Each lasts for similar periods, around 30\u201335 days. The colony starts in April as the queen begins the foundation of the nest and degenerates around October when the temperature drops and the queen dies. The size of the colony ranges from 3000 [[larvae]] up to a maximum of 8000 larvae, with the queen producing around 200\u2013300 eggs per day for 24 days.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite book |last1=Potter |first1=N.B. |title=A Study of the Biology of the Common Wasp, ''Vespula vulgaris'' L., with Special Reference to the Foraging Behavior |date=1964 |publisher=University of Bristol |location=Bristol |pages=5\u201360}}</ref>\n\n*Stage 1 \u2013 solitary stage: the queen builds the nest, provisions the cells and rears the first brood of workers.\n*Stage 2 \u2013 rapid increase: the workers replace the queen as the foraging force. The queen is now a nurse and egg producer. There is very rapid buildup of worker population.\n*Stage 3 \u2013 slow increase: the rate of population growth is not as rapid as in stage 2.\n*Stage 4 \u2013 climax of colony: worker population no longer increases. Cells built are all queen cells. Males emerge, and foraging rate per worker increases.\n*Stage 5 \u2013 decline: probably caused by death or sickness of queen. Colony cohesion breaks down, cannibalism sets in, and the foraging becomes erratic.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Brood production==\nThe general incubation period is five days, but it can occasionally be seven, due to [[cannibalism]], [[scavenging]] or replacement. The larval period can depend on the trophic condition inside and outside the nest. If there are abundant resources of food being brought into the nest, the larval period is short, but if the resource is short, the period can lengthen. The first adult emerges after around 23 days of hatching and the queen-pupated brood is completed in about a month (30 days).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe first brood of workers are all of normal size, but the next generation of them is generally smaller, due to a decrease in the queen's foraging activity after producing the first batch of larvae. As the queen's foraging decreases, the second group of workers does not get so much food, often starves, and so spends more time in the larval stage.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Nest foundation by the queen==\nAfter coming out of hibernation in the spring, the queen forages for flowers or shrubs and begins looking for nesting sites. She flies low on the ground, searching for any round, dark object or depression. If it is a hole, she flies in to inspect the details if it is suitable and if not moves on to the next hole. What constitutes a \"perfect\" nest is yet to be discovered, but it is mainly speculated that the queen's physiological state is the main deciding factor of the time and the place of nesting. When she has found a suitable site for nesting, she performs dance-like wing movements which allow her to locate the site even after she has left the area.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |last1=M.

She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a [[wikt:spindle|spindle]] and flying back out to bring in more pulp. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her [[anterior]] legs and mouth parts.<ref name=\":5\" /> She builds 20\u201330 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a [[Petiole (insect)|petiole]] and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.<ref name=\"TeAra\" />\n\nWhen the nest is completed, the queen is replaced by the workers as the foraging force and instead is now concerned only with nursing and egg producing. Her ovaries develop, her abdomen becomes distended with eggs, and she loses the ability to fly.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter the founding phase has been completed, the colony encounters a change where the workers begin to build queen cells. Once the workers start building on the queen cells, no more worker cells are built, but those that still have brood growing in them are retained. The majority of the food resource brought in by the workers is fed to the queen larvae, known as [[gynes]] and the lack of feeding for other larvae causes the prolongation of their larval periods.<ref name=\":6\" /> To ensure that only the queen's eggs are reared to adulthood, female workers remove worker-laid eggs in a process known as [[worker policing]].\n\nWhen the queen has completed her job of producing daughter queen larvae, she dies, leaving a crop of virgin queens which will leave the nest, mate, hibernate, and reproduce in the following spring. After the queen's death, the coordination of the colony breaks down and the workers begin to lay eggs. The rate and amount of foraging decrease drastically after the queen's death, so it is unable to support all the workers and their brood. This is when [[cannibalism]] occurs among the workers and furthermore, the workers tear off their cells and carry them out of the nest, dropping the temperature of the entire nest. Once this stage is reached, the remaining workers die of cold or starvation.<ref name=\":11\">{{cite journal |last1=R. J. |first1=Harris |last2=J.

The wasps produce a chemical which repels ants and secrete it around the base of the petiole, to avoid ant predation.<ref name=\"doc\" />\n\nMany variations are seen in the characteristics of the nests within the species. Aerial nests and nests that are very close to the surface of the ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. The wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal |last1=R. |first1=Sailer |title=Nest temperature in the common yellow-jacket |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society |date=1950 |volume=23 |pages=134\u2013137}}</ref>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' wasps recognize their nests by making [[pheromone]] trails from the entrance of their nest to the site of foraging.

This difference is due mainly to the variation in prey. ''Vespula vulgaris'' food sources are greatly affected by the temperature, while those of ''Vespula germanica'' are not, providing them with a much higher chance of survival even during the winter.<ref name=\":7\" /> Because many ''Vespula germanica'' are able to overwinter and most ''Vespula vulgaris'' do not, except for the queen, this affects the nest size of the two species. ''Vespula germanica'' generally have slightly bigger nest size (3500\u20139000 larvae in one colony cycle) than ''Vespula vulgaris'' (3000\u20138000 larvae in one colony cycle).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=B.

She flies frontwards and backwards in front of the nest with a slow, hovering flight and repeats this movement until its distance is further away from the hole. When the arc of the flight increases up to about 6 ft (183 cm), the pathway makes a figure of a sideways \"8\" and when the queen is about 60 ft (18 m) away from the nest site, she then flies in a straight line. This is how the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' marks the land, in respect to the landmarks around the nesting site.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Defensive behaviors===\nOnly wasps leaving the nest notice a disturbance and defend or fight off an intruder. The ones returning to the nest do not detect any disturbance and try to enter the nest. The workers that detect danger show a certain gesture \u2013 they rise onto the tips of their [[Arthropod leg#Tarsus|tarsi]], put forward their heads, turn down their abdomens and constantly vibrate their wings in high frequencies and short beats. This behavior signals other workers to fly to the entrance of the nest and defend. However, if the nest is disturbed enough times, the workers stop defending the nest and instead grow tolerant to such attacks.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, when they detect life-threatening level of danger, the ''Vespula vulgaris'' workers will vigorously defend their nest. Unlike honey bees, which die after stinging, ''Vespula vulgaris'' can sting multiple times. This makes its sting viable for personal defense when away from the colony, and the common wasp is therefore more apt to sting. However, it will usually not sting without being provoked by sudden movement or other violent behavior.\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":8\" /> ''Vespula vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with [[honey bees]] for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island black beech forests.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===Over-wintering behaviors===\nAfter mating, the queen overwinters in a hole or other sheltered location, sometimes in buildings. Wasp nests are not reused from one year to the next, but in rare instances wasps have been seen to re-nest in the footprint of a removed nest or even begin building a new nest within an old nest. In the mild climate of New Zealand and Australia, a few of the colonies may survive the winter, although this is much more common with the [[German wasp]].<ref name=\"doc\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==Factors affecting foraging==\nThe foraging activity of ''Vespula vulgaris'' is dependent on the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2\u00b0 C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2\u00b0 C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be \u2013 i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blackith |first1=R. E. |title=Visual sensitivity and foraging in social wasps |journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1007/bf02224066 |year=1958}}</ref>\n\nThe foraging activities of ''Vespula vulgaris'' are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is to satisfy the larval requirements. The workers fly off early in the morning to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because [[dew]]s and [[nectar]]s are most abundant early in the morning and are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGenerally, wasps are unable to predict heavy rainfalls. They continue their foraging activities even in the rain, but cease when the rain becomes torrential. When the rainfall becomes extremely heavy near the nesting site, the workers rapidly return to their nests. Those whose foraging activities were interrupted by heavy rainfall become reluctant to forage again in the future, even when the weather is dry and calm. Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid.\n\nThe average life span of an adult ''Vespula vulgaris'' is known to be around two weeks (14 days). There was a negative correlation found between the age of the worker ''Vespula vulgaris'' and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older. Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and spend all of their time guarding the entrance of the nest.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Diet==\nSimilarly to other ''Vespulas'', ''Vespula vulgaris'' feed on animal preys such as caterpillars to feed their developing larvae and [[carbohydrate]]s, such as nectar and sweet fruits, to satisfy their own energy requirements.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal |last1=Spradbery |first1=J. P. |title=Wasps: an account of the biology and natural history of solitary and social wasps |journal=London, Sidgwick & Jackson |date=1973 |page=508}}</ref> Their usual food sources are: wood pulp, freshly killed insects such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[lepidopteran]] larvae and [[Diptera]] and Spiders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Harris |title=Diet of the Wasps Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica in Honeydew Beech Forest of the South Island, New Zealand |journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology |date=1991 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1080/03014223.1991.10757963}}</ref> Common wasps will also attempt to invade honey bees' nests to steal their honey.\n\nAlthough the types of prey ''Vespula vulgaris'' and ''Vespula germanica'' forage are almost the same, that of ''Vespula germanica'' are generally 2\u20133.5 times bigger and heavier than that of ''Vespula vulgaris''. This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the ''Vespula germanica'' foragers are bigger in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] than those of ''Vespula vulgaris'', and they both transport the prey by carrying on them, it would be advantageous for the wasp to be bigger to be able to hold larger prey.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Caste system==\nIn the early stage of the colony founding, the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' does most of the work, both building and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during the very beginning of the hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage and take care of the broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Queen==\nOne possible factor that determines a female's social caste is known to be its nest position. The location of each cell is directly related to the amount of food a larva can receive, and the queen cell, being located at the very bottom of the nest, encounters the foragers before any other cell. Therefore, it gets most of the food and naturally, yields the biggest female \u2013 the queen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs mentioned above, the cell location can alter the size of the larva and eventually determine which female ''Vespula vulgaris'' is going to be queen. However, when several candidates of queens arise, there is competition among them. Certain variations among them rank the [[hierarchy]] of the queens and thus select the ultimate queen. Although the precise causes of the variations in the queens are still unknown, one possible factor is the amount of fat stored in the queen's body. Smaller developing queens have less fat stored, and thus have relatively higher mortality rates in winter than larger queens.

A founding queen searches for a hollow tree, wall cavity, rock crevice, or even a mammal-made hole to build a nest. One colony cycle lasts for about 6\u201311 months and each colony cycle consists of around 3000\u20138000 larvae.\n\nThe extraordinary adaptation skills of ''V. vulgaris'' enable it to live in a wide range of habitats, from very humid areas to artificial environments such as gardens and human structures. This species, along with other wasp species such as ''V. germanica'', has impacted the ecosystem, especially those in New Zealand and Australia, where they were imported by humans, and frequently cause damage to fruit crops and endanger humans.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |url= |title=Variation in colour marking of German Wasps ''Vespula germanica'' (F.) and Common Wasps ''Vespula vulgaris'' (L.)

It has [[aposematic]] colors of black and yellow; yellow pronotal bands which are almost parallel to each other and black dots and rings on its abdomen. The queens and females appear very similar to ''[[Vespula germanica]]''), except when they are seen head on, as the ''V. vulgaris'' face lacks the three black dots of ''V. germanica''. Instead, each has only one black mark on its [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|''clypeus'']], which is usually anchor or dagger-shaped. However, identification of this species may be difficult because the black mark on its ''clypeus'' can sometimes appear broken, making it again look similar to ''V. germanica''.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nStill more difficult to distinguish between species are the males. Almost undetectable with the naked eye, the only confident identification of ''V. vulgaris'' males is to seek the distinct ''[[aedeagus]]'' tip shapes and lateral processes of their [[genitalia]].<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''V. vulgaris'' is a [[Palearctic]] species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/> It was discovered in a wide range of countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, India, and China. It is invasive in New Zealand and Australia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Until 2010, it was thought to be in North America as well, but molecular and morphological data showed that specimens identified as ''V. vulgaris'' in North America were ''Vespula alascensis'', which had previously been considered a taxonomic synonym, but is now considered a separate species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' has high adaptation skills for environments. It flourishes in most types of habitats, including prairie, grassland, natural and planted forests, shrub lands, and even in urban zones such as gardens, orchards, and buildings. However, it does require the temperature to be moderately warm, because its [[foraging]] activity is temperature-dependent (above 2 \u00b0C).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Northern Hemisphere colony cycle==\nFive distinguishable stages occur in ''V. vulgaris'' colony cycle in the temperate parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Each lasts for similar periods, around 30\u201335 days. The colony starts in April as the queen begins the foundation of the nest and degenerates around October when the temperature drops and the queen dies. The size of the colony ranges from 3000 [[larvae]] up to a maximum of 8000 larvae, with the queen producing around 200\u2013300 eggs per day for 24 days.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite book |last1=Potter |first1=N.B. |title=A Study of the Biology of the Common Wasp, ''Vespula vulgaris'' L., with Special Reference to the Foraging Behavior |date=1964 |publisher=University of Bristol |location=Bristol |pages=5\u201360}}</ref>\n\n*Stage 1 \u2013 solitary stage: the queen builds the nest, provisions the cells and rears the first brood of workers.\n*Stage 2 \u2013 rapid increase: the workers replace the queen as the foraging force. The queen is now a nurse and egg producer. There is very rapid buildup of worker population.\n*Stage 3 \u2013 slow increase: the rate of population growth is not as rapid as in stage 2.\n*Stage 4 \u2013 climax of colony: worker population no longer increases. Cells built are all queen cells. Males emerge, and foraging rate per worker increases.\n*Stage 5 \u2013 decline: probably caused by death or sickness of queen. Colony cohesion breaks down, cannibalism sets in, and the foraging becomes erratic.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Brood production==\nThe general incubation period is five days, but it can occasionally be seven, due to [[cannibalism]], [[scavenging]] or replacement. The larval period can depend on the trophic condition inside and outside the nest. If there are abundant resources of food being brought into the nest, the larval period is short, but if the resource is short, the period can lengthen. The first adult emerges after around 23 days of hatching and the queen-pupated brood is completed in about a month (30 days).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe first brood of workers are all of normal size, but the next generation of them is generally smaller, due to a decrease in the queen's foraging activity after producing the first batch of larvae. As the queen's foraging decreases, the second group of workers does not get so much food, often starves, and so spends more time in the larval stage.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Nest foundation by the queen==\nAfter coming out of hibernation in the spring, the queen forages for flowers or shrubs and begins looking for nesting sites. She flies low on the ground, searching for any round, dark object or depression. If it is a hole, she flies in to inspect the details if it is suitable and if not moves on to the next hole. What constitutes a \"perfect\" nest is yet to be discovered, but it is mainly speculated that the queen's physiological state is the main deciding factor of the time and the place of nesting. When she has found a suitable site for nesting, she performs dance-like wing movements which allow her to locate the site even after she has left the area.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |last1=M.

She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a [[wikt:spindle|spindle]] and flying back out to bring in more pulp. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her [[anterior]] legs and mouth parts.<ref name=\":5\" /> She builds 20\u201330 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a [[Petiole (insect)|petiole]] and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.<ref name=\"TeAra\" />\n\nWhen the nest is completed, the queen is replaced by the workers as the foraging force and instead is now concerned only with nursing and egg producing. Her ovaries develop, her abdomen becomes distended with eggs, and she loses the ability to fly.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter the founding phase has been completed, the colony encounters a change where the workers begin to build queen cells. Once the workers start building on the queen cells, no more worker cells are built, but those that still have brood growing in them are retained. The majority of the food resource brought in by the workers is fed to the queen larvae, known as [[gynes]] and the lack of feeding for other larvae causes the prolongation of their larval periods.<ref name=\":6\" /> To ensure that only the queen's eggs are reared to adulthood, female workers remove worker-laid eggs in a process known as [[worker policing]].\n\nWhen the queen has completed her job of producing daughter queen larvae, she dies, leaving a crop of virgin queens which will leave the nest, mate, hibernate, and reproduce in the following spring. After the queen's death, the coordination of the colony breaks down and the workers begin to lay eggs. The rate and amount of foraging decrease drastically after the queen's death, so it is unable to support all the workers and their brood. This is when [[cannibalism]] occurs among the workers and furthermore, the workers tear off their cells and carry them out of the nest, dropping the temperature of the entire nest. Once this stage is reached, the remaining workers die of cold or starvation.<ref name=\":11\">{{cite journal |last1=R. J. |first1=Harris |last2=J.

Aerial nests and nests that are very close to the surface of the ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. The wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal |last1=R. |first1=Sailer |title=Nest temperature in the common yellow-jacket |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society |date=1950 |volume=23 |pages=134\u2013137}}</ref>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' wasps recognize their nests by making [[pheromone]] trails from the entrance of their nest to the site of foraging.

She flies frontwards and backwards in front of the nest with a slow, hovering flight and repeats this movement until its distance is further away from the hole. When the arc of the flight increases up to about 6 ft (183 cm), the pathway makes a figure of a sideways \"8\" and when the queen is about 60 ft (18 m) away from the nest site, she then flies in a straight line. This is how the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' marks the land, in respect to the landmarks around the nesting site.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Defensive behaviors===\nOnly wasps leaving the nest notice a disturbance and defend or fight off an intruder. The ones returning to the nest do not detect any disturbance and try to enter the nest. The workers that detect danger show a certain gesture \u2013 they rise onto the tips of their [[Arthropod leg#Tarsus|tarsi]], put forward their heads, turn down their abdomens and constantly vibrate their wings in high frequencies and short beats. This behavior signals other workers to fly to the entrance of the nest and defend. However, if the nest is disturbed enough times, the workers stop defending the nest and instead grow tolerant to such attacks.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, when they detect life-threatening level of danger, the ''Vespula vulgaris'' workers will vigorously defend their nest. Unlike honey bees, which die after stinging, ''Vespula vulgaris'' can sting multiple times. This makes its sting viable for personal defense when away from the colony, and the common wasp is therefore more apt to sting. However, it will usually not sting without being provoked by sudden movement or other violent behavior.\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":8\" /> ''Vespula vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with [[honey bees]] for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island black beech forests.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===Over-wintering behaviors===\nAfter mating, the queen overwinters in a hole or other sheltered location, sometimes in buildings. Wasp nests are not reused from one year to the next, but in rare instances wasps have been seen to re-nest in the footprint of a removed nest or even begin building a new nest within an old nest. In the mild climate of New Zealand and Australia, a few of the colonies may survive the winter, although this is much more common with the [[German wasp]].<ref name=\"doc\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==Factors affecting foraging==\nThe foraging activity of ''Vespula vulgaris'' is dependent on the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2\u00b0 C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2\u00b0 C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be \u2013 i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blackith |first1=R. E. |title=Visual sensitivity and foraging in social wasps |journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1007/bf02224066 |year=1958}}</ref>\n\nThe foraging activities of ''Vespula vulgaris'' are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is to satisfy the larval requirements. The workers fly off early in the morning to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because [[dew]]s and [[nectar]]s are most abundant early in the morning and are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGenerally, wasps are unable to predict heavy rainfalls. They continue their foraging activities even in the rain, but cease when the rain becomes torrential. When the rainfall becomes extremely heavy near the nesting site, the workers rapidly return to their nests. Those whose foraging activities were interrupted by heavy rainfall become reluctant to forage again in the future, even when the weather is dry and calm. Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid.\n\nThe average life span of an adult ''Vespula vulgaris'' is known to be around two weeks (14 days). There was a negative correlation found between the age of the worker ''Vespula vulgaris'' and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older. Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and spend all of their time guarding the entrance of the nest.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Diet==\nSimilarly to other ''Vespulas'', ''Vespula vulgaris'' feed on animal preys such as caterpillars to feed their developing larvae and [[carbohydrate]]s, such as nectar and sweet fruits, to satisfy their own energy requirements.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal |last1=Spradbery |first1=J. P. |title=Wasps: an account of the biology and natural history of solitary and social wasps |journal=London, Sidgwick & Jackson |date=1973 |page=508}}</ref> Their usual food sources are: wood pulp, freshly killed insects such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[lepidopteran]] larvae and [[Diptera]] and Spiders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Harris |title=Diet of the Wasps Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica in Honeydew Beech Forest of the South Island, New Zealand |journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology |date=1991 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1080/03014223.1991.10757963}}</ref> Common wasps will also attempt to invade honey bees' nests to steal their honey.\n\nAlthough the types of prey ''Vespula vulgaris'' and ''Vespula germanica'' forage are almost the same, that of ''Vespula germanica'' are generally 2\u20133.5 times bigger and heavier than that of ''Vespula vulgaris''. This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the ''Vespula germanica'' foragers are bigger in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] than those of ''Vespula vulgaris'', and they both transport the prey by carrying on them, it would be advantageous for the wasp to be bigger to be able to hold larger prey.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Caste system==\nIn the early stage of the colony founding, the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' does most of the work, both building and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during the very beginning of the hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage and take care of the broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Queen==\nOne possible factor that determines a female's social caste is known to be its nest position. The location of each cell is directly related to the amount of food a larva can receive, and the queen cell, being located at the very bottom of the nest, encounters the foragers before any other cell. Therefore, it gets most of the food and naturally, yields the biggest female \u2013 the queen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs mentioned above, the cell location can alter the size of the larva and eventually determine which female ''Vespula vulgaris'' is going to be queen. However, when several candidates of queens arise, there is competition among them. Certain variations among them rank the [[hierarchy]] of the queens and thus select the ultimate queen. Although the precise causes of the variations in the queens are still unknown, one possible factor is the amount of fat stored in the queen's body. Smaller developing queens have less fat stored, and thus have relatively higher mortality rates in winter than larger queens. The bigger the size and larger the amount of fat stored, the \"higher\" the queen is considered in quality, and she is able to out-compete other queens in finding a fit mate. She will then have an advantage in establishing a nest in the following spring.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nIn order for the ''Vespula vulgaris'' queen to dominate all the workers \u2013 usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony  \u2013she possesses a special chemical that sends signals of dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne [[pheromone]] from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Pest status==\nAlong with the German wasp and three species of ''[[Polistes]]'' (all [[invasive species]]), the common wasp is considered a pest species in New Zealand, as it directly predates native insects and competes with [[Endemism|endemic]] species for food, such as insects and [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.envbop.govt.nz/Factsheets/PestAnimal-090526-PA03.pdf |date=November 2004 |publisher=[[Environment Bay of Plenty]] |title=Wasps |work=Pest Animal Control}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The vulgar wasp: the story of a ruthless invader and ingenious predator |last=Lester, Phil, 1969-|isbn=9781776561858 |location=Wellington |oclc=1031341683|date = April 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" /> In some [[South Island]] beech forests it is thought that densities of wasps are higher than anywhere else in the world.<ref name=doc>{{cite web |title=Vespula Wasp Factsheet |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803073040/http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 August 2012 |publisher=Department of Conservation |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> It is calculated that the total weight of common wasps in these places may exceed that of all birds.<ref name=TeAra>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Story: Wasps and bees |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wasps-and-bees/3 |encyclopedia=Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" />\n\nResearch indicates that vespula wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |pmid=16158272 |year=2005 |last1=Steinmetz |first1=I |last2=Schmolz |first2=E |title=Nest odor dynamics in the social wasp Vespula vulgaris |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=414\u20138 |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0006-9 |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|bibcode=2005NW.....92..414S}}</ref> ''V. vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with honey bees for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island [[black beech]] forests.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite journal |last=Markwell |first=T.

{"title_page": "Free indirect speech", "text_new": "'''Free indirect speech''' is a style of [[Third-person narrative|third-person narration]] which uses some of the characteristics of third-person along with the essence of [[Grammatical person|first-person]] direct speech; it is also referred to as '''free indirect discourse''', '''free indirect style''', or, in [[French language|French]], '''''discours indirect libre'''''.\n\nFree indirect discourse can be described as a \"technique of presenting a character's voice partly mediated by the voice of the author\" (or, reversing the emphasis, \"that the character speaks through the voice of the narrator\") with the voices effectively merged.<ref name=Modernist/>  This effect is partially accomplished by eliding direct speech attributions, such as \"he said\" or \"she said\". \n\nThe following is an example of sentences using direct, indirect and free indirect speech:\n* '''Quoted''' or '''[[direct speech]]''': ''He laid down his bundle and thought of his misfortune. \"And just what pleasure have I found, since I came into this world?\" he asked.''\n* '''Reported''' or normal '''[[indirect speech]]''': ''He laid down his bundle and thought of his misfortune. He asked himself what pleasure he had found since he came into the world.''\n* '''Free indirect speech''': ''He laid down his bundle and thought of his misfortune. And just what pleasure had he found, since he came into this world?''\n\nAccording to British philologist Roy Pascal, [[Goethe]] and [[Jane Austen]] were the first novelists to use this style consistently<ref name=Pascal77/> and 19th-century French novelist [[Flaubert]] was the first to be aware of it as a style.\n\n== Naming ==\nRandall Stevenson suggests that the term free indirect discourse \"is perhaps best reserved for instances where words have actually been spoken aloud\" and that cases \"where a character's voice is probably the silent inward one of thought\" should be described as free indirect style.<ref>''Modernistic Fiction: An Introduction''. Lexington: University of Kentucky, 1992, p.12.</ref>\n\n==Comparison of styles ==\nWhat distinguishes free indirect speech from normal indirect speech is the lack of an introductory expression such as \"he said\" or \"he thought\". It is as if the [[subordinate clause]] carrying the content of the indirect speech were taken out of the [[main clause]] which contains it, becoming the [[main clause]] itself. Using free indirect speech may convey the character's words more directly than in normal indirect, as devices such as interjections and psycho-ostensive expressions like curses and swearwords can be used that cannot be normally used within a subordinate clause. Deictic pronouns and adverbials refer to the coordinates of the originator of the speech or thought, not of the narrator.\n\nFree indirect discourse can also be described as a \"technique of presenting a character's voice partly mediated by the voice of the author\", or, in the words of the French narrative theorist [[G\u00e9rard Genette]], \"the narrator takes on the speech of the character, or, if one prefers, the character speaks through the voice of the narrator, and the two instances then are ''merged''\".<ref name=Modernist>Randell Stevenson, ''Modernist Fiction: An Introduction'', p.32.</ref>\n\n==Use in literature==\nRoy Pascal cites [[Goethe]] and [[Jane Austen]] as the first novelists to use this style consistently.<ref name=Pascal77>Roy Pascal, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=nBgNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA31&dq=free+indirect+speech&hl=en&ei=gEshTaTwDo-WsgPlv8WOCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false The Dual Voice]\", Manchester University Press, 1977, page 34</ref>\nHe says the nineteenth century French novelist [[Flaubert]] was the first to be aware of it as a style.  This style would be widely imitated by later authors, called in [[French language|French]] ''discours indirect libre''. It is also known as ''estilo indirecto libre'' in Spanish, and is often used by Latin American writer [[Horacio Quiroga]].\n\nIn [[German literature]], the style, known as ''erlebte Rede'' (experienced speech), is perhaps most famous in the works of [[Franz Kafka]], blurring the subject's first-person experiences with a grammatically third-person narrative perspective.\n\nIn [[Danish literature]], the style is attested since [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt|Leonora Christina]] (1621\u20131698) (and is, outside literature, even today common in colloquial Danish speech).\n\n===English, Irish and Scottish literature===\nAs stated above, Austen was one of its first practitioners. The Irish author [[James Joyce]] also used free indirect speech in works such as \"The Dead\" (in ''[[Dubliners]]''), ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', and ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. \nScottish author [[James Kelman]] uses the style extensively, most notably in his [[Booker Prize]] winning novel ''[[How Late It Was, How Late]]'', but also in many of his short stories and some of his novels, most of which are written in [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian speech patterns]]. [[Virginia Woolf]] in her novels ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' and ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' frequently relies on free indirect discourse to take us into the minds of her characters. Another [[modernist]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], also makes frequent use of a free indirect style in \"transcribing unspoken or even incompletely verbalized thoughts\". Woolf most often uses free indirect speech, a literary technique that describes the interior thoughts of the characters using third-person singular pronoun ('he' and 'she'. in both ''[[The Rainbow]]'' and ''[[Women in Love]]''.<ref>''Modernistic Fiction: An Introduction'', p.32.</ref> According to Charles Rzepka of Boston University, [[Elmore Leonard]]'s mastery of free indirect discourse \"is unsurpassed in our time, and among the surest of all time, even if we include [[Jane Austen]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], and [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] in the mix.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last = Rzepka| first = Charles|title = ''Being Cool: The Work of Elmore Leonard''|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year= 2013|location= Baltimore| page= [https://archive.org/details/beingcoolworkofe0000rzep/page/21 21]|url=https://archive.org/details/beingcoolworkofe0000rzep|url-access = registration}}</ref>\n\nSome argue that free indirect discourse was also used by [[Chaucer]] in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.<ref>E.g. Helen Phillips, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3G3qdbmqVjgC&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=%22free+indirect+discourse%22+monk An introduction to the Canterbury tales]'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2000</ref> When the narrator says in \"The [[General Prologue]]\" that he agrees with the Monk's opinion dismissing criticism of his very unmonastic way of life, he is apparently paraphrasing the monk himself:\n\n:And I [[wikt:said|seyde]] his opinion was good:\n:What! Sholde he studie, and make himselven [[wikt:wood#Adjective 2|wood]],\n:Upon a book in [[cloister|cloistre]] alwey to [[wikt:pore#Verb|poure]]?\n:Or [[wikt:swink|swinken]] with his handes, and laboure,\n:As [[Augustine of Hippo|Austin]] [[wikt:bid#Verb|bit]]? How shal the world be served?\n:Lat Austin have his swink to him reserved!\n\nThese [[rhetorical question]]s may be regarded as the monk's own casual way of waving off criticism of his aristocratic lifestyle. Similar examples can be found in the narrator's portrait of the friar.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Dorrit Cohn|Cohn, Dorrit]], ''Transparent Minds''\n*{{cite web|last=Gingerich|first=Jon|title=The Benefits of Free Indirect Discourse|url=http://litreactor.com/columns/the-benefits-of-free-indirect-discourse|publisher=LitReactor|accessdate=3 April 2013}}\n*[[Hartmut Haberland|Haberland, Hartmut]], Indirect speech in Danish.

It is as if the [[subordinate clause]] carrying the content of the indirect speech were taken out of the [[main clause]] which contains it, becoming the [[main clause]] itself. Using free indirect speech may convey the character's words more directly than in normal indirect, as devices such as interjections and psycho-ostensive expressions like curses and swearwords can be used that cannot be normally used within a subordinate clause. Deictic pronouns and adverbials refer to the coordinates of the originator of the speech or thought, not of the narrator.\n\nFree indirect discourse can also be described as a \"technique of presenting a character's voice partly mediated by the voice of the author\", or, in the words of the French narrative theorist [[G\u00e9rard Genette]], \"the narrator takes on the speech of the character, or, if one prefers, the character speaks through the voice of the narrator, and the two instances then are ''merged''\".<ref name=Modernist>Randell Stevenson, ''Modernist Fiction: An Introduction'', p.32.</ref>\n\n==Use in literature==\nRoy Pascal cites [[Goethe]] and [[Jane Austen]] as the first novelists to use this style consistently.<ref name=Pascal77>Roy Pascal, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=nBgNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA31&dq=free+indirect+speech&hl=en&ei=gEshTaTwDo-WsgPlv8WOCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false The Dual Voice]\", Manchester University Press, 1977, page 34</ref>\nHe says the nineteenth century French novelist [[Flaubert]] was the first to be aware of it as a style.  This style would be widely imitated by later authors, called in [[French language|French]] ''discours indirect libre''. It is also known as ''estilo indirecto libre'' in Spanish, and is often used by Latin American writer [[Horacio Quiroga]].\n\nIn [[German literature]], the style, known as ''erlebte Rede'' (experienced speech), is perhaps most famous in the works of [[Franz Kafka]], blurring the subject's first-person experiences with a grammatically third-person narrative perspective.\n\nIn [[Danish literature]], the style is attested since [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt|Leonora Christina]] (1621\u20131698) (and is, outside literature, even today common in colloquial Danish speech).\n\n===English, Irish and Scottish literature===\nAs stated above, Austen was one of its first practitioners. The Irish author [[James Joyce]] also used free indirect speech in works such as \"The Dead\" (in ''[[Dubliners]]''), ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'', and ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. \nScottish author [[James Kelman]] uses the style extensively, most notably in his [[Booker Prize]] winning novel ''[[How Late It Was, How Late]]'', but also in many of his short stories and some of his novels, most of which are written in [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian speech patterns]]. [[Virginia Woolf]] in her novels ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' and ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' frequently relies on free indirect discourse to take us into the minds of her characters. Another [[modernist]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], also makes frequent use of a free indirect style in \"transcribing unspoken or even incompletely verbalized thoughts\". Woolf most often usses free indirect speech, a literary technique that describes the interior thoughts of the characters using third-person singular pronoum ('he' and 'she'. in both ''[[The Rainbow]]'' and ''[[Women in Love]]''.<ref>''Modernistic Fiction: An Introduction'', p.32.</ref> According to Charles Rzepka of Boston University, [[Elmore Leonard]]'s mastery of free indirect discourse \"is unsurpassed in our time, and among the surest of all time, even if we include [[Jane Austen]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], and [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]] in the mix.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last = Rzepka| first = Charles|title = ''Being Cool: The Work of Elmore Leonard''|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year= 2013|location= Baltimore| page= [https://archive.org/details/beingcoolworkofe0000rzep/page/21 21]|url=https://archive.org/details/beingcoolworkofe0000rzep|url-access = registration}}</ref>\n\nSome argue that free indirect discourse was also used by [[Chaucer]] in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.<ref>E.g. Helen Phillips, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3G3qdbmqVjgC&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=%22free+indirect+discourse%22+monk An introduction to the Canterbury tales]'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2000</ref> When the narrator says in \"The [[General Prologue]]\" that he agrees with the Monk's opinion dismissing criticism of his very unmonastic way of life, he is apparently paraphrasing the monk himself:\n\n:And I [[wikt:said|seyde]] his opinion was good:\n:What! Sholde he studie, and make himselven [[wikt:wood#Adjective 2|wood]],\n:Upon a book in [[cloister|cloistre]] alwey to [[wikt:pore#Verb|poure]]?\n:Or [[wikt:swink|swinken]] with his handes, and laboure,\n:As [[Augustine of Hippo|Austin]] [[wikt:bid#Verb|bit]]? How shal the world be served?\n:Lat Austin have his swink to him reserved!\n\nThese [[rhetorical question]]s may be regarded as the monk's own casual way of waving off criticism of his aristocratic lifestyle. Similar examples can be found in the narrator's portrait of the friar.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Dorrit Cohn|Cohn, Dorrit]], ''Transparent Minds''\n*{{cite web|last=Gingerich|first=Jon|title=The Benefits of Free Indirect Discourse|url=http://litreactor.com/columns/the-benefits-of-free-indirect-discourse|publisher=LitReactor|accessdate=3 April 2013}}\n*[[Hartmut Haberland|Haberland, Hartmut]], Indirect speech in Danish.
