Muscles in the [[Lateral compartment of leg]]  also weakly participate, namely the [[Fibularis longus]] and [[Fibularis brevis]] muscles. Those in the lateral compartment only have weak participation in plantar flexion though. The range of motion for plantar flexion is usually indicated in the literature as 30\u00b0 to 40\u00b0, but sometimes also 50\u00b0. The nerves are primarily from the [[Sacral nerves|sacral]] spinal cord roots S1 and S2. Compression of S1 roots may result in weakness in plantarflexion; these nerves run from the lower back to the bottom of the foot. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n''[[:wikt:pronation|Pronation]]'' at the [[forearm]] is a rotational movement at the [[Proximal radioulnar articulation|radioulnar joint]], or of the [[foot]] at the [[subtalar joint|subtalar]] and [[talocalcaneonavicular joint]]s.<ref name=\"Kendall et al.\">{{cite book |last1=Kendall |first1=F.

This corresponds to a [[counterclockwise]] twist for the right forearm and a [[clockwise]] twist for the left (when viewed superiorly). In the forearm, this action is performed by [[pronator quadratus]] and [[pronator teres muscle]]. [[Brachioradialis]] puts the forearm into a midpronated/supinated position from either full pronation or supination. For the foot, pronation will cause the sole of the foot to face more laterally than when standing in the anatomical position.\n\nPronation of the foot is a compound movement that combines [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]], [[Eversion (kinesiology)|eversion]], and [[dorsiflexion]]. Regarding posture, a pronated foot is one in which the heel bone angles inward and the arch tends to collapse.  Pronation is the motion of the inner and outer ball of the foot with the heel bone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://realhealthynet.com/2012/07/foot-in-the-bottom-of-the-foot/foot-in-the-bottom-of-the-foot/ |title=Foot in the bottom of the foot \u2013 RealHealthyNet |publisher=Realhealthynet.com |date=July 11, 2012 |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719182112/http://realhealthynet.com/2012/07/foot-in-the-bottom-of-the-foot/foot-in-the-bottom-of-the-foot/# |archive-date=2013-07-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> One is said to be \"[[knock-kneed]]\" if one has overly pronated feet.

Muscles in the [[Lateral compartment of leg]]  also weakly participate, namely the [[Fibularis longus]] and [[Fibularis brevis]] muscles. Those in the lateral compartment only have weak participation in plantar flexion though. The range of motion for plantar flexion is usually indicated in the literature as 30\u00b0 to 40\u00b0, but sometimes also 50\u00b0. The nerves are primarily from the [[Sacral nerves|sacral]] spinal cord roots S1 and S2. Compression of S1 roots may result in weakness in plantarflexion; these nerves run from the lower back to the bottom of the foot. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n''[[:wikt:pronation|Pronation]]'' at the [[forearm]] is a rotational movement at the [[Proximal radioulnar articulation|radioulnar joint]], or of the [[foot]] at the [[subtalar joint|subtalar]] and [[talocalcaneonavicular joint]]s.<ref name=\"Kendall et al.\">{{cite book |last1=Kendall |first1=F.

This corresponds to a [[counterclockwise]] twist for the right forearm and a [[clockwise]] twist for the left (when viewed superiorly). In the forearm, this action is performed by [[pronator quadratus]] and [[pronator teres muscle]]. [[Brachioradialis]] puts the forearm into a midpronated/supinated position from either full pronation or supination. For the foot, pronation will cause the sole of the foot to face more laterally than when standing in the anatomical position.\n\nPronation of the foot is a compound movement that combines [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]], [[Eversion (kinesiology)|eversion]], and [[dorsiflexion]]. Regarding posture, a pronated foot is one in which the heel bone angles inward and the arch tends to collapse.  Pronation is the motion of the inner and outer ball of the foot with the heel bone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://realhealthynet.com/2012/07/foot-in-the-bottom-of-the-foot/foot-in-the-bottom-of-the-foot/ |title=Foot in the bottom of the foot \u2013 RealHealthyNet |publisher=Realhealthynet.com |date=July 11, 2012 |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719182112/http://realhealthynet.com/2012/07/foot-in-the-bottom-of-the-foot/foot-in-the-bottom-of-the-foot/# |archive-date=2013-07-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> One is said to be \"[[knock-kneed]]\" if one has overly pronated feet. It flattens the arch as the foot strikes the ground in order to absorb shock when the heel hits the ground, and to assist in balance during mid-stance.  If habits develop, this action can lead to foot pain as well as knee pain, [[shin splints]], [[achilles tendinitis]], posterior tibial tendinitis, [[piriformis syndrome]], and [[plantar fasciitis]].{{Citation needed|reason=this is the received wisdom in running, but a citation would be nice.|date=May 2011}}.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Human physiology]]\n[[Category:Lists of human anatomical features|Movements]]\n", "name_user": "J\u0101nis Barbans", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_movements_of_the_human_body"}

People can also become infected with [[respiratory disease]]s such as [[influenza]] or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes). The five critical moments during the day where washing hands with soap is important include: before and after [[defecation]], after cleaning a child's bottom or changing [[Diaper|nappies]], before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.<ref name=\":2\" />  If [[water]] and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with [[ash]].<ref name=\"hip.fhi360.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hip.fhi360.org/page/2644.html|title=The Hygiene Improvement Project (HIP) \u2013 Tippy-Tap: A simple low-cost technology for handwashing when water is scarce|website=USAID|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025004538/http://www.hip.fhi360.org/page/2644.html|archivedate=25 October 2014|accessdate=30 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMedical hand [[hygiene]] refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.

They found that:\n* The jet-air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of {{convert|180|m/s|km/h mi/h|abbr=on}}, was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 metres away.\n* Use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.\n* Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms.\n\nIn 2005, in a study conducted by T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.<ref>T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt GmbH Report No. 425-452006 [http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090410%20T%C3%9CV%20-%20Study%20of%20different%20methods%20used%20for%20drying%20hands%20Sept%202005.pdf A report concerning a study conducted with regard to the different methods used for drying hands; September 2005]</ref> The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity. Most are based on [[isopropyl alcohol]] or [[ethanol]] formulated together with a [[thickening agent]] such as [[Carbomer]] (polymer of [[acrylic acid]]) into a gel, or a [[humectant]] such as [[glycerin]] into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Menegueti|first=Mayra Gon\u00e7alves|last2=Laus|first2=Ana Maria|last3=Ciol|first3=M\u00e1rcia Aparecida|last4=Auxiliadora-Martins|first4=Maria|last5=Basile-Filho|first5=Anibal|last6=Gir|first6=Elucir|last7=Pires|first7=Daniela|last8=Pittet|first8=Didier|last9=Bellissimo-Rodrigues|first9=Fernando|date=2019-06-24|title=Glycerol content within the WHO ethanol-based handrub formulation: balancing tolerability with antimicrobial efficacy|journal=Antimicrobial Resistance & Infection Control|volume=8|issue=1|pages=109|doi=10.1186/s13756-019-0553-z|issn=2047-2994|pmc=6591802|pmid=31285821}}</ref> Adding diluted [[Hydrogen peroxide|hydrogen-peroxide]] increases further  the antimicrobial activity.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Information|first=National Center for Biotechnology|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK144054/|title=WHO-recommended handrub formulations|date=2009|publisher=World Health Organization|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient germ killers.

They found that:\n* The jet-air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of {{convert|180|m/s|km/h mi/h|abbr=on}}, was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 metres away.\n* Use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.\n* Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms.\n\nIn 2005, in a study conducted by T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.<ref>T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt GmbH Report No. 425-452006 [http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090410%20T%C3%9CV%20-%20Study%20of%20different%20methods%20used%20for%20drying%20hands%20Sept%202005.pdf A report concerning a study conducted with regard to the different methods used for drying hands; September 2005]</ref> The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Witness descriptions were mixed: Andrew Greenwood, a science teacher, told ''The Dandenong Journal'' at the time that he saw a silvery-green disc. According to witnesses the object was descending and then crossed and overflew the high school's south-west corner, going in a south-easterly direction, before disappearing from sight as it descended behind a stand of trees and into a paddock at The Grange in front of the Westall State School (primary students). After a short period (approximately 20 minutes) the object \u2013 with witnesses now numbering over 200 \u2013 then climbed at speed and departed towards the north-west.

Hundreds of children and a number of teachers at Westall School, Clayton, watched the object during morning break.\"\n\nThe newspaper also said a number of small aeroplanes circled around it. However, a check later showed that no commercial, private or [[RAAF]] pilots had reported anything unusual in the area.\nThe Weather Bureau released a balloon at Laverton at 8:30 am and the westerly wind blowing at the time could have moved it into the area where the sighting was reported\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cxZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XZMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2083%2C1126946|title=The Age |publisher=}}</ref> Witnesses and researchers were surprised when ''[[The Sun News-Pictorial]]'' (a tabloid) ran no story, yet ''[[The Age]]'' (a broadsheet) did.\n\n''The Sun'' and ''The Herald'' newspapers, while not mentioning the Westall incident, both published cartoons in the following day's editions that made light of the flying saucer phenomena.<ref>The Herald \u2013 9 April 1966, p. 2</ref>\n\nStudio 10 (a TV program) made a 17 min summary on the 50 year anniversary of the event in January 2016 with interviews of eyewitnesses.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\nA 7-minute short entitled Westall was produced in 2017 as part of a Swinburne University of Technology project.

The VFSRS team arrived on the site on 8 April and spoke to students and viewed the \"ground mark\", originally described as a great big round patch of yellow flattened grass with a swirly pattern. The VFSRS printed an image and a small report in their magazine \"Australian UFO Bulletin\" in December 2000. An investigator, Brian Boyle (PRA), arrived at the site on 9 April with four army investigators. Boyle did a number of interviews, which he recorded on tape, over a number of days and took samples from the ground mark.<ref>John Auchettl, ''An Old Australian Phenomenon'', The Australian Annual Flying Saucer Review, Victorian UFO Research Society (VUFORS), 1983</ref> These investigators were able to speak to many of the witnesses as it was over the Easter holidays (8\u201311 April).\n\n==Proposed explanations==\n\nAlthough some witnesses reported five Cessna-type aircraft{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} around the object, investigators were unable to find any record of such aircraft. [[Moorabbin Airport]], which is 4.76&nbsp;km (south-west) from the location, was checked but no aircraft from that airport entered the airspace. The [[RAAF]] also reported no military activity in that area.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe [[Australian Skeptics]] described the object as potentially having been an experimental military aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlymelbourne.com.au/melbourne_details.php?id=5481|title= Only Melbourne, 16 July 2007 |author= Steve Roberts}}</ref> They suggest that it may have been a nylon target drogue, like a wind sock, towed by one plane for the others to chase and known to be in use by the local RAAF at the time.\n\n==Reunion==\nA witness reunion was held at Westall Tennis Club Hall, on 8 April 2006, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the incident.<ref>774 ABC Melbourne \u2013 The 1966 Westall UFO incident Tuesday, 17 January 2006, Reporter: Florenz Ronn</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|date= 2 October 2005|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/10/01/1127804696941.html |title=Academic throws light on 40-year-old UFO mystery}}</ref>\n\n==Recent media==\n\n===Documentary===\nA 50-minute HDTV documentary called ''Westall \u201866: A Suburban UFO Mystery'' first aired on Australian TV on 4 June 2010.<ref>[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/Westallhighschoolufo/files/Clipping%20-%20Westall%\\2066%20-%20WHO%20-%20June%201%20-%202010.pdf The Who Weekly mini review in TV guide of \"Westall '66\". 7 June 2010 (PDF)]</ref><ref>[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/Westallhighschoolufo/files/Sunday%20Mail%20-%20SA%\\20-%20May%2030%202010.pdf Sunday Mail Adelaide TV guide mini review of \"Westall '66\". 30 May 2010 (PDF)]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/Westallhighschoolufo/files/woman%27s%20day%20westall%2066-60pc.pdf|title=Yahoo!

However, a check later showed that no commercial, private or [[RAAF]] pilots had reported anything unusual in the area.\nThe Weather Bureau released a balloon at Laverton at 8:30 am and the westerly wind blowing at the time could have moved it into the area where the sighting was reported\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cxZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XZMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2083%2C1126946|title=The Age |publisher=}}</ref> Witnesses and researchers were surprised when ''[[The Sun News-Pictorial]]'' (a tabloid) ran no story, yet ''[[The Age]]'' (a broadsheet) did.\n\n''The Sun'' and ''The Herald'' newspapers, while not mentioning the Westall incident, both published cartoons in the following day's editions that made light of the flying saucer phenomena.<ref>The Herald \u2013 9 April 1966, p. 2</ref>\n\nStudio 10 (a TV program) made a 17 min summary on the 50 year anniversary of the event in January 2016 with interviews of eyewitnesses.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\nA 7-minute short entitled Westall was produced in 2017 as part of a Swinburne University of Technology project.

The VFSRS team arrived on the site on 8 April and spoke to students and viewed the \"ground mark\", originally described as a great big round patch of yellow flattened grass with a swirly pattern. The VFSRS printed an image and a small report in their magazine \"Australian UFO Bulletin\" in December 2000. An investigator, Brian Boyle (PRA), arrived at the site on 9 April with four army investigators. Boyle did a number of interviews, which he recorded on tape, over a number of days and took samples from the ground mark.<ref>John Auchettl, ''An Old Australian Phenomenon'', The Australian Annual Flying Saucer Review, Victorian UFO Research Society (VUFORS), 1983</ref> These investigators were able to speak to many of the witnesses as it was over the Easter holidays (8\u201311 April).\n\n==Proposed explanations==\n\nAlthough some witnesses reported five Cessna-type aircraft{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} around the object, investigators were unable to find any record of such aircraft. [[Moorabbin Airport]], which is 4.76&nbsp;km (south-west) from the location, was checked but no aircraft from that airport entered the airspace. The [[RAAF]] also reported no military activity in that area.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe [[Australian Skeptics]] described the object as potentially having been an experimental military aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.onlymelbourne.com.au/melbourne_details.php?id=5481|title= Only Melbourne, 16 July 2007 |author= Steve Roberts}}</ref> They suggest that it may have been a nylon target drogue, like a wind sock, towed by one plane for the others to chase and known to be in use by the local RAAF at the time.\n\n==Reunion==\nA witness reunion was held at Westall Tennis Club Hall, on 8 April 2006, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the incident.<ref>774 ABC Melbourne \u2013 The 1966 Westall UFO incident Tuesday, 17 January 2006, Reporter: Florenz Ronn</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|date= 2 October 2005|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/10/01/1127804696941.html |title=Academic throws light on 40-year-old UFO mystery}}</ref>\n\n==Recent media==\n\n===Documentary===\nA 50-minute HDTV documentary called ''Westall \u201866: A Suburban UFO Mystery'' first aired on Australian TV on 4 June 2010.<ref>[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/Westallhighschoolufo/files/Clipping%20-%20Westall%\\2066%20-%20WHO%20-%20June%201%20-%202010.pdf The Who Weekly mini review in TV guide of \"Westall '66\". 7 June 2010 (PDF)]</ref><ref>[https://groups.yahoo.com/group/Westallhighschoolufo/files/Sunday%20Mail%20-%20SA%\\20-%20May%2030%202010.pdf Sunday Mail Adelaide TV guide mini review of \"Westall '66\". 30 May 2010 (PDF)]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/Westallhighschoolufo/files/woman%27s%20day%20westall%2066-60pc.pdf|title=Yahoo!
