Retrieved June 16, 2016</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Gerace]] probably owes its origin, or at least its importance, to the ruin of the town of [[Locri Epizephyrii]], one of the earliest Greek colonies in Lower Italy, founded by the Ozolian [[Locrians]] (684\u2013680 B.C.) and endowed with a code of laws by [[Zaleucus]]. The town was in a favorable position for the exploitation of the rich fields along the coast of the Gulf of Taranto, and sharing in the commerce of the east-west trade route.  Locri, however, was a beachfront town, wide-open to attacks by pirates and then by Arabs, Moors, and Saracens.<ref>D'Avino, p. 261.</ref>  Before its total ruin, Locri Epizephrii had a bishop of its own; but in 709, under Bishop Gregory, the see was transferred to Gerace. Gerace had the advantage of being a fortifiable hilltop, where the population could protect itself from raiders. There was only one bishop and one diocese, however, first called Locri and then called Gerace. These were not two dioceses.<ref>D'Agostino, p. 91.</ref>\n\nIn 731, Gerace and all the towns of Calabria suffered from a major earthquake, which devastated many of the cities of the region.  There was another major earthquake in 1783, and one in 1908.<ref>D'Avino, p. 262, 263.</ref>\n\nThe name Gerace is probably derived from [[Cyriaca|Saint Cyriaca]],{{disputed inline|date=February 2017}} whose church was destroyed by the Saracens in 915.<ref>On the cult of S. Cyriaca, see D'Agostino, pp. 84\u201391.</ref> They captured the town in 986, but in 1059 it fell into the hands of the Normans.  The Normans began the turn away from Greek affiliations toward Rome, aided by the policies of Gregory VII and Urban II.<ref>D'Agostino, pp. 93\u201394; 117\u2013125.</ref>\n\nUntil 1467 the [[Greek Rite]] was in wide use at Gerace, and such had probably been the custom from the beginning. As early as the thirteenth century efforts were made to introduce the [[Latin Rite]], which accounts for the schism between Latins and Greeks about 1250\u20131253. The latter demanded as bishop the monk Bartenulfo, a Greek, whereas [[Pope Innocent IV]], in 1253, appointed [[Marco Leone]]. In 1467, bishop [[Atanasio Calceofilo]] introduced the Latin Rite.\n\nIn 1749 [[Gerace]] was a town whose population was estimated at 3,000. It was divided ecclesiastically into thirteen parishes. There were forty-five ecclesiastical parishes in the diocese.<ref>Ughelli, p. 394. Perhaps he means 45 parishes in the rest of the diocese, outside Gerace. Cf. the list of parish priests attending the Synod in 1651, pp. 10\u201314.</ref> In 1890<ref>O. Werner, ''Orbis Terrarum Catholicus'' (Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder 1891), p. 31.</ref> the population of the diocese was given as 106,335, and the number of parishes was seventy one; there were 393 priests. The Chapter of the Cathedral had eight dignities and sixteen Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 235, note 1.</ref> Among the dignities were: the Cantor, the Archdeacon, the Archpriest, the Primicerius, the Dean, the Protonotary, the Treasurer, and the Master of Ceremonies<ref>Ughelli, IX, p. 393. ''Synodus dioecesana'' (1651), pp. 8\u20139.  Twenty-one of the twenty-three signatories of an episcopal decree (p. 163) hold the degree of ''Doctor in utroque iure'', and two are ''Doctor decretorum''; the list includes the signatures of the Cantor, Archdeacon, Archpriest, Protonotary, and Master of Ceremonies.</ref> The seminary of the diocese was founded by Bishop Candido, in obedience to the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]], and completed by his successor Bishop Pasqua.<ref>D'Avino, p. 263.</ref>\n\nThe population of the town of Gerace in 2012 was 2,715.

It is a [[suffragan]] of the [[Archdiocese of Reggio Calabria-Bova]].\n\nHistorically it was the '''Diocese of Gerace''', becoming in 1954 the '''Diocese of Gerace-Locri''' and taking the current name in 1986.<ref name=CathHierGerace>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dloge.html \"Diocese of Locri-Gerace (-Santa Maria di Polsi)\"] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''.

Retrieved June 16, 2016</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Gerace]] probably owes its origin, or at least its importance, to the ruin of the town of [[Locri Epizephyrii]], one of the earliest Greek colonies in Lower Italy, founded by the Ozolian [[Locrians]] (684\u2013680 B.C.) and endowed with a code of laws by [[Zaleucus]]. The town was in a favorable position for the exploitation of the rich fields along the coast of the Gulf of Taranto, and sharing in the commerce of the east-west trade route.  Locri, however, was a beachfront town, wide-open to attacks by pirates and then by Arabs, Moors, and Saracens.<ref>D'Avino, p. 261.</ref>  Before its total ruin, Locri Epizephrii had a bishop of its own; but in 709, under Bishop Gregory, the see was transferred to Gerace. Gerace had the advantage of being a fortifiable hilltop, where the population could protect itself from raiders. There was only one bishop and one diocese, however, first called Locri and then called Gerace. These were not two dioceses.<ref>D'Agostino, p. 91.</ref>\n\nIn 731, Gerace and all the towns of Calabria suffered from a major earthquake, which devastated many of the cities of the region.  There was another major earthquake in 1783, and one in 1908.<ref>D'Avino, p. 262, 263.</ref>\n\nThe name Gerace is probably derived from [[Cyriaca|Saint Cyriaca]],{{disputed inline|date=February 2017}} whose church was destroyed by the Saracens in 915.<ref>On the cult of S. Cyriaca, see D'Agostino, pp. 84\u201391.</ref> They captured the town in 986, but in 1059 it fell into the hands of the Normans.  The Normans began the turn away from Greek affiliations toward Rome, aided by the policies of Gregory VII and Urban II.<ref>D'Agostino, pp. 93\u201394; 117\u2013125.</ref>\n\nUntil 1467 the [[Greek Rite]] was in wide use at Gerace, and such had probably been the custom from the beginning. As early as the thirteenth century efforts were made to introduce the [[Latin Rite]], which accounts for the schism between Latins and Greeks about 1250\u20131253. The latter demanded as bishop the monk Bartenulfo, a Greek, whereas [[Pope Innocent IV]], in 1253, appointed [[Marco Leone]]. In 1467, bishop [[Atanasio Calceofilo]] introduced the Latin Rite.\n\nIn 1749 [[Gerace]] was a town whose population was estimated at 3,000. It was divided ecclesiastically into thirteen parishes. There were forty-five ecclesiastical parishes in the diocese.<ref>Ughelli, p. 394. Perhaps he means 45 parishes in the rest of the diocese, outside Gerace. Cf. the list of parish priests attending the Synod in 1651, pp. 10\u201314.</ref> In 1890<ref>O. Werner, ''Orbis Terrarum Catholicus'' (Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder 1891), p. 31.</ref> the population of the diocese was given as 106,335, and the number of parishes was seventy one; there were 393 priests. The Chapter of the Cathedral had eight dignities and sixteen Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 235, note 1.</ref> Among the dignities were: the Cantor, the Archdeacon, the Archpriest, the Primicerius, the Dean, the Protonotary, the Treasurer, and the Master of Ceremonies<ref>Ughelli, IX, p. 393. ''Synodus dioecesana'' (1651), pp. 8\u20139.  Twenty-one of the twenty-three signatories of an episcopal decree (p. 163) hold the degree of ''Doctor in utroque iure'', and two are ''Doctor decretorum''; the list includes the signatures of the Cantor, Archdeacon, Archpriest, Protonotary, and Master of Ceremonies.</ref> The seminary of the diocese was founded by Bishop Candido, in obedience to the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]], and completed by his successor Bishop Pasqua.<ref>D'Avino, p. 263.</ref>\n\nThe population of the town of Gerace in 2012 was 2,715. The population of the town of [[Locri]] was 12,845 in 2010.\n\n==Bishops==\n===Diocese of Gerace===\n''Latin Name: Hieracensis''<br>\n''Erected: 5th Century''\n\n====to 1300====\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n:'''...'''\n*[Basilius (attested 451)]<ref>Basilius was present at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, according to Ughelli, pp. 394-395.

In 1974, Beverly underwent an operation for cancer. She lived ten more years, but her health was adversely affected by the surgery.<ref name=\"chapterhouse\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/chapterhousedune00herb|url-access=registration|via=[[Internet Archive]]|author=Herbert, Frank P.|date=1987|title=Chapterhouse: Dune|location=New York City|publisher=The Berkley Publishing Group, [[Ace Books]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/chapterhousedune00herb/page/59 59],436|ISBN=0-441-10267-0|quote=It was typical of her that she wanted me to call the radiologist whose treatment in 1974 was the proximate cause of her death and thank him...}}</ref>{{rp|436}} During this period, Herbert was the featured speaker at the Octocon II science fiction convention held at the El Rancho Tropicana in Santa Rosa, California, in October 1978. In 1979, he met anthropologist James Funaro with whom he conceived the [[Contact Conference]]. Beverly Herbert died on February 7, 1984, the same year that ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' was published; in his afterword to 1985's ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', Frank Herbert wrote a eulogy for her.\n\nIn 1983, British [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden (band)|Iron Maiden]] requested permission from Herbert's publisher to name a song on their album ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' after ''Dune'', but were told that the author had a strong distaste for their style of music. They instead titled the song \"To Tame a Land\".\n\n1984 was a tumultuous year in Herbert's life. During this same year of his wife's death, his career took off with the release of [[David Lynch]]'s film version of ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''. Despite high expectations, a big-budget production design and an A-list cast, the movie drew mostly poor reviews in the United States. However, despite a disappointing response in the US, the film was a critical and commercial success in Europe and Japan.<ref name=\"kirjasto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fherbert.htm |title=Frank Herbert |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010107/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fherbert.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nAfter Beverly's death, Herbert married Theresa Shackleford in 1985, the year he published ''Chapterhouse: Dune'', which tied up many of the saga's story threads. This would be Herbert's final single work (the collection ''[[Eye (short story collection)|Eye]]'' was published that year, and ''Man of Two Worlds'' was published in 1986). He died of a massive [[pulmonary embolism]] while recovering from surgery for [[pancreatic cancer]] on February 11, 1986, in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin, age 65.\n\n=== Criticism of government ===\nHerbert was a strong critic of the [[Soviet Union]]. He was a distant relative of the controversial [[Republicanism in the United States|Republican]] senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], whom he referred to as \"Cousin Joe\". Herbert was appalled to learn of McCarthy's blacklisting of suspected Communists from working in certain careers and believed that he was endangering essential freedoms of citizens of the United States.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Herbert |first1=Brian |title=Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert |date=2003 |publisher=MacMillan |page=91 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hmg0YFP52XcC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=frank+herbert+like+mccarthy&source=bl&ots=PUh2YwysYk&sig=wM8sMw9AckJ35wkgvHk0sdQbh1k&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cHTeVK-LNoTIsQS_qIHADg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=frank%20herbert%20like%20mccarthy&f=false |access-date=February 13, 2015}}</ref> Herbert believed that governments lie to protect themselves and that, following the infamous [[Watergate scandal]], President [[Richard Nixon]] had unwittingly taught an important lesson in not trusting government.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Herbert |first1=Brian |title=Dreamer of Dune: The Biography of Frank Herbert |date=2003 |publisher=MacMillan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3SF08iQGpEC&pg=PT164&lpg=PT164&dq=frank+herbert+richard+nixon+provided+proof&source=bl&ots=rlkBhD4OR8&sig=gERk-ToHchMOX7z8kAGK6d2k55A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=03feVKf6KcXlsASPnIDgCg&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=frank%20herbert%20richard%20nixon%20provided%20proof&f=false |access-date=February 13, 2015}}</ref> Herbert also opposed [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|American involvement in the war in Vietnam]].<ref>\"This was Frank Herbert, speaking from his own heart...It was a philosophy of [[non-violence]] that would ultimately lead to his involvement in the movement to stop the war in Vietnam.\"Herbert, Brian.

He was able to devote himself wholeheartedly to his writing career because his wife returned to work full-time as an advertising writer for department stores, becoming the breadwinner during the 1960s. He later told [[Willis E. McNelly]] that the novel originated when he was supposed to do a magazine article on sand dunes in the [[Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area|Oregon Dunes]] near [[Florence, Oregon]]. He became too involved and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article. The article was never written, but instead planted the seed that led to ''Dune''.\n\n''Dune'' took six years of research and writing to complete and it was much longer than commercial science fiction of the time was supposed to be. ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' (the renamed ''Astounding'', still edited by [[John W.

In 1979, he met anthropologist James Funaro with whom he conceived the [[Contact Conference]]. Beverly Herbert died on February 7, 1984, the same year that ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' was published; in his afterword to 1985's ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', Frank Herbert wrote a eulogy for her.\n\nIn 1983, British [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden (band)|Iron Maiden]] requested permission from Herbert's publisher to name a song on their album ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' after ''Dune'', but were told that the author had a strong distaste for their style of music. They instead titled the song \"To Tame a Land\".\n\n1984 was a tumultuous year in Herbert's life. During this same year of his wife's death, his career took off with the release of [[David Lynch]]'s film version of ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''. Despite high expectations, a big-budget production design and an A-list cast, the movie drew mostly poor reviews in the United States. However, despite a disappointing response in the US, the film was a critical and commercial success in Europe and Japan.<ref name=\"kirjasto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fherbert.htm |title=Frank Herbert |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010107/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fherbert.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nAfter Beverly's death, Herbert married Theresa Shackleford in 1985, the year he published ''Chapterhouse: Dune'', which tied up many of the saga's story threads.

He died of a massive [[pulmonary embolism]] while recovering from surgery for [[pancreatic cancer]] on February 11, 1986, in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin, age 65.\n\n=== Criticism of government ===\nHerbert was a strong critic of the [[Soviet Union]]. He was a distant relative of the controversial [[Republicanism in the United States|Republican]] senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], whom he referred to as \"Cousin Joe\".

The standard was created by the [[Health Level Seven International]] (HL7) health-care standards organization.\n\nFHIR builds on previous data format standards from HL7, like HL7 version 2.x and HL7 version 3.x.  But it is easier to implement because it uses a modern web-based suite of API technology, including a [[HTTP]]-based [[RESTful]]  protocol, [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] for user interface integration, a choice of [[JSON]], [[XML]] or [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] for data representation, and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] for results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hl7.org/fhir/|title=Welcome to FHIR|last=|first=|date=2016-05-15|website=HL7.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-27}}</ref> One of its goals is to facilitate interoperation between legacy health care systems, to make it easy to provide health care information to health care providers and individuals on a wide variety of devices from computers to tablets to cell phones, and to allow third-party application developers to provide medical applications which can be easily integrated into existing systems.\n\nFHIR provides an alternative to document-centric approaches by directly exposing discrete data elements as services.   For example, basic elements of healthcare like patients, admissions, diagnostic reports and medications can each be retrieved and manipulated via their own resource [[URL]]s.

The standard was created by the [[Health Level Seven International]] (HL7) health-care standards organization.\n\nFHIR builds on previous data format standards from HL7, like HL7 version 2.x and HL7 version 3.x.  But it is easier to implement because it uses a modern web-based suite of API technology, including a [[HTTP]]-based [[RESTful]]  protocol, [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] for user interface integration, a choice of [[JSON]], [[XML]] or [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] for data representation, and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] for results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hl7.org/fhir/|title=Welcome to FHIR|last=|first=|date=2016-05-15|website=HL7.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-27}}</ref> One of its goals is to facilitate interoperation between legacy health care systems, to make it easy to provide health care information to health care providers and individuals on a wide variety of devices from computers to tablets to cell phones, and to allow third-party application developers to provide medical applications which can be easily integrated into existing systems.\n\nFHIR provides an alternative to document-centric approaches by directly exposing discrete data elements as services.   For example, basic elements of healthcare like patients, admissions, diagnostic reports and medications can each be retrieved and manipulated via their own resource [[URL]]s.  FHIR was supported at an [[American Medical Informatics Association]] meeting by many EHR vendors which value its open and extensible nature.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.healthcare-informatics.com/article/smart-fhir-smoking-hot-topic-amia-meeting\n | title=SMART on FHIR a Smoking Hot Topic at AMIA Meeting\n | work=Healthcare Informatics\n | date=2014-11-17\n | accessdate=2014-11-22 }}\n</ref>\n\n==Standardization==\nThe [http://hl7.org/fhir/2011Aug/ initial draft of FHIR], then known as Resources For Healthcare (RFH), was published on Grahame Grieve's blog<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthintersections.com.au/?p=502|title= Resources For Health: A Fresh Look Proposal|date=2011-08-18|accessdate=2019-08-22|author=Grahame Grieve|work=Health Intersections}}</ref> in August 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ringholm.com/column/FHIR_5_years.htm#targetText=The%20initial%20version%20of%20FHIR,the%20time)%20on%20his%20website|title=Five years of FHIR|date=2016-08-11|accessdate=2019-08-22|author=Ren\u00e9 Spronk|work=Ringholm}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2014, [[Health Level Seven International]] published FHIR as a \"Draft Standard for Trial Use\" (DSTU), Release 1, version DSTU 1 (v0.0.82).<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=343\n |title=HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Specification 'FHIR\u2122', Release 1\n |work=HL7 International\n |date=2014-02-02\n |accessdate=2014-12-26\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228095815/http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=343\n |archivedate=2014-12-28\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn December 2014, a broad cross-section of stakeholders committed to the Argonaut Project<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public_temp_B669E2A2-1C23-BA17-0C7A999023268366/pressreleases/HL7_PRESS_20141204.pdf\n |title=HL7 Launches Joint Argonaut Project to Advance FHIR\n |work=HL7 International\n |date=2014-12-04\n |accessdate=2014-12-26\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228100113/http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public_temp_B669E2A2-1C23-BA17-0C7A999023268366/pressreleases/HL7_PRESS_20141204.pdf\n |archivedate=2014-12-28\n}}\n</ref>\nwhich will provide acceleration funding and political will to publish FHIR implementation guides and profiles for query/response interoperability and document retrieval by May 2015.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/blog/kindling-fhir\n | title=Kindling FHIR\n | work=Healthcare IT News\n | date=2014-12-04\n | accessdate=2014-12-06 }}\n</ref>  It would then be possible for medical records systems to migrate from the current practice of exchanging complex [[Clinical Document Architecture]] (CDA) documents, and instead exchange sets of simpler, more modular and interoperable FHIR JSON objects.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.informationweek.com/strategic-cio/can-argonaut-project-make-exchanging-health-data-easier/a/d-id/1318774\n | title=Can Argonaut Project Make Exchanging Health Data Easier?\n | work=InformationWeek\n | date=2015-01-26\n | accessdate=2015-02-28 }}\n</ref>  The initial goal, to be completed in time for the May 2015 HL7 FHIR Draft Standard for Trial Use revision 2 ballot, is to specify two FHIR profiles that are relevant to the [[Meaningful Use]] requirements, along with an implementation guide for using [[OAuth]] 2.0 for authentication.\n<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.healthcare-informatics.com/article/halamka-expect-argonaut-deliverables-may\n | title=Halamka: Expect Argonaut Deliverables by May\n | work=healthcare-informatics.com\n | date=2015-02-19\n | accessdate=2015-02-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nThe CEO of HL7 argued in August 2016 that it already provided valuable features, was ready to use, and was being adopted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://healthitinteroperability.com/news/health-it-standard-fhir-ready-to-advance-interoperability|title=Health IT Standard FHIR Ready to Advance Interoperability|last=HealthITInteroperability|access-date=2016-09-13}}</ref>\n\nFHIR Release 3 was published in&nbsp;March 2017, as the first STU (Standards for Trial Use) release.

It was established on November 28, 1843.  The seat of the diocese is the [[Cathedral of St. Andrew (Little Rock, Arkansas)|Cathedral of St. Andrew]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bishopbyrne.jpg|thumb|left|Bishop Byrne]]\nIn 1820 Bishop [[Louis William Valentine Dubourg]] visited the Osage Indians and, after him, Father Croix. Under Bishop Rosati, the Lazarists, from their seminary at the Barrens, Missouri, did praiseworthy missionary work from 1824 to 30 among the Indians and scattered settlers. The most noted secular priest of these times was Rev. Richard Bole, who established St. Mary's Mission, five miles below the present Pine Bluff, and brought there in 1838, from St. Genevi\u00e8ve, Missouri, five Sisters of Loretto, who opened the first Catholic school in Arkansas. The State of Arkansas and the Indian Territory, parts of the Louisiana Purchase, were formed in 1843, into the Diocese of Little Rock. Rev. [[Andrew Byrne]], pastor of [[St. Andrew Church (New York City)]], was consecrated the first bishop, March 10, 1844.<ref name=Lucey>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09295a.htm Lucey, John. \"Diocese of Little Rock.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 20 August 2019{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nBishop Byrne, born in [[Navan]], Ireland, in 1802, and ordained by [[John England (bishop)|Bishop England]] at Charleston, South Carolina, November 11, 1827, brought from New York to Arkansas Fathers Corry of Albany and Donohoe of Troy, New York. All the priests of the earlier days had gone. The Catholic population of the diocese was not more than 1000. Bishop Byrne secured from [[Naas]], Ireland, thirteen Sisters of Mercy, who established in 1850, [[Mount St. Mary Academy (Little Rock, Arkansas)|St. Mary's Academy]] at Little Rock, and in 1851, St. Ann's Academy at Fort Smith. An imposing frame [[Cathedral of St. Andrew (Little Rock, Arkansas)|cathedral]] was erected in Little Rock, and modest structures were built in several parts of the State. During the Civil War from 1861 to 1865, church work came to a halt. Bishop Byrne died on June 10, 1862.<ref name=Lucey/>\n\nThe diocese remained ''sede vacante'', with Very Rev. P. O'Reilly, V.G., as administrator until February 3, 1867, when Rev. Edward Fitzgerald, pastor of St. Patrick's Church, Columbus, Ohio, became bishop. Bishop Fitzgerald was born in 1833, at Limerick, Ireland. He entered the Lazarist Seminary at the Barrens, Missouri, in 1850, and was subsequently a student at Mount St. Mary's, Cincinnati, and Mount St. Mary's, Emmitsburg, where he was ordained in 1857 by Archbishop Purcell. Bishop Fitzgerald was consecrated on February 3, 1867. He found in his diocese four parishes, five priests, and a Catholic population of 1600. He began work to secure Catholic immigration for the State, sisters for schools and priests for missions. Benedictine monks from St. Meinrad, Indiana, came in 1876 to Logan County and soon flourishing German settlements arose. The Holy Ghost Fathers of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, established in 1879 successful German colonies near Morrilton. A Polish settlement was made at Marche in 1880, and Italians came later to Sunnyside, Tontitown, New Gascony, and Barton. On May 27, 1894, Bishop Fitzgerald dedicated the first church in Arkansas for African-Americans at Pine Bluff, where there had been established an excellent industrial school, now in care of the Sisters of the Holy Family. Monsignor John B. Morris, V.G., of Nashville, Tennessee, was consecrated Coadjutor Bishop of Little Rock, June 11, 1906, and on the death of Bishop Fitzgerald in 1907, assumed full control of a diocese with a Catholic population of 20,000.<ref name=Lucey/>\n\nThe Indian Territory, since it was created a vicariate in 1891, ceased to be part of the Diocese of Little Rock. Bishop Morris, who assumed control of the diocese in 1907, was born at Hendersonville, Tennessee, June 29, 1866. His theological studies were made at the American College, Rome, and he was ordained priest on June 11, 1892, in the Basilica of St. John Lateran, by Cardinal Parocchi. After several years' rectorship of the cathedral in Nashville, Bishop Byrne appointed him in 1901, vicar-general, and in 1905 Pius X elevated him to the rank of domestic prelate. Bishop Morris opened Little Rock College (1908), and St. Joseph's orphan asylum. The first diocesan synod was held on February 16, 1909, at Little Rock, and the first normal school of instruction for Catholic teachers was inaugurated at Little Rock, June 11, 1909.\n\n==Bishops==\nThe following are lists of bishops and their years of service:\n\n===Bishops of Little Rock===\n# [[Andrew Byrne]] (1843-1862)\n# [[Edward Fitzgerald (bishop)|Edward Fitzgerald]] (1866-1907)\n# [[John Baptist Morris]] (1907-1946)\n# [[Albert Lewis Fletcher]] (1946-1972)\n# [[Andrew Joseph McDonald]] (1972-2000)\n# [[J.

O'Reilly, V.G., as administrator until February 3, 1867, when Rev. Edward Fitzgerald, pastor of St. Patrick's Church, Columbus, Ohio, became bishop. Bishop Fitzgerald was born in 1833, at Limerick, Ireland. He entered the Lazarist Seminary at the Barrens, Missouri, in 1850, and was subsequently a student at Mount St. Mary's, Cincinnati, and Mount St. Mary's, Emmitsburg, where he was ordained in 1857 by Archbishop Purcell. Bishop Fitzgerald was consecrated on February 3, 1867. He found in his diocese four parishes, five priests, and a Catholic population of 1600. He began work to secure Catholic immigration for the State, sisters for schools and priests for missions. Benedictine monks from St. Meinrad, Indiana, came in 1876 to Logan County and soon flourishing German settlements arose. The Holy Ghost Fathers of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, established in 1879 successful German colonies near Morrilton. A Polish settlement was made at Marche in 1880, and Italians came later to Sunnyside, Tontitown, New Gascony, and Barton. On May 27, 1894, Bishop Fitzgerald dedicated the first church in Arkansas for African-Americans at Pine Bluff, where there had been established an excellent industrial school, now in care of the Sisters of the Holy Family. Monsignor John B. Morris, V.G., of Nashville, Tennessee, was consecrated Coadjutor Bishop of Little Rock, June 11, 1906, and on the death of Bishop Fitzgerald in 1907, assumed full control of a diocese with a Catholic population of 20,000.<ref name=Lucey/>\n\nThe Indian Territory, since it was created a vicariate in 1891, ceased to be part of the Diocese of Little Rock. Bishop Morris, who assumed control of the diocese in 1907, was born at Hendersonville, Tennessee, June 29, 1866. His theological studies were made at the American College, Rome, and he was ordained priest on June 11, 1892, in the Basilica of St. John Lateran, by Cardinal Parocchi. After several years' rectorship of the cathedral in Nashville, Bishop Byrne appointed him in 1901, vicar-general, and in 1905 Pius X elevated him to the rank of domestic prelate. Bishop Morris opened Little Rock College (1908), and St. Joseph's orphan asylum. The first diocesan synod was held on February 16, 1909, at Little Rock, and the first normal school of instruction for Catholic teachers was inaugurated at Little Rock, June 11, 1909.\n\n==Bishops==\nThe following are lists of bishops and their years of service:\n\n===Bishops of Little Rock===\n# [[Andrew Byrne]] (1843-1862)\n# [[Edward Fitzgerald (bishop)|Edward Fitzgerald]] (1866-1907)\n# [[John Baptist Morris]] (1907-1946)\n# [[Albert Lewis Fletcher]] (1946-1972)\n# [[Andrew Joseph McDonald]] (1972-2000)\n# [[J.
