'''Modern chandeliers''' have a more modernized design that uses [[LED]]s, and combines the elements of both classic and contemporary designs; some are also equipped with refractive crystal prisms or small mirrors.\n\nChandeliers are distinct from [[pendant light]]s, as they usually consist of multiple lamps and hang in branched frames, whereas pendant lights hang from a single cord and only contain one or two lamps with fewer decorative elements.

As a reaction to this new taste, Italian glass factories in [[Murano]] created new kinds of artistic light sources. Since [[Murano glass]] was not suitable for faceting, typical work realized at the time in other countries where crystal was used, Venetian glassmakers relied upon the unique qualities of their glass. Typical features of a Murano chandelier are the intricate arabesques of leaves, flowers and fruits that would be enriched by coloured glass, made possible by the specific type of glass used in Murano. The soda glass (famed for its clarity) that they worked with was unique and contrasted with other types of glass produced in the world at that time. Great skill and time was required to twist and shape a chandelier precisely.

The most sumptuous consisted of a metal frame covered with small elements in blown glass, transparent or colored, with decorations of flowers, fruits and leaves, while simpler models had arms made with unique pieces of glass. Their shape was inspired by an original architectural concept: the space on the inside is left almost empty, since decorations are spread all around the central support, distanced from it by the length of the arms.

Farrier Fire Fighting School, Norfolk, Virginia. 27 July 2007 Tom Wimberly, Captain, U. S. Navy (Retired)</ref>\n\nThe disaster prompted the Navy to revise its fire fighting practices. It also modified its weapon handling procedures and installed a deck wash down system on all carriers. The newly established Farrier Fire Fighting School Learning Site in Norfolk, Virginia was named after Chief Gerald W. Farrier, the commander of Damage Control Team 8, who was among the first to die in the fire and explosions.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:USS Forrestal (CVA-59) underway at sea on 31 May 1962 (KN-4507).jpg|thumb|left|Since her commissioning in 1955, ''Forrestal'' spent her service alternating between the North Atlantic and Mediterranean; her departure from Norfolk in June 1967 was her first WESTPAC deployment.]]\n[[File:USS Diamond Head (AE-19) anchored off Naples, Italy, on 20 October 1960 (USN 1050684).jpg|thumb|left|''Forrestal'' rendezvoused with the ammunition ship ''Diamond Head'' on 28 July to receive a load of new ordnance, including 16 Korean War-era AN-M65A1 GP 1,000 lb bombs.]]\n\n=== Arrival in Gulf of Tonkin ===\n\n''Forrestal''  departed its home port in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] in early June 1967. After it completed required inspections for the upcoming West Pacific cruise, it sailed to Brazil for a show of force.

The demand for [[general-purpose bomb]]s (e.g., \"iron bombs\") greatly exceeded production. The inventory of bombs dwindled throughout 1966 and became critically low by 1967.<ref name=cox/> This was particularly true for the new {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on|0}} [[Mark 83]], which the Navy favored for its power-to-size ratio. A [[CATOBAR|carrier-launched]] [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawk]], the Navy's standard light attack / [[ground attack aircraft]], could carry either a single {{convert|2000|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}} bomb, or two 1,000 lb bombs. This gave it the ability to strike two separate hardened targets in a single [[sortie]], which was more effective in most circumstances.\n\nThe [[U.S. Air Force]]'s primary ground attack aircraft in Vietnam was the much heavier, land-based, [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief|F-105 Thunderchief]]. It could simultaneously carry two {{convert|3000|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}} [[Mark 118 bomb|M118]] bombs and four {{convert|750|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}} [[M117 bomb|M117]] bombs. The Air Force had a large supply of these bombs, and did not rely as heavily on the limited supply of 1,000 lb bombs as did the Navy.{{Citation needed|date = July 2014}}\n[[File:RADM John Beling.jpg|thumb|Captain [[John Kingsman Beling|Beling]] was reluctant to take delivery of the Korean War-era 16 AN-M65A1 bombs from USS ''Diamond Head'' but, faced with the prospect of having to cancel the next day's sorties, accepted them.]]\n\n=== Issues with Zuni rockets===\n\nIn addition to bombs, the ground attack aircraft carried unguided {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} [[Zuni (rocket)|Mk-32 \"Zuni\"]] rockets.

These lessons were gradually lost and by 1967, the U.S. Navy had reverted to the Japanese model at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] and relied on specialized, highly trained damage control and fire-fighting teams.<ref name=skyhawk/>\n\nThe damage control team specializing in on-deck firefighting for ''Forrestal'' was Damage Control Team No. 8, led by [[Chief petty officer|Chief]] [[Aviation boatswain's mate|Aviation Boatswain's Mate]] Gerald Farrier.

Because it is [[insensitive munitions|relatively insensitive]] to heat, shock and electricity, Composition H6 is still used as of {{CURRENTYEAR}} in many types of naval ordnance. It is also designed to [[deflagrate]] instead of [[detonate]] when it reaches its ignition point in a fire, either melting the case and producing no explosion at all, or, at most, a subsonic [[low explosive|low order detonation]] at a fraction of its normal power.<ref name=freeman/>{{rp|85}}\n\n=== Unstable ordnance received ===\n\nOn 28 July, the day before the accident, ''Forrestal'' was resupplied with ordnance by the [[ammunition ship]] {{USS|Diamond Head|AE-19|6}}.

The AN-M65A1 bombs had been returned to service specifically because there were not enough Mark 83s to go around. According to one crew member on ''Diamond Head'', when they had arrived at Subic Bay to pick up their load of ordnance for the carriers, the base personnel who had prepared the AN-M65A1 bombs for transfer assumed ''Diamond Head'' had been ordered to dump them at sea on the way back to Yankee Station. When notified that the bombs were actually destined for active service in the carrier fleet, the commanding officer of the naval ordnance detachment at Subic Bay was so shocked that he initially refused the transfer, believing a paperwork mistake had been made.

They also identified issues with the aging 1,000 lb \"fat bombs\" carried for the strike, which were discovered to have dated from the Korean War in 1953.<ref name=DANFS/>\n\n=== Safety procedures overridden ===\n\nThe board of investigation stated, \"Poor and outdated doctrinal and technical documentation of ordnance and aircraft equipment and procedures, evident at all levels of command, was a contributing cause of the accidental rocket firing.\" However, the doctrine and procedures employed were not unique to ''Forrestal''. Other carriers had problems with the Zuni rockets.<ref name=cox/>\n\nThe investigation found that safety regulations should have prevented the Zuni rocket from firing. A triple ejector rack (TER) electrical safety pin was designed to prevent any electrical signal from reaching the rockets before the aircraft was launched, but it was also known that high winds could sometimes catch the attached tags and blow them free. In addition to the pin, a \"pigtail\" connected the electrical wiring of the missile to the rocket pod. US Navy regulations required the pigtail be connected only when the aircraft was attached to the catapult and ready to launch, but the ordnance officers found this slowed down the launch rate.<ref name=\"invespart2\"/>{{rp|57}}\n\nThe Navy investigation found that four weeks before the fire, ''Forrestal''{{'}}s Weapons Coordination Board, along with members of the Weapons Planning Board, held a meeting to discuss the issue of attaching the pigtail at the catapult. Launches were sometimes delayed when a crew member had difficulty completing the connection. They agreed on a deviation from standard procedure. In a memorandum of the meeting, they agreed to \"Allow ordnance personnel to connect pigtails 'in the pack', prior to taxi, leaving only safety pin removal at the cat.\" The memo, written on 8 July 1967, was circulated to the ship's operations officer. But the memo and the decision were never communicated to Captain Beling, the ship's commanding officer, who was required to approve such decisions.<ref name=\"invespart3\">{{cite web |title=Fire and Explosion aboard USS ''Forrestal'' (CVA-59) Part 2 |url=http://www.jag.navy.mil/library/investigations/USS%20FORRESTAL%20FIRE%2012%20AUG%2069%20PT%202.pdf |accessdate=26 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109101458/http://www.jag.navy.mil/library/investigations/USS%20FORRESTAL%20FIRE%2012%20AUG%2069%20PT%202.pdf |archive-date=9 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|65}}\n\n=== Causes identified ===\n\nThe official inquiry found that the ordnance crew acted immediately on the Weapons Coordination Board's decision.

Cmdr. Fred D. White, on the port side of the aft deck. The accidental firing was due to the simultaneous malfunction of three components: CA42282 pylon electrical disconnect, TER-7 safety switch, and LAU-10/A shorting device. They concluded that the CA42282 pylon electrical disconnect had a design defect, and found that the TER-7 safety pin was poorly designed, making it easy to confuse with ordnance pins used in the AERO-7 Sparrow Launcher, which if used by mistake would not operate effectively.<ref name=\"invespart2\">{{cite web|title=Official investigation Part 3|url=http://www.jag.navy.mil/library/investigations/USS%20FORRESTAL%20FIRE%2012%20AUG%2069%20PT%203.pdf|publisher=Judge Advocate General|accessdate=27 August 2018|date=19 September 1967|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920103030/http://www.jag.navy.mil/library/investigations/USS%20FORRESTAL%20FIRE%2012%20AUG%2069%20PT%203.pdf|archive-date=20 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Drydock repairs ===\n\nWhen temporary repairs in the Philippines were completed, ''Forrestal'' departed on 11 August, arriving at [[Naval Station Mayport]] in Florida on 12 September to disembark the remaining aircraft and air group personnel stationed in Florida.

The carrier occupied [[drydock]] number 8 from 21 September 1967, until 10 February 1968, displacing {{USS|John King|DDG-3|6}}, an oil tanker, and a minesweeper that were occupying the drydock. During the post-fire refit, {{convert|175 |feet}} of the flight deck was replaced, along with about 200 compartments on the 03, 02, 01 decks. The ship's four aft [[5\"/54 caliber Mark 42 gun]]s were removed. The forward four guns had been removed prior to 1962.

After it completed required inspections for the upcoming West Pacific cruise, it sailed to Brazil for a show of force. It then traveled east around the [[Horn of Africa]] and visited [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point]] in the Philippine Islands before sailing to [[Yankee Station]] in the Gulf of Tonkin on 25 July.\n\nAfter arrival at Yankee Station, aircraft from [[Carrier Air Wing Seventeen|Attack Carrier Air Wing 17]] flew approximately 150 missions against targets in [[North Vietnam]] over four days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/nav_legacy.asp?id=64 |title=USS ''Forrestal'' CVA-59 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=15 June 2009 |website=US Navy |accessdate=13 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915110332/http://www.navy.mil/navydata/nav_legacy.asp?id=64 |archive-date=15 September 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Vietnam bombing campaign ===\n\nThe ongoing naval bombing campaign during 1967 originating at Yankee Station represented by far the most intense and sustained air attack operation in the [[U.S. Navy]]'s history.  The demand for [[general-purpose bomb]]s (e.g., \"iron bombs\") greatly exceeded production. The inventory of bombs dwindled throughout 1966 and became critically low by 1967.<ref name=cox/> This was particularly true for the new {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on|0}} [[Mark 83]], which the Navy favored for its power-to-size ratio. A [[CATOBAR|carrier-launched]] [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawk]], the Navy's standard light attack / [[ground attack aircraft]], could carry either a single {{convert|2000|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}} bomb, or two 1,000 lb bombs. This gave it the ability to strike two separate hardened targets in a single [[sortie]], which was more effective in most circumstances.\n\nThe [[U.S. Air Force]]'s primary ground attack aircraft in Vietnam was the much heavier, land-based, [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief|F-105 Thunderchief]]. It could simultaneously carry two {{convert|3000|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}} [[Mark 118 bomb|M118]] bombs and four {{convert|750|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}} [[M117 bomb|M117]] bombs. The Air Force had a large supply of these bombs, and did not rely as heavily on the limited supply of 1,000 lb bombs as did the Navy.{{Citation needed|date = July 2014}}\n[[File:RADM John Beling.jpg|thumb|Captain [[John Kingsman Beling|Beling]] was reluctant to take delivery of the Korean War-era 16 AN-M65A1 bombs from USS ''Diamond Head'' but, faced with the prospect of having to cancel the next day's sorties, accepted them.]]\n\n=== Issues with Zuni rockets===\n\nIn addition to bombs, the ground attack aircraft carried unguided {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} [[Zuni (rocket)|Mk-32 \"Zuni\"]] rockets. These rockets were in wide use although they had a reputation for electrical difficulties and accidental firing.<ref name=\"invespart2\"/> It was common for aircraft to launch with six or more rocket packs, each containing four rockets.<ref name=\"invespart2\"/>\n\n=== Specialized fire-fighting teams ===\n\nBased on lessons learned during Japanese attacks on vessels during World War II, most sailors on board ships after World War II received training in fighting shipboard fires. These lessons were gradually lost and by 1967, the U.S. Navy had reverted to the Japanese model at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] and relied on specialized, highly trained damage control and fire-fighting teams.<ref name=skyhawk/>\n\nThe damage control team specializing in on-deck firefighting for ''Forrestal'' was Damage Control Team No. 8, led by [[Chief petty officer|Chief]] [[Aviation boatswain's mate|Aviation Boatswain's Mate]] Gerald Farrier.

Because it is [[insensitive munitions|relatively insensitive]] to heat, shock and electricity, Composition H6 is still used as of {{CURRENTYEAR}} in many types of naval ordnance. It is also designed to [[deflagrate]] instead of [[detonate]] when it reaches its ignition point in a fire, either melting the case and producing no explosion at all, or, at most, a subsonic [[low explosive|low order detonation]] at a fraction of its normal power.<ref name=freeman/>{{rp|85}}\n\n=== Unstable ordnance received ===\n\nOn 28 July, the day before the accident, ''Forrestal'' was resupplied with ordnance by the [[ammunition ship]] {{USS|Diamond Head|AE-19|6}}.

The AN-M65A1 bombs had been returned to service specifically because there were not enough Mark 83s to go around. According to one crew member on ''Diamond Head'', when they had arrived at Subic Bay to pick up their load of ordnance for the carriers, the base personnel who had prepared the AN-M65A1 bombs for transfer assumed ''Diamond Head'' had been ordered to dump them at sea on the way back to Yankee Station. When notified that the bombs were actually destined for active service in the carrier fleet, the commanding officer of the naval ordnance detachment at Subic Bay was so shocked that he initially refused the transfer, believing a paperwork mistake had been made. At the risk of delaying ''Diamond Head''{{'}}s departure, he refused to sign the transfer forms until receiving written orders from [[CINCPAC]] on the [[teleprinter]], explicitly absolving his detachment of responsibility for the bombs' terrible condition.<ref name=cox/>\n\n=== Unstable bombs stored on deck ===\n\nWith orders to conduct strike missions over North Vietnam the next day, and with no replacement bombs available, Captain Beling reluctantly concluded that he had no choice but to accept the AN-M65A1 bombs in their current condition.<ref name=skyhawk/><ref name=\"dougherty\">{{cite web |title=Bud Dougherty Collection: Disaster on the USS Forrestal |url=https://arlingtonhistoricalsociety.org/2017/06/bud-dougherty-collection-disaster-on-the-uss-forrestal/ |website=Arlington Historical Society |accessdate=26 July 2018 |date=18 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726072002/https://arlingtonhistoricalsociety.org/2017/06/bud-dougherty-collection-disaster-on-the-uss-forrestal/ |archive-date=26 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"collins\">{{cite web |last1=Collins |first1=Elizabeth M. |title=Fire Aboard Ship |url=http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/ftrStory.asp?id=101670 |website=navy.mil |publisher=All Hands |accessdate=23 July 2018 |language=en |date=27 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723064200/http://www.navy.mil/ah_online/ftrStory.asp?id=101670 |archive-date=23 July 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In one concession to the demands of the ordnance handlers, Beling agreed to store all 16 bombs alone on deck in the \"bomb farm\" area between the starboard rail and the carrier's island until they were loaded for the next day's missions.

During welcoming ceremonies, a fire alarm signal alerted crews to a fire in mattresses within the burned-out compartments.<ref name=popmech/>\n\n=== Investigation begun ===\n\nA special group, the Aircraft Carrier Safety Review Panel, was convened on 15 August in the Philippines. Owing to the necessity of returning the ship to the United States for repair, the panel acted quickly to interview personnel on board the ship.<ref name=tragic/>\n\n===Ordnance issues found ===\n[[File:USS Forrestal (CV-59) cost of the fire.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sailors carefully lower the first of their shipmates killed in the fire to the Leyte Pier at [[Naval Air Station Cubi Point]] in the Philippines.]]\n\nInvestigators identified issues with [[stray voltage]] in the circuitry of the LAU-10 rocket launchers and Zuni missiles. They also identified issues with the aging 1,000 lb \"fat bombs\" carried for the strike, which were discovered to have dated from the Korean War in 1953.<ref name=DANFS/>\n\n=== Safety procedures overridden ===\n\nThe board of investigation stated, \"Poor and outdated doctrinal and technical documentation of ordnance and aircraft equipment and procedures, evident at all levels of command, was a contributing cause of the accidental rocket firing.\" However, the doctrine and procedures employed were not unique to ''Forrestal''. Other carriers had problems with the Zuni rockets.<ref name=cox/>\n\nThe investigation found that safety regulations should have prevented the Zuni rocket from firing. A triple ejector rack (TER) electrical safety pin was designed to prevent any electrical signal from reaching the rockets before the aircraft was launched, but it was also known that high winds could sometimes catch the attached tags and blow them free. In addition to the pin, a \"pigtail\" connected the electrical wiring of the missile to the rocket pod. US Navy regulations required the pigtail be connected only when the aircraft was attached to the catapult and ready to launch, but the ordnance officers found this slowed down the launch rate.<ref name=\"invespart2\"/>{{rp|57}}\n\nThe Navy investigation found that four weeks before the fire, ''Forrestal''{{'}}s Weapons Coordination Board, along with members of the Weapons Planning Board, held a meeting to discuss the issue of attaching the pigtail at the catapult. Launches were sometimes delayed when a crew member had difficulty completing the connection. They agreed on a deviation from standard procedure. In a memorandum of the meeting, they agreed to \"Allow ordnance personnel to connect pigtails 'in the pack', prior to taxi, leaving only safety pin removal at the cat.\" The memo, written on 8 July 1967, was circulated to the ship's operations officer. But the memo and the decision were never communicated to Captain Beling, the ship's commanding officer, who was required to approve such decisions.<ref name=\"invespart3\">{{cite web |title=Fire and Explosion aboard USS ''Forrestal'' (CVA-59) Part 2 |url=http://www.jag.navy.mil/library/investigations/USS%20FORRESTAL%20FIRE%2012%20AUG%2069%20PT%202.pdf |accessdate=26 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109101458/http://www.jag.navy.mil/library/investigations/USS%20FORRESTAL%20FIRE%2012%20AUG%2069%20PT%202.pdf |archive-date=9 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|65}}\n\n=== Causes identified ===\n\nThe official inquiry found that the ordnance crew acted immediately on the Weapons Coordination Board's decision. They found that the pigtail was connected early, that the TER pin on the faulty Zuni missile was likely blown free, and that the missile fired when a power surge occurred as the pilot transferred his systems from external to internal power.<ref name=navylive/><ref name=\"invespart2\"/>{{rp|57}} Their report concluded that a ZUNI rocket on the portside TER-7 on external stores station 2 of F-4B No. 110 of VF-11, spotted on the extreme starboard quarter of the flight deck, struck A-4 No. 405, piloted by Lt. Cmdr. Fred D. White, on the port side of the aft deck. The accidental firing was due to the simultaneous malfunction of three components: CA42282 pylon electrical disconnect, TER-7 safety switch, and LAU-10/A shorting device. They concluded that the CA42282 pylon electrical disconnect had a design defect, and found that the TER-7 safety pin was poorly designed, making it easy to confuse with ordnance pins used in the AERO-7 Sparrow Launcher, which if used by mistake would not operate effectively.<ref name=\"invespart2\">{{cite web|title=Official investigation Part 3|url=http://www.jag.navy.mil/library/investigations/USS%20FORRESTAL%20FIRE%2012%20AUG%2069%20PT%203.pdf|publisher=Judge Advocate General|accessdate=27 August 2018|date=19 September 1967|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920103030/http://www.jag.navy.mil/library/investigations/USS%20FORRESTAL%20FIRE%2012%20AUG%2069%20PT%203.pdf|archive-date=20 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Drydock repairs ===\n\nWhen temporary repairs in the Philippines were completed, ''Forrestal'' departed on 11 August, arriving at [[Naval Station Mayport]] in Florida on 12 September to disembark the remaining aircraft and air group personnel stationed in Florida.

It had to be cut from the ship while being supported by the shipyard's [[Crane (machine)#Hammerhead|hammerhead crane]]. The carrier occupied [[drydock]] number 8 from 21 September 1967, until 10 February 1968, displacing {{USS|John King|DDG-3|6}}, an oil tanker, and a minesweeper that were occupying the drydock. During the post-fire refit, {{convert|175 |feet}} of the flight deck was replaced, along with about 200 compartments on the 03, 02, 01 decks. The ship's four aft [[5\"/54 caliber Mark 42 gun]]s were removed. The forward four guns had been removed prior to 1962. The repair cost about $72 million (equal to more than $602 million in 2019 dollars), and took nearly five months to complete.<ref>{{cite web |title=The USS ''Forrestal'' (CVA-59) fire and munition explosions {{!}} The History of Insensitive Munitions |url=http://www.insensitivemunitions.org/history/the-uss-forrestal-cva-59-fire-and-munition-explosions/ |website=www.insensitivemunitions.org |accessdate=13 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726103548/http://www.insensitivemunitions.org/history/the-uss-forrestal-cva-59-fire-and-munition-explosions/ |archive-date=26 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=readiness/><ref>{{cite web |title=Aircraft Carrier Photo Index: USS ''Forrestal'' (CVA-59) |url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/02/cv-59/59f-09.htm |website=www.navsource.org |accessdate=26 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726234122/http://www.navsource.org/archives/02/cv-59/59f-09.htm |archive-date=26 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Beling reassigned ===\n\n[[John Kingsman Beling|Captain Beling]], as an Admiral-selectee, received orders to report to Washington, D.C., as the Director of Development Programs in Naval Operations, reporting to Chief of Naval Operations Admiral [[Thomas H.

He had Beling assigned to his staff so he could issue a letter of reprimand. By holding Beling responsible he would effectively end his career. Holmes attached the reprimand to the final report, but when Admiral Moorer endorsed the report, he ordered Admiral Holmes to rescind and remove the reprimand.<ref name=\"freeman\" /><ref name=skyhawk/>\n\nThe investigation panel recommended several changes to safety procedures aboard carriers.

{"title_page": "Gifted education", "text_new": "'''Gifted education''' (also known as '''gifted and talented education''' ('''GATE'''), '''talented and gifted''' programs ('''TAG'''), or '''G/T education''') is a broad group of special practices, procedures, and theories used in the education of children who have been identified as [[Intellectual giftedness|gifted or talented]].\n\nThe main approaches to gifted education are enrichment and [[Academic acceleration|acceleration]]. An enrichment program teaches additional, related material, but keeps the student progressing through the curriculum at the same rate as other students.  For example, after the gifted students have completed the normal work in the curriculum, an enrichment program might provide them with additional information about a subject. An acceleration program advances the student through the standard curriculum faster than normal. This is done through many different approaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.davidsongifted.org/Search-Database/entry/A10313|title=Types of Acceleration|website=www.davidsongifted.org|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref>\n\nThere is no standard global definition of what a gifted student is; multiple definitions exist. Most definitions select the students who are the most skilled or talented in a given area, e.g., the students with the most skill or talent in music, language, logical reasoning, or mathematics.  The percentage of students selected varies, generally with 10% or fewer being selected for gifted education programs.  However, since students vary in their aptitudes and achievements, a student who is not gifted in one area, such as music, may be considered gifted in another, such as language.  Consequently, even if all programs agreed to include only the top 5% of students in their area, more than just 5% of students would be identified as gifted.\n\n==Forms==\nAttempts to provide gifted education can be classified in several ways. Most gifted students benefit from a combination of approaches at different times.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Acceleration===\nPupils are advanced to a higher-level class covering material more suited to their abilities and preparedness. This may take the form of [[Grade skipping|skipping grades]] or completing the normal curriculum in a shorter-than-normal period of time (\"telescoping\").  Subject acceleration (also called partial acceleration) is a flexible approach that can advance a student in one subject, such as mathematics or language, without changing other studies, such as [[history]] or science. This type of acceleration is usually based upon achievement testing, rather than [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]].\n\nSome colleges offer [[Early entrance to college|early entrance programs]] that give gifted younger students the opportunity to attend college early. In the U.S., many [[community colleges]] allow advanced students to enroll with the consent of school officials and the pupil's parents.\n\n[[Academic acceleration|Acceleration]] presents gifted children with academic material from established curricula that is commensurate with their ability and preparedness, and for this reason is a low-cost option from the perspective of the school. This may result in a small number of children taking classes targeted at older children. For the majority of gifted students, acceleration is beneficial both academically and socially.<ref>Nicholas Colangelo, N., Assouline, S., and Gross, M., A Nation Deceived:How Schools Hold Back America's Brightest Students, University of Iowa, Volume I, p. 2</ref>  Some advocates have argued that the disadvantages of being retained in a standard mixed-ability classroom are substantially worse than any shortcomings of acceleration. For example, [[psychologist]] Miraca Gross reports: \"the majority of these children [retained in a typical classroom] are socially rejected [by their peers with typical academic talents], isolated, and deeply unhappy. Children of [[IQ]] 180+ who are retained in the regular classroom are even more seriously at risk and experience severe emotional distress.\"<ref>[http://www.gt-cybersource.org/Record.aspx?NavID=2_0&rid=10586 Factors in the social adjustment and social acceptability of extremely gifted children<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190517/http://www.gt-cybersource.org/Record.aspx?NavID=2_0&rid=10586|date=2007-09-27}}</ref> These accelerated children should be placed together in one class if possible.<ref>Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., The Relationship of Grouping Practices to the Education of the Gifted and Talented Learner, (The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, 1991)</ref> Research suggests that acceleration might have an impact long after students graduate from high school. For example, one study shows that high-IQ individuals who experienced full-grade acceleration earned higher incomes as adults.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Liu|first2=Jonathan K|date=2017|title=Income differences among grade skippers and non-grade skippers across genders in the Terman sample, 1936\u20131976|journal=Learning and Instruction|volume=47|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2016.10.004|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Cluster Grouping===\n[[Cluster grouping]] is the gathering of four to six gifted and talented and/or high achieving students in a single classroom for the entire school day.  Cluster teachers are specially trained in differentiating for gifted learners.  Clusters are typically used in upper elementary grades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Within a cluster group, instruction may include enrichment and extensions, higher-order thinking skills, pretesting and differentiation, compacting, an accelerated pace, and more complexity in content\n\n===Colloquium===\nLike acceleration, colloquium provides advanced material for high school students. In colloquium, students take [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects than students in AP classes. Students in colloquium also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes in a different way than students enrolled in AP classes do. Colloquium is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with another subject. For example, if the students are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from [[The Scarlet Letter]] in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take [[Advanced Placement]] courses in math and science and vice versa.\n\n===Compacting===\nIn compacting, the regular school material is compacted by pretesting the student to establish which skills and content have already been mastered.  Pretests can be presented on a daily basis (pupils doing the most difficult items on a worksheet first and skipping the rest if they are performed correctly), or before a week or longer unit of instructional time.  When a student demonstrates an appropriate level of proficiency, further repetitive practice can be safely skipped, thus reducing boredom and freeing up time for the student to work on more challenging material.\n\n===Enrichment===\nOn the primary school level, students spend all class time with their peers, but receive extra material to challenge them. Enrichment may be as simple as a modified [[assignment (education)|assignment]] provided by the regular classroom teacher, or it might include formal programs such as [[Odyssey of the Mind]], [[Destination Imagination]] or academic competitions such as [[Brain Bowl]], [[Future Problem Solving]], [[Science Olympiad]], [[National History Day]], [[science fair]]s, or [[spelling bee]]s. Programmes of enrichment activities may also be organised outside the school day (e.g. the ASCEND project in secondary science education<ref>Taber, K. S. (2007). Enriching School Science for the Gifted Learner. London: Gatsby Science Enhancement Programme.</ref>). This work is done in addition to, and not instead of, any regular school work assigned. Critics of this approach argue that it requires gifted students to do more work instead of the same amount at an advanced level. On the secondary school level sometimes an option is to take more courses like [[English studies|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Latin]], [[Philosophy]], [[Science]], etc., or to engage in extra curricular activities.  Some perceive there to be a necessary choice between enrichment and acceleration, as if the two were mutually exclusive alternatives.  However, other researchers see the two as complements to each other.<ref>Assouline, S. and Lupkowski-Shoplik, A., ''Developing Math Talent: A Guide for Educating Gifted And Advanced Learners in Math'' (Prufrock Press), 2005.</ref>\n\n===Full-time separate classes or schools===\n''See also: [[List of gifted and talented programmes]]''\n\nSome gifted students are educated in either a separate class or a separate school. These classes and schools are sometimes called \"congregated gifted programs\" or \"dedicated gifted programs.\"\n\nSome independent schools have a primary mission to serve the needs of the academically gifted. Such schools are relatively scarce and often difficult for families to locate.  One resource for locating gifted schools in the United States can be found on the [[National Association for Gifted Children]]'s \"Resource Directory\" accessible through their home page. Such schools often need to work to guard their mission from occasional charges of elitism, support the professional growth and training of their staff, write curriculum units that are specifically designed to meet the social, emotional, and academic talents of their students, and educate their parent population at all ages.\n\nSome gifted and talented classes offer self-directed or individualized studies, where the students lead a class themselves and decide on their own task, tests, and all other assignments. These separate classes or schools tend to be more expensive than regular classes, due to smaller class sizes and lower student-to-teacher rations. [[Not-for-profit]] (non-profit) schools often can offer lower costs than for-profit schools.  Either way, they are in high demand and parents often have to pay part of the costs.\nhey boys.\n\n===Hobby===\nActivities such as [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[creative writing]], [[sport]], [[computer games]], [[chess]], [[music]], [[dance]], foreign languages, and [[art]] give an extra intellectual challenge outside of school hours.\n\n===Homeschooling in the US===\nAn umbrella term encompassing myriad educational options for gifted children: part-time schooling; school at home; classes, groups, mentors and tutors; and [[unschooling]]. In many US states, the population of gifted students who are being [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]] is rising quite rapidly, as school districts responding to budgetary issues and standards-based policies are cutting what limited gifted education programs remain in existence, and families seek educational opportunities that are tailored to each child's unique needs\n\n=== Pull-Out ===\nGifted students are [[Gifted Pull-out|pulled out]] of a heterogeneous classroom to spend a portion of their time in a [[gifted class]]. These programs vary widely, from carefully designed half-day academic programs to a single hour each week of educational challenges. Generally, these programs are ineffective at promoting academic advancement unless the material covered contains extensions and enrichment to the core curriculum.  The majority of pull-out programs include an assortment of critical thinking drills, creative exercises, and subjects typically not introduced in standard curricula. Much of the material introduced in gifted pull-out programs deals with the study of [[logic]], and its application to fields ranging from [[philosophy]] to [[mathematics]]. Students are encouraged to apply these empirical reasoning skills to every aspect of their education both in and outside of class.\n\n===Self-pacing===\nSelf-pacing methods, such as the [[Montessori Method]], use flexible grouping practices to allow children to advance at their own pace. Self-pacing can be beneficial for all children and is not targeted specifically at those identified as gifted or talented, but it can allow children to learn at a highly accelerated rate. Directed Studies are usually based on self-pacing.\n\n===Summer Enrichment Programs (United States)===\nThese offer a variety of courses that mainly take place in the summer. Summer schools are popular in the United States. Entrance fees are required for such programs, and programs typically focus on one subject, or class, for the duration of the camp.\n\nSeveral examples of this type of program are:\n\n*[[Center for Talented Youth]]\n*[[CTYI]]\n*[[GERI: Gifted Education Resource Institute, Purdue University]]\n*[[The Johns Hopkins University]]\n\nWithin the United States, in addition to programs designed by the state, some counties also choose to form their own Talented and Gifted Programs.  Sometimes this means that an individual county will form its own TAG program; sometimes several counties will come together if not enough gifted students are present in a single county. Generally, a TAG program focuses on a specific age group, particularly the local TAG programs. This could mean elementary age, high school age, or by years such as ages 9 through 14.\n\nThese classes are generally organized so that students have the opportunity to choose several courses they wish to participate in. Courses offered often vary between subjects, but are not typically strictly academically related to that subject. For example, a TAG course that could be offered in history could be the students learning about a certain event and then acting it out in a performance to be presented to parents on the last night of the program. These courses are designed to challenge the students to think in new ways and not merely to be lectured as they are in school.\n\n==Identifying gifted children==\nThe term \"Gifted Assessment\" is typically applied to a process of using norm-referenced psychometric tests administered by a qualified psychologist or psychometrist with the goal of identifying children whose intellectual functioning is significantly advanced as compared to the appropriate reference group (i.e., individuals of their age, gender, and country). The cut-off score for differentiating this group is usually determined by district school boards and can differ slightly from area to area, however, the majority defines this group as students scoring in the top 2 percentiles on one of the accepted tests of intellectual (cognitive) functioning or IQ. Some school boards also require a child to demonstrate advanced academic standing on individualized achievement tests and/ or through their classroom performance. Identifying gifted children is often difficult but is very important because typical school teachers are not qualified to educate a gifted student. This can lead to a situation where a gifted child is bored, underachieves and misbehaves in class.<ref name=\"ERIC\">{{cite book|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED530599|title=Contemporary Intellectual Assessment: Theories, Tests, and Issues.

However it does not distinguish well among those found to be gifted. Therefore, examiners prefer using a variety of tests to first identify giftedness and then further differentiate. This is often done by using individual IQ tests and then group or individual achievement tests. There is no standard consensus on which tests to use, as each test is better suited for a certain role.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /><ref name=\"assess\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guilfordpress.co.uk/books/details/9781462511211/|title=Assessing Intelligence in Children and Adolescents|last=Kranzler|first=John H. ; Floyd, Randy G.|work=Guilford Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201213/http://www.guilfordpress.co.uk/books/details/9781462511211/|archive-date=2014-10-16|url-status=dead|access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref>\n\nThe two most popular tests for identifying giftedness in the school-age population are the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC IV]] and the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales|SB5]]. The [[Wechsler Individual Achievement Test|WIAT III]] is considered the most popular academic achievement test to determine a child's aggregate learned knowledge.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /><ref name=\"assess\" />\n\nAlthough a newer WISC version, the WISC V, was developed in late 2014, the WISC IV is still the most commonplace test. It has been translated into several languages including Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, French, German, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Italian. The WISC-IV assesses a child's cognitive abilities, with respect to age group. Coupled with results from other tests, the WISC accurately depicts a child's developmental and psychological needs for the future.<ref name=\"ERIC\" />\n\nThe SB5 is an intelligence test that determines cognitive abilities and can be administered to persons in virtually any age group. It assesses a series of intelligence indicators including fluid reasoning, general knowledge, quantitative reasoning, spatial processing, and working memory. The SB5 makes use of both verbal and nonverbal testing.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Waddell|first=Deborah D.|date=1979-11-30|title=The Stanford-Binet: An Evaluation of the Technical Data Available Since the 1972 Restandardization.|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ233903|journal=ERIC|volume=18|issue=3|pages=203\u20139}}</ref>\n\nThe WIAT-III cannot assess all components of learned knowledge, but does give an understanding of a child's ability to acquire skills and knowledge through formal education. This test measures aspects of the learning process that take place in a traditional school setting in reading, writing, math, and oral language. Although the WIAT-III tests a wide range of material, it is designed primarily to assess children's learning before adolescence.<ref name=\"ERIC\" />\n\nVersions of these tests exist for each age group. However it is recommended to begin assessment as early as possible, with approximately eight years of age being the optimal time to test. Testing allows identification of specific needs of students and help to plan an education early.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /><ref name=\"poppies\" />\n\nOut-of-group achievement testing (such as taking the SAT or ACT early) can also help to identify these students early on (see [[Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth|SMPY]]) and is implemented by various talent search programs in use by education programs. Out-of-group testing can also help to differentiate children who have scored in the highest percentiles in a single IQ test.<ref name=\"assess\" />\n\nTesting alone cannot accurately identify every gifted child.  Teacher and parent nominations are essential additions to the objective information provided by grades and scores.  Parents are encouraged to keep portfolios of their children's work, and documentation of their early signs of gifted behavior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaegt.net.au/?page_id=753|title=The Identification of Gifted and Talented Students {{!}} AAEGT - Australian Association for the Education of the Gifted and Talented|website=www.aaegt.net.au|access-date=2016-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.raisingwizards.com/#!characteristics-of-giftedness/cpqu|title=Characteristics of Gifted Children|last=Natcharian|first=Lisa|date=2015|website=Raising Wizards|publisher=Raising Wizards|access-date=May 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Studies of giftedness==\nThe development of early intelligence tests by [[Alfred Binet]] led to the Stanford-Binet IQ test developed by Lewis Terman. Terman began long-term studies of gifted children with a view to checking if the popular view \"early ripe, early rot\" was true. The Terman Genetic Studies of Genius longitudinal study has been described by successor researchers who conducted the study after Terman's death and also by an independent researcher who had full access to the study files.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Terman's Kids: The Groundbreaking Study of How the Gifted Grow Up|last=Shurkin|first=Joel|publisher=Little, Brown|year=1992|isbn=978-0-316-78890-8|location=Boston (MA)|ref=harv|lay-url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-31/books/bk-1247_1_lewis-terman/2|laydate=2 June 2013|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/termanskids00joel}}</ref>\n\nModern studies by James and Kulik<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvCDzqIH3ysC|title=Grouping and Acceleration Practices in Gifted Education - Linda Brody, National Association for Gifted Children (U.S.) - Google Boeken|last1=Brody|first1=Linda E.|date=2004-03-06|isbn=9781412904292|accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref> conclude that gifted students benefit ''least'' from working in a mixed-level class, and benefit ''most'' from learning with other similarly advanced students in accelerated or enriched classes.\n\n===Definition of giftedness===\nEducational authorities differ on the definition of giftedness: even when using the same [[IQ]] test to define giftedness, they may disagree on what gifted means - one may take up the top 2 percent of the population, another might take up the top 5 percent of a population, which may be within a state, district, or school. Within a single school district, there can be substantial differences in the distribution of measured IQ. (The IQ for the top percentile at a high-performing school may be quite different from that at a lower performing school.)\n\n=== Dr Peter Marshall ===\nDr Peter Marshall obtained his doctorate in 1995, for research carried out in this field in the years from 1986. At the time, he was the first Research Director of The Mensa Foundation for Gifted Children. His work challenged the difficult childhood hypothesis, concluding that gifted children, by and large, do not have any more difficult childhoods than mainstream children and, in fact, that where they do, their giftedness probably helps them cope better than mainstream children. His thesis is published under the title Growing up Gifted \u2013 Triangulations with the Gulbenkian Project<ref>Marshall, P. (1995) Growing Up Gifted: Triangulations with the Gulbenkian Project, Ph.D. Thesis: University of Manchester</ref> and provided the material for his subsequent book Educating a Gifted Child<ref>Marshall, P (2013) Educating a Gifted Child, London: Oakley Books, {{ISBN|9780956978479}}(3).</ref>\n\nHe has acted as consultant to schools and local education authorities such as Cumbria County Council and Blackburn, Hyndburn and Ribble Valley Health Authority and Thorncliffe Grammar in Barrow in Furness<ref>Mensa Magazine, March 2014, p.19</ref> and he has been chosen to give the Mensa Lecture on the Subject at Trinity College Cambridge in August 2018.<ref>Mensa Magazine, June 2018,p.11</ref>\n\nIn his book,  Educating a Gifted Child, he analyses a large range of causes of underachievement, explains the social attitudes to giftedness, lists the range of non-intellective aspects of giftedness, and explores the concepts of intelligence and IQ tests.\n\nDr Marshall is the President of The International Association for High Ability (IAFHA),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iafha.com|title=The International Association for High Ability \u2013 A resource site for High Ability Children and Adults}}</ref> which aims to help gifted individuals from all backgrounds to fulfil their potential for the benefit of themselves, their society and the human race in general.\n\nIn ''Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide'', Susan K. Johnsen (2004) explains that gifted children all exhibit the potential for high performance in the areas included in the United States federal definition of gifted and talented students:\n\n{{quotation|The term 'gifted and talented' when used in respect to students, children, or youth means [those who show] [[evidence]] of high performance capability in areas such as [[intellectual]], [[creativity|creative]], [[artistic]], or [[leadership]] capacity, or in specific academic fields, and who require services or activities not ordinarily provided by the [[school]] in order to fully develop such capabilities.|P.L. 103\u2013382, Title XIV, p. 388}}\n\nThe National Association for Gifted Children in the United States defines giftedness as:<ref>National Association for Gifted Children. (2011). Redefining giftedness for a new century: Shifting the paradigm [Position Paper]. http://www.nagc.org/sites/default/files/Position%20Statement/Redefining%20Giftedness%20for%20a%20New%20Century.pdf</ref>\n\n{{quotation|Gifted individuals are those who demonstrate outstanding levels of aptitude (defined as an exceptional ability to reason and learn) or competence (documented performance or achievement in top 10% or rarer) in one or more domains. Domains include any structured area of activity with its own symbol system (e.g., mathematics, music, language) and/or set of sensorimotor skills (e.g., painting, dance, sports).\n\nThe development of ability or talent is a lifelong process. It can be evident in young children as exceptional performance on tests and/or other measures of ability or as a rapid rate of learning, compared to other students of the same age, or in actual achievement in a domain. As individuals mature through childhood to adolescence, however, achievement and high levels of motivation in the domain become the primary characteristics of their giftedness. Various factors can either enhance or inhibit the development and expression of abilities.}}\n\nThis definition has been adopted in part or completely by the majority of the states in the United States. Most have some definition similar to that used in the [[State of Texas]], whose definition states:\n\n{{quotation|[The phrase] 'gifted and talented student' means a child or youth who performs at or shows the potential for performing at a remarkably high level of accomplishment when compared to others of the same age, experience, or environment, and who:\n*exhibits high performance capability in an intellectual, creative, or artistic area;\n*possesses an unusual capacity for leadership; or\n*excels in a specific academic field.|74th legislature of the State of Texas, Chapter 29, Subchapter D, Section 29.121}}\n\nThe major characteristics of these definitions are (a) the diversity of areas in which performance may be exhibited (e.g., intellectual, creative, artistic, leadership, academic), (b) the comparison with other groups (e.g., those in general education classrooms or of the same age, experience, or environment), and (c) the use of terms that imply a need for development of the gift (e.g., capability and potential).\n\n====Reliance on IQ====\nIn her book, ''Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide'', Susan K. Johnsen (2004) writes that schools should use a variety of measures of students' capability and potential when identifying gifted children. These measures may include portfolios of student work, classroom observations, achievement measures, and intelligence scores. Most educational professionals accept that no single measure can be used in isolation to accurately identify every gifted child.\n\nEven if the notion of IQ is generally useful for identifying academically talented students who would benefit from further services, the question of the cutoff point for giftedness is still important. As noted above, different authorities often define giftedness differently.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Identification: The Theory and Practice of Identifying Students for Gifted and Talented Education Services|last1=Lohman|first1=David F.|last2=Foley Nicpon|first2=Megan|publisher=Prufrock|year=2012|isbn=978-1-931280-17-4|editor-last=Hunsaker|editor-first=Scott|location=Waco (TX)|pages=287\u2013386|chapter=Chapter 12: Ability Testing & Talent Identification|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://faculty.education.uiowa.edu/docs/default-source/dlohman/ability-testing-and-talent-identification.pdf?sfvrsn=0|lay-url=http://www.prufrock.com/Identification-The-Theory-and-Practice-of-Identifying-Students-for-Gifted-and-Talented-Education-Services-P1816.aspx|laydate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Classical era to Renaissance===\nGifted and talented education dates back thousands of years. [[Plato]] (c. 427\u2013c. 347 BCE) advocated providing specialized education for intellectually gifted young men and women.<ref name=\"bce\">Colangelo, N., & Davis, G. (1997).

Between 1888 and 1894, Galton tested more than 7,500 individuals to measure their natural intellectual abilities. He found that if a parent deviates from the norm, so will the child, but to a lesser extent than the parent.<ref>\"Francis Galton, Sir.\" ''World of Sociology''. 2 vols. Gale Group, 2001.</ref> This was one of the earliest observed examples of [[regression toward the mean]]. Galton believed that individuals could be improved through interventions in [[heredity]], a movement he named [[eugenics]]. He categorized individuals as [[gifted]], capable, [[average]], or degenerate, and he recommended breeding between the first two categories, and forced abstinence for the latter two. His term for the most intelligent and talented people was \"eminent\". After studying England's most prominent families, Galton concluded that one's eminence was directly related to the individual's direct line of heredity.<ref>\"Francis Galton.\" ''Science and Its Times'', '''5''': 1800\u20131899. Gale Group, 2000.</ref>\n\n===Lewis Terman===\nAt [[Stanford University]] in 1918, [[Lewis Terman]] adapted [[Alfred Binet]]'s Binet-Simon [[intelligence]] test into the [[Stanford-Binet]] test, and introduced [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) scoring for the test. According to Terman, the IQ was one's mental age compared to one's chronological age, based on the mental age norms he compiled after studying a sample of children.<ref>\"Lewis Madison Terman.\" ''American Decades''. Gale Research, 1998.</ref> He defined intelligence as \"the ability to carry on abstract thinking\".<ref>\"Lewis Madison Terman.\" ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'', 2nd ed. 17 Vols. Gale Research, 1998.</ref> During [[World War I]] Terman was a commissioned officer of the United States Army, and collaborated with other psychologists in developing intelligence tests for new recruits to the armed forces. For the first time, intelligence testing was given to a wide population of drafted soldiers.\n\nAfter the war, Terman undertook an extensive [[longitudinal study]] of 643 children in California who scored at IQ 140 or above, the [[Genetic Studies of Genius]], continuing to evaluate them throughout their lives. Subjects of these case studies were called \"Termites\" and the studies contacted the children in 1921, and again in 1930, 1947, and 1959 after his death. Terman's studies have to date been the most extensive on high-functioning children, and are still quoted in psychological literature today. Terman claimed to have disproven common misconceptions, such as that highly intelligent children were prone to ill physical and mental health, that their intelligence burned out early in their lives, or that they either achieved greatly or underachieved.<ref>\"Lewis Madison Terman.\"Dictionary of American Biography, Supplement 6: 1956-1960.

The program for students, who, through an [[IQ test]], ranked in the Very Superior Range; falling into Gifted or Genius. For each of the three divisions, there are 2 schools offering GATE, one for the North Side of the city (CBE Areas I, II and III) and one for the South Side (CBE Areas IV and V).

Through project-based learning, students are challenged to use higher order thinking skills. Another focus of the program is autonomous learning; students are encouraged to self-monitor, self-reflect and seek out enrichment opportunities. Entrance to the program is initiated through referral followed by a review by a screening committee. IQ tests are used but not exclusively. Students are also assessed by performance, cognitive ability tests, and motivation. There are 4 MACC's in Vancouver: grade 4/5 and grade 6/7 at Sir William Osler Elementary, grade 5/6/7 at Tecumseh Elementary, and a French Immersion grade 5/6/7 at Kerrisdale Elementary.\n\nAt a lower scale, the [[Peel District School Board]] operates its [[Regional Enhanced Program]] at [[The Woodlands School (Mississauga)|The Woodlands School]], [[Lorne Park Secondary School]], [[Glenforest Secondary School]], [[Heart Lake Secondary School]] and [[Humberview Secondary School]] to provide students an opportunity to develop and explore skills in a particular area of interest. Students identified as gifted (which the PDSB classifies as \"enhanced\") may choose to attend the nearest of these high schools instead of their assigned home high school. In the Regional Enhanced Program, enhanced students take core courses (primarily, but not limited to English, mathematics, and the sciences) in an environment surrounded by fellow enhanced peers. The classes often contain modified assignments that encourage students to be creative.\n\n===Ecuador===\nIn Ecuador, [http://www.cedapecuador.com/ Centro Ecuatoriano para el Desarrollo del Alto Potencial] started in 2018 as the first all around gifted children educational program in the country.

In his introduction to the tenth anniversary edition of his classic work Frames of Mind. The [[theory of multiple intelligences]], he says:\n\nIn the heyday of the psychometric and behaviorist eras, it was generally believed that intelligence was a single entity that was inherited; and that human beings - initially a blank slate - could be trained to learn anything, provided that it was presented in an appropriate way. Nowadays an increasing number of researchers believe precisely the opposite; that there exists a multitude of intelligences, quite independent of each other; that each intelligence has its own strengths and constraints; that the mind is far from unencumbered at birth; and that it is unexpectedly difficult to teach things that go against early 'naive' theories of that challenge the natural lines of force within an intelligence and its matching domains. (Gardner 1993: xxiii)\n\n[[Howard Gardner]] initially formulated a list of seven intelligences, but later added an eighth, that are intrinsic to the human mind: linguistic, logical/mathematical, visual/spatial, musical, bodily kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal, and naturalist intelligences.\nIt has become widely accepted at both local and international scales to adopt a broad definition of giftedness using multiple criteria to formulate gifted education policy.\n\n;The Mission and Principles of Gifted Education Policy in [[Hong Kong]]\n\nThe mission of gifted education is to systematically and strategically explore and develop the potential of gifted students.

The motto is motivating intelligence for social change. The school, located in central Pune, admits 80 students each year, after thorough testing, which includes two written papers and an interview. The psychology department of Jnana Prabodhini has worked on J. P. Guilford's model of Intelligence.\n\n===Iran===\n[[National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents]] ([[NODET]], also known as [[SAMPAD]],\nPersian: \u0633\u0645\u067e\u0627\u062f, which stands for \u0633\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u06cc \u067e\u0631\u0648\u0631\u0634 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u062e\u0634\u0627\u0646 in Persian) are national Middle and High Schools in Iran developed\nspecifically for the development of exceptionally talented students in Iran. [[NODET]] was first\nestablished in 1976 and re-established in 1987.\n\nAdmission to NODET schools is selective and based on a comprehensive nationwide entrance\nexamination procedure.\n\nEvery year thousands of students apply to enter the schools, from which less\nthan 5% are chosen for the 99 middle schools and 98 high-schools within the country. All applicants must have a minimum GPA of 19 (out of 20) for attending the entrance exam. In 2006, 87,081 boys and 83,596 girls from 56 cities applied, and finally 6,888 students were accepted for the 2007 middle schools. The admission process is much more selective in big cities like [[Tehran]], [[Isfahan]], [[Mashhad]] and [[Karaj]] in\nwhich less than 150 students are accepted after two exams and interviews, out of over 50,000\napplicants.\n\nTop schools of NODET (and also Iran's top) are [[Allameh Helli High Schools|Allameh Helli High School]] and [[Shahid Madani High School]] (in Tabriz), [[Farzanegan High School]] located in [[Tehran]], [[Shahid Ejei High School]] located in [[Isfahan]], [[Shahid Hashemi Nejad High School]] located in [[Mashhad]] and [[Shahid Soltani School]] located in [[Karaj]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.\nCourses taught in NODET schools are college-level in fields such as [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]] and [[English Language]]. The best teachers of the ministry of education are chosen mainly by the school's principal and faculty to teach at NODET schools. Schools mainly have only two majors (normal schools have three majors), math-physics and experimental sciences (like math-physics but having biology as the main course). Even though social sciences are taught, there is much less emphasis on these subjects due to the lack of interest in both students and the organization.\n\n===Norway===\nNorway has no centre for gifted or talented children or youth. However, there is the privately run [[Barratt Due Institute of Music]] who offers musical kindergarten, evening school and college for highly talented young musicians. There is also the public secondary school for talents in ballet at Rusel\u00f8kka school in Oslo, who admits the 15 top dancers. On athletics, Privately run Norwegian Elite Sports Gymnasium (NTG) offers secondary school for talents in five locations in Norway.

The center is managed by the [[Korean Educational Development Institute|Korean Educational Development Institute (KEDI)]].  Presently twenty-five universities conduct gifted and talented education research in some form; for example, [[Seoul National University]] is conducting Science-gifted Education Center, and [[KAIST]] is conducting Global Institute For Talented Education (GIFTED), the Korean Society for the Gifted and Talented (\ud55c\uad6d\uc601\uc7ac\uad50\uc721\ud559\ud68c) and the Korean Society for the Gifted (\uc0ac\ub2e8\ubc95\uc778 \ud55c\uad6d\uc601\uc7ac\ud559\ud68c).\n\nEducation for the scientifically gifted in Korea can be traced back to the 1983 government founding of [[Gyeonggi Science High School]].<ref>{{cite web\n| last =Kim\n| first =H.J.\n| authorlink =\n| title = A comparative study on gifted education for mathematics in Korea and foreign countries.\n| work = [[Dankook University]]\n| publisher = Dankook University (unpublished master's thesis)\n| year = 2006\n| url =\n| doi =\n}}</ref> Following three later additions ([[Korea Science Academy|Korea Science Academy of KAIST]]; [[Seoul Science High School]] and [[Daegu Science High School]]), approximately 1,500, or 1 in 1,300 (0.08 percent) of high school students are currently enrolled among its four gifted academies.  By 2008, about 50,000, or 1 in 140 (0.7 percent) of elementary and middle school students participated in education for the gifted. In 2005, a program was undertaken to identify and educate gifted children of socioeconomically underprivileged people.  Since then, more than 1,800 students have enrolled in the program.\n\nGradually the focus has expanded over time to cover informatics, arts, physical education, creative writing, humanities, and social sciences, leading to the 2008 creation of the government funded [[Korean National Institute for the Gifted Arts]].  To pluralize the need for trained professional educators, teachers undergo basic training (60 hours), advanced training (120 hours), and overseas training (60 hours) to acquire skills necessary to teach gifted youth.\n\n===Singapore===\n{{Main article|Gifted Education Programme (Singapore)}}\n\nIn Singapore, the [[Gifted Education Programme (Singapore)|Gifted Education Programme]] (GEP) was introduced in 1984 and is offered in the upper primary years (Primary 4\u20136, ages 10\u201312).

As such, funding for services is not consistent from state to state, and although students may be identified, the extent to which they receive services can vary widely depending upon a state or district's [[budget]]. \n\nAlthough schools with higher enrollment of minority or low-income students are just as likely to offer gifted programs as other schools, differing enrollment rates across racial and ethnic groups has raised concerns about equity in gifted education in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yaluma |first1=Christopher |last2=Tyner |first2=Adam |title=Is There a Gifted Gap?

This can be valuable for all students, especially those who have been grouped with much older students, or who have been rejected by their same-age, but academically typical, [[peer group|peers]].\n\n;[[Differentiated instruction|Differentiation]]\n:Modification of a gifted student\u2019s curriculum to accommodate their specific needs. This may include changing the content or ability level of the material.\n\n;Heterogeneous grouping\n:A strategy that groups students of varied ability, preparedness, or accomplishment in a single classroom environment. Usually this terminology is applied to groupings of students in a particular grade, especially in elementary school. For example, students in fifth grade would be heterogeneously grouped in math if they were randomly assigned to classes instead of being grouped by demonstrated subject mastery.  Heterogeneous grouping is sometimes claimed to provide a more effective instructional environment for less prepared students.\n\n;Homogeneous grouping\n:A strategy that groups students by specific ability, preparedness, or interest within a subject area. Usually this terminology is applied to groupings of students in a particular grade, especially in elementary school.  For example, students in fifth grade would be homogeneously grouped in math if they were assigned to classes based on demonstrated subject mastery rather than being randomly assigned. Homogeneous grouping can provide more effective instruction for the most prepared students.\n\n;[[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP)\n:A written document that addresses a student's specific individual needs. It may specify accommodations, materials, or classroom instruction. IEPs are often created for students with disabilities, who are required by law to have an IEP when appropriate. Most states are not required to have IEPs for students who are only identified as gifted. Some students may be intellectually gifted in addition to having learning and/or attentional disabilities, and may have an IEP that includes, for instance, enrichment activities as a means of alleviating [[boredom]] or [[frustration]], or as a reward for on-task behavior. In order to warrant such an IEP, a student needs to be diagnosed with a separate emotional or learning [[disability]] that is not simply the result of being unchallenged in a typical [[classroom]]. These are also known as Individual Program Plans, or IPPs.\n\n==Justification==\nResearchers and practitioners in gifted education contend that, if education were to follow the medical maxim of \"first, do no harm,\" then no further justification would be required for providing resources for gifted education as they believe gifted children to be [[Gifted At-Risk|at-risk]]. The notion that gifted children are \"at-risk\" was publicly declared in the [[Marland report|Marland Report]] in 1972:\n<blockquote>\nGifted and Talented children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs served by the Office of Education.\n\n(pp. xi-xii)<ref name = marland/></blockquote>\nThree decades later, a similar statement was made by researchers in the field: <blockquote>\nNational efforts to increase the availability of a variety of appropriate instructional and out-of-school provisions must be a high priority since ''research indicates that many of the emotional or social difficulties gifted students experience disappear when their educational climates are adapted to their level and pace of learning''.\" [emphasis added]<ref>''The Social and Emotional Development of Gifted Children: What Do We Know?'', Edited by Maureen Neihart, Sally M. Reis, Nancy M. Robinson, and Sidney M. Moon; National Association of Gifted Children (Prufrock Press, Inc.), 2002, p. 286.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Controversies==\nControversies concerning gifted education are varied and often highly politicized. They are as basic as agreeing upon the appropriateness of the term 'gifted' or the definition of 'giftedness'. For example, does 'giftedness' refer to performance or potential (such as inherent intelligence)? Many students do not exhibit both at the same time.\n\nMeasures of general intelligence also remain controversial. Early IQ tests were notorious for producing higher IQ scores for privileged races and classes and lower scores for disadvantaged subgroups. Although IQ tests have changed substantially over the past half century, and many objections to the early tests have been addressed by 'culture neutral' tests (such as the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven test]]), IQ testing remains controversial. Regardless of the tests used to identify children for gifted programs, many school districts in the United States still have disproportionately more White and Asian American students enrolled in their gifted programs, while Hispanic and African American students are usually underrepresented.<ref>Yoon, S. Y., & Gentry, M. (2009) Racial and ethnic representation in gifted programs: Current status of and implications for gifted Asian American students. ''Gifted Child Quarterly, 53'', 121-136. doi:10.1177/0016986208330564</ref> However, research shows that this may be not be a fault of tests, but rather a result of the [[achievement gap in the United States]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Anderson|first2=Braydon|last3=Johnson|first3=Alyce O.|year=2013|title=The impact of race and ethnicity on the identification process for giftedness in Utah|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|volume=36|issue=4|pages=487\u2013508|doi=10.1177/0162353213506065}}</ref>\n\nSome schools and districts only accept IQ tests as evidence of giftedness. This brings scrutiny to the fact that many affluent families can afford to consult with an [[educational psychologist]] to test their children, whereas families with a limited income cannot afford the test and must depend on district resources.\n\n===Appropriateness of forms of gifted education===\nThis is the most hotly debated aspect of gifted education. Some people believe that gifted education resources lack availability and flexibility. They feel that in the alternative methods of gifted education, the gifted students \"miss out\" on having a \"normal\" childhood, at least insofar as \"normal childhood\" is defined as attending school in a mixed-ability classroom. Others believe that gifted education allows gifted students to interact with peers that are on their level, be adequately challenged, and leaves them better equipped to take on the challenges of life.\n\nAnother facet of this controversy is the effectiveness of the programs dependent upon resources that are pushed more toward students who are struggling. Gifted Education is not mandated in many states, making it elective for districts to earmark money for. Many lower-achieving districts and schools must make crisis decisions on programs that are not high priorities. As a result, gifted students at these schools are not served, or not served effectively.\n\n===Class and ethnicity===\nGifted programs are often seen as being elitist in places where the majority of students receiving gifted services are from a privileged background. Identifying and serving gifted children from poverty presents unique challenges, ranging from emotional issues arising from a family's economic insecurity, to gaps in pre-school cognitive development due to the family's lack of education and time.<ref>Paul D.

This behavior is usually discouraged by educators when they recognize it.  Unfortunately, the very educators who want these children to challenge themselves and to embrace their gifts and talents are often the same people who are forced to discourage them in a mixed-ability classroom, through mechanisms like refusing to call on the talented student in class so that typical students have an opportunity to participate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nStudents who are young, enthusiastic or aggressive are more likely to attract attention and to disrupt the class by working ahead, giving the correct answers all the time, asking for new assignments, or finding creative ways to entertain themselves while the rest of the class finishes an assignment. This behavior can be mistaken for [[ADHD]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nMany parents of gifted find that it is the social-emotional aspect of their children's lives that needs support. Schools and Talent Development programs often focus on academic enrichment rather than providing time for gifted kids to have the social interaction with true peers that is required for healthy development.  National organizations such as Supporting Emotional Needs of the Gifted [[SENG]] as well as local organizations, have emerged in an effort to meet these needs.\n\nIt can also happen that some unidentified gifted students will get bored in regular class, daydream and lose track of where the class is in a lecture, and the teacher becomes convinced that the student is slow and struggling with the material.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nFinally, G&T students are statistically somewhat more likely to be diagnosed with a [[mental disorder]] such as [[bipolar disorder]] and to become addicted to drugs or [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Savage|first1=P.

Curriculum-based assessment is a form of achievement testing that focuses specifically on what the child has been exposed to in their academic career. It can be done through school or a private educational center. Although this can determine if a child's performance in school potentially signifies giftedness, there are complications. For example, if a child changes school districts or country of residence, the different terminology of curriculum could hold that child back. Secondly, discrepancies between school districts, along with public and private education, create a very wide range of potential knowledge bases.<ref name=assess/>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- Add your program to the [[List of gifted and talented programmes]], not to other articles. -->\n\n*[[List of gifted and talented programmes]]\n*[[Academic elitism]]\n*[[Exceptional education]]\n*[[Rationale for gifted programs]]\n*[[Selective school]]s\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n# The latest research about gifted education can be found in the academic journals that specialize in gifted education: ''[[Gifted Child Quarterly]]'', ''[[Journal of Advanced Academics]]'', ''[[Journal for the Education of the Gifted]]'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20120521020902/http://www.roeper.org/netcommunity/page.aspx?pid=1222 Roeper Review]. \n# Assouline, S., and A.

An enrichment program teaches additional, related material, but keeps the student progressing through the curriculum at the same rate as other students.  For example, after the gifted students have completed the normal work in the curriculum, an enrichment program might provide them with additional information about a subject. An acceleration program advances the student through the standard curriculum faster than normal. This is done through many different approaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.davidsongifted.org/Search-Database/entry/A10313|title=Types of Acceleration|website=www.davidsongifted.org|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref>\n\nThere is no standard global definition of what a gifted student is; multiple definitions exist. Most definitions select the students who are the most skilled or talented in a given area, e.g., the students with the most skill or talent in music, language, logical reasoning, or mathematics.  The percentage of students selected varies, generally with 10% or fewer being selected for gifted education programs.  However, since students vary in their aptitudes and achievements, a student who is not gifted in one area, such as music, may be considered gifted in another, such as language.  Consequently, even if all programs agreed to include only the top 5% of students in their area, more than just 5% of students would be identified as gifted.\n\n==Forms==\nAttempts to provide gifted education can be classified in several ways. Most gifted students benefit from a combination of approaches at different times.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Acceleration===\nPupils are advanced to a higher-level class covering material more suited to their abilities and preparedness. This may take the form of [[Grade skipping|skipping grades]] or completing the normal curriculum in a shorter-than-normal period of time (\"telescoping\").  Subject acceleration (also called partial acceleration) is a flexible approach that can advance a student in one subject, such as mathematics or language, without changing other studies, such as [[history]] or science. This type of acceleration is usually based upon achievement testing, rather than [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]].\n\nSome colleges offer [[Early entrance to college|early entrance programs]] that give gifted younger students the opportunity to attend college early. In the U.S., many [[community colleges]] allow advanced students to enroll with the consent of school officials and the pupil's parents.\n\n[[Academic acceleration|Acceleration]] presents gifted children with academic material from established curricula that is commensurate with their ability and preparedness, and for this reason is a low-cost option from the perspective of the school. This may result in a small number of children taking classes targeted at older children. For the majority of gifted students, acceleration is beneficial both academically and socially.<ref>Nicholas Colangelo, N., Assouline, S., and Gross, M., A Nation Deceived:How Schools Hold Back America's Brightest Students, University of Iowa, Volume I, p. 2</ref>  Some advocates have argued that the disadvantages of being retained in a standard mixed-ability classroom are substantially worse than any shortcomings of acceleration. For example, [[psychologist]] Miraca Gross reports: \"the majority of these children [retained in a typical classroom] are socially rejected [by their peers with typical academic talents], isolated, and deeply unhappy. Children of [[IQ]] 180+ who are retained in the regular classroom are even more seriously at risk and experience severe emotional distress.\"<ref>[http://www.gt-cybersource.org/Record.aspx?NavID=2_0&rid=10586 Factors in the social adjustment and social acceptability of extremely gifted children<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190517/http://www.gt-cybersource.org/Record.aspx?NavID=2_0&rid=10586|date=2007-09-27}}</ref> These accelerated children should be placed together in one class if possible.<ref>Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., The Relationship of Grouping Practices to the Education of the Gifted and Talented Learner, (The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, 1991)</ref> Research suggests that acceleration might have an impact long after students graduate from high school. For example, one study shows that high-IQ individuals who experienced full-grade acceleration earned higher incomes as adults.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Liu|first2=Jonathan K|date=2017|title=Income differences among grade skippers and non-grade skippers across genders in the Terman sample, 1936\u20131976|journal=Learning and Instruction|volume=47|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2016.10.004|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Cluster Grouping===\n[[Cluster grouping]] is the gathering of four to six gifted and talented and/or high achieving students in a single classroom for the entire school day.  Cluster teachers are specially trained in differentiating for gifted learners.  Clusters are typically used in upper elementary grades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Within a cluster group, instruction may include enrichment and extensions, higher-order thinking skills, pretesting and differentiation, compacting, an accelerated pace, and more complexity in content\n\n===Colloquium===\nLike acceleration, colloquium provides advanced material for high school students. In colloquium, students take [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects than students in AP classes. Students in colloquium also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes in a different way than students enrolled in AP classes do. Colloquium is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with another subject. For example, if the students are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from [[The Scarlet Letter]] in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take [[Advanced Placement]] courses in math and science and vice versa.\n\n===Compacting===\nIn compacting, the regular school material is compacted by pretesting the student to establish which skills and content have already been mastered.  Pretests can be presented on a daily basis (pupils doing the most difficult items on a worksheet first and skipping the rest if they are performed correctly), or before a week or longer unit of instructional time.  When a student demonstrates an appropriate level of proficiency, further repetitive practice can be safely skipped, thus reducing boredom and freeing up time for the student to work on more challenging material.\n\n===Enrichment===\nOn the primary school level, students spend all class time with their peers, but receive extra material to challenge them. Enrichment may be as simple as a modified [[assignment (education)|assignment]] provided by the regular classroom teacher, or it might include formal programs such as [[Odyssey of the Mind]], [[Destination Imagination]] or academic competitions such as [[Brain Bowl]], [[Future Problem Solving]], [[Science Olympiad]], [[National History Day]], [[science fair]]s, or [[spelling bee]]s. Programmes of enrichment activities may also be organised outside the school day (e.g. the ASCEND project in secondary science education<ref>Taber, K. S. (2007). Enriching School Science for the Gifted Learner. London: Gatsby Science Enhancement Programme.</ref>). This work is done in addition to, and not instead of, any regular school work assigned. Critics of this approach argue that it requires gifted students to do more work instead of the same amount at an advanced level. On the secondary school level sometimes an option is to take more courses like [[English studies|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Latin]], [[Philosophy]], [[Science]], etc., or to engage in extra curricular activities.  Some perceive there to be a necessary choice between enrichment and acceleration, as if the two were mutually exclusive alternatives.  However, other researchers see the two as complements to each other.<ref>Assouline, S. and Lupkowski-Shoplik, A., ''Developing Math Talent: A Guide for Educating Gifted And Advanced Learners in Math'' (Prufrock Press), 2005.</ref>\n\n===Full-time separate classes or schools===\n''See also: [[List of gifted and talented programmes]]''\n\nSome gifted students are educated in either a separate class or a separate school. These classes and schools are sometimes called \"congregated gifted programs\" or \"dedicated gifted programs.\"\n\nSome independent schools have a primary mission to serve the needs of the academically gifted. Such schools are relatively scarce and often difficult for families to locate.  One resource for locating gifted schools in the United States can be found on the [[National Association for Gifted Children]]'s \"Resource Directory\" accessible through their home page. Such schools often need to work to guard their mission from occasional charges of elitism, support the professional growth and training of their staff, write curriculum units that are specifically designed to meet the social, emotional, and academic talents of their students, and educate their parent population at all ages.\n\nSome gifted and talented classes offer self-directed or individualized studies, where the students lead a class themselves and decide on their own task, tests, and all other assignments. These separate classes or schools tend to be more expensive than regular classes, due to smaller class sizes and lower student-to-teacher rations. [[Not-for-profit]] (non-profit) schools often can offer lower costs than for-profit schools.  Either way, they are in high demand and parents often have to pay part of the costs.\n\n===Hobby===\nActivities such as [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[creative writing]], [[sport]], [[computer games]], [[chess]], [[music]], [[dance]], foreign languages, and [[art]] give an extra intellectual challenge outside of school hours.\n\n===Homeschooling in the US===\nAn umbrella term encompassing myriad educational options for gifted children: part-time schooling; school at home; classes, groups, mentors and tutors; and [[unschooling]]. In many US states, the population of gifted students who are being [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]] is rising quite rapidly, as school districts responding to budgetary issues and standards-based policies are cutting what limited gifted education programs remain in existence, and families seek educational opportunities that are tailored to each child's unique needs\n\n=== Pull-Out ===\nGifted students are [[Gifted Pull-out|pulled out]] of a heterogeneous classroom to spend a portion of their time in a [[gifted class]]. These programs vary widely, from carefully designed half-day academic programs to a single hour each week of educational challenges. Generally, these programs are ineffective at promoting academic advancement unless the material covered contains extensions and enrichment to the core curriculum.  The majority of pull-out programs include an assortment of critical thinking drills, creative exercises, and subjects typically not introduced in standard curricula. Much of the material introduced in gifted pull-out programs deals with the study of [[logic]], and its application to fields ranging from [[philosophy]] to [[mathematics]]. Students are encouraged to apply these empirical reasoning skills to every aspect of their education both in and outside of class.\n\n===Self-pacing===\nSelf-pacing methods, such as the [[Montessori Method]], use flexible grouping practices to allow children to advance at their own pace. Self-pacing can be beneficial for all children and is not targeted specifically at those identified as gifted or talented, but it can allow children to learn at a highly accelerated rate. Directed Studies are usually based on self-pacing.\n\n===Summer Enrichment Programs (United States)===\nThese offer a variety of courses that mainly take place in the summer. Summer schools are popular in the United States. Entrance fees are required for such programs, and programs typically focus on one subject, or class, for the duration of the camp.\n\nSeveral examples of this type of program are:\n\n*[[Center for Talented Youth]]\n*[[CTYI]]\n*[[GERI: Gifted Education Resource Institute, Purdue University]]\n*[[The Johns Hopkins University]]\n\nWithin the United States, in addition to programs designed by the state, some counties also choose to form their own Talented and Gifted Programs.  Sometimes this means that an individual county will form its own TAG program; sometimes several counties will come together if not enough gifted students are present in a single county. Generally, a TAG program focuses on a specific age group, particularly the local TAG programs. This could mean elementary age, high school age, or by years such as ages 9 through 14.\n\nThese classes are generally organized so that students have the opportunity to choose several courses they wish to participate in. Courses offered often vary between subjects, but are not typically strictly academically related to that subject. For example, a TAG course that could be offered in history could be the students learning about a certain event and then acting it out in a performance to be presented to parents on the last night of the program. These courses are designed to challenge the students to think in new ways and not merely to be lectured as they are in school.\n\n==Identifying gifted children==\nThe term \"Gifted Assessment\" is typically applied to a process of using norm-referenced psychometric tests administered by a qualified psychologist or psychometrist with the goal of identifying children whose intellectual functioning is significantly advanced as compared to the appropriate reference group (i.e., individuals of their age, gender, and country). The cut-off score for differentiating this group is usually determined by district school boards and can differ slightly from area to area, however, the majority defines this group as students scoring in the top 2 percentiles on one of the accepted tests of intellectual (cognitive) functioning or IQ. Some school boards also require a child to demonstrate advanced academic standing on individualized achievement tests and/ or through their classroom performance. Identifying gifted children is often difficult but is very important because typical school teachers are not qualified to educate a gifted student. This can lead to a situation where a gifted child is bored, underachieves and misbehaves in class.<ref name=\"ERIC\">{{cite book|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED530599|title=Contemporary Intellectual Assessment: Theories, Tests, and Issues.

However it does not distinguish well among those found to be gifted. Therefore, examiners prefer using a variety of tests to first identify giftedness and then further differentiate. This is often done by using individual IQ tests and then group or individual achievement tests. There is no standard consensus on which tests to use, as each test is better suited for a certain role.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /><ref name=\"assess\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guilfordpress.co.uk/books/details/9781462511211/|title=Assessing Intelligence in Children and Adolescents|last=Kranzler|first=John H. ; Floyd, Randy G.|work=Guilford Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201213/http://www.guilfordpress.co.uk/books/details/9781462511211/|archive-date=2014-10-16|url-status=dead|access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref>\n\nThe two most popular tests for identifying giftedness in the school-age population are the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC IV]] and the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales|SB5]]. The [[Wechsler Individual Achievement Test|WIAT III]] is considered the most popular academic achievement test to determine a child's aggregate learned knowledge.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /><ref name=\"assess\" />\n\nAlthough a newer WISC version, the WISC V, was developed in late 2014, the WISC IV is still the most commonplace test. It has been translated into several languages including Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, French, German, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Italian. The WISC-IV assesses a child's cognitive abilities, with respect to age group. Coupled with results from other tests, the WISC accurately depicts a child's developmental and psychological needs for the future.<ref name=\"ERIC\" />\n\nThe SB5 is an intelligence test that determines cognitive abilities and can be administered to persons in virtually any age group. It assesses a series of intelligence indicators including fluid reasoning, general knowledge, quantitative reasoning, spatial processing, and working memory. The SB5 makes use of both verbal and nonverbal testing.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Waddell|first=Deborah D.|date=1979-11-30|title=The Stanford-Binet: An Evaluation of the Technical Data Available Since the 1972 Restandardization.|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ233903|journal=ERIC|volume=18|issue=3|pages=203\u20139}}</ref>\n\nThe WIAT-III cannot assess all components of learned knowledge, but does give an understanding of a child's ability to acquire skills and knowledge through formal education. This test measures aspects of the learning process that take place in a traditional school setting in reading, writing, math, and oral language. Although the WIAT-III tests a wide range of material, it is designed primarily to assess children's learning before adolescence.<ref name=\"ERIC\" />\n\nVersions of these tests exist for each age group. However it is recommended to begin assessment as early as possible, with approximately eight years of age being the optimal time to test. Testing allows identification of specific needs of students and help to plan an education early.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /><ref name=\"poppies\" />\n\nOut-of-group achievement testing (such as taking the SAT or ACT early) can also help to identify these students early on (see [[Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth|SMPY]]) and is implemented by various talent search programs in use by education programs. Out-of-group testing can also help to differentiate children who have scored in the highest percentiles in a single IQ test.<ref name=\"assess\" />\n\nTesting alone cannot accurately identify every gifted child.  Teacher and parent nominations are essential additions to the objective information provided by grades and scores.  Parents are encouraged to keep portfolios of their children's work, and documentation of their early signs of gifted behavior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaegt.net.au/?page_id=753|title=The Identification of Gifted and Talented Students {{!}} AAEGT - Australian Association for the Education of the Gifted and Talented|website=www.aaegt.net.au|access-date=2016-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.raisingwizards.com/#!characteristics-of-giftedness/cpqu|title=Characteristics of Gifted Children|last=Natcharian|first=Lisa|date=2015|website=Raising Wizards|publisher=Raising Wizards|access-date=May 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Studies of giftedness==\nThe development of early intelligence tests by [[Alfred Binet]] led to the Stanford-Binet IQ test developed by Lewis Terman. Terman began long-term studies of gifted children with a view to checking if the popular view \"early ripe, early rot\" was true. The Terman Genetic Studies of Genius longitudinal study has been described by successor researchers who conducted the study after Terman's death and also by an independent researcher who had full access to the study files.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Terman's Kids: The Groundbreaking Study of How the Gifted Grow Up|last=Shurkin|first=Joel|publisher=Little, Brown|year=1992|isbn=978-0-316-78890-8|location=Boston (MA)|ref=harv|lay-url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-31/books/bk-1247_1_lewis-terman/2|laydate=2 June 2013|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/termanskids00joel}}</ref>\n\nModern studies by James and Kulik<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvCDzqIH3ysC|title=Grouping and Acceleration Practices in Gifted Education - Linda Brody, National Association for Gifted Children (U.S.) - Google Boeken|last1=Brody|first1=Linda E.|date=2004-03-06|isbn=9781412904292|accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref> conclude that gifted students benefit ''least'' from working in a mixed-level class, and benefit ''most'' from learning with other similarly advanced students in accelerated or enriched classes.\n\n===Definition of giftedness===\nEducational authorities differ on the definition of giftedness: even when using the same [[IQ]] test to define giftedness, they may disagree on what gifted means - one may take up the top 2 percent of the population, another might take up the top 5 percent of a population, which may be within a state, district, or school. Within a single school district, there can be substantial differences in the distribution of measured IQ. (The IQ for the top percentile at a high-performing school may be quite different from that at a lower performing school.)\n\n=== Dr Peter Marshall ===\nDr Peter Marshall obtained his doctorate in 1995, for research carried out in this field in the years from 1986. At the time, he was the first Research Director of The Mensa Foundation for Gifted Children. His work challenged the difficult childhood hypothesis, concluding that gifted children, by and large, do not have any more difficult childhoods than mainstream children and, in fact, that where they do, their giftedness probably helps them cope better than mainstream children. His thesis is published under the title Growing up Gifted \u2013 Triangulations with the Gulbenkian Project<ref>Marshall, P. (1995) Growing Up Gifted: Triangulations with the Gulbenkian Project, Ph.D. Thesis: University of Manchester</ref> and provided the material for his subsequent book Educating a Gifted Child<ref>Marshall, P (2013) Educating a Gifted Child, London: Oakley Books, {{ISBN|9780956978479}}(3).</ref>\n\nHe has acted as consultant to schools and local education authorities such as Cumbria County Council and Blackburn, Hyndburn and Ribble Valley Health Authority and Thorncliffe Grammar in Barrow in Furness<ref>Mensa Magazine, March 2014, p.19</ref> and he has been chosen to give the Mensa Lecture on the Subject at Trinity College Cambridge in August 2018.<ref>Mensa Magazine, June 2018,p.11</ref>\n\nIn his book,  Educating a Gifted Child, he analyses a large range of causes of underachievement, explains the social attitudes to giftedness, lists the range of non-intellective aspects of giftedness, and explores the concepts of intelligence and IQ tests.\n\nDr Marshall is the President of The International Association for High Ability (IAFHA),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iafha.com|title=The International Association for High Ability \u2013 A resource site for High Ability Children and Adults}}</ref> which aims to help gifted individuals from all backgrounds to fulfil their potential for the benefit of themselves, their society and the human race in general.\n\nIn ''Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide'', Susan K. Johnsen (2004) explains that gifted children all exhibit the potential for high performance in the areas included in the United States federal definition of gifted and talented students:\n\n{{quotation|The term 'gifted and talented' when used in respect to students, children, or youth means [those who show] [[evidence]] of high performance capability in areas such as [[intellectual]], [[creativity|creative]], [[artistic]], or [[leadership]] capacity, or in specific academic fields, and who require services or activities not ordinarily provided by the [[school]] in order to fully develop such capabilities.|P.L. 103\u2013382, Title XIV, p. 388}}\n\nThe National Association for Gifted Children in the United States defines giftedness as:<ref>National Association for Gifted Children. (2011). Redefining giftedness for a new century: Shifting the paradigm [Position Paper]. http://www.nagc.org/sites/default/files/Position%20Statement/Redefining%20Giftedness%20for%20a%20New%20Century.pdf</ref>\n\n{{quotation|Gifted individuals are those who demonstrate outstanding levels of aptitude (defined as an exceptional ability to reason and learn) or competence (documented performance or achievement in top 10% or rarer) in one or more domains. Domains include any structured area of activity with its own symbol system (e.g., mathematics, music, language) and/or set of sensorimotor skills (e.g., painting, dance, sports).\n\nThe development of ability or talent is a lifelong process. It can be evident in young children as exceptional performance on tests and/or other measures of ability or as a rapid rate of learning, compared to other students of the same age, or in actual achievement in a domain. As individuals mature through childhood to adolescence, however, achievement and high levels of motivation in the domain become the primary characteristics of their giftedness. Various factors can either enhance or inhibit the development and expression of abilities.}}\n\nThis definition has been adopted in part or completely by the majority of the states in the United States. Most have some definition similar to that used in the [[State of Texas]], whose definition states:\n\n{{quotation|[The phrase] 'gifted and talented student' means a child or youth who performs at or shows the potential for performing at a remarkably high level of accomplishment when compared to others of the same age, experience, or environment, and who:\n*exhibits high performance capability in an intellectual, creative, or artistic area;\n*possesses an unusual capacity for leadership; or\n*excels in a specific academic field.|74th legislature of the State of Texas, Chapter 29, Subchapter D, Section 29.121}}\n\nThe major characteristics of these definitions are (a) the diversity of areas in which performance may be exhibited (e.g., intellectual, creative, artistic, leadership, academic), (b) the comparison with other groups (e.g., those in general education classrooms or of the same age, experience, or environment), and (c) the use of terms that imply a need for development of the gift (e.g., capability and potential).\n\n====Reliance on IQ====\nIn her book, ''Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide'', Susan K. Johnsen (2004) writes that schools should use a variety of measures of students' capability and potential when identifying gifted children. These measures may include portfolios of student work, classroom observations, achievement measures, and intelligence scores. Most educational professionals accept that no single measure can be used in isolation to accurately identify every gifted child.\n\nEven if the notion of IQ is generally useful for identifying academically talented students who would benefit from further services, the question of the cutoff point for giftedness is still important. As noted above, different authorities often define giftedness differently.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Identification: The Theory and Practice of Identifying Students for Gifted and Talented Education Services|last1=Lohman|first1=David F.|last2=Foley Nicpon|first2=Megan|publisher=Prufrock|year=2012|isbn=978-1-931280-17-4|editor-last=Hunsaker|editor-first=Scott|location=Waco (TX)|pages=287\u2013386|chapter=Chapter 12: Ability Testing & Talent Identification|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://faculty.education.uiowa.edu/docs/default-source/dlohman/ability-testing-and-talent-identification.pdf?sfvrsn=0|lay-url=http://www.prufrock.com/Identification-The-Theory-and-Practice-of-Identifying-Students-for-Gifted-and-Talented-Education-Services-P1816.aspx|laydate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Classical era to Renaissance===\nGifted and talented education dates back thousands of years. [[Plato]] (c. 427\u2013c. 347 BCE) advocated providing specialized education for intellectually gifted young men and women.<ref name=\"bce\">Colangelo, N., & Davis, G. (1997).

Between 1888 and 1894, Galton tested more than 7,500 individuals to measure their natural intellectual abilities. He found that if a parent deviates from the norm, so will the child, but to a lesser extent than the parent.<ref>\"Francis Galton, Sir.\" ''World of Sociology''. 2 vols. Gale Group, 2001.</ref> This was one of the earliest observed examples of [[regression toward the mean]]. Galton believed that individuals could be improved through interventions in [[heredity]], a movement he named [[eugenics]]. He categorized individuals as [[gifted]], capable, [[average]], or degenerate, and he recommended breeding between the first two categories, and forced abstinence for the latter two. His term for the most intelligent and talented people was \"eminent\". After studying England's most prominent families, Galton concluded that one's eminence was directly related to the individual's direct line of heredity.<ref>\"Francis Galton.\" ''Science and Its Times'', '''5''': 1800\u20131899. Gale Group, 2000.</ref>\n\n===Lewis Terman===\nAt [[Stanford University]] in 1918, [[Lewis Terman]] adapted [[Alfred Binet]]'s Binet-Simon [[intelligence]] test into the [[Stanford-Binet]] test, and introduced [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) scoring for the test. According to Terman, the IQ was one's mental age compared to one's chronological age, based on the mental age norms he compiled after studying a sample of children.<ref>\"Lewis Madison Terman.\" ''American Decades''. Gale Research, 1998.</ref> He defined intelligence as \"the ability to carry on abstract thinking\".<ref>\"Lewis Madison Terman.\" ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'', 2nd ed. 17 Vols. Gale Research, 1998.</ref> During [[World War I]] Terman was a commissioned officer of the United States Army, and collaborated with other psychologists in developing intelligence tests for new recruits to the armed forces. For the first time, intelligence testing was given to a wide population of drafted soldiers.\n\nAfter the war, Terman undertook an extensive [[longitudinal study]] of 643 children in California who scored at IQ 140 or above, the [[Genetic Studies of Genius]], continuing to evaluate them throughout their lives. Subjects of these case studies were called \"Termites\" and the studies contacted the children in 1921, and again in 1930, 1947, and 1959 after his death. Terman's studies have to date been the most extensive on high-functioning children, and are still quoted in psychological literature today. Terman claimed to have disproven common misconceptions, such as that highly intelligent children were prone to ill physical and mental health, that their intelligence burned out early in their lives, or that they either achieved greatly or underachieved.<ref>\"Lewis Madison Terman.\"Dictionary of American Biography, Supplement 6: 1956-1960.

Through project-based learning, students are challenged to use higher order thinking skills. Another focus of the program is autonomous learning; students are encouraged to self-monitor, self-reflect and seek out enrichment opportunities. Entrance to the program is initiated through referral followed by a review by a screening committee. IQ tests are used but not exclusively. Students are also assessed by performance, cognitive ability tests, and motivation. There are 4 MACC's in Vancouver: grade 4/5 and grade 6/7 at Sir William Osler Elementary, grade 5/6/7 at Tecumseh Elementary, and a French Immersion grade 5/6/7 at Kerrisdale Elementary.\n\nAt a lower scale, the [[Peel District School Board]] operates its [[Regional Enhanced Program]] at [[The Woodlands School (Mississauga)|The Woodlands School]], [[Lorne Park Secondary School]], [[Glenforest Secondary School]], [[Heart Lake Secondary School]] and [[Humberview Secondary School]] to provide students an opportunity to develop and explore skills in a particular area of interest. Students identified as gifted (which the PDSB classifies as \"enhanced\") may choose to attend the nearest of these high schools instead of their assigned home high school. In the Regional Enhanced Program, enhanced students take core courses (primarily, but not limited to English, mathematics, and the sciences) in an environment surrounded by fellow enhanced peers. The classes often contain modified assignments that encourage students to be creative.\n\n===Ecuador===\nIn Ecuador, [http://www.cedapecuador.com/ Centro Ecuatoriano para el Desarrollo del Alto Potencial] started in 2018 as the first all around gifted children educational program in the country.

In his introduction to the tenth anniversary edition of his classic work Frames of Mind. The [[theory of multiple intelligences]], he says:\n\nIn the heyday of the psychometric and behaviorist eras, it was generally believed that intelligence was a single entity that was inherited; and that human beings - initially a blank slate - could be trained to learn anything, provided that it was presented in an appropriate way. Nowadays an increasing number of researchers believe precisely the opposite; that there exists a multitude of intelligences, quite independent of each other; that each intelligence has its own strengths and constraints; that the mind is far from unencumbered at birth; and that it is unexpectedly difficult to teach things that go against early 'naive' theories of that challenge the natural lines of force within an intelligence and its matching domains. (Gardner 1993: xxiii)\n\n[[Howard Gardner]] initially formulated a list of seven intelligences, but later added an eighth, that are intrinsic to the human mind: linguistic, logical/mathematical, visual/spatial, musical, bodily kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal, and naturalist intelligences.\nIt has become widely accepted at both local and international scales to adopt a broad definition of giftedness using multiple criteria to formulate gifted education policy.\n\n;The Mission and Principles of Gifted Education Policy in [[Hong Kong]]\n\nThe mission of gifted education is to systematically and strategically explore and develop the potential of gifted students.

The motto is motivating intelligence for social change. The school, located in central Pune, admits 80 students each year, after thorough testing, which includes two written papers and an interview. The psychology department of Jnana Prabodhini has worked on J. P. Guilford's model of Intelligence.\n\n===Iran===\n[[National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents]] ([[NODET]], also known as [[SAMPAD]],\nPersian: \u0633\u0645\u067e\u0627\u062f, which stands for \u0633\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u06cc \u067e\u0631\u0648\u0631\u0634 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u062e\u0634\u0627\u0646 in Persian) are national Middle and High Schools in Iran developed\nspecifically for the development of exceptionally talented students in Iran. [[NODET]] was first\nestablished in 1976 and re-established in 1987.\n\nAdmission to NODET schools is selective and based on a comprehensive nationwide entrance\nexamination procedure.\n\nEvery year thousands of students apply to enter the schools, from which less\nthan 5% are chosen for the 99 middle schools and 98 high-schools within the country. All applicants must have a minimum GPA of 19 (out of 20) for attending the entrance exam. In 2006, 87,081 boys and 83,596 girls from 56 cities applied, and finally 6,888 students were accepted for the 2007 middle schools. The admission process is much more selective in big cities like [[Tehran]], [[Isfahan]], [[Mashhad]] and [[Karaj]] in\nwhich less than 150 students are accepted after two exams and interviews, out of over 50,000\napplicants.\n\nTop schools of NODET (and also Iran's top) are [[Allameh Helli High Schools|Allameh Helli High School]] and [[Shahid Madani High School]] (in Tabriz), [[Farzanegan High School]] located in [[Tehran]], [[Shahid Ejei High School]] located in [[Isfahan]], [[Shahid Hashemi Nejad High School]] located in [[Mashhad]] and [[Shahid Soltani School]] located in [[Karaj]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.\nCourses taught in NODET schools are college-level in fields such as [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]] and [[English Language]]. The best teachers of the ministry of education are chosen mainly by the school's principal and faculty to teach at NODET schools. Schools mainly have only two majors (normal schools have three majors), math-physics and experimental sciences (like math-physics but having biology as the main course). Even though social sciences are taught, there is much less emphasis on these subjects due to the lack of interest in both students and the organization.\n\n===Norway===\nNorway has no centre for gifted or talented children or youth. However, there is the privately run [[Barratt Due Institute of Music]] who offers musical kindergarten, evening school and college for highly talented young musicians. There is also the public secondary school for talents in ballet at Rusel\u00f8kka school in Oslo, who admits the 15 top dancers. On athletics, Privately run Norwegian Elite Sports Gymnasium (NTG) offers secondary school for talents in five locations in Norway.

The center is managed by the [[Korean Educational Development Institute|Korean Educational Development Institute (KEDI)]].  Presently twenty-five universities conduct gifted and talented education research in some form; for example, [[Seoul National University]] is conducting Science-gifted Education Center, and [[KAIST]] is conducting Global Institute For Talented Education (GIFTED), the Korean Society for the Gifted and Talented (\ud55c\uad6d\uc601\uc7ac\uad50\uc721\ud559\ud68c) and the Korean Society for the Gifted (\uc0ac\ub2e8\ubc95\uc778 \ud55c\uad6d\uc601\uc7ac\ud559\ud68c).\n\nEducation for the scientifically gifted in Korea can be traced back to the 1983 government founding of [[Gyeonggi Science High School]].<ref>{{cite web\n| last =Kim\n| first =H.J.\n| authorlink =\n| title = A comparative study on gifted education for mathematics in Korea and foreign countries.\n| work = [[Dankook University]]\n| publisher = Dankook University (unpublished master's thesis)\n| year = 2006\n| url =\n| doi =\n}}</ref> Following three later additions ([[Korea Science Academy|Korea Science Academy of KAIST]]; [[Seoul Science High School]] and [[Daegu Science High School]]), approximately 1,500, or 1 in 1,300 (0.08 percent) of high school students are currently enrolled among its four gifted academies.  By 2008, about 50,000, or 1 in 140 (0.7 percent) of elementary and middle school students participated in education for the gifted. In 2005, a program was undertaken to identify and educate gifted children of socioeconomically underprivileged people.  Since then, more than 1,800 students have enrolled in the program.\n\nGradually the focus has expanded over time to cover informatics, arts, physical education, creative writing, humanities, and social sciences, leading to the 2008 creation of the government funded [[Korean National Institute for the Gifted Arts]].  To pluralize the need for trained professional educators, teachers undergo basic training (60 hours), advanced training (120 hours), and overseas training (60 hours) to acquire skills necessary to teach gifted youth.\n\n===Singapore===\n{{Main article|Gifted Education Programme (Singapore)}}\n\nIn Singapore, the [[Gifted Education Programme (Singapore)|Gifted Education Programme]] (GEP) was introduced in 1984 and is offered in the upper primary years (Primary 4\u20136, ages 10\u201312).

For example, [[The Mirman School]] caters to children with an IQ of 138 and above.\n\n== Commonly used terms ==\nSource: Frequently Used Terms in Gifted Education<ref>[http://www.nagc.org/index.aspx?id=565 NAGC - Information & Resources - Glossary of Gifted Terms<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105054659/http://www.nagc.org/index.aspx?id=565 |date=2006-11-05 }}</ref>\n\n;Affective curriculum\n:A curriculum that is designed to teach gifted students about emotions, [[self-esteem]], and [[social skills]]. This can be valuable for all students, especially those who have been grouped with much older students, or who have been rejected by their same-age, but academically typical, [[peer group|peers]].\n\n;[[Differentiated instruction|Differentiation]]\n:Modification of a gifted student\u2019s curriculum to accommodate their specific needs. This may include changing the content or ability level of the material.\n\n;Heterogeneous grouping\n:A strategy that groups students of varied ability, preparedness, or accomplishment in a single classroom environment. Usually this terminology is applied to groupings of students in a particular grade, especially in elementary school. For example, students in fifth grade would be heterogeneously grouped in math if they were randomly assigned to classes instead of being grouped by demonstrated subject mastery.  Heterogeneous grouping is sometimes claimed to provide a more effective instructional environment for less prepared students.\n\n;Homogeneous grouping\n:A strategy that groups students by specific ability, preparedness, or interest within a subject area. Usually this terminology is applied to groupings of students in a particular grade, especially in elementary school.  For example, students in fifth grade would be homogeneously grouped in math if they were assigned to classes based on demonstrated subject mastery rather than being randomly assigned. Homogeneous grouping can provide more effective instruction for the most prepared students.\n\n;[[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP)\n:A written document that addresses a student's specific individual needs. It may specify accommodations, materials, or classroom instruction. IEPs are often created for students with disabilities, who are required by law to have an IEP when appropriate. Most states are not required to have IEPs for students who are only identified as gifted. Some students may be intellectually gifted in addition to having learning and/or attentional disabilities, and may have an IEP that includes, for instance, enrichment activities as a means of alleviating [[boredom]] or [[frustration]], or as a reward for on-task behavior. In order to warrant such an IEP, a student needs to be diagnosed with a separate emotional or learning [[disability]] that is not simply the result of being unchallenged in a typical [[classroom]]. These are also known as Individual Program Plans, or IPPs.\n\n==Justification==\nResearchers and practitioners in gifted education contend that, if education were to follow the medical maxim of \"first, do no harm,\" then no further justification would be required for providing resources for gifted education as they believe gifted children to be [[Gifted At-Risk|at-risk]]. The notion that gifted children are \"at-risk\" was publicly declared in the [[Marland report|Marland Report]] in 1972:\n<blockquote>\nGifted and Talented children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs served by the Office of Education.\n\n(pp. xi-xii)<ref name = marland/></blockquote>\nThree decades later, a similar statement was made by researchers in the field: <blockquote>\nNational efforts to increase the availability of a variety of appropriate instructional and out-of-school provisions must be a high priority since ''research indicates that many of the emotional or social difficulties gifted students experience disappear when their educational climates are adapted to their level and pace of learning''.\" [emphasis added]<ref>''The Social and Emotional Development of Gifted Children: What Do We Know?'', Edited by Maureen Neihart, Sally M. Reis, Nancy M. Robinson, and Sidney M. Moon; National Association of Gifted Children (Prufrock Press, Inc.), 2002, p. 286.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Controversies==\nControversies concerning gifted education are varied and often highly politicized. They are as basic as agreeing upon the appropriateness of the term 'gifted' or the definition of 'giftedness'. For example, does 'giftedness' refer to performance or potential (such as inherent intelligence)? Many students do not exhibit both at the same time.\n\nMeasures of general intelligence also remain controversial. Early IQ tests were notorious for producing higher IQ scores for privileged races and classes and lower scores for disadvantaged subgroups. Although IQ tests have changed substantially over the past half century, and many objections to the early tests have been addressed by 'culture neutral' tests (such as the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven test]]), IQ testing remains controversial. Regardless of the tests used to identify children for gifted programs, many school districts in the United States still have disproportionately more White and Asian American students enrolled in their gifted programs, while Hispanic and African American students are usually underrepresented.<ref>Yoon, S. Y., & Gentry, M. (2009) Racial and ethnic representation in gifted programs: Current status of and implications for gifted Asian American students. ''Gifted Child Quarterly, 53'', 121-136. doi:10.1177/0016986208330564</ref> However, research shows that this may be not be a fault of tests, but rather a result of the [[achievement gap in the United States]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Anderson|first2=Braydon|last3=Johnson|first3=Alyce O.|year=2013|title=The impact of race and ethnicity on the identification process for giftedness in Utah|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|volume=36|issue=4|pages=487\u2013508|doi=10.1177/0162353213506065}}</ref>\n\nSome schools and districts only accept IQ tests as evidence of giftedness. This brings scrutiny to the fact that many affluent families can afford to consult with an [[educational psychologist]] to test their children, whereas families with a limited income cannot afford the test and must depend on district resources.\n\n===Appropriateness of forms of gifted education===\nThis is the most hotly debated aspect of gifted education. Some people believe that gifted education resources lack availability and flexibility. They feel that in the alternative methods of gifted education, the gifted students \"miss out\" on having a \"normal\" childhood, at least insofar as \"normal childhood\" is defined as attending school in a mixed-ability classroom. Others believe that gifted education allows gifted students to interact with peers that are on their level, be adequately challenged, and leaves them better equipped to take on the challenges of life.\n\nAnother facet of this controversy is the effectiveness of the programs dependent upon resources that are pushed more toward students who are struggling. Gifted Education is not mandated in many states, making it elective for districts to earmark money for. Many lower-achieving districts and schools must make crisis decisions on programs that are not high priorities. As a result, gifted students at these schools are not served, or not served effectively.\n\n===Class and ethnicity===\nGifted programs are often seen as being elitist in places where the majority of students receiving gifted services are from a privileged background. Identifying and serving gifted children from poverty presents unique challenges, ranging from emotional issues arising from a family's economic insecurity, to gaps in pre-school cognitive development due to the family's lack of education and time.<ref>Paul D.

A person who is intellectually advanced may or may not be advanced in other areas. Each individual student needs to be evaluated for physical, social, and emotional skills without the traditional prejudices which prescribe either \"compensatory\" weaknesses or \"matching\" advancement in these areas.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iF8BrSrOqjwC|title=Exceptionally Gifted Children|last=Gross|first=Miraca U.

This behavior is usually discouraged by educators when they recognize it.  Unfortunately, the very educators who want these children to challenge themselves and to embrace their gifts and talents are often the same people who are forced to discourage them in a mixed-ability classroom, through mechanisms like refusing to call on the talented student in class so that typical students have an opportunity to participate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nStudents who are young, enthusiastic or aggressive are more likely to attract attention and to disrupt the class by working ahead, giving the correct answers all the time, asking for new assignments, or finding creative ways to entertain themselves while the rest of the class finishes an assignment. This behavior can be mistaken for [[ADHD]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nMany parents of gifted find that it is the social-emotional aspect of their children's lives that needs support. Schools and Talent Development programs often focus on academic enrichment rather than providing time for gifted kids to have the social interaction with true peers that is required for healthy development.  National organizations such as Supporting Emotional Needs of the Gifted [[SENG]] as well as local organizations, have emerged in an effort to meet these needs.\n\nIt can also happen that some unidentified gifted students will get bored in regular class, daydream and lose track of where the class is in a lecture, and the teacher becomes convinced that the student is slow and struggling with the material.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nFinally, G&T students are statistically somewhat more likely to be diagnosed with a [[mental disorder]] such as [[bipolar disorder]] and to become addicted to drugs or [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Savage|first1=P.

These students can require special attention in school.\n\n===Test preparation===\nIn the United States, particularly in New York City where qualifying children as young as 4 are enrolled in enriched kindergarten classes offered by the public schools, a [[test preparation]] industry has grown up which closely monitors the nature of tests given to prospective students of gifted and talented programs. This can result in admission of significant numbers of students into programs who lack superior natural intellectual talent and exclusion of naturally talented students who did not participate in test preparation or lacked the resources to do so.<ref name=\"NYT021713\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/nyregion/new-york-city-schools-struggle-to-separate-the-gifted-from-the-just-well-prepared.html|title=Schools Ask: Gifted or Just Well-Prepared?|author=Jenny Anderson|date=February 17, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt is virtually impossible to train a child for a [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]] test or other gifted test.<ref name=\"hoagiesgifted\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoagiesgifted.org/test_prep.htm|title=How Can I Prepare My Child for Testing?|last=Yermish|first=Aimee|work=Hoagies' Gifted Education}}</ref> Some websites are known for publishing test questions and answers, although using these is considered illegal since it is highly confidential information.<ref name= hoagiesgifted/><ref name=\"gilman\">{{cite book|title=Academic Advocacy for Gifted Children: A Parent's Complete Guide|last1=Gilman|first1=Barbara Jackson|publisher=Great Potential Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0910707886|pages=62\u201365}}</ref> It would also be disastrous if a non-gifted student was placed in a gifted program.<ref name=gilman/> Reviewing actual test questions can confuse children and stifles their natural thinking process, however reviewing similar style questions is a possibility.<ref name= hoagiesgifted/>\n\nPrivate gifted assessment is usually expensive and educators recommend that parents take advantage of online screening tests to give a preliminary indication of potential giftedness.<ref name=\"shenfield\">{{cite web|url=http://www.psy-ed.com/wpblog/psychological-assessments/gifted-assessments/|title=Gifted Assessments|last=Shenfield|first=Tali|date=2014-06-30|work=Advanced Psychology}}</ref> Another way to screen for giftedness before requesting a psychological assessment is to do a curriculum-based assessment.  Curriculum-based assessment is a form of achievement testing that focuses specifically on what the child has been exposed to in their academic career. It can be done through school or a private educational center. Although this can determine if a child's performance in school potentially signifies giftedness, there are complications. For example, if a child changes school districts or country of residence, the different terminology of curriculum could hold that child back. Secondly, discrepancies between school districts, along with public and private education, create a very wide range of potential knowledge bases.<ref name=assess/>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- Add your program to the [[List of gifted and talented programmes]], not to other articles. -->\n\n*[[List of gifted and talented programmes]]\n*[[Academic elitism]]\n*[[Exceptional education]]\n*[[Rationale for gifted programs]]\n*[[Selective school]]s\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n# The latest research about gifted education can be found in the academic journals that specialize in gifted education: ''[[Gifted Child Quarterly]]'', ''[[Journal of Advanced Academics]]'', ''[[Journal for the Education of the Gifted]]'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20120521020902/http://www.roeper.org/netcommunity/page.aspx?pid=1222 Roeper Review]. \n# Assouline, S., and A.
