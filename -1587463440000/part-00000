One such MUA is [[Microsoft Outlook]]. When online it will attempt to connect to mail servers (to check for new mail at regular intervals, for example), and when offline it will not attempt to make any such connection. The online or offline state of the MUA does not necessarily reflect the connection status between the computer on which it is running and the internet. That is, the computer itself may be online\u2014connected to Internet via a [[cable modem]] or other means\u2014while Outlook is kept offline by the user, so that it makes no attempt to send or to receive messages. Similarly, a computer may be configured to employ a [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]] on demand (as when an application such as Outlook attempts to make connection to a server), but the user may not wish for Outlook to trigger that call whenever it is configured to check for mail.<ref name=\"Mann\">{{cite book|pages=[https://archive.org/details/howtodoeverythin00mann/page/76 76&ndash;77]|title=How to Do Everything with Microsoft Office Outlook 2003|author=Bill Mann|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2003|isbn=0-07-223070-3|url=https://archive.org/details/howtodoeverythin00mann/page/76}}</ref>\n\n===Offline media playing===\nAnother example of the use of these concepts is [[digital audio]] technology. A tape recorder, [[digital audio editor]], or other device that is online is one whose clock is under the control of the clock of a synchronization master device. When the sync master commences playback, the online device automatically synchronizes itself to the master and commences playing from the same point in the recording. A device that is offline uses no external clock reference and relies upon its own internal clock. When a large number of devices are connected to a sync master it is often convenient, if one wants to hear just the output of one single device, to take it offline because, if the device is played back online, all synchronized devices have to locate the playback point and wait for each other device to be in synchronization.<ref>{{cite book|title=Audiopro Home Recording Course: A Comprehensive Multimedia Audio Recording Text|author=Bill Gibson|pages=155|year=1998|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=0-87288-715-4}}</ref> (For related discussion, see [[MIDI timecode]], [[word sync]], and recording system synchronization.)\n\n===Offline browsing===\n{{main|Offline browsing|}}\nA third example of a common use of these concepts is a [[web browser]] that can be instructed to be in either online or offline states. The browser attempts to fetch pages from servers while only in the online state. In the offline state, users can perform '''offline browsing''', where pages can be browsed using local copies of those pages that have previously been downloaded while in the online state. This can be useful when the computer is offline and connection to the Internet is impossible or undesirable. The pages are downloaded either implicitly into the web browser's own [[browser cache|cache]] as a result of prior online browsing by the user or explicitly by a browser configured to keep local copies of certain web pages, which are updated when the browser is in the online state, either by checking that the local copies are up-to-date at regular intervals or by checking that the local copies are up-to-date whenever the browser is switched to the online  One such web browser capable of being explicitly configured to download pages for offline browsing is [[Internet Explorer]].

If a person is active over a messaging tool and is able to accept the messages it is termed as online message and if the person is not available and the message is left to view when the person is back, it is termed as offline message. In the same context, the person's availability is termed as online and non-availability is termed as offline.\n\n==Generalisations==\nOnline and offline distinctions have been generalised from computing and telecommunication into the field of human interpersonal relationships. The distinction between what is considered online and what is considered offline has become a subject of study in the field of [[sociology]].<ref name=Slater>{{cite book|chapter=Social Relationships and Identity On-line and Off-line|title=Handbook of New Media: Social Shaping and Consequences of ICTs|editors=Leah, Sonia, Lievrouw, and Livingstone|author=Don Slater|pages=533&ndash;543|year=2002|publisher=Sage Publications Inc|isbn=0-7619-6510-6}}</ref>\n\nThe distinction between online and offline is conventionally seen as the distinction between [[computer-mediated communication]] and [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] communication (e.g., [[face time]]), respectively. Online is virtuality or [[cyberspace]], and offline is reality (i.e., [[Real life (reality)|real life or \"meatspace\"]]). Slater states that this distinction is \"obviously far too simple\".<ref name=Slater /> To support his argument that the distinctions in relationships are more complex than a simple dichotomy of online versus offline, he observes that some people draw no distinction between an online relationship, such as indulging in [[cybersex]], and an offline relationship, such as being [[pen pal]]s.  He argues that even the [[telephone]] can be regarded as an online experience in some circumstances, and that the blurring of the distinctions between the uses of various technologies (such as [[personal digital assistant|PDA]] versus mobile phone, [[internet television]] versus internet, and telephone versus [[Voice over Internet Protocol]]) has made it \"impossible to use the term ''online'' meaningfully in the sense that was employed by the first generation of Internet research\".<ref name=Slater />\n\nSlater asserts that there are legal and regulatory pressures to reduce the distinction between online and offline, with a \"general tendency to assimilate online to offline and erase the distinction,\" stressing, however, that this does not mean that online relationships are being reduced to ''pre-existing'' offline relationships. He conjectures that greater legal status may be assigned to online relationships (pointing out that contractual relationships, such as business transactions, online are already seen as just as \"real\" as their offline counterparts), although he states it to be hard to imagine courts awarding [[palimony]] to people who have had a purely online sexual relationship. He also conjectures that an online/offline distinction may be seen by people as \"rather quaint and not quite comprehensible\" within 10 years.<ref name=Slater />\n\nThis distinction between ''online'' and ''offline'' is sometimes inverted, with online concepts being used to define and to explain offline activities, rather than (as per the conventions of the [[desktop metaphor]] with its desktops, trash cans, folders, and so forth) the other way around. Several cartoons appearing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' have satirized this. One includes [[Saint Peter]] asking for a username and a password before admitting a man into Heaven. Another illustrates \"the off-line store\" where \"All items are actual size!\", shoppers may \"Take it home as soon as you pay for it!\", and \"Merchandise may be handled prior to purchase!\"<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|title=Evolve: Succeeding in the digital culture of tomorrow|author=Rosabeth Moss Kanter|year=2001|publisher=Harvard Business School|isbn=1-57851-439-8|url=https://archive.org/details/evolvesucceeding00kant}}</ref><ref>[http://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/ebuzz/0508/images/cartoon2.jpg The \"off-line store\" cartoon from ''The New Yorker'']</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary|offline|online|come online}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Computer networking]]\n*[[NLS (computer system)|NLS]], or the \"oN-Line System\"\n*[[Offline reader]]\n*[[On the fly#Computer usage|On the fly \u00a7 Computer usage]]\n*[[Online algorithm]]\n*[[Online algorithm|Online and offline algorithms]]\n*[[Online editing]] and [[offline editing]] \u2013 the online/outline distinction in [[video editing]]\n*[[Online game]]s\n*[[Online identity]]\n*[[Online (magazine)|''Online'' (magazine)]]\n*[[Online volunteering]]\n*[[Open access (publishing)]]\n*[[Presentity]]\n*[[Reputation]]\n*[[Website mirroring software]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{FS1037C MS188}}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Computer jargo\n\nn]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Terms for being connected to, or disconnected from, the internet}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{redirect|Online}}\n{{redirect|Offline}}\nIn computer technology and [[telecommunications]], '''online''' indicates a state of connectivity''',''' and '''offline''' indicates a disconnected state.

He argues that even the [[telephone]] can be regarded as an online experience in some circumstances, and that the blurring of the distinctions between the uses of various technologies (such as [[personal digital assistant|PDA]] versus mobile phone, [[internet television]] versus internet, and telephone versus [[Voice over Internet Protocol]]) has made it \"impossible to use the term ''online'' meaningfully in the sense that was employed by the first generation of Internet research\".<ref name=Slater />\n\nSlater asserts that there are legal and regulatory pressures to reduce the distinction between online and offline, with a \"general tendency to assimilate online to offline and erase the distinction,\" stressing, however, that this does not mean that online relationships are being reduced to ''pre-existing'' offline relationships. He conjectures that greater legal status may be assigned to online relationships (pointing out that contractual relationships, such as business transactions, online are already seen as just as \"real\" as their offline counterparts), although he states it to be hard to imagine courts awarding [[palimony]] to people who have had a purely online sexual relationship. He also conjectures that an online/offline distinction may be seen by people as \"rather quaint and not quite comprehensible\" within 10 years.<ref name=Slater />\n\nThis distinction between ''online'' and ''offline'' is sometimes inverted, with online concepts being used to define and to explain offline activities, rather than (as per the conventions of the [[desktop metaphor]] with its desktops, trash cans, folders, and so forth) the other way around. Several cartoons appearing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' have satirized this. One includes [[Saint Peter]] asking for a username and a password before admitting a man into Heaven. Another illustrates \"the off-line store\" where \"All items are actual size!\", shoppers may \"Take it home as soon as you pay for it!\", and \"Merchandise may be handled prior to purchase!\"<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|title=Evolve: Succeeding in the digital culture of tomorrow|author=Rosabeth Moss Kanter|year=2001|publisher=Harvard Business School|isbn=1-57851-439-8|url=https://archive.org/details/evolvesucceeding00kant}}</ref><ref>[http://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/ebuzz/0508/images/cartoon2.jpg The \"off-line store\" cartoon from ''The New Yorker'']</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary|offline|online|come online}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Computer networking]]\n*[[NLS (computer system)|NLS]], or the \"oN-Line System\"\n*[[Offline reader]]\n*[[On the fly#Computer usage|On the fly \u00a7 Computer usage]]\n*[[Online algorithm]]\n*[[Online algorithm|Online and offline algorithms]]\n*[[Online editing]] and [[offline editing]] \u2013 the online/outline distinction in [[video editing]]\n*[[Online game]]s\n*[[Online identity]]\n*[[Online (magazine)|''Online'' (magazine)]]\n*[[Online volunteering]]\n*[[Open access (publishing)]]\n*[[Presentity]]\n*[[Reputation]]\n*[[Website mirroring software]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{FS1037C MS188}}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Computer jargon]]\n[[Category:Internet terminology]]\n", "name_user": "2001:5b0:4acf:2838:7d98:7d3f:4223:9a72", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eAntecedents)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline"}

The modern education system was developed by the British missionaries and the Indian social reformists. [[West Bengal]] has many reputed institutes of higher education like \u2013 [[University of Calcutta]] , [[Jadavpur University]] (first to introduce chemical engineering and numerous other interdisciplinary studies in India ), [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency University]], [[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta]] (the first IIM), [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]] (the first IIT), [[Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur]] (2nd oldest engineering institution in India), [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata]], [[National Institute of Technology, Durgapur]],[[Marine Engineering and Research Institute]] (oldest marine engineering college in Asia), [[Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kalyani]], [[Indian Statistical Institute]] and [[Visva-Bharati University]].

Western models of education came to [[India]] through Kolkata. Many of the first schools and colleges were established by the missionaries and reformists. Sir [[William Jones (philologist)]] established the [[Asiatic Society]] in 1784 for promoting oriental studies. People like [[Ram Mohan Roy]], [[David Hare (philanthropist)|David Hare]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]], [[Shashi Bhusan Chatterjee]], and [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] played a leading role in the setting up of modern schools and colleges in the city. The [[Fort William College]] was established in 1800. The Hindu College was established in 1817. In 1855 the [[Hindu College, Calcutta]] was renamed as the [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]].\n\n[[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] established the [[Serampore College]] in [[Serampore]] City (30&nbsp;km from Calcutta), 1818. It went on to become India's first modern university in 1827 when it was incorporated by a Royal Charter as a Danish University. Although it had the charter, it was not technically a university in the modern sense of that term. The [[Sanskrit College]] was established in 1824. Reverend [[Alexander Duff (missionary)|Alexander Duff]] of the [[Church of Scotland]] established the General Assembly's Institution in 1830 and later the Free Church Institution in 1844, which were later merged to form what is now known as the [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta]]. These institutions played a significant role in what came to be known as the [[Young Bengal|Young Bengal Movement]] and the [[Bengal Renaissance]]. [[La Martiniere Calcutta]] was established in 1836. [[John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune|John Bethune]] established a school for Indian girls in 1850 at a time when women's education was frowned upon in the society. The [[Bethune College]] for girls was set up by him in 1879.\n\nThe oldest medical school in Asia, the [[Calcutta Medical College]] was set up in 1835. In 1857, the [[University of Calcutta]] was established as the first full-fledged multi-disciplinary university in south Asia. It was modelled on the lines of the [[University of London]]. Today it is amongst the largest multidisciplinary universities of India and offers some of the widest number of academic disciplines for study. In 1856 technical and engineering education came with the establishment of a civil engineering college / department. This setup went through various reorganisations to finally become the [[Bengal Engineering College]] in 1921. The [[Jesuit]] administered [[St Xavier's College]] was established in 1860. In 1906, the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition of Bengal]] led to widespread nationalistic and anti British feelings. This led to the setting up of the National Council of Education, Bengal. This later on became the [[Jadavpur University]] in 1955.  The nation's first homeopathy college was established in the city in 1880. In 1883 [[Kadambini Ganguly]] and [[Chandramukhi Basu]] became the first women graduates from the [[University of Calcutta]]. In the process, they became the first female graduates of the [[British Empire]]. Kadambini went on to become the first female physician trained in the Western system of medicine in South Asia. The Science College was established in 1917. The first blind school came into being in 1925.\n\nAfter independence, [[Calcutta]] continued to be in the forefront of the educational scene. The [[Government College of Art & Craft]] was established in 1951. The [[Rabindra Bharati University]] was established in 1962. This university offers courses in the fine and performing arts. The [[Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management]] was set up in 1953 as the country's first management institute and is also the first in the country to offer an MBA degree of a university.  The first, [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur|Indian Institute of Technology]] was set up at [[Kharagpur]] about 120&nbsp;km from Calcutta. In 1960 the Regional Engineering college (presently [[National Institute of Technology, Durgapur|National Institute of Technology]]) at Durgapur was set up. It is amongst the top NITs in India and also among the oldest. [[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta]], the first among the prestigious [[Indian Institutes of Management]], was set up in 1961 at [[Joka, Kolkata|Joka]]. It was the first national institute for post-graduate studies and research in management sciences. It was established with the help of the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:BRKM secondary section entrance.crop.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Baranagore Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama High School]]]]\nWest Bengal schools are run by the [[School Education Department, West Bengal]] government or by private organisations, including religious institutions. Instruction is mainly in English or Bengali, though [[Urdu]] is also used, especially in Central [[Kolkata]]. The secondary schools are affiliated with the [[Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations|Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE)]], the [[Central Board of Secondary Education|Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE)]], the [[National Institute of Open Schooling|National Institute of Open School (NIOS)]] or the [[West Bengal Board of Secondary Education]]. Under the [[10+2+3 plan]], after completing secondary school, students typically enroll for 2 years in a [[junior college]], also known as pre-university, or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the [[West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education]] or any central board. Students choose from one of three streams, namely [[liberal arts]], commerce or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students may enrol in general or professional degree programs. [[South Point School]], [[St. Xaviers Collegiate School]], [[Baranagore Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama High School]] etc. are some of the best schools of West Bengal.\n\n==Schools in West Bengal==\n=== Asansol ===\n<!-- \n***************************************************************************************************\n*                                                                                                 *\n* Please do not add a school to this list, UNLESS the school already has an article on Wikipedia. *\n*                                                                                                 *\n***************************************************************************************************\n -->\n* [[Asansol Arunoday High School]]\n* [[Domohani Kelejora High School]]\n* [[Loreto Convent, Asansol]]\n* [[St. Patrick's Higher Secondary School]]\n* [[St. Vincent's High and Technical School]]\n\n=== Darjeeling ===\n<!-- \n***************************************************************************************************\n*                                                                                                 *\n* Please do not add a school to this list, UNLESS the school already has an article on Wikipedia. *\n*                                                                                                 *\n***************************************************************************************************\n -->\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Dr. Graham's Homes]], [[Kalimpong]]\n* [[Gandhi Ashram School]]\n* [[Goethals Memorial School]], [[Kurseong]]\n* [[Loreto Convent, Darjeeling|Loreto Convent]]\n* [[Mount Carmel School, Darjeeling]]\n* [[Mount Hermon School, Darjeeling|Mount Hermon School]]\n* [[Rockvale Academy]]\n* [[St. Augustine's School]]\n* [[St. George's Higher Secondary School]]\n* [[St. Joseph's School, Darjeeling]]\n* [[St. Paul's School, Darjeeling]]\n* [[St. Roberts School, Darjeeling]]\n}}\n\nBerhampore\n{{Main|List of schools in Berhampore}}\n1.Prabharani Public School(PPS)\n2.Marry Immaculate School (MIS)\n3.Don Bosco School\n4.LMET International School\n5.Mount Litera Zee School\n6.Gitaram Academy\n7.Gitaram National School\n8.Krishna nath collegeiate School\n\n===Kolkata===\n{{Main|List of schools in Kolkata}}\n\n=== Other locations ===\n<!-- \n***************************************************************************************************\n*                                                                                                 *\n* Please do not add a school to this list, UNLESS the school already has an article on Wikipedia. \n*                                                                                                 *\n*************************************************************************************************** -->\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Aditya Academy (Senior Secondary)]]\n* [[Amrai High School]]\n* [[Andal Mahabir High School]]\n* [[Andhra Association School]]\n* [[Apeejay School Kolkata]]\n* [[Arambagh Girls High School]]\n* [[Auxilium Convent School]]\n* [[B.

Western models of education came to [[India]] through Kolkata. Many of the first schools and colleges were established by the missionaries and reformists. Sir [[William Jones (philologist)]] established the [[Asiatic Society]] in 1784 for promoting oriental studies. People like [[Ram Mohan Roy]], [[David Hare (philanthropist)|David Hare]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]], [[Shashi Bhusan Chatterjee]], and [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] played a leading role in the setting up of modern schools and colleges in the city. The [[Fort William College]] was established in 1800. The Hindu College was established in 1817. In 1855 the [[Hindu College, Calcutta]] was renamed as the [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]].\n\n[[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]] established the [[Serampore College]] in [[Serampore]] City (30&nbsp;km from Calcutta), 1818. It went on to become India's first modern university in 1827 when it was incorporated by a Royal Charter as a Danish University. Although it had the charter, it was not technically a university in the modern sense of that term. The [[Sanskrit College]] was established in 1824. Reverend [[Alexander Duff (missionary)|Alexander Duff]] of the [[Church of Scotland]] established the General Assembly's Institution in 1830 and later the Free Church Institution in 1844, which were later merged to form what is now known as the [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta]]. These institutions played a significant role in what came to be known as the [[Young Bengal|Young Bengal Movement]] and the [[Bengal Renaissance]]. [[La Martiniere Calcutta]] was established in 1836. [[John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune|John Bethune]] established a school for Indian girls in 1850 at a time when women's education was frowned upon in the society. The [[Bethune College]] for girls was set up by him in 1879.\n\nThe oldest medical school in Asia, the [[Calcutta Medical College]] was set up in 1835. In 1857, the [[University of Calcutta]] was established as the first full-fledged multi-disciplinary university in south Asia. It was modelled on the lines of the [[University of London]]. Today it is amongst the largest multidisciplinary universities of India and offers some of the widest number of academic disciplines for study. In 1856 technical and engineering education came with the establishment of a civil engineering college / department. This setup went through various reorganisations to finally become the [[Bengal Engineering College]] in 1921. The [[Jesuit]] administered [[St Xavier's College]] was established in 1860. In 1906, the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition of Bengal]] led to widespread nationalistic and anti British feelings. This led to the setting up of the National Council of Education, Bengal. This later on became the [[Jadavpur University]] in 1955.  The nation's first homeopathy college was established in the city in 1880. In 1883 [[Kadambini Ganguly]] and [[Chandramukhi Basu]] became the first women graduates from the [[University of Calcutta]]. In the process, they became the first female graduates of the [[British Empire]]. Kadambini went on to become the first female physician trained in the Western system of medicine in South Asia. The Science College was established in 1917. The first blind school came into being in 1925.\n\nAfter independence, [[Calcutta]] continued to be in the forefront of the educational scene. The [[Government College of Art & Craft]] was established in 1951. The [[Rabindra Bharati University]] was established in 1962. This university offers courses in the fine and performing arts. The [[Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management]] was set up in 1953 as the country's first management institute and is also the first in the country to offer an MBA degree of a university.  The first, [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur|Indian Institute of Technology]] was set up at [[Kharagpur]] about 120&nbsp;km from Calcutta. In 1960 the Regional Engineering college (presently [[National Institute of Technology, Durgapur|National Institute of Technology]]) at Durgapur was set up. It is amongst the top NITs in India and also among the oldest. [[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta]], the first among the prestigious [[Indian Institutes of Management]], was set up in 1961 at [[Joka, Kolkata|Joka]]. It was the first national institute for post-graduate studies and research in management sciences. It was established with the help of the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:BRKM secondary section entrance.crop.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Baranagore Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama High School]]]]\nWest Bengal schools are run by the [[School Education Department, West Bengal]] government or by private organisations, including religious institutions. Instruction is mainly in English or Bengali, though [[Urdu]] is also used, especially in Central [[Kolkata]]. The secondary schools are affiliated with the [[Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations|Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE)]], the [[Central Board of Secondary Education|Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE)]], the [[National Institute of Open Schooling|National Institute of Open School (NIOS)]] or the [[West Bengal Board of Secondary Education]]. Under the [[10+2+3 plan]], after completing secondary school, students typically enroll for 2 years in a [[junior college]], also known as pre-university, or in schools with a higher secondary facility affiliated with the [[West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education]] or any central board. Students choose from one of three streams, namely [[liberal arts]], commerce or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students may enrol in general or professional degree programs. [[South Point School]], [[St. Xaviers Collegiate School]], [[Baranagore Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama High School]] etc. are some of the best schools of West Bengal.\n\n==Schools in West Bengal==\n=== Asansol ===\n<!-- \n***************************************************************************************************\n*                                                                                                 *\n* Please do not add a school to this list, UNLESS the school already has an article on Wikipedia. *\n*                                                                                                 *\n***************************************************************************************************\n -->\n* [[Asansol Arunoday High School]]\n* [[Domohani Kelejora High School]]\n* [[Loreto Convent, Asansol]]\n* [[St. Patrick's Higher Secondary School]]\n* [[St. Vincent's High and Technical School]]\n\n=== Darjeeling ===\n<!-- \n***************************************************************************************************\n*                                                                                                 *\n* Please do not add a school to this list, UNLESS the school already has an article on Wikipedia. *\n*                                                                                                 *\n***************************************************************************************************\n -->\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Dr. Graham's Homes]], [[Kalimpong]]\n* [[Gandhi Ashram School]]\n* [[Goethals Memorial School]], [[Kurseong]]\n* [[Loreto Convent, Darjeeling|Loreto Convent]]\n* [[Mount Carmel School, Darjeeling]]\n* [[Mount Hermon School, Darjeeling|Mount Hermon School]]\n* [[Rockvale Academy]]\n* [[St. Augustine's School]]\n* [[St. George's Higher Secondary School]]\n* [[St. Joseph's School, Darjeeling]]\n* [[St. Paul's School, Darjeeling]]\n* [[St. Roberts School, Darjeeling]]\n}}\n\nBerhampore\n{{Main|List of schools in Berhampore}}\n1.Prabharani Public School(PPS)\n2.Marry Immaculate School (MIS)\n3.Don Bosco School\n4.LMET International School\n5.Mount Litera Zee School\n6.Gitaram Academy\n7.Gitaram National School\n8.Krishna nath collegeiate School\n\n===Kolkata===\n{{Main|List of schools in Kolkata}}\n\n=== Other locations ===\n<!-- \n***************************************************************************************************\n*                                                                                                 *\n* Please do not add a school to this list, UNLESS the school already has an article on Wikipedia. \n*                                                                                                 *\n*************************************************************************************************** -->\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Aditya Academy (Senior Secondary)]]\n* [[Amrai High School]]\n* [[Andal Mahabir High School]]\n* [[Andhra Association School]]\n* [[Apeejay School Kolkata]]\n* [[Arambagh Girls High School]]\n* [[Auxilium Convent School]]\n* [[B.

Key players for these 49ers included running back [[Ken Willard]], quarterback [[John Brodie]], and offensive lineman [[Bruce Bosley]]. During this time the 49ers became the first NFL team to use the [[shotgun formation]]. It was named by the man who actually devised the formation, San Francisco 49ers' coach [[Red Hickey]], in 1960. The formation, where the quarterback lines up seven yards behind the center, was designed to allow the quarterback extra time to throw. The formation was used for the first time in 1960 and enabled the 49ers to beat the [[1960 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]], who were not familiar with the formation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201302030sfo.htm|title=Super Bowl XLVII - San Francisco 49ers vs. Baltimore Ravens - February 3rd, 2013|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023145432/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201302030sfo.htm|archive-date=October 23, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1961 NFL season|1961]], primarily using the shotgun, the [[1961 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] got off to a fast 4\u20131 start, including two shutouts in back-to-back weeks. In their sixth game they faced the Chicago Bears, who by moving players closer to the line of scrimmage and rushing the quarterback, were able to defeat the shotgun and in fact shut out the 49ers, 31\u20130. Though the 49ers went only 3\u20135\u20131 the rest of the way, the shotgun eventually became a component of most team's offenses and is a formation used by football teams at all levels. In [[1962 NFL season|1962]], the [[1962 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] had a frustrating season as they won only 6 games that year. They won only one game at Kezar Stadium while on the road they won five of seven games. After posting a losing record in [[1963 NFL season|1963]]. Victor Morabito died May 10, 1964, at age 45. The [[1964 NFL season|1964 season]] was another lost campaign. According to the 1965 49ers Year Book the co-owners of the team were: Mrs. Josephine V. Morabito Fox, Mrs. Jane Morabito, Mrs. O.H. Heintzelman, Lawrence J. Purcell, Mrs. William O'Grady, [[Albert J. Ruffo]], [[Franklin Mieuli]], [[Frankie Albert]], Louis G. Spadia and James Ginella. The [[1965 NFL season|1965]] [[1965 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] rebounded nicely to finish with a 7\u20136\u20131 record. They were led that year by John Brodie, who after being plagued by injuries came back to become one of the NFL's best passers by throwing for 3,112 yards and 30 touchdowns. In [[1966 NFL season|1966]], the Morabito widows named Lou Spadia, team president.

Going into the game the 49ers had a half-game lead on the Rams and needed either a win or the [[1970 New York Giants season|Giants]] to defeat the Rams in their finale to give the 49ers their first ever divisional title.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the early game the Giants were crushed by the Rams 31\u20133, thus forcing the 49ers to win their game to clinch the division. In wet, rainy conditions in Oakland, the 49ers dominated the Raiders, 38\u20137, giving the 49ers their first divisional title, making them champions of the NFC West. The 49ers won their divisional playoff game 17\u201314 against the defending conference champion [[1970 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], thus setting up a matchup against the [[1970 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] for the NFC championship. In the final home game for the 49ers at [[Kezar Stadium]] the 49ers kept up with the Cowboys before losing, 17\u201310, thus giving the Cowboys their first conference championship. The 49ers sent five players to the [[1970 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] that season, including MVP veteran quarterback [[John Brodie]], wide receiver [[Gene Washington (49ers)|Gene Washington]], and linebacker [[Dave Wilcox]]. Nolan was also named NFL Coach of the Year for 1970. Following the 1970 season the 49ers moved from [[Kezar Stadium]] to [[Candlestick Park]]. Despite being located on the outskirts of the city, Candlestick Park gave the 49ers a much more modern facility with more amenities that was easier for fans to access by highway.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe 49ers won their second straight divisional title in 1971 with a 9\u20135 record. The 49ers again won their divisional playoff game, this time against the [[1971 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] by a 24\u201320 final score. This set up a rematch against the [[1971 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the NFC championship game, this time played in Dallas. Though the defense again held the Cowboys in check, the 49ers offense was ineffective and the eventual Super Bowl champion Cowboys beat the 49ers again, 14\u20133. In 1971, eight 49ers made the [[1972 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]], including defensive back [[Jimmy Johnson (cornerback)|Jimmy Johnson]] and [[Gene Washington (49ers)|Gene Washington]], both for the second year in a row, as well as defensive end [[Cedric Hardman]], running back [[Vic Washington]], and offensive lineman [[Forrest Blue]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1971/probowl.htm|title=1971 NFL Pro Bowlers {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=April 17, 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/656dqxh9G?url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1971/probowl.htm|archive-date=January 31, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe 49ers won their third consecutive NFC West title in [[1972 NFL season|1972]] with five wins in their last six games, making them the only franchise to win their first three divisional titles after the 1970 [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]]. Their opponents this time in the divisional playoffs were the [[1972 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], making it the third consecutive year the teams faced each other in the playoffs. Vic Washington took the opening kickoff 97 yards for a score, and the 49ers took a 21\u20136 lead in the second quarter. After the 49ers took a 28\u201313 lead in the 4th quarter, Tom Landry sent quarterback [[Roger Staubach]], who was backing up [[Craig Morton]], into the game. Staubach quickly led the Cowboys on a drive to a field goal, bringing the score to within 28\u201316, and as the game wound down it appeared that this would be the last points the Cowboys would get. However, Dallas completed the comeback in the last two minutes. Just after the two-minute warning Staubach took just four plays to drive 55 yards in only 32 seconds, hitting [[Billy Parks]] on a 20-yard touchdown pass to bring the score to 28\u201323. Cowboys kicker [[Toni Fritsch]] then executed a successful onside kick that was recovered by [[Mel Renfro]], giving the Cowboys the ball at midfield with 1:20 left on the clock. With the 49ers on the ropes, Staubach scrambled for 21 yards, then completed a 19-yard sideline pass to [[Billy Parks]] who went out of bounds at the 10-yard line to stop the clock. Staubach then completed the comeback with a 10-yard touchdown pass to [[Ron Sellers]] with only 52 seconds left, giving the Cowboys a dramatic 30\u201328 victory and sending the 49ers to yet another crushing playoff defeat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe 49ers run at the top of the NFC West ended in [[1973 NFL season|1973]] with the 49ers falling to a 5\u20139 record, their worst since 1969. The team lost six of its last eight games, including games to the also-ran [[1973 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and [[1973 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. In the final season of his career, longtime 49ers quarterback [[John Brodie]] split playing time with two other quarterbacks, most notably longtime backup [[Steve Spurrier]]. The team also suffered from not having a dominant running back, with [[Vic Washington]] leading the team with only 534 yards rushing.\n\nIn [[1974 NFL season|1974]], the 49ers drafted [[Wilbur Jackson]] from the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]] to be the team's primary back. Jackson enjoyed a fine rookie year, leading the 49ers with 705 yards rushing. He and fellow running back [[Larry Schreiber]] combined for over 1,300 yards rushing. With [[Steve Spurrier]] injured and missing nearly the entire year, the 49ers did not have a regular quarterback but did put together a respectable 6\u20138 record. Following the season, longtime tight end [[Ted Kwalick]] left the 49ers to join the [[World Football League]], then the Oakland Raiders upon the WFL's dissolution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 49ers dropped to 5\u20139 in what would be Dick Nolan's final season as coach in [[1975 NFL season|1975]], losing their final four games of the season. Wilbur Jackson was hurt much of the year and [[Delvin Williams]] led the 49ers in rushing with 631 yards rushing. Following the 1975 season the 49ers traded for [[New England Patriots]] quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]], former Heisman Trophy winner from nearby [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]] (which was also the alma mater of John Brodie). Though Plunkett had shown promise with the Patriots, he had not won there and it was thought that he needed a change of scenery. [[Monte Clark]] was also brought on as 49ers head coach.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 49ers featured one of the best running games in the NFL in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. Delvin Williams emerged as an elite back, gaining over 1,200 yards rushing and made the Pro Bowl. Wilbur Jackson also enjoyed a resurgence, rushing for 792 yards. Once again Gene Washington was the team's leading receiver with 457 yards receiving and six scores. The 49ers started the season 6\u20131 for their best start since 1970. Most of the wins were against second-tier teams, although the 49ers did shut out the Rams 16\u20130, in [[1976 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles]] on ''[[Monday Night Football]]''. In that game the 49ers recorded 10 sacks, including 6 by [[Tommy Hart]]. However, the 49ers lost four games in a row, including two against divisional rivals Los Angeles and [[1976 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]] that proved fatal to their playoff hopes. Louis G. Spadia retired from the 49ers in 1977 upon the team's sale to the DeBartolo Family. The team was sold to [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.]] in March 1977, and despite finishing the season with a winning record of 8\u20136, Clark was fired after just one season by newly hired general manager [[Joe Thomas (American football executive)|Joe Thomas]], who oversaw the worst stretch of football in the team's history.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nUnder coach [[Ken Meyer]] the 49ers lost their first five games of the [[1977 NFL season|1977 season]], including being shut out twice. Though they won five of their next six, they lost their last three games to finish the season 5\u20139. Playing in San Francisco did not revive Plunkett's career as he had another disappointing season, throwing only 9 touchdown passes. Bright spots for the 49ers included defensive linemen [[Tommy Hart]] and [[Cleveland Elam]], who made the Pro Bowl, and running backs [[Wilbur Jackson]] and [[Delvin Williams]], who combined for over 1,600 yards rushing. [[Gene Washington (49ers)|Gene Washington]] again led the team in receiving in 1977, his final year with the 49ers. The 1977 offseason was marked by a number of questionable moves by Joe Thomas that backfired badly. Thomas's big offseason acquisition was running back [[O. J. Simpson]] from the [[Buffalo Bills]]. As with Plunkett two years previously, it was thought that rescuing Simpson from a bad situation and bringing him to the west coast where he had been raised would rejuvenate his career. To create playing time for Simpson, Thomas traded Delvin Williams to the [[Miami Dolphins]] for wide receiver [[Freddie Solomon]]. Thomas also released Jim Plunkett, giving up on him after two seasons. Finally, Thomas fired Meyer after only one season, and replaced him with [[Pete McCulley]], his third coach in three seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1978/01/11/49ers-name-mcculley-coach/a0055e90-2f4a-4634-a175-d54c5eba7020/?noredirect=on|title=49ers Name McCulley Coach|website=washingtonpost.com|language=en|access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1978 NFL season|1978 season]] was a disaster for the 49ers, as they finished 2\u201314, their only wins coming against the [[1978 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] and [[1978 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Simpson indeed led the team in rushing, but with less than 600 yards. It became apparent that Simpson's knees and body were worn out, and he was near the end of his career. Wilbur Jackson also missed the entire season due to injury. Even worse for the franchise was that their first pick of the [[1979 NFL season|1979 draft]] was traded to the Bills as part of the O. J. Simpson deal. Joe Thomas was fired following the season. Some of the key players that became part of the 49ers stunning rise began their 49ers career in 1978. Rookie quarterback [[Steve DeBerg]], [[Joe Montana]]'s first mentor, was the 49ers starting quarterback. Running back [[Paul Hofer]] and center/guard [[Randy Cross]] also started with the 49ers in 1978.\n\n===1979\u20131980: Arrival of Bill Walsh and Joe Montana===\n[[File:DeBartolo headquarters.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of [[The DeBartolo Corporation]] in [[Boardman, Ohio]] with the 49ers logo on the building, signifying the team's ownership by the [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]-based DeBartolo-York family.]]\n\nThe team was led in its turnaround from late 1970s doormat by new owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.]] and head coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. The former head coach of [[Stanford University]] was known for stockpiling draft picks, making excellent draft selections, and patching roster holes by acquiring key free agents.\n\nBill Walsh was hired to be the 49ers head coach in the 1978 off-season. Walsh was a disciple of [[Paul Brown]], and served as Brown's offensive coordinator with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] from 1968 to 1975. However, Brown did not appoint him as his successor upon his retirement, choosing another assistant, former 49ers center Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson. Desiring head coach experience, Walsh looked to [[Stanford University]] in 1977. He had had some success there before the 49ers tapped him to be their replacement.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nWalsh is given credit for popularizing the '[[West Coast offense]]'. The Bill Walsh offense was actually created and refined while he was an assistant coach with the Bengals. The offense utilizes a short, precise, timed passing game as a replacement/augmentation of the running game. The offense is extremely difficult to defend against as it is content to consistently make 6\u20138-yard gains all the way down the field. (The other West Coast offense\u2014more focused on the vertical, or downfield, passing game\u2014was actually created by 1960s L.A. / San Diego coach [[Sid Gillman]], and San Diego State coach [[Don Coryell]], who also employed a version of it as head coach of the St. Louis (football) Cardinals and [[San Diego Chargers]] during a period where it garnered the nickname \"[[Coryell Offense|Air Coryell]]\".){{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn Walsh's first draft, the 49ers had targeted [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] quarterback [[Joe Montana]] as an early round pick. Montana had enjoyed a storied college career, leading the [[1977 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Fighting Irish]] to the 1977 national title and a number of dramatic comeback victories, the most stunning of all being his final game, at the [[1979 Cotton Bowl Classic]]. Playing the [[Houston Cougars football|University of Houston]] in an ice storm, and with Montana suffering from a bad flu, Notre Dame was down 34\u201310 in the third quarter. However, Montana led a magnificent rally that culminated with him throwing a touchdown pass on the game's final play to give Notre Dame the 35\u201334 win.\n[[File:Joe Montana ESPN cropped2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joe Montana]] in 2006]]\nDespite this, most scouts did not peg Montana as a top prospect. Although 6'2\" and 190\u2013200&nbsp;lbs., Montana's arm strength was considered suspect as was the consistency of his play. Although he did get his share of the credit, most thought of him as a system player surrounded by a great team.\n\nIn the 1979 draft, the Dallas Cowboys were placed just ahead of the 49ers. The Cowboys' draft strategy through that time was to take the highest-ranked player on their draft board at the time of their selection, regardless of position. When the Cowboys' turn came up in the third round, the highest rated player on their board was Montana. However, feeling that the quarterback position was in excellent long-term shape with [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Danny White]], and desperately needing a tight end, the Cowboys went off their strategy and drafted [[Doug Cosbie]]. The 49ers took Montana. The 49ers other notable draft choice of the 1979 draft was wide receiver [[Dwight Clark]] in the 10th round. Walsh discovered the unheralded Clark while scouting quarterback Steve Fuller of [[Clemson University]] as Clark ran routes for Fuller during Walsh's evaluation of the quarterback. Walsh's serendipitous discovery of Clark proved to be an early glimpse into the coach's keen eye for talent.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs Walsh implemented his strategies and game plan, the 49ers had another year of losing, finishing 2\u201314 like the previous season. There were, however, a number of bright spots. Despite throwing more interceptions (21) than touchdowns (17), [[Steve DeBerg]] blossomed under Walsh, throwing for over 3,600 yards and completing 60% of his passes. Freddie Solomon also had a good year, with over 800 yards receiving. The running game was patchwork, with Paul Hofer leading the team with 615 yards and [[O.J. Simpson]], in his final season, rushing for only 460 yards and being sidelined with injuries. The 49ers got off to a strong start in 1980, winning their first three games of the season. However, the team, still maturing, lost their next eight games in a row. Many of those games though were close, and the 49ers acquitted themselves well. During the season Walsh alternated DeBerg and Montana at quarterback. Though DeBerg had played well for the 49ers, Walsh felt the team's best chance to win in the long run was with Montana. He alternated the two quarterbacks, giving Montana some experience while keeping opponents off guard. This strategy of alternating quarterbacks from game to game and during games is rare in football, although it had been employed by other successful teams in the past, specifically the [[Dallas Cowboys]] of the early 1970s who alternated [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Craig Morton]], and the [[Los Angeles Rams]] of the late 1940s alternating [[Norm Van Brocklin]] and [[Bob Waterfield]].\n\nIn all DeBerg started nine games, going 4\u20135 with 1,998 yards, 12 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. Montana started seven games, going 2\u20135 with 1,795 yards, 15 touchdowns, and nine picks; Montana also had a better completion percentage at 64.5 to DeBerg's 57.9.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1980.htm|title=1980 San Francisco 49ers Statistics & Players {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=April 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418093129/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1980.htm|archive-date=April 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe highlight of the 1980 season, and a sign of good things to come, came in Week 14. The 49ers trailed the [[New Orleans Saints]], who at the time were winless at 0\u201313, 35\u20137 at halftime. However, led by [[Joe Montana]], the 49ers made (what was then) the greatest comeback in NFL history, coming back to tie the score in regulation and winning the game in [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] with a field goal by [[Ray Wersching]] to give the 49ers an incredible 38\u201335 victory. It was this game, which marked Montana's first big NFL comeback win, that won Montana the quarterback job full-time. A number of key players emerged for the 49ers in 1980. Among them were [[Dwight Clark]], who led the 49ers with 82 receptions and just under 1,000 yards receiving, and running back [[Earl Cooper (NFL)|Earl Cooper]], who ran for over 700 yards.\n\n===1981\u20131984: First two Super Bowls===\n{{See also|1981 San Francisco 49ers season|The Catch (American football)}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 27 - Dan Bunz (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Head coach Bill Walsh led the 49ers to their first NFL championship, defeating the Bengals 26\u201321 in [[Super Bowl XVI]].]]\nWith the offense playing well consistently, Walsh and the 49ers focused on overhauling the defense in 1981. Walsh took the highly unusual step of overhauling his entire secondary with rookies and untested players, bringing on board [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Eric C. Wright|Eric Wright]] and [[Carlton Williamson]] and giving [[Dwight Hicks]] a prominent role. He also acquired veteran linebacker [[Jack \"Hacksaw\" Reynolds]] and veteran defensive lineman and sack specialist [[Fred Dean]]. These new additions, when added to existing defensive mainstays like [[Keena Turner]], turned the 49ers into an offensively and defensively balanced, dominant team. After a 1\u20132 start, the 49ers won all but one of their remaining games to finish with a 13\u20133 record; up to this point in time it was the team's best regular season win-loss record in its history. Dean made the [[Pro Bowl]], as did Lott, and Hicks. Led by Montana, the unusual offense was centered on the [[west coast offense|short passing game]], which Walsh used as ball control. Both Dwight Clark and [[Freddie Solomon]] had excellent years receiving; Clark as the possession receiver, and Solomon as more of a deep threat. The 49ers running game, however, was among the weakest in the league. [[Ricky Patton]] led the 49ers with only 543 yards rushing. The 49ers' most valuable running back, however, might have been Earl Cooper, whose strength was as a pass-catching back. The 49ers faced the [[New York Giants]] in the divisional playoffs and won, 38\u201324. This set up an NFC championship game match-up with the [[Dallas Cowboys]], whom the 49ers historically could not beat during their playoff runs in the early 1970s. The 49ers played the Cowboys tough, but the Cowboys forced six turnovers and held the lead late. The 49ers were down 27\u201321 and on their own 11-yard line with 4:54 remaining. As Montana had done for Notre Dame and the 49ers so many times before, he led the 49ers on a sustained final 89-yard drive to the Cowboys' 6-yard line. On a 3rd-and-3 play, with his primary receiver covered, Montana rolled right and threw the ball off balance to Dwight Clark in the end zone, who leaped up and caught the ball to tie the game at 27 (now known as \"[[The Catch (NFL)|The Catch]]\"), with the extra point giving the 49ers the lead. Despite this, the Cowboys had one last chance to win. On the first play of the next possession, Cowboys receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] caught a pass from Danny White and got to midfield before he was pulled down by the jersey at the 49ers 44-yard line by Cornerback Eric Wright saving a potential late-touchdown. On the next play, White was sacked by [[Lawrence Pillers]] and fumbled the ball, which was recovered by [[Jim Stuckey]], giving the 49ers the win and a trip to their first ever Super Bowl against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], who were also in their first Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XVI]] The 49ers took a 20\u20130 halftime lead and held on to win 26\u201321 behind kicker [[Ray Wersching]]'s four field goals and a key defensive stand. Throughout the '81 season, the defense had been a significant reason for the team's success, despite residing in the shadow of the then-innovative offense. Montana won MVP honors mostly on the strength of leading the 49ers on a 92-yard, 12 play drive culminating in a touchdown pass to Earl Cooper. Thus did the 49ers complete one of the most dramatic and complete turnarounds in NFL history, going from a 2\u201314 season followed by a 6\u201310 season to a Super Bowl championship.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe 1982 season was a bad one for the 49ers, as they lost all five games at Candlestick Park en route to a 3\u20136 record in a strike-shortened season. This was the 49ers last losing season for the next 17 years. Joe Montana was the one highlight, passing for 2,613 yards in just nine games, highlighted by five straight games in which he broke the 300-yard barrier.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 28 - Roger Craig (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Roger Craig (''middle'') and Joe Montana (''right'') led the 49ers to their second Super Bowl victory ([[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]]) in four seasons.]]\nIn 1983, the 49ers won their final three games of the season, finishing with a 10\u20136 record and winning their 2nd NFC Western Divisional Title in three years. Leading the rebound was Joe Montana with another stellar season, passing for 3,910 yards and connecting on 26 touchdowns. In the NFC Divisional Playoffs, they hosted the Detroit Lions. The 49ers jumped out in front early and led 17\u20139 entering the 4th quarter, but the Lions roared back, scoring two touchdowns to take a 23\u201317 lead. However, Montana led a comeback, hitting wide receiver [[Freddie Solomon]] on a game-winning 14-yard touchdown pass with 2:00 left on the clock to put the 49ers ahead 24\u201323. The game ended when a potential game-winning FG attempt by Lions kicker [[Eddie Murray (American football)|Eddie Murray]] missed. The next week, the 49ers came back from a 21\u20130 deficit against the [[Washington Redskins]] in the NFC championship game to tie the game, only to lose, after a questionable defensive holding call, 24\u201321 on a Mark Moseley field goal that sent the Redskins to [[Super Bowl XVIII]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 1984, the 49ers had one of the greatest seasons in team history by finishing the regular season 15\u20131, setting the record for most regular season wins that was later equaled by the 1985 [[Chicago Bears]], the 1998 [[Minnesota Vikings]], the 2004 [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], the 2011 [[Green Bay Packers]] and finally broken by the 2007 [[New England Patriots]] (with 16 regular season victories). Their 18 wins overall is also still a record, tied by the 1985 Bears and the 2007 New England Patriots (they won 18 straight, but lost [[Super Bowl XLII]] to the [[New York Giants]]). The 49ers' only defeat in the 1984 season was a 20\u201317 loss to the Steelers; a late field goal attempt in that game by San Francisco kicker [[Ray Wersching]] went off the uprights and was no good. In the playoffs, they beat the [[New York Giants]] 21\u201310, shut out the [[Chicago Bears]] 23\u20130 in the NFC championship, and in [[Super Bowl XIX]] the 49ers shut down a record-setting year by NFL MVP [[Dan Marino]] (and his speedy receivers Mark Clayton and Mark Duper), beating the [[Miami Dolphins]] 38\u201316. Their entire defensive backfield (Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, Dwight Hicks, and Carlton Williamson) was elected to the Pro Bowl\u2014an NFL first.\n\n===1985\u20131987: Arrival of Jerry Rice===\nIn the [[1985 NFL Draft]], the team received the 28th overall pick after winning the Super bowl the previous year. On draft day, the 49ers traded its first two picks for New England's first-round choice, the 16th selection overall (the teams also swapped third-round picks as part of the deal), and selected [[Jerry Rice]] from [[Mississippi Valley State University|Mississippi Valley State]]. It was reported that the Dallas Cowboys, who had the 17th selection overall, were intending to pick him. In the 1985 season, the 49ers were not as dominant as in 1984, finishing the regular season with a 10\u20136 record and a wild card berth. Jerry Rice struggled at times (dropping numerous passes), but he still impressed the NFL in his rookie season for the 49ers in 1985, especially after a 10-catch, 241-yard game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] in December. Rice was named NFC Offensive Rookie of the Year after recording 49 catches for 927 yards, and averaging 19.9 yards per catch, [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] became the first NFL player to gain 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season. In the 1985 playoffs the 49ers were quickly eliminated from the playoffs by the [[New York Giants]] 17\u20133.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/30/sports/giants-stop-49ers-in-wild-card-playoff-17-3.html|title=Giants Stop 49ers in Wild-Card Playoff, 17-3|last=Litsky|first=Frank|date=December 30, 1985|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813060009/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/30/sports/giants-stop-49ers-in-wild-card-playoff-17-3.html|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1986 NFL season the 49ers got off to a quick start after a 31\u20137 win over the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] on opening day. But the win was costly; Joe Montana injured his back and was out for two months, the injury was to a spinal disc in Montana's lower back and required immediate surgery. The injury was so severe that Montana's doctors suggested that Montana retire. On September 15, 1986, the 49ers placed Montana on the [[injured reserve list]], [[Jeff Kemp]] became the starting quarterback, and the 49ers went 4\u20133\u20131 in September and October.\n\nMontana returned to the team on November 6 of that year. In his first game back from injury, Montana passed for 270 yards and three touchdown passes in a 43\u201317 49er victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. The 49ers caught fire, winning the next 5 of the final 7 games, including a 24\u201314 win over the [[Los Angeles Rams]], to clinch the NFC West title. Jerry Rice continued to show improvement from the previous season catching 86 passes for a league-leading 1,570 yards and 15 touchdowns. Montana was co-recipient of the 1986 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award, which he shared with Vikings quarterback [[Tommy Kramer]]. However, the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] would defeat the 49ers again in the playoffs, 49\u20133 in the team's worst post-season loss to date. Montana was again injured in the first half by a hit from the Giants' [[Jim Burt (football player)|Jim Burt]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/05/sports/montana-is-hospitalized-for-concussion.html | title=Montana Is Hospitalized for Concussion | first=Michael | last=Janofsky | date=January 5, 1987 | work=The New York Times | access-date=December 20, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204070453/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/05/sports/montana-is-hospitalized-for-concussion.html | archive-date=February 4, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the off-season, Bill Walsh was concerned about Montana's health going forward, and with no reliable back-up at quarterback he completed a trade for [[Steve Young]], then a quarterback with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. During the strike-shortened 1987 season, the 49ers became one of the NFL's elite teams once again with a league-best 13\u20132 record. Joe Montana had a bounce-back year after his injuries the previous year and being questioned by the media if he could still produce at a high level, by throwing 31 touchdown passes, a career-high. He also set the NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts without an incomplete pass (22), passed for 3,054 yards, and had a passer rating of 102.1. Rice had established himself as an elite receiver, he caught 65 passes for 1,078 yards and a then NFL-record 22 touchdowns in just 12 games. 1987 was the second of six seasons in which Rice would lead the NFL in receiving and/or touchdown receptions, he was named [[National Football League Offensive Player of the Year Award|Offensive Player of the Year]]. By the end of the regular season the 49ers were ranked No. 1 on both offense and defense and were heavy favorites to win the Super Bowl. However, they were stunned in the [[1987\u201388 NFL playoffs#NFC: Minnesota Vikings 36, San Francisco 49ers 24|NFC divisional round]], losing 36\u201324 to what was believed to be an inferior [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] team, their third straight playoff loss in a row. Joe Montana had one of his worst post-season games of his career, and was eventually benched during the game in favor of Steve Young, who scored a rushing touchdown and threw another. After the game, owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.|Eddie DeBartolo]] stripped Walsh of the team president title. [[Dwight Clark]] retired that off-season.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dwightclark87.com/bio.html | title=Dwight Clark biography | website=DwightClark87.com | access-date=February 3, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121110730/http://www.dwightclark87.com/bio.html | archive-date=January 21, 2018 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===1988\u20131989: Back-to-back Super Bowls===\nDuring the off-season, a quarterback controversy between Joe Montana and Steve Young had begun after Montana's poor performance in the playoffs the previous year. Many speculated that the 1988 season would be his last year with the team. In the [[1988 NFL season]], the 49ers struggled to start the season; Walsh would constantly switch QBs between Montana (who suffered an elbow injury week 1 that would linger for most of the season) and Young. At one point, they were 6\u20135 and the team was in danger of missing the playoffs. Before week 11, [[Ronnie Lott]] called a players-only meeting; after the meeting the team came together and defeated the defending Super Bowl champion [[1988 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in a Monday night game, Montana had fully recovered from his injury and retook the starting quarterback job as the team eventually finished the season at 10\u20136. They gained a measure of revenge by routing the [[1988 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 34\u20139 in the divisional playoffs. The 49ers then traveled to Chicago's [[Soldier Field]] for the NFC championship against the [[Chicago Bears]], where the wind chill factor at game time was -26\u00b0. However, despite the weather, Joe Montana picked apart the Bears' top-rated defense by scoring three touchdowns as the 49ers dominated the Bears with a 28\u20133 victory, earning the team's third trip to the Super Bowl, to go against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]. In [[Super Bowl XXIII]], despite numerous trips deep into Cincinnati territory by the 49ers, the game was tied 3\u20133 at halftime. Early in the fourth quarter, Montana tied the score at 13; however, Cincinnati regained the lead on a [[Jim Breech]] field goal to put the Bengals ahead 16\u201313 with just over three minutes left on the clock. Following the kickoff, and a holding penalty, the 49ers took over on their 8-yard line with 3:08 left on the clock. Joe Montana began the final drive by stepping into the huddle and remarking to offensive tackle [[Harris Barton]], during a television timeout, \"hey, there's [[John Candy]]\", as he pointed to the stands on the other side of the field.<ref name=comeback>{{cite web | url=http://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016306.html | title=Montana was comeback king | work=[[ESPN.com]] | last=Schwartz | first=Larry | accessdate=August 12, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809043825/http://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016306.html | archive-date=August 9, 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref> His calm demeanor reassured the 49ers, and he then engineered what some consider the greatest drive in Super Bowl history, as he drove the team 92 yards for the winning touchdown on a pass to [[John Taylor (American football)|John Taylor]] with only 34 seconds left, as they captured their third Super bowl championship with a score of 20\u201316. Jerry Rice was named Super Bowl MVP.<ref name=comeback/>\n\nAfter Super Bowl XXIII, Bill Walsh retired as head coach; his defensive coordinator and handpicked successor, [[George Seifert]], took over as head coach. In the [[1989 NFL season]], Joe Montana threw for 3,521 yards and 26 touchdowns, with only 8 interceptions, giving him a 112.4 quarterback rating, which was then the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history, and was named [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award|NFL Most Valuable Player]]. Jerry Rice, in his fifth year in the league, continued to dominate; he led the league with almost 1490 receiving yards, and 17 touchdowns. The 49ers clinched their fourth straight division title, beating the [[1989 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] 30\u201327 after a dramatic second-half comeback; they finished 14\u20132, gaining home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Their two losses were by a combined five points.\n\nIn the divisional playoffs, they easily defeated the Vikings, 41\u201313. In the [[1989\u201390 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 30, Los Angeles Rams 3|NFC championship game]], they played against the Rams for a third time; the previous two games had been decided by a total of 4 points, but they were able to blow out the Rams 30\u20133, earning another trip to the Super Bowl, where they defeated the [[1989 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in relatively easy fashion by a score of 55\u201310 in [[Super Bowl XXIV]] \u2013 setting a record for points scored and widest margin of victory in a Super Bowl. Montana himself set many Super Bowl records (some since tied or surpassed) en route to his third Super Bowl MVP. In winning the Super Bowl, the 49ers became the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls under different head coaches. This 1989 championship team is often regarded as one of the most dominant teams in NFL history, winning three playoff games by a combined 100 points.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://dev.realclearsports.com/lists/dominating_postseason_team_performances/1989_san_francisco_49ers.html | title=Top 10 Most Dominant Postseasons: 1989 San Francisco 49ers | date=May 28, 2012 | access-date=February 3, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205233159/http://dev.realclearsports.com/lists/dominating_postseason_team_performances/1989_san_francisco_49ers.html | archive-date=February 5, 2018 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20131993: Unsuccessful Three-peat / Steve Young Steps in===\n[[File:SF 49ers HQ tophy wall.JPG|thumb|right|49ers wall of trophies at the Marie P.

Joe Montana missed almost all of the following two seasons with a recurring elbow injury. Following the 1990 season, the 49ers left team stalwarts Roger Craig and Ronnie Lott unprotected and let them go to the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] via Plan B free agency.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-04/sports/1991247225_1_sprained-ankle-montana-torn-ligament|title=Mystery still surrounds extent of injury to Montanta's elbow|newspaper=articles.baltimoresun.com|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613222548/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-04/sports/1991247225_1_sprained-ankle-montana-torn-ligament|archive-date=June 13, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1991 NFL season|1991]], [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] injured the thumb on his throwing hand and later was sidelined with an injured knee. After 10 games, the 49ers had a record of 4\u20136. Backup quarterback [[Steve Bono]] helped the team win its next five games with Young sidelined. In the final game of the season, Monday night versus the NFC's number two seed, Young returned and the 49ers beat the [[1991 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] 52\u201314, finishing 10\u20136. However, the team missed qualifying for the playoffs by virtue of losing the head-to-head tiebreaker to the [[1991 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], which had beaten the 49ers on a last-second Hail Mary pass earlier in the season. The 1992 and 1993 seasons saw a resurgent 49er team under the leadership of Steve Young, but a subpar and aging defense could only take them to the NFC championship game before falling to the [[1991 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] each time.\n\nIn [[1992 NFL season|1992]], Joe Montana came back after missing almost two full seasons due to an elbow injury in his throwing arm, and started the second half of a Monday night game versus [[1992 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]] on December 28, 1992. With the 49ers clinging to a 7\u20136 lead, Montana entered the game and looked as though he had not missed a single snap, completing 15\u201321 for 126 yards and 2 touchdowns, as the 49ers defeated the Lions 24\u20136. The 49ers finished the 1992 season with a 14\u20132 record and home field advantage in the playoffs. San Francisco defeated the [[1992 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] 20\u201313 in the divisional playoff game, but lost to the [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 30\u201320 in the NFC championship at Candlestick Park.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAt the end of the 1992 season, partly fueled by media hype, the biggest quarterback controversy in football history was in full swing. After discussions with the owner and the coach, Montana asked for, and was granted, a trade to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] prior to the 1993 season. Despite Eddie DeBartolo wanting Montana to stay and start, Montana realized that he and Young could not stay with the 49ers without a controversy. Montana was later quoted as saying, \"If I had stayed and started, there would have been problems. If I had stayed and Steve Young had started, there would have been problems.\"\n\nThe 49ers finished the [[1993 NFL season|1993 season]], the team's first without Joe Montana on the roster, with a 10\u20136 record and no. 2 seed in the playoffs. San Francisco defeated the [[1993 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] 44\u20133 in the divisional playoff game, but lost to the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 38\u201321 in the NFC championship at Texas Stadium.\n\n===1994\u20131998: Fifth Super Bowl===\n[[File:49ers Super Bowl ring.jpg|thumb|200px|The 49ers ring for [[Super Bowl XXIX]]]]\n\nIn [[1994 NFL season|1994]], the team spent large amounts of money on the addition of several star free agents from other teams, including [[Ken Norton (American football)|Ken Norton Jr.]], [[Gary Plummer (American football)|Gary Plummer]], [[Rickey Jackson]], [[Bart Oates]], [[Richard Dent]], [[Charles Mann (American football)|Charles Mann]] and [[Deion Sanders]]. Additionally, several rookie players made key contributions to the team, some becoming season-long starters such as defensive tackle [[Bryant Young]], fullback [[William Floyd (American football)|William Floyd]], and linebacker [[Lee Woodall]]. Due to injuries to the offensive line, the 49ers had some tough times early in the season, including a 40\u20138 home loss to the [[1994 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], and a 24\u201317 loss to the [[1994 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], led by former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana. Following the Eagles game, a poll conducted on local sports radio station [[KNBR (AM)|KNBR]] showed that an overwhelming majority of 49er fans wanted head coach George Seifert fired. The game against the Eagles was a turning point for the 49ers despite the lopsided score. Quarterback Steve Young was benched in the 3rd quarter and was later seen livid on the sidelines, shouting profanities at Seifert. The following week in Detroit, the 49ers trailed the [[1994 Detroit Lions season|Lions]] 14\u20130. After throwing a pass, Young was hit, picked up, and driven into the ground by three Lions defenders. After the hit, Young was screaming with his face dark red in color. He crawled most of the way off of the field before refusing help from the trainers as he limped the remaining way off the field. He miraculously returned to the field one play later (NFL rules state that after trainers attend to an injured player, that player must leave the field for at least one play) to lead the 49ers to a 27\u201321 victory. The team rallied around Young to win 10 straight games, including a 21\u201314 victory over the two-time defending Super Bowl champion [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]. During that span the 49ers' average margin of victory was nearly 20 points per game, a sustained dominance not seen since the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]]. Despite scoring only 8 points in one game and 14 in another, the 49ers set a new record for total regular season and post season combined points scored. That record was later broken by the [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in 2007 (the 1998 Minnesota Vikings scored 556 regular season points, but only 68 post season points, for a total of 624 points, while the 1994 49ers scored 495 regular season points and 131 post season points for a total of 626, the second highest mark in NFL history). Even after those initial rough spots early in the season, the 49ers finished the season 13\u20133 and with home field advantage throughout the playoffs. In their first game, they easily defeated the [[1994 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], 44\u201315, setting up the third straight [[1994\u201395 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 38, Dallas Cowboys 28|49ers\u2013Cowboys NFC championship game]]. The 49ers took advantage of three early [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] turnovers, taking a 21\u20130 lead in the first quarter. Taking a 31\u201314 lead into halftime after a perfect 29-yard pass from Young to Rice in the closing seconds, the game appeared to be far out of reach for the Cowboys. But a 49er fumble on the opening kick of the 3rd quarter led to a Cowboy score, cutting the lead to 31\u201321. Later, the 49ers responded with a Young touchdown run, making it 38\u201321, before the Cowboys scored another touchdown in the final minutes for a final score of 38\u201328. The convincing win qualified the 49ers for their fifth [[Super Bowl XXIX|Super Bowl]] appearance, and the first to be played by two teams from California. The 49ers steamrolled the [[1994 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] 49\u201326 behind Young's record-setting 6 touchdown passes in [[Super Bowl XXIX]], at the time becoming the first team to win a record five Super Bowls. Finally establishing himself as a worthy successor to Joe Montana, Young was named the game's MVP. The 49er's run of five Super Bowl wins in 14 seasons (1981\u20131994) solidified them alongside the 1960s [[Vince Lombardi]] [[Green Bay Packers]] and 1970s [[Chuck Knoll]] [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] as one of the modern NFL's great dynasties.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2018/01/27/little-debate-about-who-tops-the-best-dynasties-in-nfl-history/ |title=\"Little debate about who tops the best dynasties in NFL history\", ''New York Post'' |access-date=January 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007073741/https://nypost.com/2018/01/27/little-debate-about-who-tops-the-best-dynasties-in-nfl-history/ |archive-date=October 7, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe 49ers made the playoffs in 1995 and again in 1996, being eliminated by the [[Green Bay Packers]] both times in the Divisional Round. On January 17, 1997, [[George Seifert]] retired as 49ers head coach. On the same day as Seifert's retirement, the 49ers hired [[California Golden Bears football|Cal]] head coach [[Steve Mariucci]] as his replacement. At the time, Mariucci only had one year of head-coaching experience at any level. The first game of the [[1997 NFL season|1997 season]] against the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] was a disaster, as both quarterback Steve Young and receiver Jerry Rice went down with injuries. Rice appeared to be out for the season with a serious knee injury, while Young left the game with one of the many concussions he suffered throughout his career. However, the team overcame adversity: Young returned two weeks later, and with the league's number one defense, the 49ers finished the season with a 13\u20133 record which included an 11-game winning streak which was the longest by a rookie head coach at the time, and the 49ers became the quickest team in NFL history to clinch their division at the time. Rice returned for one and a half quarters in week 16 against the [[Denver Broncos]], before getting another injury to his knee (unrelated to the first one). In the playoffs the 49ers defeated the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 38\u201322, advancing to the [[1997\u201398 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: Green Bay Packers 23, San Francisco 49ers 10|NFC championship game]] for the first time since 1994, where they again met the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] at Candlestick Park, but lost 23\u201310.\n\nDuring that season Eddie DeBartolo Jr. was involved in a corruption investigation regarding [[Louisiana]] [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Edwin Edwards]] and one of his [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] [[riverboat]] [[casino]]s. DeBartolo later pleaded guilty to a failure to report a felony charge in 1998. He was suspended from active control of the 49ers for one year. His sister, [[Denise DeBartolo York|Denise]], and her husband, [[John York|Dr. John York]], took over operations of the team.\n\nIn [[1998 NFL season|1998]], Jerry Rice finally returned from his knee injury week 1 against the [[New York Jets]], a game best remembered for running back [[Garrison Hearst]]'s 96-yard touchdown run in overtime to win the game. The 49ers had the 2nd most productive offense in league history. Young, who was questioned if his concussion history would put an end to his career, had his best season, throwing for 4,170 yards, 36 touchdowns and only 12 interceptions. A healthy Jerry Rice, 3rd-year player [[Terrell Owens]], and 4th-year player [[J.J. Stokes]] became the first WR-trio in team history to catch at least 60 passes in the same season, Hearst ran for 1,570 yards and 7 touchdowns while averaging 5.1 yards per carry. The 49ers finished 12\u20134, their 16th straight winning season (all with 10 wins or more), earning a wildcard berth.\n\nOnce again, the 49ers faced the [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] in the playoffs. Things looked bleak when the 49ers trailed 27\u201323 in the waning seconds. However, in the game's final moment, Young hit Terrell Owens (who was having a terrible game up to that point) on a dramatic, game-winning 25-yard touchdown pass, dubbed by many as \"The Catch II\". That put the 49ers ahead 30\u201327 with just three seconds left on the game clock, sealing the win. After finally beating the Packers, the 49ers went on to lose to the eventual NFC champion [[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] in the [[1998\u201399 NFL playoffs#NFC: Atlanta Falcons 20, San Francisco 49ers 18|Divisional round]] 20\u201318, in a game that was marked by Hearst suffering a gruesome broken ankle on the first play from scrimmage.\n\n===1999\u20132002: Ownership change===\nDeBartolo returned from his suspension in 1999, but a series of lawsuits over control of the family's vast holdings led him to surrender controlling interest to the Yorks as part of a 2000 settlement. Denise York became chairwoman of the board, while John York became CEO. On the field, the [[1999 San Francisco 49ers season|1999 49ers]] got off to a 3\u20131 start, then in a nationally televised ''Monday Night Football'' game against the [[Arizona Cardinals]], Steve Young suffered a blindside hit from cornerback [[Aeneas Williams]] that knocked him out of the game and eventually convinced him to retire. At the time it was believed the severe hit ended his career but Young later said in interviews he could have come back to play another season or two. After meeting with then-general manager Bill Walsh and being told about how the salary cap troubles would make the team non-competitive, Young chose to retire rather than risk his long-term health further for a likely losing club. Without their future Hall of Famer, 29-year-old rookie [[Jeff Garcia]] took over as starting quarterback, but he would be benched for poor performances in favor of [[Steve Stenstrom]]. Garcia would be reinstated as the starting quarterback and in the final 5 games of the regular season. The 49ers lost 11 of their last 12 games, and suffered their first losing season in a non-strike year since 1980, which was also the last time that the 49ers did not win at least ten or more games in a season. [[Bobb McKittrick]], 49ers offensive line coach since 1979, also died of cancer following the 1999 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/16/sports/bobb-mckittrick-64-coach-of-standout-offensive-line-for-49ers.html|title= Bobb McKittrick, 64, Coach of Standout Offensive Line for 49ers|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 16, 2000|last=Litsky|first=Frank|accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref>\n\nBefore the [[2000 San Francisco 49ers season|2000 season]] Jeff Garcia was named the starting quarterback despite the 49ers drafting two quarterbacks ([[Giovanni Carmazzi]] in the third round and [[Tim Rattay]] in the seventh). Garcia kept the starting job throughout the season and showed drastic improvement from the previous year. He broke a franchise record for most passing yards in one season, with 4,278 passing yards and 31 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions. Garcia and Terrell Owens, who established himself as the team's number-one receiver, both earned their first [[Pro Bowl]] selections. However, the 49ers finished 6\u201310, missing the playoffs for the second straight season for the first time since 1979 and 1980, due to a defense that gave up 26.4 points per game and a total of 422 points. The 2000 season was Jerry Rice's final year with the 49ers; he played 16 seasons with the team. In the [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|2001 season]] the 49ers established themselves as a playoff team once again after two down years. They finished with a 12\u20134 record and a wildcard berth. A quarter of their wins came in 4th-quarter comebacks. Their defense also had a bounce-back year, going from the 28th-ranked defense in 2000, to the 9th-ranked. Terrell Owens had become Jeff Garcia's favorite target. Garrison Hearst, who had been forced to retire from football after breaking his ankle in the 1998 divisional playoffs, finally returned to the line-up after over two years of rehabilitation. He became the first player in NFL history to come back to football after suffering [[avascular necrosis]]. He had an excellent season, rushing for 1,206 yards on a 4.8 average. His comeback earned him the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award]]. In the final 6 weeks of the season the 49ers defense shut out 3 teams (the [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Miami Dolphins]], and [[New Orleans Saints]]), and had one of the most stupendous goal-line stands against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. In the team's first playoff game in 2 years, they played against the [[Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]] in the [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs#NFC: Green Bay Packers 25, San Francisco 49ers 15|NFC Wild Card]], but lost 25\u201315. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe [[2002 NFL season]] began with the [[2002 NFL season#Expansion and realignment|divisional realignment]]. The 49ers gained two new divisional rivals, the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and [[Arizona Cardinals]], while former divisional foes [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[New Orleans Saints]], and [[Carolina Panthers]] moved to the newly formed [[NFC South]]. The team's production dropped from the previous year. Jeff Garcia went from having 31 and 32 touchdowns in the previous 2 seasons, to only 21 in 2002. The 49ers defense struggled at times, dropping from the 9th-ranked defense in the previous season to the 19th-ranked. Even though the team did not have the same success as they did in the 2001 regular season, the 49ers won the NFC West for the first time since 1997, with the division-clinching game coming on a last-second touchdown pass to Terrell Owens against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The 49ers finished 10\u20136. In the [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs]] they hosted the [[New York Giants]] in the [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs#NFC: San Francisco 49ers 39, New York Giants 38|2002 NFC Wild Card]]. The Giants had a 38\u201314 lead late in the third quarter; however, the Giants defense, which had been highly ranked all year, began to collapse, and by the final minute in the 4th quarter Jeff Garcia had led the team back from the 24-point deficit to take a 1-point lead. Giants quarterback [[Kerry Collins]] then led a drive in the game's final minute to put the Giants at the 49ers' 23-yard line with six seconds left for a shot at a game-winning field goal. [[Long snapper]] [[Trey Junkin]], who had been signed by the Giants that week, made a bad snap, so holder [[Matt Allen]] attempted a desperate pass down the field, which fell incomplete, but there was a flag on the play. The initial thought by spectators and the Giants was that pass interference had clearly been committed by the 49ers defense, but the flag was against the Giants for an ineligible receiver, so the game was over. The next day, the NFL admitted that the referee had blown the call, that the 49ers had indeed committed pass interference, and that the down should have been replayed. A press conference was held and a reporter asked 49ers head coach [[Steve Mariucci]] about his thoughts on the NFL saying they blew the call, and he replied: \"Bummer.\" It was the second-biggest comeback victory in NFL playoff history, with the 49ers winning 39\u201338. The 49ers lost the next week to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs#NFC: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31, San Francisco 49ers 6|Divisional round]], 31\u20136. This was the last postseason appearance for the 49ers until the [[2011\u201312 NFL playoffs|2011\u201312 playoffs]]. Steve Mariucci, whose published statements about his degree of power in the organization had frayed already-strained relations with management, was fired by John York, despite a winning record.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===2003\u20132010: Struggles===\nThen-[[Oregon State University|Oregon State]] head coach [[Dennis Erickson]] was signed to a five-year contract to replace Mariucci.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42814843/reno_gazettejournal/|title=Niners Choose Erickson|newspaper=Reno Gazette-Journal|location=Reno, Nevada|date=February 12, 2003|agency=Associated Press|page=B1}}</ref> The hiring of Erickson was highly criticized by the fans and the media, as Erickson's offensive philosophy was very different from the West Coast offense. The 2003 season was one of turmoil for the 49ers. While the Niners started the season with a 49\u20137 demolishing of Chicago, the team quickly began to unravel afterwards, as the relationship between Garcia and Owens turned sour upon Garcia taking issue with Owens's public praise for the play of backup quarterback [[Tim Rattay]]. Garcia responded with a cryptic remark of \"we cannot let the sickness spread\"; in response, Owens wore a surgeon's mask at the following practice. The team was also ravaged by injuries to key players on both sides of the ball; the often reckless play of Jeff Garcia started to take a toll on him, as he was forced to miss 3 games during the season. The 49ers finished 7\u20139 and missed the playoffs. Despite this disappointing result, Erickson was retained as coach for the 2004 season. Owens' on- and off-field antics led to the 49ers trading him to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] during the offseason. Several other key 49er players were released due to salary cap concerns, including Garcia and Hearst. The team finished the 2004 season with a 2\u201314 record, tying a franchise worst and finishing last in the NFC West for the first time since 1979, ending what had been the NFL's longest active streak for not finishing last in a division. With the worst record in the NFL the team secured the rights to the first pick in the NFL Draft. [[Dennis Erickson]] and general manager [[Terry Donahue]] were fired.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:Frankgore.png|thumb|left|49ers' former running back [[Frank Gore]] in action against the [[St. Louis Rams]] in 2007]]\n\nAfter an extensive coaching search, the 49ers hired the defensive coordinator of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] [[Mike Nolan]] as their head coach. Nolan was the son of [[Dick Nolan (American football)|Dick Nolan]], who had led the team to three consecutive playoff appearances from 1970 to 1972. The 49ers did not hire a general manager. In Mike Nolan's first draft as head coach, he selected quarterback [[Alex Smith (quarterback)|Alex Smith]] from the [[Utah Utes football|University of Utah]] with the first overall pick of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. It was a pick predicted by most, though many thought the 49ers might select local product [[Aaron Rodgers]] of the [[California Golden Bears football|University of California]]. Alex Smith's rookie season was a disaster, producing only one touchdown against eleven interceptions. The team finished 4th in the NFC West for the second consecutive year, with a 4\u201312 record. This earned the 49ers the 6th pick in the [[2006 NFL Draft]] which they used to draft tight end [[Vernon Davis]]. [[Alex Smith]] and the team improved greatly in 2006, led by second year player [[Frank Gore]] from the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]]. Gore ran for a franchise record of 1,695 rushing yards, which led the NFC, along with 8 touchdowns. He was awarded his first Pro Bowl appearance. They also swept division rival and defending NFC Champion, [[2006 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], and kept the [[2006 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] from a playoff berth in the last game of the season. However, the team finished 7\u20139, their fourth consecutive losing season.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[File:Alex Smith warm up 1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|49ers' former quarterback [[Alex Smith]]]]\nIn the off-season, the 49ers signed cornerback [[Nate Clements]] and safety [[Michael Lewis (safety)|Michael Lewis]] to improve their secondary. Clement's contract was worth $80 million for eight years, the largest contract given to a defensive player in NFL history at the time. In the [[2007 NFL Draft|NFL Draft]], the 49ers made another key addition to their defense, selecting middle linebacker [[Patrick Willis]] with the 11th overall pick. Willis would eventually be named the 2007 [[AP Defensive Rookie of the Year|AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]]. Before the beginning of the 2007 season, Hall of Fame coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] died of complications from [[leukemia]]. The 49ers started the season 2\u20130, for the first time since [[1998 NFL season|1998]]. In the fourth game of the season, against the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], Alex Smith suffered a separated shoulder on the third play of the game, an injury that severely hampered his play and ultimately led to an early end to his 2008 campaign after having shoulder surgery. Chiefly due to back up quarterback [[Trent Dilfer]]'s struggles and Alex Smith's injury, the 49ers lost eight straight consecutive games from week three through week twelve, ending the year with a disappointing 5\u201311 record. Questions were raised about the future of Alex Smith, whose first three seasons had been plagued by inconsistent play, injuries, and never having had the same offensive coordinator from one year to the next. Head coach Mike Nolan and new offensive coordinator [[Mike Martz]] stated that a competition between Smith, [[Shaun Hill]], and NFL journeyman [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] would run through the first two preseason games of 2008. O'Sullivan was named the 49ers starter because of his familiarity with the Martz offense and after performing better than Smith or Hill in the first three preseason games. On October 20, 2008, after a 2\u20135 start, Mike Nolan was fired. Assistant head coach [[Mike Singletary]], a [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] linebacker with the [[Chicago Bears]], was named as the interim head coach. Singletary proved to be a fan favorite when after his first game as head coach he delivered a memorable post game interview. Singletary said of their loss: \"... right now, we've got to figure out the formula. Our formula. Our formula is this: We go out, we hit people in the mouth.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entertonement.com/clips/xjtxzdvvnb--Hit-People-in-the-Mouth|title=Mike Singletary Press Conference \"Hit-People-in-the-Mouth\"|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The team went 5\u20134 overall under Singletary, winning five of its final seven games and ending the season with a 7\u20139 record. After the last game of the season, Singletary was named permanent head coach by Jed York, who had been appointed as team president just days before. [[Jed York]] is the oldest son of John York and Denise DeBartolo York.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:49ers Offense.jpg|thumb|[[Trent Dilfer]] (#12) quarterbacks the 2007 49ers]]\n\nOn April 25, 2009, the 49ers selected Texas Tech WR [[Michael Crabtree]], a player many people thought would go in the top five, with the 10th pick in the first round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. The 2009 training camp became the first since 2005 that the 49ers failed to have all drafted rookies signed and in training camp on time, as Crabtree held out trying to reach a contract. He finally reached a contract agreement on October 7, 2009, having missed the first four games of the regular season. The 49ers posted an 8\u20138 record after a frustrating season, losing only 2 games by more than a touchdown. Nevertheless, it was the team's first non-losing season since 2002. Despite missing the playoffs for the seventh straight season, several key players showed signs of improvement. Alex Smith regained his role as the 49ers' starting quarterback (after Shaun Hill had won the starting job in training camp), passing for more than 2,000 yards with 19 touchdowns, while Frank Gore collected his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard season, a 49ers record. Safety [[Dashon Goldson]] showed signs of potential in his first year as full-time starter, as he tallied 94 tackles, four interceptions, three forced fumbles, and two sacks. [[Vernon Davis]] in particular had a breakthrough year at tight end, earning Pro Bowl honors with 965 yards and 13 touchdowns (tying the NFL record for his position). 2010 saw five 49ers go to the Pro Bowl: Patrick Willis, Vernon Davis, Frank Gore, Justin Smith, and punter Andy Lee.\n\nThe [[2010 NFL season|2010 season]] started with the 49ers heavy favorites to win the NFC West after Cardinals QB [[Kurt Warner]] retired early in the offseason, but the season was a disaster. They started 0\u20135, their worst start since the dark days of 1979. In week 3, the 49ers fired offensive coordinator [[Jimmy Raye II|Jimmy Raye]], who had been hand-picked by Singletary in the 2009 offseason. Starting safety [[Michael Lewis (safety)|Michael Lewis]] demanded to be released after he was demoted in favor of rookie safety [[Taylor Mays]]. By mid-season, Singletary was switching QBs between [[Alex Smith]] and [[Troy Smith]], who had been picked up in free agency after the preseason, but with little effect. On December 27, 2010, the 49ers fired Mike Singletary as head coach, naming defensive line coach Jim Tomsula as interim head coach for the last game of the season, where despite crushing the [[2010 Arizona Cardinals season|Cardinals]] 38\u20137, they finished a sad and disappointing 6\u201310 and missed the playoffs yet again.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===2011\u20132014: Jim Harbaugh era===\nOn January 4, 2011, Jed York promoted interim General Manager [[Trent Baalke]] to be the permanent general manager.

From 1962, the 49ers' logo has been the iconic \"SF\" within the center of a red oval; throughout the years the logo has had minor modifications, such as a black outlining on the intertwined \"SF\" that was added in 1989 and a gold trimming inside the oval that was added in 1996.\n\n===Uniforms===\nThe San Francisco 49ers have two different uniforms: red and gold home uniforms and white, red, and gold road uniforms. However, the 49ers have changed uniform designs and color combinations quite often throughout their history. From the team's inception in 1946, they wore dark or cardinal red, switching to scarlet red jerseys and gold pants for the 1948 season, with a gold helmet with one red stripe, with solid red socks and pants with no stripes. Entering the 1949 season, the first in the NFL, the 49ers adopted three stripes to their red jerseys, wearing gold helmets and pants, with no stripes and red socks with three white stripes. In the 1953, '54, and '55 seasons, the 49ers wore red helmets with a gold stripe in the middle, with silver pants with one single stripe of red. The socks also added the three stripes similar to the jersey's. 1955 was also unique in that the 49ers wore white pants with a black stripe bounded by two red stripes, and shadow drop numbers on their red jerseys, with black shadow drop borders on the white numerals. The following season, 1956, the team wore white helmets with no stripes, and white pants with a red stripe. In 1957 the 49ers wore red jerseys, a gold helmet with no stripes, and gold pants with no stripes; for the first time the 49ers wore white on the road, as dictated by the NFL for all teams, to have at least one team wearing a light colored jersey during games. The first white jersey had two red stripes with a gold in the middle, as was their road socks: white, with two red stripes and gold in the middle. San Francisco wore red and gold in 1958 as well, with their white jersey having a single shoulder loop stripe, as well as adding TV numbers to the sleeves of their home and away jerseys. And in contrast to the socks at home, red with three red stripes, the away socks were solid red. In 1959 the team switched to red and platinum gold (looking more like silver), and for the next several years afterwards, with their white jerseys having double shoulder loop stripes (mimicking UCLA's), but continuing with the three white stripes on the sleeves above the elbow and below the TV numbers, with the red home jerseys. In 1960, the team added \"Northwestern\" red stripes to their helmets (a thicker middle stripe bordered by two thinner stripes), and that changed in 1962, with the addition of the helmet design the team has mostly worn since: white stripe bounded by two red, with the red oval and SF logo on the sides of the helmet. In 1964 the team's colors then changed again. All silver elements were changed to what was called \"49er Gold;\" helmets were gold. New beige-gold pants with a red-white-red tri-stripe in the same style as the helmet were introduced. Uniform's basic design would be worn for practically the next 30 seasons with only some minor changes and adjustments, such as a gradual change over from sans-serif to serifed block numerals from 1970 to 1974 and a switch from thin stripes to a very thick pant striping in 1976 (during which white jerseys were also worn at home for most of that season). The uniform ensemble of red and white jerseys, and beige-gold pants with thick striping were worn until 1995 with a few minor changes. During the 1994 season, many NFL teams wore \"throwback uniforms\" on occasional games to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary (a corresponding diamond-shaped 75th Anniversary patch was also worn by all teams) . The 49ers chose to wear a version of their 1955 uniforms as their throwbacks, with simpler sans-serif block numerals that were outlined and shadowed in black with White pants with thinner red-black-red striping were also worn, along with the old striped red socks. The regular 1989\u201395 design gold helmet was worn with this uniform, as there was no logo on the 1955 helmet.\n\nIn 1996, the 49ers celebrated their 49th anniversary by designing a commemorative jersey patch based on the earlier shield-crest logo. The team also debuted a substantially new uniform design, most notably changing the shade of red used in their jerseys from bright scarlet to a deeper, cardinal red a black dropshadow effect (along with gold trim) was added to the jersey numerals (which remained in the blocked serif style). As in 1994, the Niners donned white pants full-time for the 1996 season (also wearing them for the 1997 season and 1998 preseason,) though this time the pant stripes were marginally thicker and the colors were reversed to black-cardinal red-black (matching the striping on the helmets). For the 1998 regular season opener, the team switched back to gold pants, with a more metallic gold rather than the previous beige-matte gold of the past. The striping along the side of the pants remained black-cardinal red-black, though a thin gold trimming was added, along with further oval \"SF\" logos placed on both sides of the hip. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe 1996 helmet and jersey design with the 1998 gold pants was worn as the team's regular uniforms until the end of the 2008 season. The 49ers once again changed uniforms in 2009, which are very similar to the classic design, albeit with several significant changes. The sleeve stripes are now set at an angle to accommodate the even shorter sleeves of modern jerseys, (though the stripes appear straight and parallel to the ground when worn by the players themselves).<ref>{{cite news|last=Price|first=Taylor|title=49ers Unveil Classic Uniforms|url=https://www.49ers.com/news/49ers-unveil-classic-uniforms-490491|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=April 25, 2009|access-date=May 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508021911/https://www.49ers.com/news/49ers-unveil-classic-uniforms-490491|archive-date=May 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> An updated 49ers uniform with improved fit, and more breathable and moisture-resistant fabrics was debuted (alongside the rest of the NFL teams) by new league uniform manufacturer [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] on April 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Price|first=Taylor|title=Morning Tailgate: Uniform Edition (April 3)|url=http://blog.49ers.com/2012/04/03/morning-tailgate-uniform-edition-april-3/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=April 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405210202/http://blog.49ers.com/2012/04/03/morning-tailgate-uniform-edition-april-3|archivedate=April 5, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn April 30, 2015 at their [[2015 NFL Draft|NFL Draft]] rally, the team unveiled their first ever alternate uniform (as opposed to a throwback design).

Prior to 2002, the teams played each other almost every season during the pre-season, but only every three years during the regular season when the AFC West and NFC West teams faced each other. So far, their rivalry has not been as intense as other division foes because for the most part both teams have not been good at the same time. In the middle to late part of the decade, the Seahawks lost the division and their favorable record against the 49ers reflected this. However, games at [[CenturyLink Field]], one of the toughest stadiums to play at as a visiting team, have still been difficult to win. The 49ers have a 3\u20137 record all-time at that stadium, with their largest margin of victory there being ten points, and failed to score a touchdown in four of those losses. The rivalry has intensified after the 49ers hired [[Jim Harbaugh]] out of [[Stanford University|Stanford]] in 2011, as he and Seahawks and former [[University of Southern California|USC]] head coach [[Pete Carroll]] had an intense rivalry in college. Seattle leads the all-time series 20\u201315 after winning both regular season games in 2014 and taking a week 7 win at Levi's Stadium in 2015.\n\n====Arizona Cardinals====\nThe [[Arizona Cardinals]] are a recent growing rival of the 49ers. Unlike most rivalries of this team, the Arizona Cardinals are in the same division as the 49ers (since 2002, when the Cardinals transferred from the [[NFC East]]). Recently, there has been much bad blood between these two teams' players; an example of this is a Twitter \"battle\" between [[Darnell Dockett]] of the Arizona Cardinals and [[Vernon Davis]] of the San Francisco 49ers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revengeofthebirds.com/2010/5/11/1468108/adrian-wilson-vs-vernon-davis-rotb|title=Adrian Wilson vs Vernon Davis; ROTB Announcement|publisher=Revengeofthebirds.com|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=January 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721204430/http://www.revengeofthebirds.com/2010/5/11/1468108/adrian-wilson-vs-vernon-davis-rotb|archive-date=July 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Another clash was when Early Doucet of the Cardinals and Dashon Goldson of the Niners threw punches at each other. The clash of words between players of both teams, added with the decline of the other major rivalries of the 49ers, either from the rarity of meeting the rival teams (49ers rarely meet the Cowboys) or the move to different cities (Los Angeles Rams moving to St. Louis), has led to the rivalry between the 49ers and the Cardinals becoming heated and intense. The 49ers hold the edge over the Cardinals all-time by 28\u201318.<ref>[http://blogs.mercurynews.com/49ers/2011/01/02/49ers-cardinals-pre-game-notes-lombardi-says-harbaugh-lookes-headed-for-michigan/ 49ers\u2013Cardinals pre-game notes: Lombardi says Harbaugh looks headed for Michigan; 49ers Hot Read] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714073521/http://blogs.mercurynews.com/49ers/2011/01/02/49ers-cardinals-pre-game-notes-lombardi-says-harbaugh-lookes-headed-for-michigan/ |date=July 14, 2011 }}, mercurynews.com, January 2, 2011; accessed November 27, 2014.</ref>\n\n===NFC===\n\n====Green Bay Packers====\n\nThe [[Green Bay Packers]] rivalry emerged in the mid-1990s when the Packers upset the 49ers in the 1995 NFC Divisional game at Candlestick Park, ending any chance of a Super Bowl repeat. From that point, the Packers beat the 49ers four more times including two post-season games. San Francisco was finally able to exact revenge in the 1998 NFC Wild Card round, a game that is remembered for a 25-yard game-winning touchdown reception by [[Terrell Owens]] off a [[Steve Young]] pass (referred to by some as \"The Catch II\"), lifting the 49ers over the Packers 30\u201327. Since that game, the Packers had beaten the 49ers eight straight times including once in the 2001 post-season, a streak that came to an end in the 2012 season when the 49ers beat the Packers in [[Lambeau Field]] week 1 for the first time since 1990, and again in the NFC Divisional game that same season. The 49ers trail the all-time series with a record of 32\u201336\u20131, including a 4\u20134 postseason split.\n\n===Historic rivals===\n{{original research section|date=January 2013}}\n\n====Dallas Cowboys====\n{{main|49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry}}\nThe rivalry between the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and the 49ers has lasted since the 1970s. The [[NFL Top 10]] ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in NFL history. San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC championship game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' [[Joe Montana]] complete a game-winning pass to [[Dwight Clark]] in the final minute (now known as '''The Catch'''), is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992\u20131994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC championship game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are second all time in [[Super Bowl]] victories to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] with five each. The 49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. In recent years, this once-great rivalry has greatly softened, with the struggles of both the Cowboys and 49ers. However, in its prime especially in the 1990s, this rivalry was a very bitter one as both teams were the class of the NFL during this time.\n\n====New York Giants====\n{{main|49ers\u2013Giants rivalry}}\n\nThe [[New York Giants]] have the most playoff meetings versus the 49ers (eight). This rivalry is rooted in the 1980s when both teams were on the rise. In the first two playoff meetings between these two teams, the [[Joe Montana]]-led 49ers won both meetings, 38\u201324 in [[1981 NFL Season|1981]] and 21\u201310 in [[1984 NFL Season|1984]] both in the divisional round at [[Candlestick Park]]; the 49ers went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The Giants won the next three playoff meetings, which included a 49\u20133 rout at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[1986 NFL Season|1986]], and the [[1990 NFL Season|1990 NFC championship]], where they upset the 49ers 15\u201313, ruining the 49ers hopes of a Super Bowl three-peat after [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] lost a fumble late in the fourth quarter and let the Giants score on a last-second field goal. Giants also went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The 49ers defeated the Giants 44\u20133 in [[1993 NFL Season|1993]] in the divisional round.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/schedules;/1993/POST NFL 1993 Post-season Schedule] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506161202/http://www.nfl.com/schedules;/1993/POST |date=May 6, 2019 }} NFL.com; Retrieved 6 May 2019</ref>  In the [[2002 NFL Season|2002 NFC Wildcard]] game, the Giants were ahead 38\u201314 late in the third quarter; however, the 49ers came back from the 24-point deficit to beat the Giants with a 39\u201338 victory. The teams met again in the [[2011 NFL Season|2011 NFC championship]] at Candlestick Park, and just like the 1990 NFC championship, it was a low-scoring game; the Giants won the game on a [[Lawrence Tynes]] 31-yard field goal in overtime, 20\u201317. In an eerie similarity to Roger Craig's fumble 21 years earlier, [[Kyle Williams (wide receiver)|Kyle Williams]] fumbled a punt in the crucial minutes of the game, and just like the last two times the Giants beat the 49ers in the playoffs, they went on to win the Super Bowl.\n\n====New Orleans Saints====\n\nAll-time record:  49\u201326\u20132 (including 1\u20130 postseason)\n\nThe [[New Orleans Saints]] were division rivals with the 49ers up until realignment in 2002 when the Saints were placed in the newly formed [[NFC South]]. The 49ers dominated the rivalry when the Saints played in the [[NFC West]], but the Saints have held the upper hand since realignment, winning the first six-game since moving to the NFC South. They met most recently in the divisional round of the [[2011\u201312 NFL playoffs|2011 playoffs]] at Candlestick Park. There were four lead changes in the final four minutes of the game, culminating with [[Alex Smith]] throwing the game-winning touchdown to [[Vernon Davis]] with nine seconds left (referred by many as '''Vernon Post''' or '''The Catch III'''). Three months after that game, it was revealed that then-Saints [[defensive coordinator]] [[Gregg Williams]] ordered his players to target certain players in certain areas in a profanity-laced speech as part of the [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal|bounty]] scandal prior to that game.\n\n====Atlanta Falcons====\n\nAll-time record:  47\u201332\u20131 (including 1\u20131 postseason)\n\nThe [[Atlanta Falcons]] were also division rivals with the 49ers until the Falcons moved to the NFC South in 2002 after the realignment. Just like the Saints, the 49ers had dominated the Falcons when they played in the NFC West, but the Falcons won their first four games (spanning nine seasons) against the 49ers since moving to the NFC South. Both teams met in the divisional round of the [[1998\u201399 NFL playoffs|1998 playoffs]], when [[Garrison Hearst]] suffered an ankle break when his foot was caught in the [[Georgia Dome]] turf and twisted severely as he tried to spin away from Falcons' defensive end [[Chuck Smith (football player)|Chuck Smith]] on the first play from [[Line of scrimmage|scrimmage]]; 49ers lost that game 20\u201318. They met in the [[2012\u201313 NFL playoffs|2012 NFC championship]], in which the 49ers, led by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, defeated the top-seeded Falcons in Atlanta by a score of 28\u201324. The next year, the Falcons played against the 49ers in the last home game at Candlestick Park. The game ended in a dramatic interception return for a touchdown also known as \"The Pick at the 'Stick\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Fann|first=Joe|title=NaVorro Bowman Retires from NFL as a Member of the 49ers|url=https://www.49ers.com/news/navorro-bowman-retires-from-nfl-as-a-member-of-the-49ers|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=June 4, 2019|access-date=July 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190629081852/https://www.49ers.com/news/navorro-bowman-retires-from-nfl-as-a-member-of-the-49ers|archive-date=June 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.levisstadium.com/2015/04/49ers-announce-2015-schedule/|title=49ers Announce 2015 Schedule|date=April 21, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525153719/http://www.levisstadium.com/2015/04/49ers-announce-2015-schedule/|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n====Las Vegas Raiders====\n{{Main|49ers\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe [[Las Vegas Raiders]] were the 49ers' geographic rivals prior to the Raiders relocation to Las Vegas. As a result, games between the two were referred to as the \"Battle of the Bay.\"<ref name=\"battletwo\">{{cite news|title=49ers And Raiders Stagger Into Battle|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=49ers&id=4638285|agency=Associated Press|publisher=KGO-TV|date=October 7, 2006|accessdate=February 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219105318/http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=49ers&id=4638285|archive-date=February 19, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first exhibition game played in 1967, ended with the NFL 49ers defeating the AFL Raiders 13\u201310. After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38\u20137. The rivalry still remained heated when [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|the Raiders moved to Los Angeles]], leaving many Raider fans in Northern California bitter over the move, and some of them becoming 49er fans, added with the antagonism between Northern and Southern California. The Raiders notably upset the defending Super Bowl champion 49ers in San Francisco in 1982, winning 23-17. Since the two teams play in different conferences, regular season matchups are at least every four years. Fans and players of the winning team can claim \"bragging rights\" as the better team in the area. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}In addition, both teams have shared a number of players, most notably [[Jim Plunkett]], [[Jerry Rice]], [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Michael Crabtree]], [[Tom Rathman]], and [[Charlie Garner]].\n\nThe Battle of the Bay ended tied 7 to 7. San Francisco won the last matchup 34-3 on November 1, 2018 in Week 9\n\nOn August 20, 2011, in the third week of the pre-season, the pre-season game between the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at [[Candlestick Park]] including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured. The NFL decided to cancel all future pre-season games between the Raiders and 49ers.\n\n==Season-by-season records==\nThis is a partial list of the 49ers' last five completed seasons.

Key players for these 49ers included running back [[Ken Willard]], quarterback [[John Brodie]], and offensive lineman [[Bruce Bosley]]. During this time the 49ers became the first NFL team to use the [[shotgun formation]]. It was named by the man who actually devised the formation, San Francisco 49ers' coach [[Red Hickey]], in 1960. The formation, where the quarterback lines up seven yards behind the center, was designed to allow the quarterback extra time to throw. The formation was used for the first time in 1960 and enabled the 49ers to beat the [[1960 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]], who were not familiar with the formation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201302030sfo.htm|title=Super Bowl XLVII - San Francisco 49ers vs. Baltimore Ravens - February 3rd, 2013|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023145432/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201302030sfo.htm|archive-date=October 23, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1961 NFL season|1961]], primarily using the shotgun, the [[1961 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] got off to a fast 4\u20131 start, including two shutouts in back-to-back weeks. In their sixth game they faced the Chicago Bears, who by moving players closer to the line of scrimmage and rushing the quarterback, were able to defeat the shotgun and in fact shut out the 49ers, 31\u20130. Though the 49ers went only 3\u20135\u20131 the rest of the way, the shotgun eventually became a component of most team's offenses and is a formation used by football teams at all levels. In [[1962 NFL season|1962]], the [[1962 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] had a frustrating season as they won only 6 games that year. They won only one game at Kezar Stadium while on the road they won five of seven games. After posting a losing record in [[1963 NFL season|1963]]. Victor Morabito died May 10, 1964, at age 45. The [[1964 NFL season|1964 season]] was another lost campaign. According to the 1965 49ers Year Book the co-owners of the team were: Mrs. Josephine V. Morabito Fox, Mrs. Jane Morabito, Mrs. O.H. Heintzelman, Lawrence J. Purcell, Mrs. William O'Grady, [[Albert J. Ruffo]], [[Franklin Mieuli]], [[Frankie Albert]], Louis G. Spadia and James Ginella. The [[1965 NFL season|1965]] [[1965 San Francisco 49ers season|49ers]] rebounded nicely to finish with a 7\u20136\u20131 record. They were led that year by John Brodie, who after being plagued by injuries came back to become one of the NFL's best passers by throwing for 3,112 yards and 30 touchdowns. In [[1966 NFL season|1966]], the Morabito widows named Lou Spadia, team president. For the [[1968 NFL season|1968 season]], the 49ers hired as their head coach [[Dick Nolan (American football)|Dick Nolan]], who had been [[Tom Landry]]'s defensive coordinator with the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Nolan's first two seasons with the 49ers had gone much the same as the previous decade, with the 49ers going 7\u20136\u20131 and 4\u20138\u20132.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/Team/year-by-year-results.pdf|title=49ers Yearly Results and Statistics National Football League (1950-present)|last=|first=|date=|work=2016 Season Media Guide|publisher=|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525171035/http://prod.static.49ers.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/Team/year-by-year-results.pdf|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe 49ers started out the [[1970 NFL season|1970 season]] 7\u20131\u20131, their only loss a one-point defeat to [[1970 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]].

In wet, rainy conditions in Oakland, the 49ers dominated the Raiders, 38\u20137, giving the 49ers their first divisional title, making them champions of the NFC West. The 49ers won their divisional playoff game 17\u201314 against the defending conference champion [[1970 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], thus setting up a matchup against the [[1970 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] for the NFC championship. In the final home game for the 49ers at [[Kezar Stadium]] the 49ers kept up with the Cowboys before losing, 17\u201310, thus giving the Cowboys their first conference championship.

Nolan was also named NFL Coach of the Year for 1970. Following the 1970 season the 49ers moved from [[Kezar Stadium]] to [[Candlestick Park]].

The 49ers again won their divisional playoff game, this time against the [[1971 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] by a 24\u201320 final score. This set up a rematch against the [[1971 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the NFC championship game, this time played in Dallas. Though the defense again held the Cowboys in check, the 49ers offense was ineffective and the eventual Super Bowl champion Cowboys beat the 49ers again, 14\u20133. In 1971, eight 49ers made the [[1972 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]], including defensive back [[Jimmy Johnson (cornerback)|Jimmy Johnson]] and [[Gene Washington (49ers)|Gene Washington]], both for the second year in a row, as well as defensive end [[Cedric Hardman]], running back [[Vic Washington]], and offensive lineman [[Forrest Blue]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1971/probowl.htm|title=1971 NFL Pro Bowlers {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=April 17, 2018|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/656dqxh9G?url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1971/probowl.htm|archive-date=January 31, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe 49ers won their third consecutive NFC West title in [[1972 NFL season|1972]] with five wins in their last six games, making them the only franchise to win their first three divisional titles after the 1970 [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]]. Their opponents this time in the divisional playoffs were the [[1972 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], making it the third consecutive year the teams faced each other in the playoffs. Vic Washington took the opening kickoff 97 yards for a score, and the 49ers took a 21\u20136 lead in the second quarter. After the 49ers took a 28\u201313 lead in the 4th quarter, Tom Landry sent quarterback [[Roger Staubach]], who was backing up [[Craig Morton]], into the game. Staubach quickly led the Cowboys on a drive to a field goal, bringing the score to within 28\u201316, and as the game wound down it appeared that this would be the last points the Cowboys would get. However, Dallas completed the comeback in the last two minutes. Just after the two-minute warning Staubach took just four plays to drive 55 yards in only 32 seconds, hitting [[Billy Parks]] on a 20-yard touchdown pass to bring the score to 28\u201323. Cowboys kicker [[Toni Fritsch]] then executed a successful onside kick that was recovered by [[Mel Renfro]], giving the Cowboys the ball at midfield with 1:20 left on the clock. With the 49ers on the ropes, Staubach scrambled for 21 yards, then completed a 19-yard sideline pass to [[Billy Parks]] who went out of bounds at the 10-yard line to stop the clock. Staubach then completed the comeback with a 10-yard touchdown pass to [[Ron Sellers]] with only 52 seconds left, giving the Cowboys a dramatic 30\u201328 victory and sending the 49ers to yet another crushing playoff defeat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe 49ers run at the top of the NFC West ended in [[1973 NFL season|1973]] with the 49ers falling to a 5\u20139 record, their worst since 1969. The team lost six of its last eight games, including games to the also-ran [[1973 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and [[1973 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. In the final season of his career, longtime 49ers quarterback [[John Brodie]] split playing time with two other quarterbacks, most notably longtime backup [[Steve Spurrier]]. The team also suffered from not having a dominant running back, with [[Vic Washington]] leading the team with only 534 yards rushing.\n\nIn [[1974 NFL season|1974]], the 49ers drafted [[Wilbur Jackson]] from the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]] to be the team's primary back. Jackson enjoyed a fine rookie year, leading the 49ers with 705 yards rushing. He and fellow running back [[Larry Schreiber]] combined for over 1,300 yards rushing. With [[Steve Spurrier]] injured and missing nearly the entire year, the 49ers did not have a regular quarterback but did put together a respectable 6\u20138 record. Following the season, longtime tight end [[Ted Kwalick]] left the 49ers to join the [[World Football League]], then the Oakland Raiders upon the WFL's dissolution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 49ers dropped to 5\u20139 in what would be Dick Nolan's final season as coach in [[1975 NFL season|1975]], losing their final four games of the season. Wilbur Jackson was hurt much of the year and [[Delvin Williams]] led the 49ers in rushing with 631 yards rushing. Following the 1975 season the 49ers traded for [[New England Patriots]] quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]], former Heisman Trophy winner from nearby [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]] (which was also the alma mater of John Brodie). Though Plunkett had shown promise with the Patriots, he had not won there and it was thought that he needed a change of scenery. [[Monte Clark]] was also brought on as 49ers head coach.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe 49ers featured one of the best running games in the NFL in [[1976 NFL season|1976]]. Delvin Williams emerged as an elite back, gaining over 1,200 yards rushing and made the Pro Bowl. Wilbur Jackson also enjoyed a resurgence, rushing for 792 yards. Once again Gene Washington was the team's leading receiver with 457 yards receiving and six scores. The 49ers started the season 6\u20131 for their best start since 1970. Most of the wins were against second-tier teams, although the 49ers did shut out the Rams 16\u20130, in [[1976 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles]] on ''[[Monday Night Football]]''. In that game the 49ers recorded 10 sacks, including 6 by [[Tommy Hart]]. However, the 49ers lost four games in a row, including two against divisional rivals Los Angeles and [[1976 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]] that proved fatal to their playoff hopes. Louis G. Spadia retired from the 49ers in 1977 upon the team's sale to the DeBartolo Family. The team was sold to [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.]] in March 1977, and despite finishing the season with a winning record of 8\u20136, Clark was fired after just one season by newly hired general manager [[Joe Thomas (American football executive)|Joe Thomas]], who oversaw the worst stretch of football in the team's history.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nUnder coach [[Ken Meyer]] the 49ers lost their first five games of the [[1977 NFL season|1977 season]], including being shut out twice. Though they won five of their next six, they lost their last three games to finish the season 5\u20139. Playing in San Francisco did not revive Plunkett's career as he had another disappointing season, throwing only 9 touchdown passes. Bright spots for the 49ers included defensive linemen [[Tommy Hart]] and [[Cleveland Elam]], who made the Pro Bowl, and running backs [[Wilbur Jackson]] and [[Delvin Williams]], who combined for over 1,600 yards rushing. [[Gene Washington (49ers)|Gene Washington]] again led the team in receiving in 1977, his final year with the 49ers. The 1977 offseason was marked by a number of questionable moves by Joe Thomas that backfired badly. Thomas's big offseason acquisition was running back [[O. J. Simpson]] from the [[Buffalo Bills]]. As with Plunkett two years previously, it was thought that rescuing Simpson from a bad situation and bringing him to the west coast where he had been raised would rejuvenate his career. To create playing time for Simpson, Thomas traded Delvin Williams to the [[Miami Dolphins]] for wide receiver [[Freddie Solomon]]. Thomas also released Jim Plunkett, giving up on him after two seasons. Finally, Thomas fired Meyer after only one season, and replaced him with [[Pete McCulley]], his third coach in three seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1978/01/11/49ers-name-mcculley-coach/a0055e90-2f4a-4634-a175-d54c5eba7020/?noredirect=on|title=49ers Name McCulley Coach|website=washingtonpost.com|language=en|access-date=May 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1978 NFL season|1978 season]] was a disaster for the 49ers, as they finished 2\u201314, their only wins coming against the [[1978 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] and [[1978 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. Simpson indeed led the team in rushing, but with less than 600 yards. It became apparent that Simpson's knees and body were worn out, and he was near the end of his career. Wilbur Jackson also missed the entire season due to injury. Even worse for the franchise was that their first pick of the [[1979 NFL season|1979 draft]] was traded to the Bills as part of the O. J. Simpson deal. Joe Thomas was fired following the season. Some of the key players that became part of the 49ers stunning rise began their 49ers career in 1978. Rookie quarterback [[Steve DeBerg]], [[Joe Montana]]'s first mentor, was the 49ers starting quarterback. Running back [[Paul Hofer]] and center/guard [[Randy Cross]] also started with the 49ers in 1978.\n\n===1979\u20131980: Arrival of Bill Walsh and Joe Montana===\n[[File:DeBartolo headquarters.jpg|thumb|The headquarters of [[The DeBartolo Corporation]] in [[Boardman, Ohio]] with the 49ers logo on the building, signifying the team's ownership by the [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]-based DeBartolo-York family.]]\n\nThe team was led in its turnaround from late 1970s doormat by new owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.]] and head coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. The former head coach of [[Stanford University]] was known for stockpiling draft picks, making excellent draft selections, and patching roster holes by acquiring key free agents.\n\nBill Walsh was hired to be the 49ers head coach in the 1978 off-season. Walsh was a disciple of [[Paul Brown]], and served as Brown's offensive coordinator with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] from 1968 to 1975. However, Brown did not appoint him as his successor upon his retirement, choosing another assistant, former 49ers center Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson. Desiring head coach experience, Walsh looked to [[Stanford University]] in 1977. He had had some success there before the 49ers tapped him to be their replacement.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nWalsh is given credit for popularizing the '[[West Coast offense]]'. The Bill Walsh offense was actually created and refined while he was an assistant coach with the Bengals. The offense utilizes a short, precise, timed passing game as a replacement/augmentation of the running game. The offense is extremely difficult to defend against as it is content to consistently make 6\u20138-yard gains all the way down the field. (The other West Coast offense\u2014more focused on the vertical, or downfield, passing game\u2014was actually created by 1960s L.A. / San Diego coach [[Sid Gillman]], and San Diego State coach [[Don Coryell]], who also employed a version of it as head coach of the St. Louis (football) Cardinals and [[San Diego Chargers]] during a period where it garnered the nickname \"[[Coryell Offense|Air Coryell]]\".){{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn Walsh's first draft, the 49ers had targeted [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] quarterback [[Joe Montana]] as an early round pick. Montana had enjoyed a storied college career, leading the [[1977 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Fighting Irish]] to the 1977 national title and a number of dramatic comeback victories, the most stunning of all being his final game, at the [[1979 Cotton Bowl Classic]]. Playing the [[Houston Cougars football|University of Houston]] in an ice storm, and with Montana suffering from a bad flu, Notre Dame was down 34\u201310 in the third quarter. However, Montana led a magnificent rally that culminated with him throwing a touchdown pass on the game's final play to give Notre Dame the 35\u201334 win.\n[[File:Joe Montana ESPN cropped2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joe Montana]] in 2006]]\nDespite this, most scouts did not peg Montana as a top prospect. Although 6'2\" and 190\u2013200&nbsp;lbs., Montana's arm strength was considered suspect as was the consistency of his play. Although he did get his share of the credit, most thought of him as a system player surrounded by a great team.\n\nIn the 1979 draft, the Dallas Cowboys were placed just ahead of the 49ers. The Cowboys' draft strategy through that time was to take the highest-ranked player on their draft board at the time of their selection, regardless of position. When the Cowboys' turn came up in the third round, the highest rated player on their board was Montana. However, feeling that the quarterback position was in excellent long-term shape with [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Danny White]], and desperately needing a tight end, the Cowboys went off their strategy and drafted [[Doug Cosbie]]. The 49ers took Montana. The 49ers other notable draft choice of the 1979 draft was wide receiver [[Dwight Clark]] in the 10th round. Walsh discovered the unheralded Clark while scouting quarterback Steve Fuller of [[Clemson University]] as Clark ran routes for Fuller during Walsh's evaluation of the quarterback. Walsh's serendipitous discovery of Clark proved to be an early glimpse into the coach's keen eye for talent.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs Walsh implemented his strategies and game plan, the 49ers had another year of losing, finishing 2\u201314 like the previous season. There were, however, a number of bright spots. Despite throwing more interceptions (21) than touchdowns (17), [[Steve DeBerg]] blossomed under Walsh, throwing for over 3,600 yards and completing 60% of his passes. Freddie Solomon also had a good year, with over 800 yards receiving. The running game was patchwork, with Paul Hofer leading the team with 615 yards and [[O.J. Simpson]], in his final season, rushing for only 460 yards and being sidelined with injuries. The 49ers got off to a strong start in 1980, winning their first three games of the season. However, the team, still maturing, lost their next eight games in a row. Many of those games though were close, and the 49ers acquitted themselves well. During the season Walsh alternated DeBerg and Montana at quarterback. Though DeBerg had played well for the 49ers, Walsh felt the team's best chance to win in the long run was with Montana. He alternated the two quarterbacks, giving Montana some experience while keeping opponents off guard. This strategy of alternating quarterbacks from game to game and during games is rare in football, although it had been employed by other successful teams in the past, specifically the [[Dallas Cowboys]] of the early 1970s who alternated [[Roger Staubach]] and [[Craig Morton]], and the [[Los Angeles Rams]] of the late 1940s alternating [[Norm Van Brocklin]] and [[Bob Waterfield]].\n\nIn all DeBerg started nine games, going 4\u20135 with 1,998 yards, 12 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. Montana started seven games, going 2\u20135 with 1,795 yards, 15 touchdowns, and nine picks; Montana also had a better completion percentage at 64.5 to DeBerg's 57.9.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1980.htm|title=1980 San Francisco 49ers Statistics & Players {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=April 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418093129/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/1980.htm|archive-date=April 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe highlight of the 1980 season, and a sign of good things to come, came in Week 14. The 49ers trailed the [[New Orleans Saints]], who at the time were winless at 0\u201313, 35\u20137 at halftime. However, led by [[Joe Montana]], the 49ers made (what was then) the greatest comeback in NFL history, coming back to tie the score in regulation and winning the game in [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] with a field goal by [[Ray Wersching]] to give the 49ers an incredible 38\u201335 victory. It was this game, which marked Montana's first big NFL comeback win, that won Montana the quarterback job full-time. A number of key players emerged for the 49ers in 1980. Among them were [[Dwight Clark]], who led the 49ers with 82 receptions and just under 1,000 yards receiving, and running back [[Earl Cooper (NFL)|Earl Cooper]], who ran for over 700 yards.\n\n===1981\u20131984: First two Super Bowls===\n{{See also|1981 San Francisco 49ers season|The Catch (American football)}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 27 - Dan Bunz (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Head coach Bill Walsh led the 49ers to their first NFL championship, defeating the Bengals 26\u201321 in [[Super Bowl XVI]].]]\nWith the offense playing well consistently, Walsh and the 49ers focused on overhauling the defense in 1981. Walsh took the highly unusual step of overhauling his entire secondary with rookies and untested players, bringing on board [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Eric C. Wright|Eric Wright]] and [[Carlton Williamson]] and giving [[Dwight Hicks]] a prominent role. He also acquired veteran linebacker [[Jack \"Hacksaw\" Reynolds]] and veteran defensive lineman and sack specialist [[Fred Dean]]. These new additions, when added to existing defensive mainstays like [[Keena Turner]], turned the 49ers into an offensively and defensively balanced, dominant team. After a 1\u20132 start, the 49ers won all but one of their remaining games to finish with a 13\u20133 record; up to this point in time it was the team's best regular season win-loss record in its history. Dean made the [[Pro Bowl]], as did Lott, and Hicks. Led by Montana, the unusual offense was centered on the [[west coast offense|short passing game]], which Walsh used as ball control. Both Dwight Clark and [[Freddie Solomon]] had excellent years receiving; Clark as the possession receiver, and Solomon as more of a deep threat. The 49ers running game, however, was among the weakest in the league. [[Ricky Patton]] led the 49ers with only 543 yards rushing. The 49ers' most valuable running back, however, might have been Earl Cooper, whose strength was as a pass-catching back. The 49ers faced the [[New York Giants]] in the divisional playoffs and won, 38\u201324. This set up an NFC championship game match-up with the [[Dallas Cowboys]], whom the 49ers historically could not beat during their playoff runs in the early 1970s. The 49ers played the Cowboys tough, but the Cowboys forced six turnovers and held the lead late. The 49ers were down 27\u201321 and on their own 11-yard line with 4:54 remaining. As Montana had done for Notre Dame and the 49ers so many times before, he led the 49ers on a sustained final 89-yard drive to the Cowboys' 6-yard line. On a 3rd-and-3 play, with his primary receiver covered, Montana rolled right and threw the ball off balance to Dwight Clark in the end zone, who leaped up and caught the ball to tie the game at 27 (now known as \"[[The Catch (NFL)|The Catch]]\"), with the extra point giving the 49ers the lead. Despite this, the Cowboys had one last chance to win. On the first play of the next possession, Cowboys receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] caught a pass from Danny White and got to midfield before he was pulled down by the jersey at the 49ers 44-yard line by Cornerback Eric Wright saving a potential late-touchdown. On the next play, White was sacked by [[Lawrence Pillers]] and fumbled the ball, which was recovered by [[Jim Stuckey]], giving the 49ers the win and a trip to their first ever Super Bowl against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], who were also in their first Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XVI]] The 49ers took a 20\u20130 halftime lead and held on to win 26\u201321 behind kicker [[Ray Wersching]]'s four field goals and a key defensive stand. Throughout the '81 season, the defense had been a significant reason for the team's success, despite residing in the shadow of the then-innovative offense. Montana won MVP honors mostly on the strength of leading the 49ers on a 92-yard, 12 play drive culminating in a touchdown pass to Earl Cooper. Thus did the 49ers complete one of the most dramatic and complete turnarounds in NFL history, going from a 2\u201314 season followed by a 6\u201310 season to a Super Bowl championship.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe 1982 season was a bad one for the 49ers, as they lost all five games at Candlestick Park en route to a 3\u20136 record in a strike-shortened season. This was the 49ers last losing season for the next 17 years. Joe Montana was the one highlight, passing for 2,613 yards in just nine games, highlighted by five straight games in which he broke the 300-yard barrier.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 28 - Roger Craig (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Roger Craig (''middle'') and Joe Montana (''right'') led the 49ers to their second Super Bowl victory ([[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]]) in four seasons.]]\nIn 1983, the 49ers won their final three games of the season, finishing with a 10\u20136 record and winning their 2nd NFC Western Divisional Title in three years. Leading the rebound was Joe Montana with another stellar season, passing for 3,910 yards and connecting on 26 touchdowns. In the NFC Divisional Playoffs, they hosted the Detroit Lions. The 49ers jumped out in front early and led 17\u20139 entering the 4th quarter, but the Lions roared back, scoring two touchdowns to take a 23\u201317 lead. However, Montana led a comeback, hitting wide receiver [[Freddie Solomon]] on a game-winning 14-yard touchdown pass with 2:00 left on the clock to put the 49ers ahead 24\u201323. The game ended when a potential game-winning FG attempt by Lions kicker [[Eddie Murray (American football)|Eddie Murray]] missed. The next week, the 49ers came back from a 21\u20130 deficit against the [[Washington Redskins]] in the NFC championship game to tie the game, only to lose, after a questionable defensive holding call, 24\u201321 on a Mark Moseley field goal that sent the Redskins to [[Super Bowl XVIII]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 1984, the 49ers had one of the greatest seasons in team history by finishing the regular season 15\u20131, setting the record for most regular season wins that was later equaled by the 1985 [[Chicago Bears]], the 1998 [[Minnesota Vikings]], the 2004 [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], the 2011 [[Green Bay Packers]] and finally broken by the 2007 [[New England Patriots]] (with 16 regular season victories). Their 18 wins overall is also still a record, tied by the 1985 Bears and the 2007 New England Patriots (they won 18 straight, but lost [[Super Bowl XLII]] to the [[New York Giants]]). The 49ers' only defeat in the 1984 season was a 20\u201317 loss to the Steelers; a late field goal attempt in that game by San Francisco kicker [[Ray Wersching]] went off the uprights and was no good. In the playoffs, they beat the [[New York Giants]] 21\u201310, shut out the [[Chicago Bears]] 23\u20130 in the NFC championship, and in [[Super Bowl XIX]] the 49ers shut down a record-setting year by NFL MVP [[Dan Marino]] (and his speedy receivers Mark Clayton and Mark Duper), beating the [[Miami Dolphins]] 38\u201316. Their entire defensive backfield (Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, Dwight Hicks, and Carlton Williamson) was elected to the Pro Bowl\u2014an NFL first.\n\n===1985\u20131987: Arrival of Jerry Rice===\nIn the [[1985 NFL Draft]], the team received the 28th overall pick after winning the Super bowl the previous year. On draft day, the 49ers traded its first two picks for New England's first-round choice, the 16th selection overall (the teams also swapped third-round picks as part of the deal), and selected [[Jerry Rice]] from [[Mississippi Valley State University|Mississippi Valley State]]. It was reported that the Dallas Cowboys, who had the 17th selection overall, were intending to pick him. In the 1985 season, the 49ers were not as dominant as in 1984, finishing the regular season with a 10\u20136 record and a wild card berth. Jerry Rice struggled at times (dropping numerous passes), but he still impressed the NFL in his rookie season for the 49ers in 1985, especially after a 10-catch, 241-yard game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]] in December. Rice was named NFC Offensive Rookie of the Year after recording 49 catches for 927 yards, and averaging 19.9 yards per catch, [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] became the first NFL player to gain 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season. In the 1985 playoffs the 49ers were quickly eliminated from the playoffs by the [[New York Giants]] 17\u20133.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/30/sports/giants-stop-49ers-in-wild-card-playoff-17-3.html|title=Giants Stop 49ers in Wild-Card Playoff, 17-3|last=Litsky|first=Frank|date=December 30, 1985|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813060009/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/30/sports/giants-stop-49ers-in-wild-card-playoff-17-3.html|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1986 NFL season the 49ers got off to a quick start after a 31\u20137 win over the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] on opening day. But the win was costly; Joe Montana injured his back and was out for two months, the injury was to a spinal disc in Montana's lower back and required immediate surgery. The injury was so severe that Montana's doctors suggested that Montana retire. On September 15, 1986, the 49ers placed Montana on the [[injured reserve list]], [[Jeff Kemp]] became the starting quarterback, and the 49ers went 4\u20133\u20131 in September and October.\n\nMontana returned to the team on November 6 of that year. In his first game back from injury, Montana passed for 270 yards and three touchdown passes in a 43\u201317 49er victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. The 49ers caught fire, winning the next 5 of the final 7 games, including a 24\u201314 win over the [[Los Angeles Rams]], to clinch the NFC West title. Jerry Rice continued to show improvement from the previous season catching 86 passes for a league-leading 1,570 yards and 15 touchdowns. Montana was co-recipient of the 1986 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award, which he shared with Vikings quarterback [[Tommy Kramer]]. However, the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] would defeat the 49ers again in the playoffs, 49\u20133 in the team's worst post-season loss to date.

During the strike-shortened 1987 season, the 49ers became one of the NFL's elite teams once again with a league-best 13\u20132 record. Joe Montana had a bounce-back year after his injuries the previous year and being questioned by the media if he could still produce at a high level, by throwing 31 touchdown passes, a career-high. He also set the NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts without an incomplete pass (22), passed for 3,054 yards, and had a passer rating of 102.1. Rice had established himself as an elite receiver, he caught 65 passes for 1,078 yards and a then NFL-record 22 touchdowns in just 12 games. 1987 was the second of six seasons in which Rice would lead the NFL in receiving and/or touchdown receptions, he was named [[National Football League Offensive Player of the Year Award|Offensive Player of the Year]]. By the end of the regular season the 49ers were ranked No. 1 on both offense and defense and were heavy favorites to win the Super Bowl. However, they were stunned in the [[1987\u201388 NFL playoffs#NFC: Minnesota Vikings 36, San Francisco 49ers 24|NFC divisional round]], losing 36\u201324 to what was believed to be an inferior [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] team, their third straight playoff loss in a row. Joe Montana had one of his worst post-season games of his career, and was eventually benched during the game in favor of Steve Young, who scored a rushing touchdown and threw another. After the game, owner [[Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.|Eddie DeBartolo]] stripped Walsh of the team president title. [[Dwight Clark]] retired that off-season.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dwightclark87.com/bio.html | title=Dwight Clark biography | website=DwightClark87.com | access-date=February 3, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121110730/http://www.dwightclark87.com/bio.html | archive-date=January 21, 2018 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===1988\u20131989: Back-to-back Super Bowls===\nDuring the off-season, a quarterback controversy between Joe Montana and Steve Young had begun after Montana's poor performance in the playoffs the previous year. Many speculated that the 1988 season would be his last year with the team. In the [[1988 NFL season]], the 49ers struggled to start the season; Walsh would constantly switch QBs between Montana (who suffered an elbow injury week 1 that would linger for most of the season) and Young. At one point, they were 6\u20135 and the team was in danger of missing the playoffs. Before week 11, [[Ronnie Lott]] called a players-only meeting; after the meeting the team came together and defeated the defending Super Bowl champion [[1988 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in a Monday night game, Montana had fully recovered from his injury and retook the starting quarterback job as the team eventually finished the season at 10\u20136. They gained a measure of revenge by routing the [[1988 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 34\u20139 in the divisional playoffs. The 49ers then traveled to Chicago's [[Soldier Field]] for the NFC championship against the [[Chicago Bears]], where the wind chill factor at game time was -26\u00b0. However, despite the weather, Joe Montana picked apart the Bears' top-rated defense by scoring three touchdowns as the 49ers dominated the Bears with a 28\u20133 victory, earning the team's third trip to the Super Bowl, to go against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]. In [[Super Bowl XXIII]], despite numerous trips deep into Cincinnati territory by the 49ers, the game was tied 3\u20133 at halftime. Early in the fourth quarter, Montana tied the score at 13; however, Cincinnati regained the lead on a [[Jim Breech]] field goal to put the Bengals ahead 16\u201313 with just over three minutes left on the clock. Following the kickoff, and a holding penalty, the 49ers took over on their 8-yard line with 3:08 left on the clock. Joe Montana began the final drive by stepping into the huddle and remarking to offensive tackle [[Harris Barton]], during a television timeout, \"hey, there's [[John Candy]]\", as he pointed to the stands on the other side of the field.<ref name=comeback>{{cite web | url=http://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016306.html | title=Montana was comeback king | work=[[ESPN.com]] | last=Schwartz | first=Larry | accessdate=August 12, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809043825/http://www.espn.com/sportscentury/features/00016306.html | archive-date=August 9, 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref> His calm demeanor reassured the 49ers, and he then engineered what some consider the greatest drive in Super Bowl history, as he drove the team 92 yards for the winning touchdown on a pass to [[John Taylor (American football)|John Taylor]] with only 34 seconds left, as they captured their third Super bowl championship with a score of 20\u201316. Jerry Rice was named Super Bowl MVP.<ref name=comeback/>\n\nAfter Super Bowl XXIII, Bill Walsh retired as head coach; his defensive coordinator and handpicked successor, [[George Seifert]], took over as head coach. In the [[1989 NFL season]], Joe Montana threw for 3,521 yards and 26 touchdowns, with only 8 interceptions, giving him a 112.4 quarterback rating, which was then the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history, and was named [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award|NFL Most Valuable Player]]. Jerry Rice, in his fifth year in the league, continued to dominate; he led the league with almost 1490 receiving yards, and 17 touchdowns. The 49ers clinched their fourth straight division title, beating the [[1989 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] 30\u201327 after a dramatic second-half comeback; they finished 14\u20132, gaining home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Their two losses were by a combined five points.\n\nIn the divisional playoffs, they easily defeated the Vikings, 41\u201313. In the [[1989\u201390 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 30, Los Angeles Rams 3|NFC championship game]], they played against the Rams for a third time; the previous two games had been decided by a total of 4 points, but they were able to blow out the Rams 30\u20133, earning another trip to the Super Bowl, where they defeated the [[1989 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in relatively easy fashion by a score of 55\u201310 in [[Super Bowl XXIV]] \u2013 setting a record for points scored and widest margin of victory in a Super Bowl. Montana himself set many Super Bowl records (some since tied or surpassed) en route to his third Super Bowl MVP. In winning the Super Bowl, the 49ers became the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls under different head coaches. This 1989 championship team is often regarded as one of the most dominant teams in NFL history, winning three playoff games by a combined 100 points.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://dev.realclearsports.com/lists/dominating_postseason_team_performances/1989_san_francisco_49ers.html | title=Top 10 Most Dominant Postseasons: 1989 San Francisco 49ers | date=May 28, 2012 | access-date=February 3, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205233159/http://dev.realclearsports.com/lists/dominating_postseason_team_performances/1989_san_francisco_49ers.html | archive-date=February 5, 2018 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20131993: Unsuccessful Three-peat / Steve Young Steps in===\n[[File:SF 49ers HQ tophy wall.JPG|thumb|right|49ers wall of trophies at the Marie P.

Joe Montana missed almost all of the following two seasons with a recurring elbow injury. Following the 1990 season, the 49ers left team stalwarts Roger Craig and Ronnie Lott unprotected and let them go to the [[Los Angeles Raiders]] via Plan B free agency.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-04/sports/1991247225_1_sprained-ankle-montana-torn-ligament|title=Mystery still surrounds extent of injury to Montanta's elbow|newspaper=articles.baltimoresun.com|access-date=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613222548/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-04/sports/1991247225_1_sprained-ankle-montana-torn-ligament|archive-date=June 13, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1991 NFL season|1991]], [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] injured the thumb on his throwing hand and later was sidelined with an injured knee. After 10 games, the 49ers had a record of 4\u20136. Backup quarterback [[Steve Bono]] helped the team win its next five games with Young sidelined. In the final game of the season, Monday night versus the NFC's number two seed, Young returned and the 49ers beat the [[1991 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] 52\u201314, finishing 10\u20136. However, the team missed qualifying for the playoffs by virtue of losing the head-to-head tiebreaker to the [[1991 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], which had beaten the 49ers on a last-second Hail Mary pass earlier in the season. The 1992 and 1993 seasons saw a resurgent 49er team under the leadership of Steve Young, but a subpar and aging defense could only take them to the NFC championship game before falling to the [[1991 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] each time.\n\nIn [[1992 NFL season|1992]], Joe Montana came back after missing almost two full seasons due to an elbow injury in his throwing arm, and started the second half of a Monday night game versus [[1992 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]] on December 28, 1992. With the 49ers clinging to a 7\u20136 lead, Montana entered the game and looked as though he had not missed a single snap, completing 15\u201321 for 126 yards and 2 touchdowns, as the 49ers defeated the Lions 24\u20136. The 49ers finished the 1992 season with a 14\u20132 record and home field advantage in the playoffs. San Francisco defeated the [[1992 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] 20\u201313 in the divisional playoff game, but lost to the [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 30\u201320 in the NFC championship at Candlestick Park.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAt the end of the 1992 season, partly fueled by media hype, the biggest quarterback controversy in football history was in full swing. After discussions with the owner and the coach, Montana asked for, and was granted, a trade to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] prior to the 1993 season. Despite Eddie DeBartolo wanting Montana to stay and start, Montana realized that he and Young could not stay with the 49ers without a controversy. Montana was later quoted as saying, \"If I had stayed and started, there would have been problems. If I had stayed and Steve Young had started, there would have been problems.\"\n\nThe 49ers finished the [[1993 NFL season|1993 season]], the team's first without Joe Montana on the roster, with a 10\u20136 record and no. 2 seed in the playoffs. San Francisco defeated the [[1993 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] 44\u20133 in the divisional playoff game, but lost to the [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] 38\u201321 in the NFC championship at Texas Stadium.\n\n===1994\u20131998: Fifth Super Bowl===\n[[File:49ers Super Bowl ring.jpg|thumb|200px|The 49ers ring for [[Super Bowl XXIX]]]]\n\nIn [[1994 NFL season|1994]], the team spent large amounts of money on the addition of several star free agents from other teams, including [[Ken Norton (American football)|Ken Norton Jr.]], [[Gary Plummer (American football)|Gary Plummer]], [[Rickey Jackson]], [[Bart Oates]], [[Richard Dent]], [[Charles Mann (American football)|Charles Mann]] and [[Deion Sanders]]. Additionally, several rookie players made key contributions to the team, some becoming season-long starters such as defensive tackle [[Bryant Young]], fullback [[William Floyd (American football)|William Floyd]], and linebacker [[Lee Woodall]]. Due to injuries to the offensive line, the 49ers had some tough times early in the season, including a 40\u20138 home loss to the [[1994 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], and a 24\u201317 loss to the [[1994 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], led by former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana. Following the Eagles game, a poll conducted on local sports radio station [[KNBR (AM)|KNBR]] showed that an overwhelming majority of 49er fans wanted head coach George Seifert fired. The game against the Eagles was a turning point for the 49ers despite the lopsided score. Quarterback Steve Young was benched in the 3rd quarter and was later seen livid on the sidelines, shouting profanities at Seifert. The following week in Detroit, the 49ers trailed the [[1994 Detroit Lions season|Lions]] 14\u20130. After throwing a pass, Young was hit, picked up, and driven into the ground by three Lions defenders. After the hit, Young was screaming with his face dark red in color. He crawled most of the way off of the field before refusing help from the trainers as he limped the remaining way off the field. He miraculously returned to the field one play later (NFL rules state that after trainers attend to an injured player, that player must leave the field for at least one play) to lead the 49ers to a 27\u201321 victory. The team rallied around Young to win 10 straight games, including a 21\u201314 victory over the two-time defending Super Bowl champion [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]. During that span the 49ers' average margin of victory was nearly 20 points per game, a sustained dominance not seen since the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]]. Despite scoring only 8 points in one game and 14 in another, the 49ers set a new record for total regular season and post season combined points scored. That record was later broken by the [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in 2007 (the 1998 Minnesota Vikings scored 556 regular season points, but only 68 post season points, for a total of 624 points, while the 1994 49ers scored 495 regular season points and 131 post season points for a total of 626, the second highest mark in NFL history). Even after those initial rough spots early in the season, the 49ers finished the season 13\u20133 and with home field advantage throughout the playoffs. In their first game, they easily defeated the [[1994 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], 44\u201315, setting up the third straight [[1994\u201395 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: San Francisco 49ers 38, Dallas Cowboys 28|49ers\u2013Cowboys NFC championship game]]. The 49ers took advantage of three early [[1994 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] turnovers, taking a 21\u20130 lead in the first quarter. Taking a 31\u201314 lead into halftime after a perfect 29-yard pass from Young to Rice in the closing seconds, the game appeared to be far out of reach for the Cowboys. But a 49er fumble on the opening kick of the 3rd quarter led to a Cowboy score, cutting the lead to 31\u201321. Later, the 49ers responded with a Young touchdown run, making it 38\u201321, before the Cowboys scored another touchdown in the final minutes for a final score of 38\u201328. The convincing win qualified the 49ers for their fifth [[Super Bowl XXIX|Super Bowl]] appearance, and the first to be played by two teams from California. The 49ers steamrolled the [[1994 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] 49\u201326 behind Young's record-setting 6 touchdown passes in [[Super Bowl XXIX]], at the time becoming the first team to win a record five Super Bowls. Finally establishing himself as a worthy successor to Joe Montana, Young was named the game's MVP. The 49er's run of five Super Bowl wins in 14 seasons (1981\u20131994) solidified them alongside the 1960s [[Vince Lombardi]] [[Green Bay Packers]] and 1970s [[Chuck Knoll]] [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] as one of the modern NFL's great dynasties.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2018/01/27/little-debate-about-who-tops-the-best-dynasties-in-nfl-history/ |title=\"Little debate about who tops the best dynasties in NFL history\", ''New York Post'' |access-date=January 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007073741/https://nypost.com/2018/01/27/little-debate-about-who-tops-the-best-dynasties-in-nfl-history/ |archive-date=October 7, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe 49ers made the playoffs in 1995 and again in 1996, being eliminated by the [[Green Bay Packers]] both times in the Divisional Round. On January 17, 1997, [[George Seifert]] retired as 49ers head coach. On the same day as Seifert's retirement, the 49ers hired [[California Golden Bears football|Cal]] head coach [[Steve Mariucci]] as his replacement. At the time, Mariucci only had one year of head-coaching experience at any level. The first game of the [[1997 NFL season|1997 season]] against the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] was a disaster, as both quarterback Steve Young and receiver Jerry Rice went down with injuries. Rice appeared to be out for the season with a serious knee injury, while Young left the game with one of the many concussions he suffered throughout his career. However, the team overcame adversity: Young returned two weeks later, and with the league's number one defense, the 49ers finished the season with a 13\u20133 record which included an 11-game winning streak which was the longest by a rookie head coach at the time, and the 49ers became the quickest team in NFL history to clinch their division at the time. Rice returned for one and a half quarters in week 16 against the [[Denver Broncos]], before getting another injury to his knee (unrelated to the first one). In the playoffs the 49ers defeated the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 38\u201322, advancing to the [[1997\u201398 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: Green Bay Packers 23, San Francisco 49ers 10|NFC championship game]] for the first time since 1994, where they again met the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] at Candlestick Park, but lost 23\u201310.\n\nDuring that season Eddie DeBartolo Jr. was involved in a corruption investigation regarding [[Louisiana]] [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Edwin Edwards]] and one of his [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] [[riverboat]] [[casino]]s. DeBartolo later pleaded guilty to a failure to report a felony charge in 1998. He was suspended from active control of the 49ers for one year. His sister, [[Denise DeBartolo York|Denise]], and her husband, [[John York|Dr. John York]], took over operations of the team.\n\nIn [[1998 NFL season|1998]], Jerry Rice finally returned from his knee injury week 1 against the [[New York Jets]], a game best remembered for running back [[Garrison Hearst]]'s 96-yard touchdown run in overtime to win the game. The 49ers had the 2nd most productive offense in league history. Young, who was questioned if his concussion history would put an end to his career, had his best season, throwing for 4,170 yards, 36 touchdowns and only 12 interceptions. A healthy Jerry Rice, 3rd-year player [[Terrell Owens]], and 4th-year player [[J.J. Stokes]] became the first WR-trio in team history to catch at least 60 passes in the same season, Hearst ran for 1,570 yards and 7 touchdowns while averaging 5.1 yards per carry. The 49ers finished 12\u20134, their 16th straight winning season (all with 10 wins or more), earning a wildcard berth.\n\nOnce again, the 49ers faced the [[1998 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] in the playoffs. Things looked bleak when the 49ers trailed 27\u201323 in the waning seconds. However, in the game's final moment, Young hit Terrell Owens (who was having a terrible game up to that point) on a dramatic, game-winning 25-yard touchdown pass, dubbed by many as \"The Catch II\". That put the 49ers ahead 30\u201327 with just three seconds left on the game clock, sealing the win. After finally beating the Packers, the 49ers went on to lose to the eventual NFC champion [[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] in the [[1998\u201399 NFL playoffs#NFC: Atlanta Falcons 20, San Francisco 49ers 18|Divisional round]] 20\u201318, in a game that was marked by Hearst suffering a gruesome broken ankle on the first play from scrimmage.\n\n===1999\u20132002: Ownership change===\nDeBartolo returned from his suspension in 1999, but a series of lawsuits over control of the family's vast holdings led him to surrender controlling interest to the Yorks as part of a 2000 settlement. Denise York became chairwoman of the board, while John York became CEO. On the field, the [[1999 San Francisco 49ers season|1999 49ers]] got off to a 3\u20131 start, then in a nationally televised ''Monday Night Football'' game against the [[Arizona Cardinals]], Steve Young suffered a blindside hit from cornerback [[Aeneas Williams]] that knocked him out of the game and eventually convinced him to retire. At the time it was believed the severe hit ended his career but Young later said in interviews he could have come back to play another season or two. After meeting with then-general manager Bill Walsh and being told about how the salary cap troubles would make the team non-competitive, Young chose to retire rather than risk his long-term health further for a likely losing club. Without their future Hall of Famer, 29-year-old rookie [[Jeff Garcia]] took over as starting quarterback, but he would be benched for poor performances in favor of [[Steve Stenstrom]]. Garcia would be reinstated as the starting quarterback and in the final 5 games of the regular season. The 49ers lost 11 of their last 12 games, and suffered their first losing season in a non-strike year since 1980, which was also the last time that the 49ers did not win at least ten or more games in a season. [[Bobb McKittrick]], 49ers offensive line coach since 1979, also died of cancer following the 1999 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/16/sports/bobb-mckittrick-64-coach-of-standout-offensive-line-for-49ers.html|title= Bobb McKittrick, 64, Coach of Standout Offensive Line for 49ers|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 16, 2000|last=Litsky|first=Frank|accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref>\n\nBefore the [[2000 San Francisco 49ers season|2000 season]] Jeff Garcia was named the starting quarterback despite the 49ers drafting two quarterbacks ([[Giovanni Carmazzi]] in the third round and [[Tim Rattay]] in the seventh). Garcia kept the starting job throughout the season and showed drastic improvement from the previous year. He broke a franchise record for most passing yards in one season, with 4,278 passing yards and 31 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions. Garcia and Terrell Owens, who established himself as the team's number-one receiver, both earned their first [[Pro Bowl]] selections. However, the 49ers finished 6\u201310, missing the playoffs for the second straight season for the first time since 1979 and 1980, due to a defense that gave up 26.4 points per game and a total of 422 points. The 2000 season was Jerry Rice's final year with the 49ers; he played 16 seasons with the team. In the [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|2001 season]] the 49ers established themselves as a playoff team once again after two down years. They finished with a 12\u20134 record and a wildcard berth. A quarter of their wins came in 4th-quarter comebacks. Their defense also had a bounce-back year, going from the 28th-ranked defense in 2000, to the 9th-ranked. Terrell Owens had become Jeff Garcia's favorite target. Garrison Hearst, who had been forced to retire from football after breaking his ankle in the 1998 divisional playoffs, finally returned to the line-up after over two years of rehabilitation. He became the first player in NFL history to come back to football after suffering [[avascular necrosis]]. He had an excellent season, rushing for 1,206 yards on a 4.8 average. His comeback earned him the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award]]. In the final 6 weeks of the season the 49ers defense shut out 3 teams (the [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Miami Dolphins]], and [[New Orleans Saints]]), and had one of the most stupendous goal-line stands against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. In the team's first playoff game in 2 years, they played against the [[Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]] in the [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs#NFC: Green Bay Packers 25, San Francisco 49ers 15|NFC Wild Card]], but lost 25\u201315. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThe [[2002 NFL season]] began with the [[2002 NFL season#Expansion and realignment|divisional realignment]]. The 49ers gained two new divisional rivals, the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and [[Arizona Cardinals]], while former divisional foes [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[New Orleans Saints]], and [[Carolina Panthers]] moved to the newly formed [[NFC South]]. The team's production dropped from the previous year. Jeff Garcia went from having 31 and 32 touchdowns in the previous 2 seasons, to only 21 in 2002. The 49ers defense struggled at times, dropping from the 9th-ranked defense in the previous season to the 19th-ranked. Even though the team did not have the same success as they did in the 2001 regular season, the 49ers won the NFC West for the first time since 1997, with the division-clinching game coming on a last-second touchdown pass to Terrell Owens against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The 49ers finished 10\u20136. In the [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs]] they hosted the [[New York Giants]] in the [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs#NFC: San Francisco 49ers 39, New York Giants 38|2002 NFC Wild Card]]. The Giants had a 38\u201314 lead late in the third quarter; however, the Giants defense, which had been highly ranked all year, began to collapse, and by the final minute in the 4th quarter Jeff Garcia had led the team back from the 24-point deficit to take a 1-point lead. Giants quarterback [[Kerry Collins]] then led a drive in the game's final minute to put the Giants at the 49ers' 23-yard line with six seconds left for a shot at a game-winning field goal. [[Long snapper]] [[Trey Junkin]], who had been signed by the Giants that week, made a bad snap, so holder [[Matt Allen]] attempted a desperate pass down the field, which fell incomplete, but there was a flag on the play. The initial thought by spectators and the Giants was that pass interference had clearly been committed by the 49ers defense, but the flag was against the Giants for an ineligible receiver, so the game was over. The next day, the NFL admitted that the referee had blown the call, that the 49ers had indeed committed pass interference, and that the down should have been replayed. A press conference was held and a reporter asked 49ers head coach [[Steve Mariucci]] about his thoughts on the NFL saying they blew the call, and he replied: \"Bummer.\" It was the second-biggest comeback victory in NFL playoff history, with the 49ers winning 39\u201338. The 49ers lost the next week to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the [[2002\u201303 NFL playoffs#NFC: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 31, San Francisco 49ers 6|Divisional round]], 31\u20136. This was the last postseason appearance for the 49ers until the [[2011\u201312 NFL playoffs|2011\u201312 playoffs]]. Steve Mariucci, whose published statements about his degree of power in the organization had frayed already-strained relations with management, was fired by John York, despite a winning record.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===2003\u20132010: Struggles===\nThen-[[Oregon State University|Oregon State]] head coach [[Dennis Erickson]] was signed to a five-year contract to replace Mariucci.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/42814843/reno_gazettejournal/|title=Niners Choose Erickson|newspaper=Reno Gazette-Journal|location=Reno, Nevada|date=February 12, 2003|agency=Associated Press|page=B1}}</ref> The hiring of Erickson was highly criticized by the fans and the media, as Erickson's offensive philosophy was very different from the West Coast offense. The 2003 season was one of turmoil for the 49ers. While the Niners started the season with a 49\u20137 demolishing of Chicago, the team quickly began to unravel afterwards, as the relationship between Garcia and Owens turned sour upon Garcia taking issue with Owens's public praise for the play of backup quarterback [[Tim Rattay]]. Garcia responded with a cryptic remark of \"we cannot let the sickness spread\"; in response, Owens wore a surgeon's mask at the following practice. The team was also ravaged by injuries to key players on both sides of the ball; the often reckless play of Jeff Garcia started to take a toll on him, as he was forced to miss 3 games during the season. The 49ers finished 7\u20139 and missed the playoffs. Despite this disappointing result, Erickson was retained as coach for the 2004 season. Owens' on- and off-field antics led to the 49ers trading him to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] during the offseason. Several other key 49er players were released due to salary cap concerns, including Garcia and Hearst. The team finished the 2004 season with a 2\u201314 record, tying a franchise worst and finishing last in the NFC West for the first time since 1979, ending what had been the NFL's longest active streak for not finishing last in a division. With the worst record in the NFL the team secured the rights to the first pick in the NFL Draft. [[Dennis Erickson]] and general manager [[Terry Donahue]] were fired.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:Frankgore.png|thumb|left|49ers' former running back [[Frank Gore]] in action against the [[St. Louis Rams]] in 2007]]\n\nAfter an extensive coaching search, the 49ers hired the defensive coordinator of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] [[Mike Nolan]] as their head coach. Nolan was the son of [[Dick Nolan (American football)|Dick Nolan]], who had led the team to three consecutive playoff appearances from 1970 to 1972. The 49ers did not hire a general manager. In Mike Nolan's first draft as head coach, he selected quarterback [[Alex Smith (quarterback)|Alex Smith]] from the [[Utah Utes football|University of Utah]] with the first overall pick of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. It was a pick predicted by most, though many thought the 49ers might select local product [[Aaron Rodgers]] of the [[California Golden Bears football|University of California]]. Alex Smith's rookie season was a disaster, producing only one touchdown against eleven interceptions. The team finished 4th in the NFC West for the second consecutive year, with a 4\u201312 record. This earned the 49ers the 6th pick in the [[2006 NFL Draft]] which they used to draft tight end [[Vernon Davis]]. [[Alex Smith]] and the team improved greatly in 2006, led by second year player [[Frank Gore]] from the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]]. Gore ran for a franchise record of 1,695 rushing yards, which led the NFC, along with 8 touchdowns. He was awarded his first Pro Bowl appearance. They also swept division rival and defending NFC Champion, [[2006 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], and kept the [[2006 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] from a playoff berth in the last game of the season. However, the team finished 7\u20139, their fourth consecutive losing season.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[File:Alex Smith warm up 1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|49ers' former quarterback [[Alex Smith]]]]\nIn the off-season, the 49ers signed cornerback [[Nate Clements]] and safety [[Michael Lewis (safety)|Michael Lewis]] to improve their secondary. Clement's contract was worth $80 million for eight years, the largest contract given to a defensive player in NFL history at the time. In the [[2007 NFL Draft|NFL Draft]], the 49ers made another key addition to their defense, selecting middle linebacker [[Patrick Willis]] with the 11th overall pick. Willis would eventually be named the 2007 [[AP Defensive Rookie of the Year|AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]]. Before the beginning of the 2007 season, Hall of Fame coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] died of complications from [[leukemia]]. The 49ers started the season 2\u20130, for the first time since [[1998 NFL season|1998]]. In the fourth game of the season, against the [[2007 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]], Alex Smith suffered a separated shoulder on the third play of the game, an injury that severely hampered his play and ultimately led to an early end to his 2008 campaign after having shoulder surgery. Chiefly due to back up quarterback [[Trent Dilfer]]'s struggles and Alex Smith's injury, the 49ers lost eight straight consecutive games from week three through week twelve, ending the year with a disappointing 5\u201311 record. Questions were raised about the future of Alex Smith, whose first three seasons had been plagued by inconsistent play, injuries, and never having had the same offensive coordinator from one year to the next. Head coach Mike Nolan and new offensive coordinator [[Mike Martz]] stated that a competition between Smith, [[Shaun Hill]], and NFL journeyman [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] would run through the first two preseason games of 2008. O'Sullivan was named the 49ers starter because of his familiarity with the Martz offense and after performing better than Smith or Hill in the first three preseason games. On October 20, 2008, after a 2\u20135 start, Mike Nolan was fired. Assistant head coach [[Mike Singletary]], a [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] linebacker with the [[Chicago Bears]], was named as the interim head coach. Singletary proved to be a fan favorite when after his first game as head coach he delivered a memorable post game interview. Singletary said of their loss: \"... right now, we've got to figure out the formula. Our formula. Our formula is this: We go out, we hit people in the mouth.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entertonement.com/clips/xjtxzdvvnb--Hit-People-in-the-Mouth|title=Mike Singletary Press Conference \"Hit-People-in-the-Mouth\"|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The team went 5\u20134 overall under Singletary, winning five of its final seven games and ending the season with a 7\u20139 record. After the last game of the season, Singletary was named permanent head coach by Jed York, who had been appointed as team president just days before. [[Jed York]] is the oldest son of John York and Denise DeBartolo York.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:49ers Offense.jpg|thumb|[[Trent Dilfer]] (#12) quarterbacks the 2007 49ers]]\n\nOn April 25, 2009, the 49ers selected Texas Tech WR [[Michael Crabtree]], a player many people thought would go in the top five, with the 10th pick in the first round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. The 2009 training camp became the first since 2005 that the 49ers failed to have all drafted rookies signed and in training camp on time, as Crabtree held out trying to reach a contract. He finally reached a contract agreement on October 7, 2009, having missed the first four games of the regular season. The 49ers posted an 8\u20138 record after a frustrating season, losing only 2 games by more than a touchdown. Nevertheless, it was the team's first non-losing season since 2002. Despite missing the playoffs for the seventh straight season, several key players showed signs of improvement. Alex Smith regained his role as the 49ers' starting quarterback (after Shaun Hill had won the starting job in training camp), passing for more than 2,000 yards with 19 touchdowns, while Frank Gore collected his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard season, a 49ers record. Safety [[Dashon Goldson]] showed signs of potential in his first year as full-time starter, as he tallied 94 tackles, four interceptions, three forced fumbles, and two sacks. [[Vernon Davis]] in particular had a breakthrough year at tight end, earning Pro Bowl honors with 965 yards and 13 touchdowns (tying the NFL record for his position). 2010 saw five 49ers go to the Pro Bowl: Patrick Willis, Vernon Davis, Frank Gore, Justin Smith, and punter Andy Lee.\n\nThe [[2010 NFL season|2010 season]] started with the 49ers heavy favorites to win the NFC West after Cardinals QB [[Kurt Warner]] retired early in the offseason, but the season was a disaster. They started 0\u20135, their worst start since the dark days of 1979. In week 3, the 49ers fired offensive coordinator [[Jimmy Raye II|Jimmy Raye]], who had been hand-picked by Singletary in the 2009 offseason. Starting safety [[Michael Lewis (safety)|Michael Lewis]] demanded to be released after he was demoted in favor of rookie safety [[Taylor Mays]]. By mid-season, Singletary was switching QBs between [[Alex Smith]] and [[Troy Smith]], who had been picked up in free agency after the preseason, but with little effect. On December 27, 2010, the 49ers fired Mike Singletary as head coach, naming defensive line coach Jim Tomsula as interim head coach for the last game of the season, where despite crushing the [[2010 Arizona Cardinals season|Cardinals]] 38\u20137, they finished a sad and disappointing 6\u201310 and missed the playoffs yet again.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===2011\u20132014: Jim Harbaugh era===\nOn January 4, 2011, Jed York promoted interim General Manager [[Trent Baalke]] to be the permanent general manager.

From 1962, the 49ers' logo has been the iconic \"SF\" within the center of a red oval; throughout the years the logo has had minor modifications, such as a black outlining on the intertwined \"SF\" that was added in 1989 and a gold trimming inside the oval that was added in 1996.\n\n===Uniforms===\nThe San Francisco 49ers have two different uniforms: red and gold home uniforms and white, red, and gold road uniforms. However, the 49ers have changed uniform designs and color combinations quite often throughout their history. From the team's inception in 1946, they wore dark or cardinal red, switching to scarlet red jerseys and gold pants for the 1948 season, with a gold helmet with one red stripe, with solid red socks and pants with no stripes. Entering the 1949 season, the first in the NFL, the 49ers adopted three stripes to their red jerseys, wearing gold helmets and pants, with no stripes and red socks with three white stripes. In the 1953, '54, and '55 seasons, the 49ers wore red helmets with a gold stripe in the middle, with silver pants with one single stripe of red. The socks also added the three stripes similar to the jersey's. 1955 was also unique in that the 49ers wore white pants with a black stripe bounded by two red stripes, and shadow drop numbers on their red jerseys, with black shadow drop borders on the white numerals. The following season, 1956, the team wore white helmets with no stripes, and white pants with a red stripe. In 1957 the 49ers wore red jerseys, a gold helmet with no stripes, and gold pants with no stripes; for the first time the 49ers wore white on the road, as dictated by the NFL for all teams, to have at least one team wearing a light colored jersey during games. The first white jersey had two red stripes with a gold in the middle, as was their road socks: white, with two red stripes and gold in the middle. San Francisco wore red and gold in 1958 as well, with their white jersey having a single shoulder loop stripe, as well as adding TV numbers to the sleeves of their home and away jerseys. And in contrast to the socks at home, red with three red stripes, the away socks were solid red. In 1959 the team switched to red and platinum gold (looking more like silver), and for the next several years afterwards, with their white jerseys having double shoulder loop stripes (mimicking UCLA's), but continuing with the three white stripes on the sleeves above the elbow and below the TV numbers, with the red home jerseys. In 1960, the team added \"Northwestern\" red stripes to their helmets (a thicker middle stripe bordered by two thinner stripes), and that changed in 1962, with the addition of the helmet design the team has mostly worn since: white stripe bounded by two red, with the red oval and SF logo on the sides of the helmet. In 1964 the team's colors then changed again. All silver elements were changed to what was called \"49er Gold;\" helmets were gold. New beige-gold pants with a red-white-red tri-stripe in the same style as the helmet were introduced. Uniform's basic design would be worn for practically the next 30 seasons with only some minor changes and adjustments, such as a gradual change over from sans-serif to serifed block numerals from 1970 to 1974 and a switch from thin stripes to a very thick pant striping in 1976 (during which white jerseys were also worn at home for most of that season). The uniform ensemble of red and white jerseys, and beige-gold pants with thick striping were worn until 1995 with a few minor changes. During the 1994 season, many NFL teams wore \"throwback uniforms\" on occasional games to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary (a corresponding diamond-shaped 75th Anniversary patch was also worn by all teams) . The 49ers chose to wear a version of their 1955 uniforms as their throwbacks, with simpler sans-serif block numerals that were outlined and shadowed in black with White pants with thinner red-black-red striping were also worn, along with the old striped red socks. The regular 1989\u201395 design gold helmet was worn with this uniform, as there was no logo on the 1955 helmet.\n\nIn 1996, the 49ers celebrated their 49th anniversary by designing a commemorative jersey patch based on the earlier shield-crest logo. The team also debuted a substantially new uniform design, most notably changing the shade of red used in their jerseys from bright scarlet to a deeper, cardinal red a black dropshadow effect (along with gold trim) was added to the jersey numerals (which remained in the blocked serif style). As in 1994, the Niners donned white pants full-time for the 1996 season (also wearing them for the 1997 season and 1998 preseason,) though this time the pant stripes were marginally thicker and the colors were reversed to black-cardinal red-black (matching the striping on the helmets). For the 1998 regular season opener, the team switched back to gold pants, with a more metallic gold rather than the previous beige-matte gold of the past. The striping along the side of the pants remained black-cardinal red-black, though a thin gold trimming was added, along with further oval \"SF\" logos placed on both sides of the hip. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe 1996 helmet and jersey design with the 1998 gold pants was worn as the team's regular uniforms until the end of the 2008 season. The 49ers once again changed uniforms in 2009, which are very similar to the classic design, albeit with several significant changes. The sleeve stripes are now set at an angle to accommodate the even shorter sleeves of modern jerseys, (though the stripes appear straight and parallel to the ground when worn by the players themselves).<ref>{{cite news|last=Price|first=Taylor|title=49ers Unveil Classic Uniforms|url=https://www.49ers.com/news/49ers-unveil-classic-uniforms-490491|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=April 25, 2009|access-date=May 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508021911/https://www.49ers.com/news/49ers-unveil-classic-uniforms-490491|archive-date=May 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> An updated 49ers uniform with improved fit, and more breathable and moisture-resistant fabrics was debuted (alongside the rest of the NFL teams) by new league uniform manufacturer [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] on April 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Price|first=Taylor|title=Morning Tailgate: Uniform Edition (April 3)|url=http://blog.49ers.com/2012/04/03/morning-tailgate-uniform-edition-april-3/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=April 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405210202/http://blog.49ers.com/2012/04/03/morning-tailgate-uniform-edition-april-3|archivedate=April 5, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn April 30, 2015 at their [[2015 NFL Draft|NFL Draft]] rally, the team unveiled their first ever alternate uniform (as opposed to a throwback design).

Prior to 2002, the teams played each other almost every season during the pre-season, but only every three years during the regular season when the AFC West and NFC West teams faced each other. So far, their rivalry has not been as intense as other division foes because for the most part both teams have not been good at the same time. In the middle to late part of the decade, the Seahawks lost the division and their favorable record against the 49ers reflected this. However, games at [[CenturyLink Field]], one of the toughest stadiums to play at as a visiting team, have still been difficult to win. The 49ers have a 3\u20137 record all-time at that stadium, with their largest margin of victory there being ten points, and failed to score a touchdown in four of those losses. The rivalry has intensified after the 49ers hired [[Jim Harbaugh]] out of [[Stanford University|Stanford]] in 2011, as he and Seahawks and former [[University of Southern California|USC]] head coach [[Pete Carroll]] had an intense rivalry in college. Seattle leads the all-time series 20\u201315 after winning both regular season games in 2014 and taking a week 7 win at Levi's Stadium in 2015.\n\n====Arizona Cardinals====\nThe [[Arizona Cardinals]] are a recent growing rival of the 49ers. Unlike most rivalries of this team, the Arizona Cardinals are in the same division as the 49ers (since 2002, when the Cardinals transferred from the [[NFC East]]). Recently, there has been much bad blood between these two teams' players; an example of this is a Twitter \"battle\" between [[Darnell Dockett]] of the Arizona Cardinals and [[Vernon Davis]] of the San Francisco 49ers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revengeofthebirds.com/2010/5/11/1468108/adrian-wilson-vs-vernon-davis-rotb|title=Adrian Wilson vs Vernon Davis; ROTB Announcement|publisher=Revengeofthebirds.com|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=January 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721204430/http://www.revengeofthebirds.com/2010/5/11/1468108/adrian-wilson-vs-vernon-davis-rotb|archive-date=July 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Another clash was when Early Doucet of the Cardinals and Dashon Goldson of the Niners threw punches at each other. The clash of words between players of both teams, added with the decline of the other major rivalries of the 49ers, either from the rarity of meeting the rival teams (49ers rarely meet the Cowboys) or the move to different cities (Los Angeles Rams moving to St. Louis), has led to the rivalry between the 49ers and the Cardinals becoming heated and intense. The 49ers hold the edge over the Cardinals all-time by 28\u201318.<ref>[http://blogs.mercurynews.com/49ers/2011/01/02/49ers-cardinals-pre-game-notes-lombardi-says-harbaugh-lookes-headed-for-michigan/ 49ers\u2013Cardinals pre-game notes: Lombardi says Harbaugh looks headed for Michigan; 49ers Hot Read] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714073521/http://blogs.mercurynews.com/49ers/2011/01/02/49ers-cardinals-pre-game-notes-lombardi-says-harbaugh-lookes-headed-for-michigan/ |date=July 14, 2011 }}, mercurynews.com, January 2, 2011; accessed November 27, 2014.</ref>\n\n===NFC===\n\n====Green Bay Packers====\n\nThe [[Green Bay Packers]] rivalry emerged in the mid-1990s when the Packers upset the 49ers in the 1995 NFC Divisional game at Candlestick Park, ending any chance of a Super Bowl repeat. From that point, the Packers beat the 49ers four more times including two post-season games. San Francisco was finally able to exact revenge in the 1998 NFC Wild Card round, a game that is remembered for a 25-yard game-winning touchdown reception by [[Terrell Owens]] off a [[Steve Young]] pass (referred to by some as \"The Catch II\"), lifting the 49ers over the Packers 30\u201327. Since that game, the Packers had beaten the 49ers eight straight times including once in the 2001 post-season, a streak that came to an end in the 2012 season when the 49ers beat the Packers in [[Lambeau Field]] week 1 for the first time since 1990, and again in the NFC Divisional game that same season. The 49ers trail the all-time series with a record of 32\u201336\u20131, including a 4\u20134 postseason split.\n\n===Historic rivals===\n{{original research section|date=January 2013}}\n\n====Dallas Cowboys====\n{{main|49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry}}\nThe rivalry between the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and the 49ers has lasted since the 1970s. The [[NFL Top 10]] ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in NFL history. San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC championship game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' [[Joe Montana]] complete a game-winning pass to [[Dwight Clark]] in the final minute (now known as '''The Catch'''), is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992\u20131994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC championship game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are second all time in [[Super Bowl]] victories to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] with five each. The 49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. In recent years, this once-great rivalry has greatly softened, with the struggles of both the Cowboys and 49ers. However, in its prime especially in the 1990s, this rivalry was a very bitter one as both teams were the class of the NFL during this time.\n\n====New York Giants====\n{{main|49ers\u2013Giants rivalry}}\n\nThe [[New York Giants]] have the most playoff meetings versus the 49ers (eight). This rivalry is rooted in the 1980s when both teams were on the rise. In the first two playoff meetings between these two teams, the [[Joe Montana]]-led 49ers won both meetings, 38\u201324 in [[1981 NFL Season|1981]] and 21\u201310 in [[1984 NFL Season|1984]] both in the divisional round at [[Candlestick Park]]; the 49ers went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The Giants won the next three playoff meetings, which included a 49\u20133 rout at [[Giants Stadium]] in [[1986 NFL Season|1986]], and the [[1990 NFL Season|1990 NFC championship]], where they upset the 49ers 15\u201313, ruining the 49ers hopes of a Super Bowl three-peat after [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] lost a fumble late in the fourth quarter and let the Giants score on a last-second field goal. Giants also went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The 49ers defeated the Giants 44\u20133 in [[1993 NFL Season|1993]] in the divisional round.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/schedules;/1993/POST NFL 1993 Post-season Schedule] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506161202/http://www.nfl.com/schedules;/1993/POST |date=May 6, 2019 }} NFL.com; Retrieved 6 May 2019</ref>  In the [[2002 NFL Season|2002 NFC Wildcard]] game, the Giants were ahead 38\u201314 late in the third quarter; however, the 49ers came back from the 24-point deficit to beat the Giants with a 39\u201338 victory. The teams met again in the [[2011 NFL Season|2011 NFC championship]] at Candlestick Park, and just like the 1990 NFC championship, it was a low-scoring game; the Giants won the game on a [[Lawrence Tynes]] 31-yard field goal in overtime, 20\u201317. In an eerie similarity to Roger Craig's fumble 21 years earlier, [[Kyle Williams (wide receiver)|Kyle Williams]] fumbled a punt in the crucial minutes of the game, and just like the last two times the Giants beat the 49ers in the playoffs, they went on to win the Super Bowl.\n\n====New Orleans Saints====\n\nAll-time record:  49\u201326\u20132 (including 1\u20130 postseason)\n\nThe [[New Orleans Saints]] were division rivals with the 49ers up until realignment in 2002 when the Saints were placed in the newly formed [[NFC South]]. The 49ers dominated the rivalry when the Saints played in the [[NFC West]], but the Saints have held the upper hand since realignment, winning the first six-game since moving to the NFC South. They met most recently in the divisional round of the [[2011\u201312 NFL playoffs|2011 playoffs]] at Candlestick Park. There were four lead changes in the final four minutes of the game, culminating with [[Alex Smith]] throwing the game-winning touchdown to [[Vernon Davis]] with nine seconds left (referred by many as '''Vernon Post''' or '''The Catch III'''). Three months after that game, it was revealed that then-Saints [[defensive coordinator]] [[Gregg Williams]] ordered his players to target certain players in certain areas in a profanity-laced speech as part of the [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal|bounty]] scandal prior to that game.\n\n====Atlanta Falcons====\n\nAll-time record:  47\u201332\u20131 (including 1\u20131 postseason)\n\nThe [[Atlanta Falcons]] were also division rivals with the 49ers until the Falcons moved to the NFC South in 2002 after the realignment. Just like the Saints, the 49ers had dominated the Falcons when they played in the NFC West, but the Falcons won their first four games (spanning nine seasons) against the 49ers since moving to the NFC South. Both teams met in the divisional round of the [[1998\u201399 NFL playoffs|1998 playoffs]], when [[Garrison Hearst]] suffered an ankle break when his foot was caught in the [[Georgia Dome]] turf and twisted severely as he tried to spin away from Falcons' defensive end [[Chuck Smith (football player)|Chuck Smith]] on the first play from [[Line of scrimmage|scrimmage]]; 49ers lost that game 20\u201318. They met in the [[2012\u201313 NFL playoffs|2012 NFC championship]], in which the 49ers, led by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, defeated the top-seeded Falcons in Atlanta by a score of 28\u201324. The next year, the Falcons played against the 49ers in the last home game at Candlestick Park. The game ended in a dramatic interception return for a touchdown also known as \"The Pick at the 'Stick\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Fann|first=Joe|title=NaVorro Bowman Retires from NFL as a Member of the 49ers|url=https://www.49ers.com/news/navorro-bowman-retires-from-nfl-as-a-member-of-the-49ers|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=49ers.com|date=June 4, 2019|access-date=July 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190629081852/https://www.49ers.com/news/navorro-bowman-retires-from-nfl-as-a-member-of-the-49ers|archive-date=June 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.levisstadium.com/2015/04/49ers-announce-2015-schedule/|title=49ers Announce 2015 Schedule|date=April 21, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525153719/http://www.levisstadium.com/2015/04/49ers-announce-2015-schedule/|archive-date=May 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n====Las Vegas Raiders====\n{{Main|49ers\u2013Raiders rivalry}}\nThe [[Las Vegas Raiders]] were the 49ers' geographic rivals prior to the Raiders relocation to Las Vegas. As a result, games between the two were referred to as the \"Battle of the Bay.\"<ref name=\"battletwo\">{{cite news|title=49ers And Raiders Stagger Into Battle|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=49ers&id=4638285|agency=Associated Press|publisher=KGO-TV|date=October 7, 2006|accessdate=February 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219105318/http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=49ers&id=4638285|archive-date=February 19, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first exhibition game played in 1967, ended with the NFL 49ers defeating the AFL Raiders 13\u201310. After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38\u20137. The rivalry still remained heated when [[History of the Los Angeles Raiders|the Raiders moved to Los Angeles]], leaving many Raider fans in Northern California bitter over the move, and some of them becoming 49er fans, added with the antagonism between Northern and Southern California. The Raiders notably upset the defending Super Bowl champion 49ers in San Francisco in 1982, winning 23-17. Since the two teams play in different conferences, regular season matchups are at least every four years. Fans and players of the winning team can claim \"bragging rights\" as the better team in the area. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}In addition, both teams have shared a number of players, most notably [[Jim Plunkett]], [[Jerry Rice]], [[Ronnie Lott]], [[Michael Crabtree]], [[Tom Rathman]], and [[Charlie Garner]].\n\nThe Battle of the Bay ended tied 7 to 7. San Francisco won the last matchup 34-3 on November 1, 2018 in Week 9\n\nOn August 20, 2011, in the third week of the pre-season, the pre-season game between the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at [[Candlestick Park]] including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured. The NFL decided to cancel all future pre-season games between the Raiders and 49ers.\n\n==Season-by-season records==\nThis is a partial list of the 49ers' last five completed seasons.

It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the \"Western Wall\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Complete visual compendium of Western Wall|url=https://madainproject.com/western_wall_(temple_mount)|website=Madain Project|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the [[Second Jewish Temple]] begun by [[Herod the Great]], which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the [[Temple Mount]], in a huge rectangular structure topped by a flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself, its auxiliary buildings, and crowds of worshippers and visitors. \n\nIn one of several varying Muslim traditions, it is the site where the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] tied his winged steed, al-[[Buraq]], on his [[night journey|Isra and Mi'raj]] to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the eastern border of ''al-Haram al-Sharif'', the Noble Sanctuary of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].\n\nThe Western Wall's holiness in Judaism is a result of its proximity to the Temple Mount. Because of the [[Temple Mount entry restrictions]], the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the [[Foundation Stone]], the holiest site in the Jewish faith, lies behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by [[Herod the Great|Herod]], who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support the Temple platform and using extensive substructures and earth fills in order to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved platform which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one is considered to be closest to the former [[Holy of Holies]], which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount platform.\n\nJust over half the wall's total height, including its 17 [[course (architecture)|courses]] located below street level, dates from the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, and is commonly believed to have been built by Herod the Great starting in 19 BCE, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad period]], while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\n\nThe term Western Wall and its variations are mostly used in a narrow sense for the section traditionally used by Jews for prayer; it has also been called the \"Wailing Wall\", referring to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of the Temples. During the period of [[Byzantine Empire|Christian Roman rule]] over Jerusalem (ca. 324\u2013638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except to attend [[Tisha B'Av]], the day of national mourning for the Temples, and on this day the Jews would weep at their holy places. The term \"Wailing Wall\" was thus almost exclusively used by Christians, and was revived in the period of non-Jewish control between the establishment of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Rule]] in 1920 and the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. The term \"Wailing Wall\" is not used by religious Jews, and increasingly not by many others who consider it derogatory.<ref name=\"Halkin01\">{{harvnb|Halkin|2001}}</ref>\n\nIn a broader sense, \"Western Wall\" can refer to the entire {{convert|488|m|ft}}-long retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount. The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the [[Muslim Quarter]], with the small exception of a {{convert|8|m|ft}} section, the so-called [[Little Western Wall]]. The segment of the western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy, known as the \"Western Wall\" or \"Wailing Wall\", derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much more of the original Herodian [[stonework]] than the \"Little Western Wall\". In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" ([[Shechina]]), and the [[Western Wall Tunnel|underground]] [[Warren's Gate]], which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century, even more so.\n\nWhilst the wall was considered Muslim property as an integral part of the [[Haram esh-Sharif]] and [[waqf]] property of the [[Moroccan Quarter]], a right of Jewish prayer and [[pilgrimage]] existed as part of the [[Status Quo (Jerusalem and Bethlehem)|Status Quo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Working Paper on the Holy Places|date=1949|author=UN Conciliation Commission |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_Conciliation_Commission_for_Palestine_Working_Paper_on_the_Holy_Places.djvu|pages=26|quote=The Palestine Administration interpreted the Status Quo in respect of the Wailing Wall as being that the Jewish Community had a right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for their devotions, but that the Wall itself, the pavement in front of it and the adjacent Moroccan Quarter, were legally Moslem property. The Jews might bring to the Wall only those appurtenances of worship that were allowed under the Ottoman regime. This position was in general reaffirmed by the International Commission appointed by the British Government in 1930, with the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, to enquire into conflicting rights and claims concerning the Wailing Wall. The International Commission further ruled that although the Jews enjoyed no sort of proprietary rights to the Wall or the adjacent pavement, they should have free access to them at all times, subject to certain stipulations. The placing of benches and screens against the Wall was prohibited; the Moslems were similarly forbidden to carry out the Zikr ceremony during the progress of Jewish devotions or to cause annoyance to the Jews in any other way; no political speeches or demonstrations near the Wall were to be allowed; the Moslems' right to repair the pavement was affirmed, and if any repairs were not carried out by them in due time, the work was to be undertaken by the Government. The maintenance of the Wall itself was entrusted to the Government, but it was understood that repairs to it should be carried out only after consultation with the Supreme Moslem Council and the Chief Rabbinate.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Status Quo in the Holy Places|date=1929|first=L.

Some of the dwellings are entered from the space in front of the Wall. The wall separating the garden to the north from the Wailing Wall was rebuilt without incident in 1929. The wall overlooking the Wailing Wall by the Bab-al-Mughrabi was also rebuilt at the same time. The Moslems wanted to erect a low wall, but it was ruled, to preserve the Status Quo, that the wall must be rebuilt to its former height. The Wailing Wall, as being one of the few relics of the Temple of Herod of undisputed authenticity, is held in very great veneration by the Jews. Jewish writers refer to it as \"the Holiest possession of the fifteen millions of Jews throughout the world which they have not forgotten for one moment since the Dispersion.\" On Sabbaths and other Holy Days the Wall is thronged with worshippers, the American and European Jew mixing with the Orthodox Jew in his caftan and the Bokharan in his gorgeous silks. The Jewish custom of praying here is of considerable antiquity, being mentioned by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela and has now become an established right. This right to pray has, however, become linked with the claim to the actual ownership of the Wall. The Moslems resist this on the ground that the Wall is an integral part of the enclosure wall of the Haram al Sharif, and that the space in front of it is a public way, and part of the premises of the Abu Midian Waqf. For this reason the Moslems have always protested against the placing of benches or chairs in front of the Wall by the Jews as causing an obstruction in this public way and implying possessory rights. Though benches have certainly from time to time been introduced, there is extant a resolution taken by the Administrative Council and confirmed by the Mutasarrif in 1912 that chairs or tents or curtains (to divide the women from the men) are not to be allowed. This is still enforced, but portable camp-stools or boxes or tins with cushions are permitted for the convenience of worshippers. This ruling was notified to the Jewish religious authorities and the Police by the District Governor in 1922, and confirmed in 1926 after a rather serious dispute had arisen on account of the introduction of some benches on the previous Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).}}</ref><ref name=\"Reiter2017\">{{cite book |author=Yitzhak Reiter|title=Contested Holy Places in Israel\u2013Palestine: Sharing and Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieyfDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26|date=7 April 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-99884-0|pages=26\u2013}}</ref> This position was confirmed in a [[1930 Western Wall Commission|1930 international commission]] during the British Mandate period.\n\nThe earliest source mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 17th century.<ref name=\"Goren\">{{cite book |first= Amnon |last= Ramon  |title= Delicate balances at the Temple Mount, 1967-1999  |work= Jerusalem: A City and Its Future |editors= Marshall J.

From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly [[1929 Palestine riots|riot in 1929]] in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]], and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the [[Six-Day War]]. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the [[Moroccan Quarter]] was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1984}} \"One of the best documented endowments, one that embraced the entire quarter of Western Muslims or Maghrebis\".</ref>\n\n[[File:Jerusalem Western Wall stones.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Herodian ashlars of the Western Wall]]\n\n==Etymology==\n===Western Wall===\nEarly Jewish texts referred to a \"western wall of the Temple\",<ref name=SSR>[[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah]], ch. 2\u20138</ref> but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer, retaining wall called today \"the Western Wall\", or to the western wall of the actual Temple.<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/> The earliest Jewish use of the Hebrew term \"ha-kotel ha-ma'aravi\", \"the Western Wall\", as referring to the wall visible today, was by the 11th-century poet [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel]].<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/>\n\n===Wailing Wall===\nThe name \"Wailing Wall\", and descriptions such as \"wailing place\", appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century.<ref>\"Wailing Wall\" appears, for example, in J.J.

In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall.

Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock.

It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the ''Even ha-shetiya'' or [[Foundation Stone]], which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by [[Kareth]]. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the [[Dome of the Rock]] is the Foundation Stone,<ref>[[Radbaz]] [[Responsa]] 691: \"Under the [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt, is the location of the Foundation Stone.\"; Ya'ari, Avraham: ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' by [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], [[Ramat Gan]] 1971: \"I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct.\"</ref> some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain.<ref>[[Moishe Sternbuch|Sternbuch, Moishe]] ''Teshuvos Ve-hanhagos'' Vol. 3, Ch. 39: \"In truth they have erred, thinking that the stone upon they built their dome was in fact the Foundation Stone, however, most possibly, the Stone is located further to the south in the open space opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall.\"</ref> This spot was the site of the [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]] when the Temple stood.\n\n===Part of the Temple proper===\nRabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical [[King Solomon]] from the time of the [[First Temple]].<ref name=KHB>Frishman, Avraham; ''Kum Hisalech Be\u2019aretz'', [[Jerusalem]] 2004</ref>\n\nSome medieval rabbis claimed that today's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity.<ref>See Radvaz 692</ref> Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.<ref name=AH>{{cite book\n| last= Horovitz |first= Ahron |title= Jerusalem: Footsteps Through Time |year= 2001\n| publisher= [[Feldheim Publishers|Feldheim]] |location= [[Jerusalem]] |chapter =\n| quote= However, today there is no doubt that the wall is the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount and the Midrash refers to the Temple in its broader sense, that is, the Temple Mount.}}</ref>\n\n===Divine custody===\nA [[Midrash]] compiled in [[Late Antiquity]] refers to a western wall of the Temple which \"would never be destroyed\",<ref name=SSR/> and [[Lamentations Rabbah]] mentions how [[Roman Empire|Rome]] was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.<ref>[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 1:32</ref>\n\n===Divine Presence===\nAnother Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: \"Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall\",<ref>[[Exodus Rabbah]] 2:2</ref> and the [[Zohar]] similarly writes that \"the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] rests upon the Western Wall\".<ref>[[Zohar]] [[Mishpatim]] 116</ref>\n\nEighteenth-century scholar [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]] writes that \"after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour\".<ref>''[[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|Ya'arot Devash]]'' Vol. 1, Ch. 4</ref> It is told that great Jewish sages, including [[Isaac Luria]] and the [[Radvaz]], experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.<ref>See also ''[[Kav ha-Yashar]]'' Ch. 93 and ''[[Chaim Joseph David Azulai#His Shem ha-Gedolim|Shem Ha-gedolim]]'' for a similar account with Rabbi Avraham Ha-levi of Safed.</ref>\n\n===Kabbalah of the word ''kotel''===\nRabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover]] discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word ''kotel'' when discussing the significance of praying against a wall.

These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall.<ref name=SLC/> Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long [[responsa]] appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper ''[[Israel Dov Frumkin#Havatzelet|Havatzelet]]'' in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration.<ref name=SLC/> More recently the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness.<ref name=YY>{{cite book\n| last= Yosef\n| first= Ovadia\n| authorlink= Ovadia Yosef\n| title= ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]''\n| year= 1990\n| location= [[Jerusalem]]\n| volume= 2, Laws of Kotel HaMa'aravi\n| pages= 278\u2013282\n| nopp= true\n}}</ref> Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a [[halachic]] point of view.

It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the \"Western Wall\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Complete visual compendium of Western Wall|url=https://madainproject.com/western_wall_(temple_mount)|website=Madain Project|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the [[Second Jewish Temple]] begun by [[Herod the Great]], which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the [[Temple Mount]], in a huge rectangular structure topped by a flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself, its auxiliary buildings, and crowds of worshippers and visitors. \n\nIn one of several varying Muslim traditions, it is the site where the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] tied his winged steed, al-[[Buraq]], on his [[night journey|Isra and Mi'raj]] to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the eastern border of ''al-Haram al-Sharif'', the Noble Sanctuary of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].\n\nThe Western Wall's holiness in Judaism is a result of its proximity to the Temple Mount. Because of the [[Temple Mount entry restrictions]], the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the [[Foundation Stone]], the holiest site in the Jewish faith, lies behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by [[Herod the Great|Herod]], who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support the Temple platform and using extensive substructures and earth fills in order to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved platform which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one is considered to be closest to the former [[Holy of Holies]], which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount platform.\n\nJust over half the wall's total height, including its 17 [[course (architecture)|courses]] located below street level, dates from the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, and is commonly believed to have been built by Herod the Great starting in 19 BCE, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad period]], while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\n\nThe term Western Wall and its variations are mostly used in a narrow sense for the section traditionally used by Jews for prayer; it has also been called the \"Wailing Wall\", referring to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of the Temples. During the period of [[Byzantine Empire|Christian Roman rule]] over Jerusalem (ca. 324\u2013638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except to attend [[Tisha B'Av]], the day of national mourning for the Temples, and on this day the Jews would weep at their holy places. The term \"Wailing Wall\" was thus almost exclusively used by Christians, and was revived in the period of non-Jewish control between the establishment of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Rule]] in 1920 and the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. The term \"Wailing Wall\" is not used by religious Jews, and increasingly not by many others who consider it derogatory.<ref name=\"Halkin01\">{{harvnb|Halkin|2001}}</ref>\n\nIn a broader sense, \"Western Wall\" can refer to the entire {{convert|488|m|ft}}-long retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount. The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the [[Muslim Quarter]], with the small exception of a {{convert|8|m|ft}} section, the so-called [[Little Western Wall]]. The segment of the western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy, known as the \"Western Wall\" or \"Wailing Wall\", derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much more of the original Herodian [[stonework]] than the \"Little Western Wall\". In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" ([[Shechina]]), and the [[Western Wall Tunnel|underground]] [[Warren's Gate]], which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century, even more so.\n\nWhilst the wall was considered Muslim property as an integral part of the [[Haram esh-Sharif]] and [[waqf]] property of the [[Moroccan Quarter]], a right of Jewish prayer and [[pilgrimage]] existed as part of the [[Status Quo (Jerusalem and Bethlehem)|Status Quo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Working Paper on the Holy Places|date=1949|author=UN Conciliation Commission |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_Conciliation_Commission_for_Palestine_Working_Paper_on_the_Holy_Places.djvu|pages=26|quote=The Palestine Administration interpreted the Status Quo in respect of the Wailing Wall as being that the Jewish Community had a right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for their devotions, but that the Wall itself, the pavement in front of it and the adjacent Moroccan Quarter, were legally Moslem property. The Jews might bring to the Wall only those appurtenances of worship that were allowed under the Ottoman regime. This position was in general reaffirmed by the International Commission appointed by the British Government in 1930, with the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, to enquire into conflicting rights and claims concerning the Wailing Wall. The International Commission further ruled that although the Jews enjoyed no sort of proprietary rights to the Wall or the adjacent pavement, they should have free access to them at all times, subject to certain stipulations. The placing of benches and screens against the Wall was prohibited; the Moslems were similarly forbidden to carry out the Zikr ceremony during the progress of Jewish devotions or to cause annoyance to the Jews in any other way; no political speeches or demonstrations near the Wall were to be allowed; the Moslems' right to repair the pavement was affirmed, and if any repairs were not carried out by them in due time, the work was to be undertaken by the Government. The maintenance of the Wall itself was entrusted to the Government, but it was understood that repairs to it should be carried out only after consultation with the Supreme Moslem Council and the Chief Rabbinate.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Status Quo in the Holy Places|date=1929|first=L.

Some of the dwellings are entered from the space in front of the Wall. The wall separating the garden to the north from the Wailing Wall was rebuilt without incident in 1929. The wall overlooking the Wailing Wall by the Bab-al-Mughrabi was also rebuilt at the same time. The Moslems wanted to erect a low wall, but it was ruled, to preserve the Status Quo, that the wall must be rebuilt to its former height. The Wailing Wall, as being one of the few relics of the Temple of Herod of undisputed authenticity, is held in very great veneration by the Jews. Jewish writers refer to it as \"the Holiest possession of the fifteen millions of Jews throughout the world which they have not forgotten for one moment since the Dispersion.\" On Sabbaths and other Holy Days the Wall is thronged with worshippers, the American and European Jew mixing with the Orthodox Jew in his caftan and the Bokharan in his gorgeous silks. The Jewish custom of praying here is of considerable antiquity, being mentioned by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela and has now become an established right. This right to pray has, however, become linked with the claim to the actual ownership of the Wall. The Moslems resist this on the ground that the Wall is an integral part of the enclosure wall of the Haram al Sharif, and that the space in front of it is a public way, and part of the premises of the Abu Midian Waqf. For this reason the Moslems have always protested against the placing of benches or chairs in front of the Wall by the Jews as causing an obstruction in this public way and implying possessory rights. Though benches have certainly from time to time been introduced, there is extant a resolution taken by the Administrative Council and confirmed by the Mutasarrif in 1912 that chairs or tents or curtains (to divide the women from the men) are not to be allowed. This is still enforced, but portable camp-stools or boxes or tins with cushions are permitted for the convenience of worshippers. This ruling was notified to the Jewish religious authorities and the Police by the District Governor in 1922, and confirmed in 1926 after a rather serious dispute had arisen on account of the introduction of some benches on the previous Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).}}</ref><ref name=\"Reiter2017\">{{cite book |author=Yitzhak Reiter|title=Contested Holy Places in Israel\u2013Palestine: Sharing and Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieyfDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26|date=7 April 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-99884-0|pages=26\u2013}}</ref> This position was confirmed in a [[1930 Western Wall Commission|1930 international commission]] during the British Mandate period.\n\nThe earliest source mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 17th century.<ref name=\"Goren\">{{cite book |first= Amnon |last= Ramon  |title= Delicate balances at the Temple Mount, 1967-1999  |work= Jerusalem: A City and Its Future |editors= Marshall J.

From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly [[1929 Palestine riots|riot in 1929]] in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]], and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the [[Six-Day War]]. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the [[Moroccan Quarter]] was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1984}} \"One of the best documented endowments, one that embraced the entire quarter of Western Muslims or Maghrebis\".</ref>\n\n[[File:Jerusalem Western Wall stones.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Herodian ashlars of the Western Wall]]\n\n==Etymology==\n===Western Wall===\nEarly Jewish texts referred to a \"western wall of the Temple\",<ref name=SSR>[[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah]], ch. 2\u20138</ref> but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer, retaining wall called today \"the Western Wall\", or to the western wall of the actual Temple.<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/> The earliest Jewish use of the Hebrew term \"ha-kotel ha-ma'aravi\", \"the Western Wall\", as referring to the wall visible today, was by the 11th-century poet [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel]].<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/>\n\n===Wailing Wall===\nThe name \"Wailing Wall\", and descriptions such as \"wailing place\", appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century.<ref>\"Wailing Wall\" appears, for example, in J.J.

Around 19 BCE [[Herod the Great]] began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount.

Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall.

Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock.

It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the ''Even ha-shetiya'' or [[Foundation Stone]], which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by [[Kareth]]. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the [[Dome of the Rock]] is the Foundation Stone,<ref>[[Radbaz]] [[Responsa]] 691: \"Under the [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt, is the location of the Foundation Stone.\"; Ya'ari, Avraham: ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' by [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], [[Ramat Gan]] 1971: \"I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct.\"</ref> some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain.<ref>[[Moishe Sternbuch|Sternbuch, Moishe]] ''Teshuvos Ve-hanhagos'' Vol. 3, Ch. 39: \"In truth they have erred, thinking that the stone upon they built their dome was in fact the Foundation Stone, however, most possibly, the Stone is located further to the south in the open space opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall.\"</ref> This spot was the site of the [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]] when the Temple stood.\n\n===Part of the Temple proper===\nRabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical [[King Solomon]] from the time of the [[First Temple]].<ref name=KHB>Frishman, Avraham; ''Kum Hisalech Be\u2019aretz'', [[Jerusalem]] 2004</ref>\n\nSome medieval rabbis claimed that today's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity.<ref>See Radvaz 692</ref> Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.<ref name=AH>{{cite book\n| last= Horovitz |first= Ahron |title= Jerusalem: Footsteps Through Time |year= 2001\n| publisher= [[Feldheim Publishers|Feldheim]] |location= [[Jerusalem]] |chapter =\n| quote= However, today there is no doubt that the wall is the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount and the Midrash refers to the Temple in its broader sense, that is, the Temple Mount.}}</ref>\n\n===Divine custody===\nA [[Midrash]] compiled in [[Late Antiquity]] refers to a western wall of the Temple which \"would never be destroyed\",<ref name=SSR/> and [[Lamentations Rabbah]] mentions how [[Roman Empire|Rome]] was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.<ref>[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 1:32</ref>\n\n===Divine Presence===\nAnother Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: \"Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall\",<ref>[[Exodus Rabbah]] 2:2</ref> and the [[Zohar]] similarly writes that \"the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] rests upon the Western Wall\".<ref>[[Zohar]] [[Mishpatim]] 116</ref>\n\nEighteenth-century scholar [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]] writes that \"after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour\".<ref>''[[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|Ya'arot Devash]]'' Vol. 1, Ch. 4</ref> It is told that great Jewish sages, including [[Isaac Luria]] and the [[Radvaz]], experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.<ref>See also ''[[Kav ha-Yashar]]'' Ch. 93 and ''[[Chaim Joseph David Azulai#His Shem ha-Gedolim|Shem Ha-gedolim]]'' for a similar account with Rabbi Avraham Ha-levi of Safed.</ref>\n\n===Kabbalah of the word ''kotel''===\nRabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover]] discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word ''kotel'' when discussing the significance of praying against a wall.

These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall.<ref name=SLC/> Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long [[responsa]] appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper ''[[Israel Dov Frumkin#Havatzelet|Havatzelet]]'' in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration.<ref name=SLC/> More recently the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness.<ref name=YY>{{cite book\n| last= Yosef\n| first= Ovadia\n| authorlink= Ovadia Yosef\n| title= ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]''\n| year= 1990\n| location= [[Jerusalem]]\n| volume= 2, Laws of Kotel HaMa'aravi\n| pages= 278\u2013282\n| nopp= true\n}}</ref> Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a [[halachic]] point of view.

Ben was the leader of a group of island natives called the [[Others (Lost)|Others]] and was initially known as '''Henry Gale''' to the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815.  He began as the main [[antagonist]] during the second and third seasons, but in subsequent seasons, becomes a morally ambiguous ally to the main characters. Other characters frequently describe him as loyal only to himself, though it is also often hinted that he may be driven by some higher purpose.\n\n<!--Out of universe character development summary-->As with most characters on ''Lost'', Ben's history is revealed through flashbacks and episodes set in other time periods which are revealed slowly as the series progresses. [[Sterling Beaumon]] first portrayed a young Ben late in season three, in the character's first centric episode, \"[[The Man Behind the Curtain]]\". Ben's childhood is further explored in the [[Lost (season 5)|fifth season]] of the series, partially set in 1977. Fifth season episode \"[[Dead Is Dead]]\" explores Ben's fragile state following the events of the [[Lost (season 4)|fourth season]], in which his loyalty to the island led to the death of his adoptive daughter [[Alex Rousseau]] ([[Tania Raymonde]]), and flashbacks show the audience Ben's original acquisition of Alex and his rise to leadership of the Others, after exiling his rival [[Charles Widmore]] ([[Alan Dale]]). Originally cast for three guest appearances in the second season, Emerson's role was expanded. As leader of the Others, Ben became a regular cast member from the [[Lost (season 3)|third season]] onward. Reviews of the show would often focus on Ben's mysterious motives. Emerson's portrayal garnered many positive reviews, resulting in nominations for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor]] year-on-year from 2007 to 2010, winning in 2009.\n\nIn 2010, Ben Linus was ranked #24 on the [[TV Guide Network]] special ''25 Greatest TV Characters of All Time''.<ref>{{Cite AV media|type=TV production\n | title = 25 Greatest TV Characters of All Time\n | publisher = [[TV Guide Network]]\n | date = September 19, 2010\n | language = English\n}}</ref> In 2016, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him #1 of their \"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/40-greatest-tv-villains-of-all-time-20160209 |title=40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Sean T. |last=Collins |date=February 9, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427201150/http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/40-greatest-tv-villains-of-all-time-20160209 |archive-date=April 27, 2016 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Arc==\n===Prior to the crash===\nFlashbacks during \"[[The Man Behind the Curtain]]\" show Benjamin Linus being born in the woods outside of [[Portland, Oregon]], to [[Characters of Lost#Dharma Initiative members|Roger]] ([[Jon Gries]]) and Emily Linus ([[Carrie Preston]]). Emily dies after giving birth to Ben. When Ben is young, he and his father move to the Island, after Roger is offered a job working for the [[Dharma Initiative]]. On the Island, Ben begins to see visions of his mother, while Roger starts drinking heavily and [[Physical abuse|physically]] and [[Verbal abuse|verbally abusing]] him. Ben develops a hatred for the Dharma Initiative and one day runs away from the Barracks. He comes across [[Richard Alpert (Lost)|Richard Alpert]] ([[Nestor Carbonell]]), one of the Island natives known to the Initiative as the \"Hostiles\", in the jungle, who grants Ben's request to join his group but tells him he needs to be very patient.<ref name = \"The Man Behind the Curtain\"/>\n\nSeason five's \"[[Namaste (Lost)|Namaste]]\" shows a young Ben coming into contact with a captured [[Sayid Jarrah]] ([[Naveen Andrews]]), who along with several other Oceanic Flight 815 survivors has been brought back in time from 2007. In the following episode, \"[[He's Our You]]\", he helps free Sayid under the impression Sayid was sent by the Others to bring him to Richard. Sayid instead shoots Ben and leaves him for dead. Fellow crash survivor [[Jack Shephard]] ([[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]) refuses to help the boy, so [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]) and [[James \"Sawyer\" Ford]] ([[Josh Holloway]]) take Ben to Richard, who informs them Ben will henceforth lose his innocence and always be one of the Others. In 1987 (or possibly 1992) he assists the hostiles in using poisonous gas to kill the Dharma Initiative, including his father.<ref name = \"The Man Behind the Curtain\">{{cite episode | title = The Man Behind the Curtain | episodelink = The Man Behind the Curtain | series = Lost | serieslink = Lost (TV series) | credits = [[Bobby Roth]] (director); [[Elizabeth Sarnoff]] & [[Drew Goddard]] (writers) | network = ABC | airdate = 2007-05-09 | season = 3 | number = 20}}</ref> In 1988, Charles Widmore, leader of the Others, sends Ben to kill French scientist [[Danielle Rousseau]] ([[Melissa Farman]]), who was marooned on the island.

Ben visits Jack in the funeral home housing Locke's body, telling Jack he will help him return to the island, but the only way to get back is to bring everyone who had left it, including Locke's corpse. Ben boards Ajira Airways Flight 316 with the rest of survivors, which then crashes on the island. Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid are transported to 1977, while Sun and Ben remain in 2007 with a resurrected Locke. The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him in the back of the head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including Locke. After Ben regains consciousness and finds Locke to be alive, he convinces Locke he knew bringing him to the island would resurrect him, and he stopped Locke's suicide attempt merely to gain information. Locke travels with Ben, who is to be judged by the Monster. After they fail to find the Monster at the Barracks, they head to the Temple. As Ben and Locke travel through a series of tunnels beneath the Temple, Ben falls through the floor, so Locke leaves to get something that he can pull him up with. The Monster flows out of a grate below and surrounds Ben, showing flashes of decisions he made in his life involving Alex. The Monster takes the form of Alex and pushes Ben against a wall. She says she knows Ben is planning to kill Locke again, and if he does she will hunt him down and destroy him. She orders him to follow Locke and do whatever he asks, then disappears. They return to the Others' camp, where Locke gathers the group together and announces he is taking them to see Jacob.<ref>\"Follow the Leader\". Stephen Willams. Writ. Paul Zbyszewski & Elizabeth Sarnoff. ''Lost'' ABC. 2009-05-06. No. 15, season 5</ref> As they are walking, Ben relates his experience with the Monster and his promise to do whatever Locke asks, so Locke convinces Ben to kill Jacob.<ref>The Incident, Part 2</ref> Richard leads them to the base of the statue, where Jacob lives. Within, they are met by Jacob ([[Mark Pellegrino]]). Jacob greets Locke and observes Locke has found a loophole. It is revealed that Locke was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of Locke. Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him \u2013 and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.\n\nAfter Jacob's death, the Monster tells Ben to fetch Richard, as he wants to speak to him. However, when Ben exits the statue, Richard throws him down beside the corpse of the real John Locke, which has been brought to the statue by survivors of the Ajira flight, led by [[Ilana Verdansky]] ([[Zuleikha Robinson]]). Ben is forced by Ilana's group to bring them to the imposter Locke. They start shooting at the Monster, but he disappears, then returns in its black smoke form, killing Ilana's group. The Monster returns to Locke's form and mockingly informs Ben of the real Locke's last thoughts, while being strangled by Ben. Afterwards, Ben comforts Ilana when he finds her crying in Jacob's chamber and sets off with her, Sun, and [[Frank Lapidus]] ([[Jeff Fahey]]) to bury Locke before going to the Temple, where they believe they will be safe from the Monster. At Locke's funeral, Ben provides the eulogy, and expresses his sincere apologies for killing Locke. When they arrive at the Temple, the Monster is destroying the place. They return to the beach as a temporary shelter, and Ben attempts to make amends with everyone for killing Jacob. Ilana then forces him to dig a grave and explains she will kill Ben for murdering her [[father figure]]. Later, the Monster visits Ben, telling him to join him and then magically frees Ben. After Ben escapes, Ilana chases after him, and the two come face-to-face at the jungle when Ben points a rifle at her. Ben explains to her why he really killed Jacob, particularly grieving his [[Alex Rousseau|daughter]]. Ilana understands and allows him to rejoin their group, which he does. Hurley, Jack, and Richard show up and join their group, then have a meeting, deciding what to do next. Richard suggests they should stop the Monster escaping by blowing up the Ajira plane. After Hurley destroys the available dynamite from the shipwrecked ''Black Rock'', Richard insists he will find other explosives. Ben and Miles join Richard, while the rest decide to go talk to the Monster. When Ben, Richard and Miles arrive at the Barracks, Widmore is there, and is soon joined by the Monster. Ben murders Widmore before he is able to make a deal with the Monster to spare his daughter. The Monster and Ben find Desmond and the Monster forces him to go destroy the Island. They run into Jack's group and they both go to the heart of the Island, where Desmond removes the cork of the Island, causing the Island to begin collapsing. After Jack kills the Monster, Ben and Hurley volunteer to stay behind on the Island with Jack to assist him relighting the Island. Jack tells them he will die doing this and Jack gives Hurley the new position of being protector of the Island. Ben advises him to approach his Island duties with his kindness and helpful attitude. Hurley asks Ben to become his advisor, to which he is honored. After an undisclosed period of time, Ben, on orders from Hurley, arrives at the Dharma Logistics Warehouse in Guam. He speaks to the two workers there and instructs them that the facility is being shut down. Afterward, Ben arrives at the Santa Rosa Mental Hospital and visits Walt. Ben tells him that he is still special and that he can help his father, Michael, even though he is dead, and offers Walt a job to return to the island.\n\nThe afterlife experienced by the survivors is shown during season six. In \"[[The Substitute (Lost)|The Substitute]]\", Ben Linus is shown as a teacher of [[European History]]. In \"[[Dr. Linus]]\", Ben laments his life in general, frustrated with the school bureaucracy and particularly due to Reynolds, the principal who does not care for the school. He is living with his father, Roger ([[Jon Gries]]), who is on [[life support]]. At school, he is shown to have a close relationship with his star pupil, [[Alex Rousseau|Alex]], and befriends a substitute teacher, [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]]. While studying together, Alex tells Ben that Principal Reynolds is having a sexual affair with one of the school nurses on campus.  Ben attempts to blackmail Reynolds, threatening to reveal his [[substantial truth|affair]] and citing his position as principal as the demand. However, Reynolds swiftly retaliates by saying if he makes good on his threats, Alex's chances of going to [[Yale University]] will decrease substantially, as he is requested to write her a [[recommendation letter]]. Wanting to save Alex's educational future, Ben backs down. Days later, Ben notices [[Desmond Hume]] waiting outside the school in his car for an extended amount of time. Desmond runs over Locke, and swiftly drives off. As soon as the ambulance arrives, Ben gets in and sits next to the critically injured Locke, assuring him everything will be all right. When Locke returns to the school, Desmond does as well, and Ben catches him. Desmond beats Ben severely saying he was only trying to help Locke let go. Ben has a vision from his previous life during Desmond's beating. Ben believes him and relays Locke this information. When Alex sees how badly Ben was beaten, she invites him to her house where her mother, Danielle, fixes him supper. Danielle tells Ben that Alex views him as a father, and Ben begins to cry. Ben waits outside the chapel where the Oceanic survivors plan to move on together, and he sees Locke for the last time. Ben sincerely apologizes to Locke for killing him, and Locke forgives him. Hurley later comes out of the chapel and invites Ben in, but Ben politely declines saying he is not ready to move on, saying he \"has a few things to work out\". Hurley accepts this, and tells Ben that he was a \"real good number two\", thanking him for his help in protecting the island. Ben, touched by this, responds \"And you were a great number one, Hugo.\"\n\n==Personality==\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = \"That's what my father does \u2013 he manipulates people.

Ben was the leader of a group of island natives called the [[Others (Lost)|Others]] and was initially known as '''Henry Gale''' to the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815.  He began as the main [[antagonist]] during the second and third seasons, but in subsequent seasons, becomes a morally ambiguous ally to the main characters. Other characters frequently describe him as loyal only to himself, though it is also often hinted that he may be driven by some higher purpose.\n\n<!--Out of universe character development summary-->As with most characters on ''Lost'', Ben's history is revealed through flashbacks and episodes set in other time periods which are revealed slowly as the series progresses. [[Sterling Beaumon]] first portrayed a young Ben late in season three, in the character's first centric episode, \"[[The Man Behind the Curtain]]\". Ben's childhood is further explored in the [[Lost (season 5)|fifth season]] of the series, partially set in 1977. Fifth season episode \"[[Dead Is Dead]]\" explores Ben's fragile state following the events of the [[Lost (season 4)|fourth season]], in which his loyalty to the island led to the death of his adoptive daughter [[Alex Rousseau]] ([[Tania Raymonde]]), and flashbacks show the audience Ben's original acquisition of Alex and his rise to leadership of the Others, after exiling his rival [[Charles Widmore]] ([[Alan Dale]]). Originally cast for three guest appearances in the second season, Emerson's role was expanded. As leader of the Others, Ben became a regular cast member from the [[Lost (season 3)|third season]] onward. Reviews of the show would often focus on Ben's mysterious motives. Emerson's portrayal garnered many positive reviews, resulting in nominations for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor]] year-on-year from 2007 to 2010, winning in 2009.\n\nIn 2010, Ben Linus was ranked #24 on the [[TV Guide Network]] special ''25 Greatest TV Characters of All Time''.<ref>{{Cite AV media|type=TV production\n | title = 25 Greatest TV Characters of All Time\n | publisher = [[TV Guide Network]]\n | airdate = September 19, 2010\n | language = English\n}}</ref> In 2016, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him #1 of their \"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/40-greatest-tv-villains-of-all-time-20160209 |title=40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Sean T. |last=Collins |date=February 9, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427201150/http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/lists/40-greatest-tv-villains-of-all-time-20160209 |archive-date=April 27, 2016 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Arc==\n===Prior to the crash===\nFlashbacks during \"[[The Man Behind the Curtain]]\" show Benjamin Linus being born in the woods outside of [[Portland, Oregon]], to [[Characters of Lost#Dharma Initiative members|Roger]] ([[Jon Gries]]) and Emily Linus ([[Carrie Preston]]). Emily dies after giving birth to Ben. When Ben is young, he and his father move to the Island, after Roger is offered a job working for the [[Dharma Initiative]]. On the Island, Ben begins to see visions of his mother, while Roger starts drinking heavily and [[Physical abuse|physically]] and [[Verbal abuse|verbally abusing]] him. Ben develops a hatred for the Dharma Initiative and one day runs away from the Barracks. He comes across [[Richard Alpert (Lost)|Richard Alpert]] ([[Nestor Carbonell]]), one of the Island natives known to the Initiative as the \"Hostiles\", in the jungle, who grants Ben's request to join his group but tells him he needs to be very patient.<ref name = \"The Man Behind the Curtain\"/>\n\nSeason five's \"[[Namaste (Lost)|Namaste]]\" shows a young Ben coming into contact with a captured [[Sayid Jarrah]] ([[Naveen Andrews]]), who along with several other Oceanic Flight 815 survivors has been brought back in time from 2007. In the following episode, \"[[He's Our You]]\", he helps free Sayid under the impression Sayid was sent by the Others to bring him to Richard. Sayid instead shoots Ben and leaves him for dead. Fellow crash survivor [[Jack Shephard]] ([[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]]) refuses to help the boy, so [[Kate Austen]] ([[Evangeline Lilly]]) and [[James \"Sawyer\" Ford]] ([[Josh Holloway]]) take Ben to Richard, who informs them Ben will henceforth lose his innocence and always be one of the Others.

He gets Locke to reveal what he knows about returning to the island, then kills him and stages it as a suicide. Ben visits Jack in the funeral home housing Locke's body, telling Jack he will help him return to the island, but the only way to get back is to bring everyone who had left it, including Locke's corpse. Ben boards Ajira Airways Flight 316 with the rest of survivors, which then crashes on the island. Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid are transported to 1977, while Sun and Ben remain in 2007 with a resurrected Locke. The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him in the back of the head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including Locke. After Ben regains consciousness and finds Locke to be alive, he convinces Locke he knew bringing him to the island would resurrect him, and he stopped Locke's suicide attempt merely to gain information. Locke travels with Ben, who is to be judged by the Monster. After they fail to find the Monster at the Barracks, they head to the Temple. As Ben and Locke travel through a series of tunnels beneath the Temple, Ben falls through the floor, so Locke leaves to get something that he can pull him up with. The Monster flows out of a grate below and surrounds Ben, showing flashes of decisions he made in his life involving Alex. The Monster takes the form of Alex and pushes Ben against a wall. She says she knows Ben is planning to kill Locke again, and if he does she will hunt him down and destroy him. She orders him to follow Locke and do whatever he asks, then disappears. They return to the Others' camp, where Locke gathers the group together and announces he is taking them to see Jacob.<ref>\"Follow the Leader\". Stephen Willams. Writ.

No. 15, season 5</ref> As they are walking, Ben relates his experience with the Monster and his promise to do whatever Locke asks, so Locke convinces Ben to kill Jacob.<ref>The Incident, Part 2</ref> Richard leads them to the base of the statue, where Jacob lives. Within, they are met by Jacob ([[Mark Pellegrino]]). Jacob greets Locke and observes Locke has found a loophole. It is revealed that Locke was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of Locke. Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him \u2013 and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.\n\nAfter Jacob's death, the Monster tells Ben to fetch Richard, as he wants to speak to him. However, when Ben exits the statue, Richard throws him down beside the corpse of the real John Locke, which has been brought to the statue by survivors of the Ajira flight, led by [[Ilana Verdansky]] ([[Zuleikha Robinson]]). Ben is forced by Ilana's group to bring them to the imposter Locke. They start shooting at the Monster, but he disappears, then returns in its black smoke form, killing Ilana's group. The Monster returns to Locke's form and mockingly informs Ben of the real Locke's last thoughts, while being strangled by Ben. Afterwards, Ben comforts Ilana when he finds her crying in Jacob's chamber and sets off with her, Sun, and [[Frank Lapidus]] ([[Jeff Fahey]]) to bury Locke before going to the Temple, where they believe they will be safe from the Monster. At Locke's funeral, Ben provides the eulogy, and expresses his sincere apologies for killing Locke. When they arrive at the Temple, the Monster is destroying the place. They return to the beach as a temporary shelter, and Ben attempts to make amends with everyone for killing Jacob. Ilana then forces him to dig a grave and explains she will kill Ben for murdering her [[father figure]]. Later, the Monster visits Ben, telling him to join him and then magically frees Ben. After Ben escapes, Ilana chases after him, and the two come face-to-face at the jungle when Ben points a rifle at her. Ben explains to her why he really killed Jacob, particularly grieving his [[Alex Rousseau|daughter]]. Ilana understands and allows him to rejoin their group, which he does. Hurley, Jack, and Richard show up and join their group, then have a meeting, deciding what to do next. Richard suggests they should stop the Monster escaping by blowing up the Ajira plane. After Hurley destroys the available dynamite from the shipwrecked ''Black Rock'', Richard insists he will find other explosives. Ben and Miles join Richard, while the rest decide to go talk to the Monster. When Ben, Richard and Miles arrive at the Barracks, Widmore is there, and is soon joined by the Monster. Ben murders Widmore before he is able to make a deal with the Monster to spare his daughter. The Monster and Ben find Desmond and the Monster forces him to go destroy the Island. They run into Jack's group and they both go to the heart of the Island, where Desmond removes the cork of the Island, causing the Island to begin collapsing. After Jack kills the Monster, Ben and Hurley volunteer to stay behind on the Island with Jack to assist him relighting the Island. Jack tells them he will die doing this and Jack gives Hurley the new position of being protector of the Island. Ben advises him to approach his Island duties with his kindness and helpful attitude. Hurley asks Ben to become his advisor, to which he is honored. After an undisclosed period of time, Ben, on orders from Hurley, arrives at the Dharma Logistics Warehouse in Guam. He speaks to the two workers there and instructs them that the facility is being shut down. Afterward, Ben arrives at the Santa Rosa Mental Hospital and visits Walt. Ben tells him that he is still special and that he can help his father, Michael, even though he is dead, and offers Walt a job to return to the island.\n\nThe afterlife experienced by the survivors is shown during season six. In \"[[The Substitute (Lost)|The Substitute]]\", Ben Linus is shown as a teacher of [[European History]]. In \"[[Dr. Linus]]\", Ben laments his life in general, frustrated with the school bureaucracy and particularly due to Reynolds, the principal who does not care for the school. He is living with his father, Roger ([[Jon Gries]]), who is on [[life support]]. At school, he is shown to have a close relationship with his star pupil, [[Alex Rousseau|Alex]], and befriends a substitute teacher, [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]]. While studying together, Alex tells Ben that Principal Reynolds is having a sexual affair with one of the school nurses on campus.  Ben attempts to blackmail Reynolds, threatening to reveal his [[substantial truth|affair]] and citing his position as principal as the demand. However, Reynolds swiftly retaliates by saying if he makes good on his threats, Alex's chances of going to [[Yale University]] will decrease substantially, as he is requested to write her a [[recommendation letter]]. Wanting to save Alex's educational future, Ben backs down. Days later, Ben notices [[Desmond Hume]] waiting outside the school in his car for an extended amount of time. Desmond runs over Locke, and swiftly drives off. As soon as the ambulance arrives, Ben gets in and sits next to the critically injured Locke, assuring him everything will be all right. When Locke returns to the school, Desmond does as well, and Ben catches him. Desmond beats Ben severely saying he was only trying to help Locke let go. Ben has a vision from his previous life during Desmond's beating. Ben believes him and relays Locke this information. When Alex sees how badly Ben was beaten, she invites him to her house where her mother, Danielle, fixes him supper. Danielle tells Ben that Alex views him as a father, and Ben begins to cry. Ben waits outside the chapel where the Oceanic survivors plan to move on together, and he sees Locke for the last time. Ben sincerely apologizes to Locke for killing him, and Locke forgives him. Hurley later comes out of the chapel and invites Ben in, but Ben politely declines saying he is not ready to move on, saying he \"has a few things to work out\". Hurley accepts this, and tells Ben that he was a \"real good number two\", thanking him for his help in protecting the island. Ben, touched by this, responds \"And you were a great number one, Hugo.\"\n\n==Personality==\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = \"That's what my father does \u2013 he manipulates people.

The language is mainly spoken by the [[Achomi people]], but also by some [[Huwala]]. The majority of Achomi people are Sunni Muslims.\n\n== History ==\nThe Achomi language can be considered a descendant of the Sassanid Persian language or [[Middle Persian]].<ref>\u06af\u0648\u064a\u0634 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0648\u0632. \u0646\u0633\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0641 \u067e\u0648\u0631 \u0648 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0631\u0641\u064a\u0639 \u0636\u064a\u0627\u064a\u0649 1396</ref>\n\n== In Eastern Arabia (Arab states of the Persian Gulf) ==\nIranian people who have migrated from southern Iran to the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] at the early 20th century still speak this language in their homes, however, this variety has been somewhat influenced by the [[Arabic|Arabic language]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nSpeakers of Achomi dialects in Iran that come from different towns might also find some variations in some words and may differ slightly in grammar and particularly in accent. Hence, if the speaker is from [[Evaz]], they are referred as speaking Evazi, and if they are from Bastak their dialect is known as Bastaki.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Accents and variations of Achomi ==\nSince the Achomi region is widespread, there are different Achomi accents and some slight differences in grammar. For example, in some places people say ''raftom'' for \"I went\" (very similar to the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''raftam''), but in some other places like Lar people say ''chedem'' instead (Kurdish: ''dichim'' or ''dechim)''.\n\n=== Examples of Achomi (bedeshare accent) ===\n\n=== Verbs ===\n\nTo make simple past verbs\n:\n\nThe ids (om / ot / osh / mo / tosho) + The simple past root of the first type\n\nExample:\n\nOmgot: I said\n\noshbu: win\n\nTokha: You ate\n\nAnd ...\n\nThe root of the past simple second type + ids (am / esh / ruleless / em / eh / et)\nExample:\n\nChedam: a to be shortened! I went\n\nKhatesh: Sleep\n\n\u00a0bodem: we got\n\nAnd...\n\n===== Passive =====\nTo create a passive verb in past tense we can use the verb root plus its proper prefix. For example, in Achomi (Lari), the root for the verb \"to tell\" is ''got'' (''gota'' equals \"tell\").\n\nomgot (om+got), Kurdish (migot or min got) = I told ...\n\notgot (om+got), Kurdish (tugot or tegot) = You told...\n\noshgot (osh+got), Kurdish (wigot) = He told...\n\nmogot (mo+got), Kurdish (megot) = We told...\n\ntogot (to+got), Kurdish pl (wegot) = You(pl) told\n\nshogot (sho+got), Kurdish (wa-n got) = They told\n\nAnother example: \"deda\" means \"see,\" and \"dee\" Kurdish (Deed or dee) is the root verb.

The language is mainly spoken by the [[Achomi people]], but also by some [[Huwala]]. The majority of Achomi people are Sunni Muslims.\n\n== History ==\nThe Achomi language can be considered a descendant of the Sassanid Persian language or [[Middle Persian]].<ref>\u06af\u0648\u064a\u0634 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0648\u0632. \u0646\u0633\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0641 \u067e\u0648\u0631 \u0648 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0631\u0641\u064a\u0639 \u0636\u064a\u0627\u064a\u0649 1396</ref>\n\n== In Eastern Arabia (Arab states of the Persian Gulf) ==\nIranian people who have migrated from southern Iran to the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] at the early 20th century still speak this language in their homes, however, this variety has been somewhat influenced by the [[Arabic|Arabic language]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nSpeakers of Achomi dialects in Iran that come from different towns might also find some variations in some words and may differ slightly in grammar and particularly in accent. Hence, if the speaker is from [[Evaz]], they are referred as speaking Evazi, and if they are from Bastak their dialect is known as Bastaki.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Accents and variations of Achomi ==\nSince the Achomi region is widespread, there are different Achomi accents and some slight differences in grammar. For example, in some places people say ''raftom'' for \"I went\" (very similar to the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''raftam''), but in some other places like Lar people say ''chedem'' instead (Kurdish: ''dichim'' or ''dechim)''.\n\n=== Examples of Achomi (bedeshare accent) ===\n\n=== Verbs ===\n\nTo make simple past verbs\n:\n\nThe ids (om / ot / osh / mo / tosho) + The simple past root of the first type\n\nExample:\n\nOmgot: I said\n\noshbu: win\n\nTokha: You ate\n\nAnd ...\n\nThe root of the past simple second type + ids (am / esh / ruleless / em / eh / et)\nExample:\n\nChedam: a to be shortened! I went\n\nKhatesh: Sleep\n\n\u00a0bodem: we got\n\nAnd...\n\n===== Passive =====\nTo create a passive verb in past tense we can use the verb root plus its proper prefix. For example, in Achomi (Lari), the root for the verb \"to tell\" is ''got'' (''gota'' equals \"tell\").\n\nomgot (om+got), Kurdish (migot or min got) = I told ...\n\notgot (om+got), Kurdish (tugot or tegot) = You told...\n\noshgot (osh+got), Kurdish (wigot) = He told...\n\nmogot (mo+got), Kurdish (megot) = We told...\n\ntogot (to+got), Kurdish pl (wegot) = You(pl) told\n\nshogot (sho+got), Kurdish (wa-n got) = They told\n\nAnother example: \"deda\" means \"see,\" and \"dee\" Kurdish (Deed or dee) is the root verb. So:\n\nomdee = I saw, Kurdish (mideed, midee, min deed, min dee)\n\notdee= you saw, Kurdish (tu-te dee)....\n\nTo create a simple present or continued present tense of a passive verb, here's another example:\n\nagota'em (a+got+aem):I am telling...\n\nagota'esh (a+got+aesh): You are telling...\n\nagotay (a+got+ay): He is telling...\n\nagota'am (a+got+a'am): We are telling...\n\nagotay (a+got+ay): You(pl) are telling...\n\nagota'en (a+got+a'en): They are telling...\n\nFor the verb \"see\" (\"deda\"):\n\nadead'em, adeda'esh, adeaday,...\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Iranian languages}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Southwestern Iranian languages]]\n[[Category:Languages of Iran]]\n", "name_user": "82.11.68.116", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achomi_language"}

AC/DC were signed to the same management company as Gary Moore, with whom Slade had just finished touring. The Young brothers ([[Angus Young|Angus]] and [[Malcolm Young|Malcolm]]) initially hired Slade only temporarily through management, then asked him\u2013during the recording of the only album he made with them \u2013 to join the band. Slade played on ''[[The Razors Edge (AC/DC album)|The Razors Edge]]'' album in 1990 and the accompanying world tour, and the \"[[Big Gun]]\" single released in 1993. According to Slade, after working on demos for the following album, ''[[Ballbreaker]]'', [[Malcolm Young]] called Slade and told him they wanted to try a reunion with former drummer [[Phil Rudd]]. Slade replied, \"That's me out then, I'm gone.\" Young said that he wanted to keep Slade on hand if Rudd's return did not work out, but Slade refused. However he made statements that he still got on well with AC/DC and \"it was an honour and a privilege to play with those guys\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/drums/chris-slade-on-ac-dc-tom-jones-jimmy-page-gary-numan-and-more-603830#null|title=Chris Slade on AC/DC, Tom Jones, Jimmy Page, Gary Numan, and more|date=21 July 2014|accessdate=23 July 2014|publisher=Music Radar}}</ref>\n\nAfter his departure Slade spent a few years living in the UK countryside, before receiving a call from [[Geoff Downes]] of the British [[progressive rock]] group [[Asia (band)|Asia]].

Harvard University Press.</ref>\n\nThe POS is often used as evidence for [[universal grammar]]. This is the idea that all languages conform to the same structural principles, which define the space of possible languages. Both poverty of the stimulus and universal grammar are terms that can be credited to [[Noam Chomsky]], the main proponent of [[generative grammar]]. Chomsky coined the term \"poverty of the stimulus\" in 1980. However, he had argued for the idea since his [[Verbal Behavior#Chomsky's review|1959 review of B.F. Skinner's ''Verbal Behavior'']].\n\nThere was much research based on generative grammar in [[language development]] during the latter half of the twentieth century. This research was partially abandoned by the linguistics field as a result of what some scientists perceived as the problems with the Poverty of the Stimulus argument.<ref name=Fernald&Marchman_2006>{{cite book |last1=Fernald |first1=Anne| last2=Marchman |first2=Virginia A. |editor-last= Traxler and Gernsbacher |title= Handbook of Psycholinguistics |publisher=Academic Press |date=2006 |pages=1027\u20141071 |chapter= 27: Language learning in infancy |isbn= 9780080466415 }}</ref><ref name=DeBot_2015>{{cite book |last=de Bot |first=Kees |year=2015| title=A History of Applied Linguistics: From 1980 to the Present |publisher=Routledge |url= |pages= |isbn= 9781138820654 |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==The form of the argument==\nAn argument from the poverty of the stimulus generally takes the following structure:<ref name=\"PullumScholz2002\" /><ref>Fodor, J.A.

This idea is closely related to what Chomsky calls \"[[Plato's Problem]]\". He outlined this [[philosophical]] approach in the first chapter of the ''Knowledge of Language'' in 1986.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I6CZ6wpNKeEC&pg=PA42&dq=plato's+problem#v=onepage&q=plato's%20problem&f=true|title=The Cambridge Companion to Chomsky|author=James McGilvray|date=2005-02-24|page=42|accessdate=2016-01-21|via=Books.google.com|isbn=9780521784313}}</ref> Plato's Problem traces back to ''[[Meno]]'', a [[Socratic dialogue]].

Chomsky illustrates that humans are not exposed to all structures of their language, yet they fully achieve knowledge of these structures.\n\nLinguistic nativism is the theory that humans are born with some knowledge of language. One acquires a language not entirely through experience. According to Noam Chomsky,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=N|title=Language and the problems of knowledge|date=1988|publisher=MIT Press|page=24}}</ref> \"The speed and precision of vocabulary acquisition leaves no real alternative to the conclusion that the child somehow has the concepts available before experience with language and is basically learning labels for concepts that are already a part of his or her conceptual apparatus.\" One of the most significant arguments generative grammarians have for linguistic nativism is the poverty of the stimulus argument.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09515080802412321|title=Language Learning in Infancy: Does the Empirical Evidence Support a Domain Specific Language Acquisition Device?|journal=Philosophical Psychology|volume=21|issue=5|pages=641\u2013671|year=2008|last1=Behme|first1=Christina|last2=Deacon|first2=S.

Nativism Reconsidered|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\nGenerative Grammarians have extensively studied the hypothesised innate effects on language in order to provide evidence for Poverty of the Stimulus. An overarching theme in examples is that children acquire grammatical rules based on evidence that is consistent with multiple generalizations. And since children are not instructed in the grammar of their language, the gap must be filled in by properties of the learner.\n\n===Syntax===\n====Binding theory \u2013 Principle C====\n# While he was dancing, the Ninja Turtle ate pizza.\n# He ate pizza while the Ninja Turtle was dancing.\nIn general, pronouns can refer to any prominent individual in the discourse context. However, a pronoun cannot find its antecedent in certain structural positions, as defined by the [[Binding (linguistics)|Binding Theory]]. For example, the pronoun \"he\" can refer to the Ninja Turtle in (1) but not (2), above. Given that speech to children does not indicate what interpretations are impossible, the input is equally consistent with a grammar that allows coreference between \"he\" and \"the Ninja Turtle\" in (2) and one that does not. But, since all speakers of English recognize that (2) does not allow this coreference, this aspect of the grammar must come from some property internal to the learner.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Passives====\n# I believe the dog to be hungry\n# The dog is believed to be hungry\n# I believe the dog's owner to be hungry.\n# The dog's owner is believed to be hungry.\n# * The dog is believed's owner to be hungry.\nThe sentences in (1) and (2) illustrate the [[English passive voice|active-passive alternation in English]]. The Noun Phrase after the verb in the active (1) is the subject in the passive (2). Data like (2) would be compatible with a passive rule stated in terms of linear order (move the 1st NP after the verb) or syntactic structure (move the highest NP after the verb). The data in (3-5) illustrate that the actual rule is formulated in terms of structure. If it were stated in terms of linear order, then (4) would be ungrammatical and (5) would be grammatical. But the opposite is true. However, children may not be exposed to sentences like (3-5) as evidence in favor of the correct grammar. Thus, the fact that all adult speakers agree that (4) is grammatical and (5) is not suggests that the linear rule was never even considered and that children are predisposed to a structure based grammatical system.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Anaphoric \"one\"====\nThe English word \"one\" can refer back to a previously mentioned property in the discourse. For example in (1), \"one\" can mean \"ball\". \n# I like this ball and you like that one. \n# I like this red ball and you like that one. \nIn (2), one is interpreted as \"red ball.\" However, even if a speaker intends (2) in this way, it would be difficult to distinguish that interpretation from one in which \"one\" simply meant \"ball\". This is because when a speaker refers to a red ball, they are also referring to a ball since the set of red balls is a subset of balls in general. 18-month-olds, like adults, show that they believe 'one' refers to 'red ball' and not 'ball'.<ref name=\"Infants\">{{cite journal|last1=Lidz|first1=J.|last2=Freedman|first2=J.|last3=Waxman|first3=S.|date=October 2003|title=What infants know about syntax but couldn't have learned: experimental evidence for syntactic structure at 18 months|journal=Cognition|volume=89|pages=295\u2013303|number=3|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00116-1}}</ref> The evidence available to children is systematically ambiguous between a grammar in which \"one\" refers back to Nouns and one in which \"one\" refers back to noun phrases. Despite this ambiguity, children learn the more narrow interpretation, suggesting that some property other than the input is responsible for their interpretations.\n\n====Island effects====\nIn Wh-questions, the Wh-word at the beginning of the sentence (the filler) is related to a position later in the sentence (the gap). This relation can hold over an unbounded distance, as in (1). However, there are restrictions on the gap positions that a filler can be related to. These restrictions are called [[Wh-movement#Extraction islands|syntactic islands]] (2). Because questions with islands are ungrammatical, they are not included in the speech that children hear\u2014but neither are grammatical Wh-questions that span multiple clauses. Because the speech children are exposed to is consistent with grammars which have island constraints and grammars which don't, something internal to the child must contribute this knowledge.\n#What did you claim that Jack bought _ ?\n#<nowiki>*What did you make the claim that Jack bought _ ? (Complex Noun Phrase Island)</nowiki>\n\n=== Phonology ===\n==== Learning stress systems ====\nBergelson & Idsardi (2009) presented adults with words drawn from an artificial language.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Bergelson E|author2=Idsardi WJ|date=2009|title=Structural biases in phonology: infant and adult evidence from artificial language learning.|url=http://174.143.211.73/~idsardi/papers/2009bucld.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd BUCLD|volume=33|pages=85\u201396}}</ref> The words contained 3 CV syllables. If the last vowel was long, then it bore [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Otherwise, stress fell on the first syllable. This pattern is consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, a long vowel bears stress if it is the last segment in the word. This is a rule based on absolute finality. In the other grammar, a long vowel bears stress only if it is the last vowel in the word (i.e., even if it is not the last segment of the word). This is a rule based on relative finality. In natural languages stress rules make reference to relative finality but not to absolute finality. After being exposed to these words, participants were then tested to see whether they thought that a word with a long vowel in a closed syllable (CVVC) would bear stress. If it did, then that would be consistent with the relative-final grammar, but not with the absolute-final grammar. English-speaking adults (tested through computer software) were more likely to accept the words from the relative-final grammar than from the absolute-final grammar. Since the data they were exposed to was equally consistent with both grammars, and since neither rule is a rule of English, the source of this decision must have come from the participants, not from any aspect of their experience. In addition, eighth-month-old children (tested via the [[Statistical language acquisition#Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP)|Headturn Preference Procedure]]) were found to have the same preference as adults. Given that this preference could not have come from their exposure to either the artificial language or to their native language, the researchers concluded that human language acquisition mechanisms are \"hardwired\" to lead infants towards certain generalizations, consistent with the argument for the poverty of the stimulus.\n\n==== English plural marker ====\n\nHalle (1978)<ref name=\"Halle\" /> argues that the morphophonological rule governing the [[English plurals|English plural]] produces forms that are consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows one of the sounds [p, t, k, f, \u03b8]; otherwise it is pronounced as [z]. In the other grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows a voiceless consonant. These rules are exactly equal in their coverage of English since the set of consonants that triggers the [s] pronunciation is identical in the two cases. However, Halle also observes that English speakers consistently pluralize the German name ''Bach'' (pronounced ''/bax/'') as ''/baxs/'', despite not having any experience with the ''/x/'' sound, which is nonexistent in English. Since there is \"no indication\" that speakers could have acquired this knowledge, Halle argues that the tendency to build rules in terms of natural classes comes from a factor internal to the child and not from their experience.<ref name=\"Halle\">{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262580434_sch_0009.pdf|title=From Memory to Speech and Back: Papers on Phonetics and Phonology|last=Halle|first=Morris|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=294\u2013303}}</ref>\n\n=== Semantics ===\n\n==== Word learning ====\n\nThe poverty of the stimulus also applies in the domain of word learning. When learning a new word, children are exposed to examples of the word's referent, but not to the full extent of the category. For example, in learning the word \"dog\", a child might see a German Shepherd, a Great Dane and a Poodle. How do they know to extend this category to include Dachshunds and Bulldogs? The situations in which the word is used cannot provide the relevant information. Thus, something internal to learners must shape the way that they generalize. This problem is closely related to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s [[Indeterminacy of translation|gavagai]] problem.\n\n==== Attitude verbs ====\nIn other cases, words refer to aspects of the world that cannot be observed directly. For example [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]] poses a POS argument with respect to verbs that label mental states. She observes that a learner cannot see inside another person's mind, and so an utterance of \"Kim thinks that it is raining\" is likely to occur in the same kinds of [[context (language use)|context]]s as \"Kim wonders if it is raining\" or even \"Kim wants it to rain\". If no aspect of the context can determine whether a mental state verb refers to thinkings, wanting or wonderings, then some aspect of children's minds must direct their attention to other cues. Thus, our ability to learn these word meanings must be shaped by factors internal to the child and not simply from the conditions of their use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila

This idea is closely related to what Chomsky calls \"[[Plato's Problem]]\".

An overarching theme in examples is that children acquire grammatical rules based on evidence that is consistent with multiple generalizations. And since children are not instructed in the grammar of their language, the gap must be filled in by properties of the learner.\n\n===Syntax===\n====Binding theory \u2013 Principle C====\n# While he was dancing, the Ninja Turtle ate pizza.\n# He ate pizza while the Ninja Turtle was dancing.\nIn general, pronouns can refer to any prominent individual in the discourse context. However, a pronoun cannot find its antecedent in certain structural positions, as defined by the [[Binding (linguistics)|Binding Theory]]. For example, the pronoun \"he\" can refer to the Ninja Turtle in (1) but not (2), above. Given that speech to children does not indicate what interpretations are impossible, the input is equally consistent with a grammar that allows coreference between \"he\" and \"the Ninja Turtle\" in (2) and one that does not. But, since all speakers of English recognize that (2) does not allow this coreference, this aspect of the grammar must come from some property internal to the learner.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Passives====\n# I believe the dog to be hungry\n# The dog is believed to be hungry\n# I believe the dog's owner to be hungry.\n# The dog's owner is believed to be hungry.\n# * The dog is believed's owner to be hungry.\nThe sentences in (1) and (2) illustrate the [[English passive voice|active-passive alternation in English]]. The Noun Phrase after the verb in the active (1) is the subject in the passive (2). Data like (2) would be compatible with a passive rule stated in terms of linear order (move the 1st NP after the verb) or syntactic structure (move the highest NP after the verb). The data in (3-5) illustrate that the actual rule is formulated in terms of structure. If it were stated in terms of linear order, then (4) would be ungrammatical and (5) would be grammatical. But the opposite is true. However, children may not be exposed to sentences like (3-5) as evidence in favor of the correct grammar. Thus, the fact that all adult speakers agree that (4) is grammatical and (5) is not suggests that the linear rule was never even considered and that children are predisposed to a structure based grammatical system.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Anaphoric \"one\"====\nThe English word \"one\" can refer back to a previously mentioned property in the discourse. For example in (1), \"one\" can mean \"ball\". \n# I like this ball and you like that one. \n# I like this red ball and you like that one. \nIn (2), one is interpreted as \"red ball.\" However, even if a speaker intends (2) in this way, it would be difficult to distinguish that interpretation from one in which \"one\" simply meant \"ball\". This is because when a speaker refers to a red ball, they are also referring to a ball since the set of red balls is a subset of balls in general. 18-month-olds, like adults, show that they believe 'one' refers to 'red ball' and not 'ball'.<ref name=\"Infants\">{{cite journal|last1=Lidz|first1=J.|last2=Freedman|first2=J.|last3=Waxman|first3=S.|date=October 2003|title=What infants know about syntax but couldn't have learned: experimental evidence for syntactic structure at 18 months|journal=Cognition|volume=89|pages=295\u2013303|number=3|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00116-1}}</ref> The evidence available to children is systematically ambiguous between a grammar in which \"one\" refers back to Nouns and one in which \"one\" refers back to noun phrases. Despite this ambiguity, children learn the more narrow interpretation, suggesting that some property other than the input is responsible for their interpretations.\n\n====Island effects====\nIn Wh-questions, the Wh-word at the beginning of the sentence (the filler) is related to a position later in the sentence (the gap). This relation can hold over an unbounded distance, as in (1). However, there are restrictions on the gap positions that a filler can be related to. These restrictions are called [[Wh-movement#Extraction islands|syntactic islands]] (2). Because questions with islands are ungrammatical, they are not included in the speech that children hear\u2014but neither are grammatical Wh-questions that span multiple clauses. Because the speech children are exposed to is consistent with grammars which have island constraints and grammars which don't, something internal to the child must contribute this knowledge.\n#What did you claim that Jack bought _ ?\n#<nowiki>*What did you make the claim that Jack bought _ ? (Complex Noun Phrase Island)</nowiki>\n\n=== Phonology ===\n==== Learning stress systems ====\nBergelson & Idsardi (2009) presented adults with words drawn from an artificial language.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Bergelson E|author2=Idsardi WJ|date=2009|title=Structural biases in phonology: infant and adult evidence from artificial language learning.|url=http://174.143.211.73/~idsardi/papers/2009bucld.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd BUCLD|volume=33|pages=85\u201396}}</ref> The words contained 3 CV syllables. If the last vowel was long, then it bore [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Otherwise, stress fell on the first syllable. This pattern is consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, a long vowel bears stress if it is the last segment in the word. This is a rule based on absolute finality. In the other grammar, a long vowel bears stress only if it is the last vowel in the word (i.e., even if it is not the last segment of the word). This is a rule based on relative finality. In natural languages stress rules make reference to relative finality but not to absolute finality. After being exposed to these words, participants were then tested to see whether they thought that a word with a long vowel in a closed syllable (CVVC) would bear stress. If it did, then that would be consistent with the relative-final grammar, but not with the absolute-final grammar. English-speaking adults (tested through computer software) were more likely to accept the words from the relative-final grammar than from the absolute-final grammar. Since the data they were exposed to was equally consistent with both grammars, and since neither rule is a rule of English, the source of this decision must have come from the participants, not from any aspect of their experience. In addition, eighth-month-old children (tested via the [[Statistical language acquisition#Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP)|Headturn Preference Procedure]]) were found to have the same preference as adults. Given that this preference could not have come from their exposure to either the artificial language or to their native language, the researchers concluded that human language acquisition mechanisms are \"hardwired\" to lead infants towards certain generalizations, consistent with the argument for the poverty of the stimulus.\n\n==== English plural marker ====\n\nHalle (1978)<ref name=\"Halle\" /> argues that the morphophonological rule governing the [[English plurals|English plural]] produces forms that are consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows one of the sounds [p, t, k, f, \u03b8]; otherwise it is pronounced as [z]. In the other grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows a voiceless consonant. These rules are exactly equal in their coverage of English since the set of consonants that triggers the [s] pronunciation is identical in the two cases. However, Halle also observes that English speakers consistently pluralize the German name ''Bach'' (pronounced ''/bax/'') as ''/baxs/'', despite not having any experience with the ''/x/'' sound, which is nonexistent in English. Since there is \"no indication\" that speakers could have acquired this knowledge, Halle argues that the tendency to build rules in terms of natural classes comes from a factor internal to the child and not from their experience.<ref name=\"Halle\">{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262580434_sch_0009.pdf|title=From Memory to Speech and Back: Papers on Phonetics and Phonology|last=Halle|first=Morris|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=294\u2013303}}</ref>\n\n=== Semantics ===\n\n==== Word learning ====\n\nThe poverty of the stimulus also applies in the domain of word learning. When learning a new word, children are exposed to examples of the word's referent, but not to the full extent of the category. For example, in learning the word \"dog\", a child might see a German Shepherd, a Great Dane and a Poodle. How do they know to extend this category to include Dachshunds and Bulldogs? The situations in which the word is used cannot provide the relevant information. Thus, something internal to learners must shape the way that they generalize. This problem is closely related to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s [[Indeterminacy of translation|gavagai]] problem.\n\n==== Attitude verbs ====\nIn other cases, words refer to aspects of the world that cannot be observed directly. For example [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]] poses a POS argument with respect to verbs that label mental states. She observes that a learner cannot see inside another person's mind, and so an utterance of \"Kim thinks that it is raining\" is likely to occur in the same kinds of [[context (language use)|context]]s as \"Kim wonders if it is raining\" or even \"Kim wants it to rain\". If no aspect of the context can determine whether a mental state verb refers to thinkings, wanting or wonderings, then some aspect of children's minds must direct their attention to other cues. Thus, our ability to learn these word meanings must be shaped by factors internal to the child and not simply from the conditions of their use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Nappa|first3=Rebecca|last4=Papafragou|first4=Anna|last5=Trueswell|first5=John C.|date=2005-01-01|title=Hard Words|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23\u201364|doi=10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|issn=1547-5441}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nCritics demonstrated in the 1980s and 1990s that Chomsky's purported linguistic evidence for poverty of the stimulus may have been false.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Pullum|first1=GK|last2=Scholz |first2=BC |date=2002|title=Empirical assessment of stimulus poverty arguments |url= http://www.ucd.ie/artspgs/research/pullum.pdf|journal=The Linguistic Review |volume=18|issue=1\u20142|pages= 9\u201450 |doi=10.1515/tlir.19.1-2.9|access-date=2020-02-28 }}</ref> Around the same time there was research in [[applied linguistics]] and [[neuroscience]] that rejected the idea of languages being innate and not learned.<ref name=Fernald&Marchman_2006 /> These developments led to the abandonment of innatism by the mainstream child [[language acquisition]] community, with [[generative grammar]] being pushed into the margins.<ref name=DeBot_2015 /> According to some professionals, decades of research were wasted between 1964 and 2014 owing to the assumption of the poverty of the stimulus;
