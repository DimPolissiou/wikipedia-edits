Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.

South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

After teaching psychology at [[Harvard University]], he returned to Canada in 1998 to become a faculty member in the psychology department at the University of Toronto. He later became a full professor. Peterson's first book, ''[[Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief]]'' (1999), examined several academic fields to describe the structure of systems of beliefs and myths, their role in the regulation of emotion, creation of [[Meaning (psychology)|meaning]], and several other topics such as motivation for [[genocide]]{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}. His second book, ''[[12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos]]'', was published in January 2018 and became a bestseller in several countries.\n\nIn 2016, Peterson released a series of [[YouTube]] videos criticizing [[political correctness]] and the Canadian government's [[An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code|Bill C-16]], \"An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code\". The act added \"[[gender identity]] and [[gender expression|expression]]\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination,{{efn-la|The phrase \"a prohibited ground of discrimination\" means that it is illegal to discriminate against an individual or groups of people {{em|on the grounds of}} (based on) race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, etc.}} which Peterson characterised as an example of [[compelled speech]].

He is also an author, produces YouTube videos and podcasts, and has outspoken views on gender identity and masculinity.\n\nPeterson has bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the University of Alberta and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from [[McGill University]]. After teaching psychology at [[Harvard University]], he returned to Canada in 1998 to become a faculty member in the psychology department at the University of Toronto. He later became a full professor. Peterson's first book, ''[[Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief]]'' (1999), examined several academic fields to describe the structure of systems of beliefs and myths, their role in the regulation of emotion, creation of [[Meaning (psychology)|meaning]], and several other topics such as motivation for [[genocide]]{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}. His second book, ''[[12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos]]'', was published in January 2018 and became a bestseller in several countries.\n\nIn 2016, Peterson released a series of [[YouTube]] videos criticizing [[political correctness]] and the Canadian government's [[An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code|Bill C-16]], \"An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code\". The act added \"[[gender identity]] and [[gender expression|expression]]\" as a prohibited ground of discrimination,{{efn-la|The phrase \"a prohibited ground of discrimination\" means that it is illegal to discriminate against an individual or groups of people {{em|on the grounds of}} (based on) race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, etc.}} which Peterson characterised as an example of [[compelled speech]]. He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism. \n\nIn 2019 and 2020, Peterson sought treatment for a physical dependence on [[clonazepam]] and experienced complications that led him to become incapacitated.\n\n== Early life ==\nPeterson was born on June 12, 1962.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/pg/drjordanpeterson/about/ \"About\"], Peterson's official Facebook page</ref> He grew up in [[Fairview, Alberta|Fairview]], [[Alberta]], a small town northwest of his birthplace ([[Edmonton]]).<ref name=\":0\">[[Nellie Bowles|Bowles, Nellie]] (May 18, 2018).

He left the program for the film industry, starring in films such as ''[[Taxi (2004 film)|Taxi]]'' (2004) and ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]'' (2005).\n\nFollowing his film career, Fallon returned to television as the host of ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on NBC studios in 2009, where he became well known for his emphasis on music and video games. He moved from that program to become the sixth permanent host of the long-running ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in 2014. In addition to his television work, Fallon has released two comedy albums and five books.\n\n==Early life==\nJames Thomas Fallon was born on September 19, 1974, in the [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, New York]], the son of Gloria (''n\u00e9e'' Feeley; 1949\u20132017) and James W.

Thomas Fallon''' (born September 19, 1974) is an American comedian, actor, television host, writer, and producer. He is known for his work in television as a [[cast member]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and as the host of [[late-night talk show]] ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' and before that ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]''. He grew up with an interest in comedy and music, moving to [[Los Angeles]] at 21 to pursue opportunities in [[stand-up comedy]].\n\nHe was commissioned to join [[NBC]]'s ''Saturday Night Live'' as a cast member in 1998, fulfilling a lifelong dream. Fallon remained on ''SNL'' for six years between 1998 and 2004, co-hosting the program's ''[[Weekend Update]]'' segment and becoming a celebrity in the process. He left the program for the film industry, starring in films such as ''[[Taxi (2004 film)|Taxi]]'' (2004) and ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]'' (2005).\n\nFollowing his film career, Fallon returned to television as the host of ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on NBC studios in 2009, where he became well known for his emphasis on music and video games. He moved from that program to become the sixth permanent host of the long-running ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in 2014.

During his time on the tribe, he was quickly attracted to fellow contestant Brenda Lowe, who became aware of his attraction and used it to her advantage, recruiting him and several others into an alliance. However, after La Flor won three of the first four tribal immunity challenges, the tribes were blended and Rice ended up on the new version of the original \"older contestants\" tribe, Espada, while Lowe remained on the new version of the La Flor tribe. Rice and Lowe both ultimately made it to the merged group, Libertad, where their alliance successfully caused the eliminations of Alina Wilson and Marty Piombo, before turning on Lowe and eliminating her as a threat. Following Lowe's elimination, Rice continued with the alliance under new leader Matthew \"Sash\" Lenahan. After two contestants (NaOnka Mixon and \"Purple Kelly\" Shinn) quit, the alliance continued eliminating targets Ben \"Benry\" Henry, Jane Bright, Dan Lembo, and [[Holly Hoffman]], although Bright and Hoffman were members of the alliance. The alliance tried to eliminate [[Jud Birza|Jud \"Fabio\" Birza]] as a threat against the jury, but Birza managed to evade them by winning the last three consecutive immunities. Rice performed exceptionally well in the post-merge challenges, being on the winning team in two of the three team-oriented rewards, and winning the last two individual rewards. Eventually, Rice made it to the final three with Lenahan and Birza, where he had a chance to win the $1 million as \"Sole Survivor\".

During his time on the tribe, he was quickly attracted to fellow contestant Brenda Lowe, who became aware of his attraction and used it to her advantage, recruiting him and several others into an alliance. However, after La Flor won three of the first four tribal immunity challenges, the tribes were blended and Rice ended up on the new version of the original \"older contestants\" tribe, Espada, while Lowe remained on the new version of the La Flor tribe. Rice and Lowe both ultimately made it to the merged group, Libertad, where their alliance successfully caused the eliminations of Alina Wilson and Marty Piombo, before turning on Lowe and eliminating her as a threat. Following Lowe's elimination, Rice continued with the alliance under new leader Matthew \"Sash\" Lenahan. After two contestants (NaOnka Mixon and \"Purple Kelly\" Shinn) quit, the alliance continued eliminating targets Ben \"Benry\" Henry, Jane Bright, Dan Lembo, and [[Holly Hoffman]], although Bright and Hoffman were members of the alliance. The alliance tried to eliminate [[Jud Birza|Jud \"Fabio\" Birza]] as a threat against the jury, but Birza managed to evade them by winning the last three consecutive immunities. Rice performed exceptionally well in the post-merge challenges, being on the winning team in two of the three team-oriented rewards, and winning the last two individual rewards. Eventually, Rice made it to the final three with Lenahan and Birza, where he had a chance to win the $1 million as \"Sole Survivor\". In pleading his case to the jury, Rice claimed that he was being open about how he played the game, but was criticized both for his rash decisions and occasional indecisiveness, as well as being perceived as a follower under both Lowe and Lenahan.
