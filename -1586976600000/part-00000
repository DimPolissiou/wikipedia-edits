Washington State Park''' is a former [[state park]] near the community of [[Institute, West Virginia|Institute]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]]. The park was operated by the West Virginia Conservation Commission, Division of State Parks, from 1949 until the late 1950s.\n\nThe park was a day-use [[Picnic|picnic area]] located on {{convert|7.43|acres|0}} of [[secondary forest]] outside Institute, approximately {{convert|0.86|miles|km|1}} east of the [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] (now University) campus. The park was integrated shortly after the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in May 1954.\n\nThe land and the vicinity of this park were once part of a dense concentration of [[Adena culture|Late Adena]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Mound Builders|mounds]] and earthworks along the [[Kanawha River]], including the nearby Shawnee Reservation Mound. In the 18th century, the area became a part of a large land tract owned by [[George Washington]]. In 1853 [[Samuel I. Cabell]] purchased {{convert|967|acres|ha}} of the valley. He and his wife Mary Barnes Cabell (a [[freedman|freedwoman]]) operated a [[plantation]] near the park's location, and following the [[American Civil War]] his children and the plantation's freed slaves settled the community of Piney Grove. Under the provisions of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land-Grant Act]] of 1890, the [[West Virginia Legislature]] established the West Virginia Colored Institute for the education of African Americans in 1891. The institute opened at Piney Grove in 1892, and the town's name was changed to Institute. In 1949 the West Virginia Conservation Commission, Division of State Parks, opened Booker T. Washington State Park, which was named for African American educator and West Virginia native [[Booker T. Washington]]. Following the park's integration in 1954, it remained open as a day-use picnic area until the late 1950s. By 1959 Booker T. Washington State Park was no longer listed in that year's ''West Virginia Blue Book'' listing of state parks.\n\n== Geography and setting ==\nBooker T.

Washington State Park''' is a former [[state park]] near the community of [[Institute, West Virginia|Institute]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]]. The park was operated by the West Virginia Conservation Commission, Division of State Parks, from 1949 until the late 1950s.\n\nThe park was a day-use [[Picnic|picnic area]] located on {{convert|7.43|acres|0}} of [[secondary forest]] outside Institute, approximately {{convert|0.86|miles|km|1}} east of the [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] (now University) campus. The park was integrated shortly after the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in May 1954.\n\nThe land and the vicinity of this park were once part of a dense concentration of [[Adena culture|Late Adena]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Mound Builders|mounds]] and earthworks along the [[Kanawha River]], including the nearby Shawnee Reservation Mound. In the 18th century, the area became a part of a large land tract owned by [[George Washington]]. In 1853 [[Samuel I. Cabell]] purchased {{convert|967|acres|ha}} of the valley. He and his wife Mary Barnes Cabell (a [[freedman|freedwoman]]) operated a [[plantation]] near the park's location, and following the [[American Civil War]] his children and the plantation's freed slaves settled the community of Piney Grove. Under the provisions of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land-Grant Act]] of 1890, the [[West Virginia Legislature]] established the West Virginia Colored Institute for the education of African Americans in 1891. The institute opened at Piney Grove in 1892, and the town's name was changed to Institute. In 1949 the West Virginia Conservation Commission, Division of State Parks, opened Booker T. Washington State Park, which was named for African American educator and West Virginia native [[Booker T. Washington]]. Following the park's integration in 1954, it remained open as a day-use picnic area until the late 1950s. By 1959 Booker T. Washington State Park was no longer listed in that year's ''West Virginia Blue Book'' listing of state parks.\n\n== Geography and setting ==\nBooker T.

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012.

Indeed, cultural, ethnic, and religious differences between Anglos and Hispanics persisted in the decades after the Mexican War.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 36}}</ref> Although the episodes of ethnic violence were episodic,<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 133}}</ref> the historian Alonzo argues that \"Anglo superiority also served to rationalize the very common idea in Texas that it is no wrong to kill a Mexican and, worse still, that killing an ethnic Mexican was an act to be proud of.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 134}}</ref>\n\nIn his book about Gregorio Cortez's life, Am\u00e9rico Paredes highlights the role of the Texas Rangers division in exacerbating the cultural conflicts on the border due to their alleged violent methods.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|pages= 23-32}}</ref>. An antagonistic relationship between [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican-Americans]] has developed in Texas due to a cycle of revenge involving Bandit Gang, Texas Rangers and innocent [[Mexican-Americans]] collaterals victims.<ref>{{harvnb|Levario|2012|page= 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 132}}</ref> However, the role of the Texas Rangers in discrimination is a subject of historical controversy. On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Sometime in this period, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting land from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Escape to the Robledo ranch ===\n\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. After spending a couple of days at the Robledo ranch, authorities discovered Cortez's whereabouts and thus begun the Battle of Belmont.\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, he traveled close to the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] and made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his newfound horse jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. Suspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio.\n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The amount of money raised is unknown, however, the fund was largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]] and saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\".<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, many [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe first of Cortez's trials began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> waiting with anticipation to see Cortez sentenced to death. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. Though they originally claimed the murder to have been done by a Mrs. Robledo during the fight, Robledo was coaxed into testifying that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Sheriff of Gonzales County, Robert M. Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home, Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure, ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though Sanders later told the defense his story and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a rushed decision emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nThe criminalization of Cortez continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris, as they understood he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont which many witnesses denied.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 94}}</ref>. The [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] soon upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v.

Glover, who was killed during the pursuit. Efforts to have Cortez pardoned began with his incarceration and finally succeeded in 1913 when Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] issued him a conditional [[pardon]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> He was freed on July 14 of that year.\n\n== Post-prison life and death ==\n\nAfter his pardon in 1913, Cortez thanked those who helped secure his freedom, spent his later years in [[Nuevo Laredo, Mexico]], and joined the losing [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertist]] forces of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> After being wounded in the war, Cortez began living with one of his sons in [[Manor, Texas]] then later resided in [[Anson, Texas]].<ref>Brown, 150</ref><ref name= Deutsch2012>[https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/19510/cfch_Deutsch_GregorioCortez.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Deutsch, James I. 2012. \"Gregorio Cortez.\" in Great Lives from History: Latinos.]</ref>. Then on February 28, 1916, having been recently married for the third time to an assumed Esther Mart\u00ednez, Cortez died suddenly at the age of 40.<ref name=\"orozco\" /><ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />\n\nTo this day, the [[cause of death]] of Cortez is contested.

In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 175}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks.

''Am\u00e9rico Paredes.'']</ref>. The particularity of the work is that it constitutes a hybrid of genres. The first chapter and the third chapters are historical. In the first one, he retraces the social and political background of the former Spanish province of [[Nuevo Santander]] to explain the origin of ethnic tensions. In the third chapter, through extensive corpus sources (judicial reports, newspapers, and testimonies) he reconstructs in detail the whole life of Cortez. The second chapter could be classified as a study of regional folklore because he describes \"an idealized and formalized version of the legend.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 108}}</ref> In the second part of the book \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez, a Ballad of Border Conflict,\u201d Paredes provides a study of the narrative form of the corrido.

It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human. If you go too heavy on the racism, it makes it difficult to see them as people.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan Cortina]]\n* [[Joaquin Murietta]]\n* [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]\n* [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]\n* [[Manifest Destiny]]\n* [[Texas Ranger Division]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation|last= Alonzo |first= A.

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012.

On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Sometime in this period, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting land from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Escape to the Robledo ranch ===\n\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. After spending a couple of days at the Robledo ranch, authorities discovered Cortez's whereabouts and thus begun the Battle of Belmont.\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, he traveled close to the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] and made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his newfound horse jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. Suspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio.\n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The fund, largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]], saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\".<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, many [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe first of Cortez's trials began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> waiting with anticipation to see Cortez sentenced to death. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. Though they originally claimed the murder to have been done by a Mrs. Robledo during the fight, Robledo was coaxed into testifying that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Sheriff of Gonzales County, Robert M. Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home, Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure, ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though Sanders later told the defense his story and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a rushed decision emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nThe criminalization of Cortez continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris, as they understood he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont which many witnesses denied.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 94}}</ref>. The [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] soon upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v. State, 83 S.W. 812 (Tex. Crim.

Glover, who was killed during the pursuit. Efforts to have Cortez pardoned began with his incarceration and finally succeeded in 1913 when Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] issued him a conditional [[pardon]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> He was freed on July 14 of that year.\n\n== Post-prison life and death ==\n\nAfter his pardon in 1913, Cortez thanked those who helped secure his freedom, spent his later years in [[Nuevo Laredo, Mexico]], and joined the losing [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertist]] forces of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> After being wounded in the war, Cortez began living with one of his sons in [[Manor, Texas]] then later resided in [[Anson, Texas]].<ref>Brown, 150</ref><ref name= Deutsch2012>[https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/19510/cfch_Deutsch_GregorioCortez.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Deutsch, James I. 2012. \"Gregorio Cortez.\" in Great Lives from History: Latinos.]</ref>.

In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 175}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks.

''Am\u00e9rico Paredes.'']</ref>. The particularity of the work is that it constitutes a hybrid of genres. The first chapter and the third chapters are historical. In the first one, he retraces the social and political background of the former Spanish province of [[Nuevo Santander]] to explain the origin of ethnic tensions. In the third chapter, through extensive corpus sources (judicial reports, newspapers, and testimonies) he reconstructs in detail the whole life of Cortez. The second chapter could be classified as a study of regional folklore because he describes \"an idealized and formalized version of the legend.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 108}}</ref> In the second part of the book \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez, a Ballad of Border Conflict,\u201d Paredes provides a study of the narrative form of the corrido.

It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human.
