No, as in life, there's beauty in uncertainty.\" While praising Glover's songwriting and the features on ''3.15.20'', Jones criticized the production and vocals on a few of the album's tracks.<ref name=\"COS\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dean Van Nguyen acclaimed the album, saying that \"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levity.\" Nguyen further stated that the themes of the album fits to the present day insecurities with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], saying that \"The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n|headline = ''3.15.20'' track listing\n| title1 = 0.00\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.

No, as in life, there's beauty in uncertainty.\" While praising Glover's songwriting and the features on ''3.15.20'', Jones criticized the production and vocals on a few of the album's tracks.<ref name=\"COS\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dean Van Nguyen acclaimed the album, saying that \"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levity.\" Nguyen further stated that the themes of the album fits to the present day insecurities with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], saying that \"The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n|headline = ''3.15.20'' track listing\n| title1 = 0.00 (We Are)\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.

It also presented tips and keyboard shortcuts. For example, typing an address followed by \"Dear\" would cause the Assistant to appear with the message, \"''It looks like you're writing a [[Letter (message)|letter]]. Would you like help?''\".\n\n===Assistants===\nApart from Clippit, other Office Assistants were also available:\n*The Dot (a shape-shifting [[smiley]]-faced red ball)\n*Hoverbot (a robot)\n*The Genius (a caricature of [[Albert Einstein]], removed in Office XP but available as a downloadable add-on)\n*Office Logo (a jigsaw puzzle)\n*Mother Nature (a globe)\n*Scribble (an origami-esque cat)\n*Power Pup (a superhero dog)\n*Will (a caricature of [[William Shakespeare]]).\n\nIn many cases the Office installation [[Compact Disc|CD]] was necessary to activate a different Office assistant character, so the default character, Clippit, remains widely known compared to other Office Assistants.\n\nIn Office 2000, the ''Hoverbot'', ''Scribble'' and ''Power Pup'' assistants were replaced by:\n*F1 (a robot)\n*Links (a cat)\n*Rocky (a dog)\n\nThe Clippit and Office Logo assistants were also redesigned. The removed assistants later resurfaced as downloadable add-ons.\n\nThe Microsoft Office XP Multilingual Pack had two more assistants, {{Nihongo|''Saeko Sensei''|\u51b4\u5b50\u5148\u751f|}}, an animated secretary, and a version of the [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]] ({{zh|t=\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a}}) for Asian language users in non-Asian Office versions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaiyou-k.jp/fumiovol14.htm |title=\u30d5\u30df\u30aa\u541b\u306e\u30dc\u30e4\u30ad \u7b2c14\u56de \u300e\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u300f\u306e\u30a4\u30eb\u30ab |publisher=Kaiyou-k.jp |date=2004-07-18 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}</ref> Native language versions provided additional representations, such as Kairu the [[dolphin]] in Japanese.\n\n[[File:Clippy_Hidden_in_office.png|thumb|right|Clippit, hidden.]]\nA small image of Clippit can be found in Office 2013 or newer, which could be enabled by going to Options and changing the theme to \"School Supplies\".

Users can add other assistants to the folder where Office is installed for them to show up in the Office application, or install in the Microsoft Agent folder in [[Special folder#List of special folders|System32]] folder. Microsoft Agent-based characters have richer forms and colors, and are not enclosed within a boxed window. Furthermore, the Office Assistant could use the Lernout & Hauspie TruVoice Text-to-Speech Engine to provide output speech capabilities to Microsoft Agent, but it required SAPI 4.0.

He was the first ruler to hold the title ''[[Sultan]]'' (\"authority\"), signifying the extent of his power while at the same time preserving an ideological link to the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. During his rule, he invaded and plundered the richest cities and temple towns in the regions of present day [[India]] seventeen times, and used the booty to build his magnificent capital in Ghazni.{{sfn|Heathcote|1995|p=6}}{{sfn|Anjum|2007|p=234}}\n\n== Background ==\nMahmud was born in the town of [[Ghazni]] in the region of [[Zabulistan]] (now present-day [[Afghanistan]]) on 2 November 971. His father, [[Sabuktigin]], was a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] slave commander (''[[ghilman]]'') who laid foundations to the Ghaznavid dynasty in Ghazni in 977, which he ruled as a subordinate of the [[Samanids]], who ruled [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]]. Mahmud's mother was the daughter of an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] aristocrat from Zabulistan,{{sfn|Bosworth|1991|p=65}}{{sfn|Bosworth|2012}} and is therefore known in some sources as ''Mahmud-i Zavuli'' (\"Mahmud from Zabulistan\").{{sfn|Bosworth|2012}} Not much about Mahmud's early life is known, he was a school-fellow of [[Ahmad Maymandi]], a Persian native of Zabulistan and foster brother of his.{{sfn|Nazim|Bosworth|1991|p=915}}\n\n==Family==\nMahmud married a woman named Kausari Jahan, and they had twin sons [[Mohammad Ghaznavi|Mohammad]] and [[Ma'sud I of Ghazni|Ma'sud]], who succeeded him one after the other; his grandson by Mas'ud, [[Maw'dud Ghaznavi]], also later became ruler of the empire. His sister, Sitr-e-Mu'alla, was married to Dawood bin Ataullah Alavi, also known as [[Gazi Saiyyed Salar Sahu|Ghazi Salar Sahu]], whose son was [[Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud]].\n\nMahmud's companion was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n slave [[Malik Ayaz]], and his love for him inspired poems and stories.{{sfn|Ritter|2003|p=309-310}}\n\n==Early career==\n\n[[File:Mahmud ibn Sebuktegin attacks the fortress of Zarang.jpg|300px|left|thumb|upright|Sultan Mahmud and his forces attacking the fortress of [[Zaranj]]]]\nIn 994 Mahmud joined his father [[Sabuktigin]] in the capture of Khorasan from the rebel Fa'iq in aid of the [[Samanid Empire|Samanid Emir]], [[Nuh II]]. During this period, the Samanid Empire became highly unstable, with shifting internal political tides as various factions vied for control, the chief among them being Abu'l-Qasim Simjuri, Fa'iq, Abu{{nbsp}}Ali{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, the General Bekhtuzin as well as the neighbouring [[Buyid dynasty]] and [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]].\n\n==Reign==\nSabuktigin died in 997, and was succeeded by his son [[Ismail of Ghazni|Ismail]] as the ruler of the Ghaznavid dynasty. The reason behind Sabuktigin's choice to appoint Ismail as heir over the more experienced and older Mahmud is uncertain. It may due to Ismail's mother being the daughter of Sabuktigin's old master, [[Alptigin]].{{sfn|Bosworth|2012}} Mahmud shortly revolted, and with the help of his other brother, Abu'l-Muzaffar, the governor of [[Lashkargah|Bust]], he defeated Ismail the following year at the [[Battle of Ghazni (998)|battle of Ghazni]] and gained control over the Ghaznavid kingdom.{{sfn|Nazim|Bosworth|1991|p=65}} That year, in 998, Mahmud then traveled to Balkh and paid homage to Amir [[Mansur II|Abu'l-Harith Mansur b. Nur II]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1963|p=45}} He then appointed [[Abu'l-Hasan Isfaraini]] as his [[vizier]],{{sfn|Bosworth|1983|pp=303-304}} and then set out west from Ghazni to take the [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar region]] followed by Bost ([[Lashkar Gah]]), where he turned it into a militarised city.\n\nMahmud initiated the first of numerous invasions of [[North India]]. On 28{{nbsp}}November 1001, his army fought and defeated the army of [[Jayapala|Raja Jayapala]] of the [[Kabul Shahi]]s at [[Battle of Peshawar (1001)|the battle of Peshawar]]. In 1002 Mahmud invaded [[Sistan]] and dethroned [[Khalaf ibn Ahmad]], ending the [[Saffarid dynasty]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1963|p=89}} From there he decided to focus on Hindustan to the southeast, particularly the highly [[Fertility (soil)|fertile]] lands of the [[Punjab region]].\n\nMahmud's first campaign to the south was against an [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] state first established at [[Multan]] in 965 by a [[da'i]] from the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in a bid to curry political favor and recognition with the Abbasid Caliphate; he also engaged elsewhere with the Fatimids. At this point, Jayapala attempted to gain revenge for an earlier military defeat at the hands of Mahmud's father, who had controlled  Ghazni in the late 980s and had cost Jayapala extensive territory. His son [[Anandapala]] succeeded him and continued the struggle to avenge his father's suicide. He assembled a powerful confederacy that suffered defeat as his elephant turned back from the battle at a crucial moment, turning the tide into Mahmud's favor once more at [[Lahore]] in 1008 and bringing Mahmud into control of the Shahi dominions of Udbandpura.{{sfn|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1977|p=3-4}}\n\n===Ghaznavid campaigns in Indian Subcontinent===\n[[File:Mahmud of Ghazni last success.jpg|thumb|Mahmud of Ghazni's last success in India against the Jats]]\nFollowing the defeat of the Indian Confederacy, after deciding to retaliate for their combined resistance, Mahmud then set out on regular expeditions against them, leaving the conquered kingdoms in the hands of [[Hindu]] [[vassal]]s and [[annexation|annexing]] only the [[Punjab region]].{{sfn|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1977|p=3-4}} He also vowed to raid and loot the wealthy region of northwestern India every year.{{sfn|Saunders|1947|p=162}}\n\nIn 1001 Mahmud of Ghazni first invaded modern day Afghanistan and Pakistan and then parts of India. Mahmud defeated, captured, and later released the Shahi ruler Jayapala, who had moved his capital to [[Peshawar]] (modern Pakistan). Jayapala killed himself and was succeeded by his son Anandapala. In 1005 Mahmud of Ghazni invaded Bhatia (probably Bhera), and in 1006 he invaded [[Multan]], at which time Anandapala's army attacked him. The following year Mahmud of Ghazni attacked and crushed Sukhapala, ruler of [[Bathinda]] (who had become ruler by rebelling against the Shahi kingdom). In 1013, during Mahmud's eighth expedition into eastern Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Shahi kingdom (which was then under Trilochanapala, son of Anandapala) was overthrown.{{sfn|Barnett|1999|p=74-78}}\n\nIn 1014 Mahmud led an expedition to [[Thanesar]]. The next year he unsuccessfully attacked [[Kashmir]]. In 1018 he attacked [[Mathura]] and defeated a coalition of rulers there while also killing a ruler called Chandrapala. In 1021 Mahmud supported the [[Kannauj]] king against [[Chandela]] Ganda, who was defeated. That same year Shahi Trilochanapala was killed at Rahib and his son Bhimapala succeeded him. [[Lahore]] (modern Pakistan) was annexed by Mahmud. Mahmud besieged [[Gwalior]], in 1023, where he was given tribute. Mahmud attacked [[Somnath]] in 1025, and its ruler [[Bhima I]] fled. The next year, he captured Somnath and marched to [[Kutch|Kachch]] against Bhima I. That same year Mahmud also attacked the Jats of Jud.{{sfn|Barnett|1999|p=74-78}}\n\n[[Christoph Baumer]] notes that in 1026 CE, [[Jats]] \"inflicted heavy losses\" on the army of Mahmud while it was on its way from Somnath to [[Multan]]. Later in 1027 CE, he avenged the attack by Jats, who had also been impervious to \"forced Islamisation\" for the last three centuries, by ravaging the fleet of Jats in the [[Indus river]].

As the contemporary writer Gardizi reports, Mahmud had 1,400 boats built; each boat was to carry 20 archers and be equipped with special projectiles that could be filled with naphtha.

They were also used against a Turkic rebel, with the command given to a Hindu named Tilak according to [[Abu'l-Fadl Bayhaqi|Baihaki]].<ref name=Fadl>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PnBMFaGMabYC&pg=PA40&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWnIi-zv3YAhUDro8KHaLtD98Q6AEINDAD#v=onepage&f=false|title= Somanatha: The Many Voices of a History|publisher=Verso|author=[[Romila Thapar]]|page=40}}</ref>\n\n[[Mohammad Habib]] states that there was no imposition of [[Jizya]] on \"non-Muslims\" during the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni nor any mention of \"forced conversions\": {{Quote|[H]is (Mahmud's) expeditions against India were not motivated by religion but by love of plunder.{{sfn|Habib|1965|p=77}}}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\n[[File:\u0424\u0438\u0440\u0434\u0443\u0441\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u044d\u043c\u0443 \u00ab\u0428\u0430\u0445-\u041d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u00bb \u0448\u0430\u0445\u0443 \u041c\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u0413\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0438 (1913).jpg|thumb|right|[[Ferdowsi]] reads the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' to Mahmud of Ghazni (by [[Vardges Sureniants]], 1913)]]\n\nBy the end of his reign, the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]] extended from [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] in the west to [[Samarkand]] in the north-east, and from the [[Caspian Sea]] to the [[Yamuna]]. Although his raids carried his forces across the [[Indian subcontinent]], only a portion of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and of [[Sindh]] in modern-day Pakistan came under his semi-permanent rule; [[Kashmir]], the [[Doab]], [[Rajasthan]], and [[Gujarat]] remained under the control of the local Hindu dynasties.\n\nThe booty brought back to [[Ghazni]] was enormous, and contemporary historians (e.g. [[Abolfazl Beyhaghi]], [[Ferdowsi]]) give descriptions of the magnificence of the capital, as well as of the conqueror's munificent support of literature. He transformed Ghazni, the first centre of [[Persian literature]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=Arts, Islamic|journal=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|date=20 October 2006}}</ref> into one of the leading cities of Central Asia, patronizing scholars, establishing colleges, laying out gardens, and building mosques, palaces, and caravansaries. Mahmud brought whole libraries from Ray and Isfahan to Ghazni. He even demanded that the Khwarizmshah court send its men of learning to Ghazni.{{sfn|Bosworth|1963|p=132}}\n\nMahmud patronized the notable poet Ferdowsi, who after laboring 27 years, went to Ghazni and presented the [[Shahnameh]] to him. There are various stories in medieval texts describing the lack of interest shown by Mahmud to Ferdowsi and his life's work. According to historians, Mahmud had promised Ferdowsi a [[dinar]] for every distich written in the Shahnameh (which would have been 60,000 dinars), but later retracted his promise and presented him with dirhams (20,000 dirhams), at that time the equivalent of only 200{{nbsp}}dinars. His expedition across the Gangetic plains in 1017 inspired [[Al-Biruni]] to compose his ''Tarikh Al-Hind'' in order to understand the Indians and their beliefs. During Mahmud's rule, universities were founded to study various subjects such as mathematics, religion, the humanities, and medicine.\n\nOn 30 April 1030 Sultan Mahmud died in Ghazni at the age of 58. Sultan Mahmud had contracted [[malaria]] during his last invasion. The medical complication from malaria had caused lethal tuberculosis.\n\nThe Ghaznavid Empire was ruled by his successors for 157 years. The expanding [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] empire absorbed most of the Ghaznavid west. The [[Ghorid]]s captured Ghazni in 1150, and [[Mu'izz al-Din]] (also known as Muhammad of Ghori) captured the last Ghaznavid stronghold at Lahore in 1187.\n\nThe military of Pakistan has named its [[short-range ballistic missile]] the [[Ghaznavi Missile]] in honour of Mahmud of Ghazni.{{sfn|Ramachandran|2005}} In addition, the Pakistan Military Academy, where cadets are trained to become officers of the Pakistan Army, also gives tribute to Mahmud of Ghazni by naming one of its twelve companies Ghaznavi Company.\n\n==Personality==\nSultan Mahmud thought of himself as \"the Shadow of the God on Earth<ref>Ibn Qutaiba, Uyunu'l-Akhbar, p.3</ref>\", an absolute power whose will is law.

At the time of his death, his kingdom had been transformed into an extensive military empire, which extended from northwestern [[Iran]] proper to the [[Punjab]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Khwarazm]] in [[Transoxiana]], and [[Makran]].\n\nHighly [[Persianization|Persianized]],{{sfn|Grousset|1970|p=146}} Sultan Mahmud continued the bureaucratic, political, and cultural customs of his predecessors, the [[Samanids]], which established the ground for a [[Persianate society|Persianate]] state in northwestern India.{{sfn|Meri|2005|p=294}} His capital of [[Ghazni]] evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual centre in the Islamic world, almost rivalling the important city of [[Baghdad]].

He was the first ruler to hold the title ''[[Sultan]]'' (\"authority\"), signifying the extent of his power while at the same time preserving an ideological link to the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. During his rule, he invaded and plundered the richest cities and temple towns in the regions of present day [[India]] seventeen times, and used the booty to build his magnificent capital in Ghazni.{{sfn|Heathcote|1995|p=6}}{{sfn|Anjum|2007|p=234}}\n\n== Background ==\nMahmud was born in the town of [[Ghazni]] in the region of [[Zabulistan]] (now present-day [[Afghanistan]]) on 2 November 971. His father, [[Sabuktigin]], was a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] slave commander (''[[ghilman]]'') who laid foundations to the Ghaznavid dynasty in Ghazni in 977, which he ruled as a subordinate of the [[Samanids]], who ruled [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]]. Mahmud's mother was the daughter of an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] aristocrat from Zabulistan,{{sfn|Bosworth|1991|p=65}}{{sfn|Bosworth|2012}} and is therefore known in some sources as ''Mahmud-i Zavuli'' (\"Mahmud from Zabulistan\").{{sfn|Bosworth|2012}} Not much about Mahmud's early life is known, he was a school-fellow of [[Ahmad Maymandi]], a Persian native of Zabulistan and foster brother of his.{{sfn|Nazim|Bosworth|1991|p=915}}\n\n==Family==\nMahmud married a woman named Kausari Jahan, and they had twin sons [[Mohammad Ghaznavi|Mohammad]] and [[Ma'sud I of Ghazni|Ma'sud]], who succeeded him one after the other; his grandson by Mas'ud, [[Maw'dud Ghaznavi]], also later became ruler of the empire. His sister, Sitr-e-Mu'alla, was married to Dawood bin Ataullah Alavi, also known as [[Gazi Saiyyed Salar Sahu|Ghazi Salar Sahu]], whose son was [[Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud]].\n\nMahmud's companion was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n slave [[Malik Ayaz]], and his love for him inspired poems and stories.{{sfn|Ritter|2003|p=309-310}}\n\n==Early career==\n\n[[File:Mahmud ibn Sebuktegin attacks the fortress of Zarang.jpg|300px|left|thumb|upright|Sultan Mahmud and his forces attacking the fortress of [[Zaranj]]]]\nIn 994 Mahmud joined his father [[Sabuktigin]] in the capture of Khorasan from the rebel Fa'iq in aid of the [[Samanid Empire|Samanid Emir]], [[Nuh II]]. During this period, the Samanid Empire became highly unstable, with shifting internal political tides as various factions vied for control, the chief among them being Abu'l-Qasim Simjuri, Fa'iq, Abu{{nbsp}}Ali{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, the General Bekhtuzin as well as the neighbouring [[Buyid dynasty]] and [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]].\n\n==Reign==\nSabuktigin died in 997, and was succeeded by his son [[Ismail of Ghazni|Ismail]] as the ruler of the Ghaznavid dynasty. The reason behind Sabuktigin's choice to appoint Ismail as heir over the more experienced and older Mahmud is uncertain. It may due to Ismail's mother being the daughter of Sabuktigin's old master, [[Alptigin]].{{sfn|Bosworth|2012}} Mahmud shortly revolted, and with the help of his other brother, Abu'l-Muzaffar, the governor of [[Lashkargah|Bust]], he defeated Ismail the following year at the [[Battle of Ghazni (998)|battle of Ghazni]] and gained control over the Ghaznavid kingdom.{{sfn|Nazim|Bosworth|1991|p=65}} That year, in 998, Mahmud then traveled to Balkh and paid homage to Amir [[Mansur II|Abu'l-Harith Mansur b. Nur II]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1963|p=45}} He then appointed [[Abu'l-Hasan Isfaraini]] as his [[vizier]],{{sfn|Bosworth|1983|pp=303-304}} and then set out west from Ghazni to take the [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar region]] followed by Bost ([[Lashkar Gah]]), where he turned it into a militarised city.\n\nMahmud initiated the first of numerous invasions of [[North India]]. On 28{{nbsp}}November 1001, his army fought and defeated the army of [[Jayapala|Raja Jayapala]] of the [[Kabul Shahi]]s at [[Battle of Peshawar (1001)|the battle of Peshawar]]. In 1002 Mahmud invaded [[Sistan]] and dethroned [[Khalaf ibn Ahmad]], ending the [[Saffarid dynasty]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1963|p=89}} From there he decided to focus on Hindustan to the southeast, particularly the highly [[Fertility (soil)|fertile]] lands of the [[Punjab region]].\n\nMahmud's first campaign to the south was against an [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] state first established at [[Multan]] in 965 by a [[da'i]] from the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in a bid to curry political favor and recognition with the Abbasid Caliphate; he also engaged elsewhere with the Fatimids. At this point, Jayapala attempted to gain revenge for an earlier military defeat at the hands of Mahmud's father, who had controlled  Ghazni in the late 980s and had cost Jayapala extensive territory. His son [[Anandapala]] succeeded him and continued the struggle to avenge his father's suicide. He assembled a powerful confederacy that suffered defeat as his elephant turned back from the battle at a crucial moment, turning the tide into Mahmud's favor once more at [[Lahore]] in 1008 and bringing Mahmud into control of the Shahi dominions of Udbandpura.{{sfn|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1977|p=3-4}}\n\n===Ghaznavid campaigns in Indian Subcontinent===\n[[File:Mahmud of Ghazni last success.jpg|thumb|Mahmud of Ghazni's last success in India against the Jats]]\nFollowing the defeat of the Indian Confederacy, after deciding to retaliate for their combined resistance, Mahmud then set out on regular expeditions against them, leaving the conquered kingdoms in the hands of [[Hindu]] [[vassal]]s and [[annexation|annexing]] only the [[Punjab region]].{{sfn|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1977|p=3-4}} He also vowed to raid and loot the wealthy region of northwestern India every year.{{sfn|Saunders|1947|p=162}}\n\nIn 1001 Mahmud of Ghazni first invaded modern day Afghanistan and Pakistan and then parts of India.

In 1005 Mahmud of Ghazni invaded Bhatia (probably Bhera), and in 1006 he invaded [[Multan]], at which time Anandapala's army attacked him. The following year Mahmud of Ghazni attacked and crushed Sukhapala, ruler of [[Bathinda]] (who had become ruler by rebelling against the Shahi kingdom).

[[Lahore]] (modern Pakistan) was annexed by Mahmud. Mahmud besieged [[Gwalior]], in 1023, where he was given tribute. Mahmud attacked [[Somnath]] in 1025, and its ruler [[Bhima I]] fled.

Although his raids carried his forces across the [[Indian subcontinent]], only a portion of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and of [[Sindh]] in modern-day Pakistan came under his semi-permanent rule; [[Kashmir]], the [[Doab]], [[Rajasthan]], and [[Gujarat]] remained under the control of the local Hindu dynasties.\n\nThe booty brought back to [[Ghazni]] was enormous, and contemporary historians (e.g. [[Abolfazl Beyhaghi]], [[Ferdowsi]]) give descriptions of the magnificence of the capital, as well as of the conqueror's munificent support of literature. He transformed Ghazni, the first centre of [[Persian literature]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=Arts, Islamic|journal=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|date=20 October 2006}}</ref> into one of the leading cities of Central Asia, patronizing scholars, establishing colleges, laying out gardens, and building mosques, palaces, and caravansaries. Mahmud brought whole libraries from Ray and Isfahan to Ghazni. He even demanded that the Khwarizmshah court send its men of learning to Ghazni.{{sfn|Bosworth|1963|p=132}}\n\nMahmud patronized the notable poet Ferdowsi, who after laboring 27 years, went to Ghazni and presented the [[Shahnameh]] to him. There are various stories in medieval texts describing the lack of interest shown by Mahmud to Ferdowsi and his life's work. According to historians, Mahmud had promised Ferdowsi a [[dinar]] for every distich written in the Shahnameh (which would have been 60,000 dinars), but later retracted his promise and presented him with dirhams (20,000 dirhams), at that time the equivalent of only 200{{nbsp}}dinars. His expedition across the Gangetic plains in 1017 inspired [[Al-Biruni]] to compose his ''Tarikh Al-Hind'' in order to understand the Indians and their beliefs. During Mahmud's rule, universities were founded to study various subjects such as mathematics, religion, the humanities, and medicine.\n\nOn 30 April 1030 Sultan Mahmud died in Ghazni at the age of 58. Sultan Mahmud had contracted [[malaria]] during his last invasion. The medical complication from malaria had caused lethal tuberculosis.\n\nThe Ghaznavid Empire was ruled by his successors for 157 years. The expanding [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] empire absorbed most of the Ghaznavid west. The [[Ghorid]]s captured Ghazni in 1150, and [[Mu'izz al-Din]] (also known as Muhammad of Ghori) captured the last Ghaznavid stronghold at Lahore in 1187.\n\nThe military of Pakistan has named its [[short-range ballistic missile]] the [[Ghaznavi Missile]] in honour of Mahmud of Ghazni.{{sfn|Ramachandran|2005}} In addition, the Pakistan Military Academy, where cadets are trained to become officers of the Pakistan Army, also gives tribute to Mahmud of Ghazni by naming one of its twelve companies Ghaznavi Company.\n\n==Personality==\nSultan Mahmud thought of himself as \"the Shadow of the God on Earth<ref>Ibn Qutaiba, Uyunu'l-Akhbar, p.3</ref>\", an absolute power whose will is law.
