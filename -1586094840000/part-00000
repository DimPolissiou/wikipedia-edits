Four German divisions conducted a spoiling attack on the positions of the [[I ANZAC Corps|1st Anzac Corps]] of the British [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]]. The attack was to delay the advance of the Fifth Army towards the Hindenburg Line, causing as many casualties and destroying as much equipment, particularly artillery, as possible.\n\n{{lang|de|Sturmbock}} was also to deprive the British of the means to attack {{lang|de|Gruppe Arras}} ([[IX Reserve Corps (German Empire)|IX Reserve Corps]]) as it fought the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] (9 April to 16 May 1917) and {{lang|de|Gruppe Qu\u00e9ant}} ([[XIV Reserve Corps (German Empire)|XIV Reserve Corps]]) to the south. The German commanders hoped to gain time to prepare more defences and to show that the retirement to the [[Hindenburg Line]] had not diminished German morale or the ability to attack. The Fifth Army was recovering from the [[First attack on Bullecourt]] (11 April) and preparing for the [[Battle of Bullecourt]] 3\u201317 May 1917, a bigger effort.\n\nThe attack by two divisions of {{lang|de|Gruppe Qu\u00e9ant}} and two divisions of {{lang|de|Gruppe Cambrai}} to the south, fell on the positions of the [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Australian Division]] and [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Australian Division]]. The Australians repulsed the attacks, except at Lagnicourt, where German troops broke in, took prisoners destroyed six artillery pieces and recovered confidential documents. Australian counter-attacks cut off some of the attackers and inflicted {{nowrap|2,313 casualties}} against {{nowrap|1,010 Australian.}}\n\nThe Fifth Army hurried forward more artillery and consolidated its defences, adding more advanced posts. Preparations for the next attack at Bullecourt continued and the Germans reinforced the Hindenburg Line ({{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}}) defences in the area. The attack was criticised by German commanders, especially its rushed preparations, sparse results and severe casualties. The British moved no reserves outside the 1st Anzac Corps area and continued the offensive at Arras.\n\n==Background==\n===Hindenburg Line===\n\n[[File:Hindenberg line bullecourt.jpg|thumb|{{centre|The Hindenberg Line at Bullecourt (photographed 1920)}}]]\n[[General of the Infantry (Germany)|General]] [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] the German Chief of the General Staff was dismissed on 29 August 1916 and replaced by [[Field Marshal (Germany)|Field Marshal]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and General [[Erich Ludendorff]]. {{lang|de|[[Oberste Heeresleitung#The third OHL|Oberste Heeresleitung]]}} (Third OHL, the new supreme command) ended the offensive at Verdun on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and requested proposals for a new shorter defensive position.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=134\u2013135}} {{lang|de|Generalfeldmarschall}} [[Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria|Crown Prince Rupprecht]], commander of Army Group Rupprecht of Bavaria ({{lang|de|[[Army Group Rupprecht of Bavaria|Heeresgruppe Kronprinz Rupprecht]]}}), was ordered to prepare a rear defensive line and work on the new Hindenburg Line ({{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}} [Siegfried Position]) began. As the situation on the Somme deteriorated, Hindenburg ordered that the front be given priority in the west for troops and supplies.{{sfn|Miles|1992|p=455}}\n\nBy the end of September Rupprecht had no reserves left on the Somme and another thirteen fresh divisions were sent to the British sector of the Somme, troops being scraped up wherever they could be found.{{sfn|Miles|1992|p=455}} For the {{lang|de|Abwehrschlacht}} (defensive battle) expected in 1917, the Hindenburg Line was to be built across the base of the Noyon Salient from Neuville Vitasse near Arras, through St Quentin and Laon to the Chemin des Dames ridge.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|pp=133\u2013134}} The new fortified areas ({{lang|de|Eventualstellungen}}, similar to ones built on the Russian front) were intended to be precautionary measures ({{lang|de|Sicherheitskoeffizient}}) and to shorten the Western Front, economising on troops, creating more reserves against the {{lang|fr|[[Triple Entente|Entente]]}} offensives expected in 1917. The {{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}} had the potential to release the greatest number of troops and was begun first.{{sfnm|1a1=Wynne|1y=1976|1pp=133\u2013134|2a1=Falls|2y=1992|2p=110}}\n\n===Operation Alberich===\n\n{{main|Operation Alberich}}\n[[File:German retirements Somme 1917.png|thumb|{{center|German retirements from the Somme, 1917}}]]\nLudendorff ordered 9 February to be the first day of the {{lang|de|Alberich Bewegung}} (Alberich Manoeuvre) and 16 March the first marching day.{{sfn|Falls|1992|p=115}} On 17 March, the [[1st Army (German Empire)|1st Army]], at the north end of the Bapaume Salient, withdrew swiftly. {{lang|de|Riegel I Stellung}} was abandoned by 18 March and next day [[Boyelles]] and [[Boiry-Becquerelle]] were evacuated. The withdrawal went straight back to the {{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}} (Hindenburg Line) except for outposts and raids were mounted on British outposts during 20 and 21 March. {{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=149\u2013154}} Bapaume was also abandoned, with many houses were still on fire. Next day, parties of Germans at Beugny in the {{lang|de|Riegel III Stellung}} fought until nightfall then slipped away. A party at [[Vaulx-Vraucourt]] was surprised and driven back to [[Lagnicourt-Marcel|Lagnicourt]]. Lagnicourt was lost on 26 March, a German counter-attack from [[Noreuil]] and a British attack on [[Bucquoy]] were repulsed.{{sfn|Falls|1992|p=138}}\n\nOn 17 March, withdrawals by the [[2nd Army (German Empire)|2nd Army]] began north of the [[Avre (Somme)|Avre]] and by 18 March, the other German armies and the southern wing of the [[6th Army (German Empire)|6th Army]] , began to withdraw from {{cvt|110|mi|km|0}} of the old front line ({{cvt|65|mi|km|0}} as the crow flies). The Somme River and canal crossings from [[Offoy, Somme|Offoy]] to [[P\u00e9ronne, Somme|P\u00e9ronne]] were destroyed and pools of water {{cvt|0.5|mi|km|0}} wide, near road embankments, made crossings anywhere else impossible, the damage being made worse by the spring thaw. On 18 March the main body of German troops reached the Hindenburg Line ({{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}}) where work was still being done to remedy defects in the original position.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=127\u2013135}} Outpost villages close to the {{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}} south of Qu\u00e9ant had to be held for longer than expected to complete the extra work. [[Heudicourt, Somme|Heudicourt]], [[Sorel, Somme|Sorel]] and [[Fins, Somme|Fins]] were lost on 30 March. The northern outpost villages were captured on 2 April and [[Lempire]] fell three days later.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=138\u2013153}}\n\n===XIV Reserve Corps===\n\n{{main|Western Front tactics, 1917}}\n\n[[File:Otto von Moser.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.50|{{centre|{{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} Otto von Moser}}]]\nDuring the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916, divisions had quickly become exhausted and it had proved impractical to replace corps headquarters and their constituent divisions at the rate necessary to rest tired divisions; corps HQ remained on the Somme and took over fresh divisions as they arrived.{{sfn|Wynne|1976|p=126}} By 1917 the connexion between Corps HQ and their component divisions had been dissolved on the rest of the Western Front and territorial titles introduced. After the retreat to the {{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}}, the [[IX Reserve Corps (German Empire)|IX Reserve Corps]], responsible for the line from the Scarpe to Croisilles, became {{lang|de|Gruppe [[Arras]]}} and the [[XIV Reserve Corps (German Empire)|XIV Reserve Corps]]  {{lang|de|Gruppe [[Qu\u00e9ant]]}} ({{lang|de|[[Generalleutnant]]}} [Lieutenant-General] [[Otto von Moser]] from 12 March 1917) held the {{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}} from [[Croisilles, Pas-de-Calais|Croisilles]] to [[M\u0153uvres]]. The 6th Army HQ had decided that the {{cvt|11000|yd|mi+km|abbr=on}} front held by the {{lang|de|Gruppe}} was too vulnerable to be held by two divisions. On 13 April, the 6th Army chief of staff notified Moser that the [[3rd Guards Infantry Division (German Empire)|3rd Guard Division]] ({{lang|de|3. Garde-Infanterie-Division}}) was being transferred to the {{lang|de|Gruppe}} after having had three months of rest and training.{{sfn|Bean|1982|p=394}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Fifth Army===\n\n{{main|Battle of Arras (1917)}}\n\n[[File:26.Res.-Div. M\u00e4rz 1917 Bullecourt.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Retirement of the 26th Reserve Division, March 1917}}]]\nThe original British plan for the Fifth Army to co-operate with the Third Army attack into the salient formed around [[Bapaume]] during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 was made redundant. The German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line ({{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}}) forestalled the British attack and the Fifth Army was ordered to push back German rearguards and prepare to attack the Hindenburg Line between Qu\u00e9ant and Bullecourt, to support the Third Army offensive, a much more difficult task. The Fifth Army had been stripped of divisions and artillery and bringing up the remaining guns and ammunition over the supply desert created by German demolitions was slow. The Hindenburg Line was far more formidable than the decrepit defences abandoned during the withdrawal but if the Fifth Army could penetrate the Hindenburg Line, the task of the Third Army, advancing south-eastwards down the Arras\u2013[[Cambrai]] road would be eased. Bullecourt was {{cvt|3.5|mi|km|0}} from the road at [[Vis-en-Artois]] and under {{cvt|2|mi|km|0}} at [[Fontaine-l\u00e8s-Croisilles]], the first objective of the [[Cavalry Corps (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Corps]] advancing in front of the Third Army.{{sfn|Falls|1992|p=357}}\n\nGough suggested that the Fifth Army could support the main offensive but for lack of means could only attack on a narrow front. Bullecourt was substituted for Qu\u00e9ant which was behind four defensive positions. The attack would then pivot to the right flank to capture the junction of the Hindenburg Line and the [[Drocourt, Pas-de-Calais|Drocourt]]\u2013Qu\u00e9ant Switch Line ({{lang|de|Wotanstellung}}). If successful, the [[1st Indian Cavalry Division|4th Cavalry Division]] would pass through to meet the Cavalry Corps from Arras. Fifth Army attacks on 2 April captured the German outpost villages from [[Doignies]] to Croisilles and Gough ordered that risks be taken to advance as much heavy artillery as possible. On 5 April Gough issued orders to the [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] and [[I ANZAC Corps|1st Anzac Corps]] for an attack on a {{cvt|3500|yd|mi+km}} front with Bullecourt in the centre. [[Riencourt]] was the second objective and [[Hendecourt-l\u00e8s-Cagnicourt|Hendecourt]] the third objective, where the 4th Cavalry Division was to advance to rendezvous with the Cavalry Corps. The Fifth Army received D Company, [[Royal Tank Regiment|Tank Corps]], five tanks for each corps and two in army reserve. The heavy guns were delayed by German road demolitions and the field artillery had to be moved in relays due to a shortage of horses. The 4th Australian Division was not able to use all its seven artillery brigades until 8 April, even after hauling field guns with crews and ammunition by lorry. On the right of V Corps to the north, the [[62nd (2nd West Riding) Division]] took over from the 7th Division on 5 April; both divisional artilleries moved forward in stages and began wire cutting on 7 April. Australian patrols found no gaps in the wire, about {{cvt|30|yd|m|0}} deep, east of Bullecourt.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=357\u2013359}}\n\n===First attack on Bullecourt===\n====8\u201310 April====\n\n{{main|First attack on Bullecourt}}\n\n[[File:Siegfriedstellung defences 1917.png|thumb|{{centre|Relief map showing the Hindenburg Line and Wotan Line {{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung, Wotanstellung}}) defences around Bullecourt and Qu\u00e9ant, 1917.}}]]\nThe Hindenburg Line defences enclosing the village of [[Bullecourt]] formed a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|re-entrant]] for about {{cvt|2500|yd|m|0}} to the {{lang|de|Balkonstellung}} (Balcony Trench) around Qu\u00e9ant, defended by the {{lang|fr|\u00e9lite}} German [[27th Division (German Empire)|27th Division]].{{sfnm|1a1=Sheldon|1y=2015|1p=220|2a1=Oldham|2y=2000|2pp=66\u201367}}{{efn|In the ''Report of the Battles Nomenclature Committee'' (1921), subsidiary operations to the main Battle of Arras were labelled \"Flanking Operations to the Arras Offensive\".{{sfn|James|1990|pp=viii, 19}}}} On 8 April it was announced that wire cutting, begun on 5 April, would take another eight days.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=357\u2013359}}{{efn|Despite transfers, the Fifth Army had 26 batteries of medium and heavy howitzers but overcrowded roads caused many hold-ups.

Preparations were made in a rush, the 4th Australian Division to attack with two brigades, the 4th on the right and 12th on the left. The attack had to cover {{cvt|500|yd|m|0}} to the wire and another {{cvt|100|yd|m|0}} to the first trench at {{nowrap|4:30 a.m.,}} about an hour and 48 minutes before the sun rose, to evade crossfire in the re-entrant between Qu\u00e9ant and Bullecourt.

Only four tanks reached their start line by {{nowrap|4:30 a.m.}} but drowning the sound of their engines with machine-gun fire failed and they were heard in the German defences.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=363\u2013364}} The tank on the right flank deviated to the right, suffered mechanical difficulties and returned to the railway. Another tank also veered right and crossed the first trench of the {{lang|de|Balkonstellung}} opposite Grenadier Regiment 123 and was knocked out by machine-guns firing armour-piercing ([[K bullet]]) ammunition. The next tank to reach the German lines was snagged by wire then crossed the first trench before being knocked out. The last tank started late followed a similar path to the first. The four tanks comprising the left-hand section were late and two were knocked out short of the German trenches; the third tank arrived behind the Australian infantry and silenced a machine-gun in Bullecourt. The tank was hit twice, returned to the railway and was hit again.{{efn|Falls wrote that reports that tanks got into Riencourt and Hendecourt were caused by the foreshortening effect of the rolling down land. An Australian [[Artillery observer|forward observation officer]] reported that two tanks and 200 infantry penetrated Hendecourt and that Indian cavalry could be seen west of Riencourt; no cavalry of the Sialkot Brigade came within {{cvt|1.5|mi|km|0}} of the village.{{sfn|Falls|1992|p=366}}}}\n\nThe Australian infantry in the German defences were cut off. When the 4th Australian Brigade ran out of grenades it was forced back and the remnants of the brigade not taken prisoner tried to retreat and suffered many more casualties. In the 12th Australian Brigade, the 46th Australian Battalion in the first trench was forced out and the 48th Australian Battalion further forward was surrounded. The 48th Australian Battalion bombed its way back to the first trench.{{sfn|Falls|1992|p=369}} The artillery of the neighbouring 2nd Guard Division and 220th Division added to the defensive barrage in front of Bullecourt and prevented any renewal of the Australian attack.

Doignies and [[Demicourt]] were the objectives of the 38th Division and Hermies on the southern flank was the target of the 4th ''Ersatz'' Division. The attacking battalions were to be followed by engineers and in the latter two divisions by elements of their divisional {{lang|de|sturmbataillonen}}, flame-thrower {{lang|de|flammenwerfer}} and detachments of light artillery.

The advance ran into trouble as soon as it began, German artillery firing short; a flare signal warning the artillery was fired but went unnoticed and the signal was repeated, which silhouetted the advancing troops. The second and third waves hurried forward to escape the German bombardment and bunched up and Australian posts were encountered far in advance of the positions that were thought to be occupied, the recent move forward of the Australian outpost line having gone undetected. Australian small-arms fire was sufficient to stop the German advance; soon after dawn another tow companies went forward to plug a gap in the centre of the attack but German artillery-fire failed to suppress the rifle and machine-gun fire from the Australian infantry and at {{nowrap|3:00 p.m.}} the attacking troops were ordered to retire. The German infantry retirement, with eleven Australian prisoners, was untroubled and outposts were left on the right flank, south of the Bapaume\u2013Cambrai road, covering the left flank of the 38th Division.{{sfn|Bean|1982|pp=396\u2013397}}\n\n===38th Division===\nFive battalions of infantry from the 38th Division attacked from the village of M\u0153uvres and return-fire from Australian outposts caused the attacking waves to merge, the third wave suffering severe casualties from machine-gun fire.

At {{nowrap|5:45 a.m.}} news arrived of the success of the attack beyond the right of the divisional flank and the division was ordered to attack Louveral along with the 3rd Guard Division. Just before {{nowrap|8:00 a.m.}} news arrived that the 3rd Guard Division was in Louveral park and the 38th Divisional artillery was ordered to lengthen its range to beyond the village. After two hours the report was found to be false and a plan to attack the park at noon after another artillery preparation when reports arrived at {{nowrap|10:30 a.m.}} that the advance of the divisions on either flank had been stopped with many casualties and that the 2nd Guard Reserve Division had been forced back to the {{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}}.

During the attack the left and centre battalions surprised and overran posts of the 11th Australian Battalion but then ran into camouflaged machine-gun nests which had to be attacked. The process of reducing the Australian machine-guns was costly and even with reinforcements from the second wave the advance was halted. On the right flank of Regiment Guard Fusilier, the attack was stopped by the left flank company of the 11th Australian Battalion.{{sfn|Bean|1982|pp=397\u2013398}} On the right flank, the III {{lang|de|Bataillon}} {{lang|de|Regiment Lehr}} crossed the path of a battalion of the 2nd Guard Reserve Division and was so badly delayed that it reached its assembly area an hour late. The regiment advanced at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.}} instead of {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.,}} its attack was spotted immediately and driven under cover except on the right. Some troops got into Lagnicourt with the 2nd Guard Reserve Division and retired at the same time, the left flank remaining until {{nowrap|8;00 p.m.}}{{sfn|Bean|1982|pp=397\u2013398}}\n\n===2nd Guard Reserve Division===\nThe infantry of the 2nd Guard Reserve Division ({{lang|de|Generalmajor}} {{ill|Axel von Petersdorff|de}}) knew the ground, having fought over it while retiring on the {{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}}. Petersdorff dispensed with the preliminary hurricane bombardment due from {{nowrap|3:00 to 3:20 a.m.,}} to get the attackers into the Australian artillery positions before the alarm was raised. I {{lang|de|Bataillon}} RIR 91 (I/RIR 91) provided a flank guard to the north, I and III/RIR 77 attacked on the right and centre, with the I and III/RIR 15 on the left. The number of attackers, their knowledge of the ground and the silent approach succeeded and RIR 15 reported at {{nowrap|3:25 a.m.}} that it had received only sporadic machine-gun fire. At {{nowrap|3:50 a.m.}} RIR 77 sent a message that the spur between Noreuil and Lagnicourt had been captured with few losses and no artillery-fire from the defenders, RIR 15 occupying Lagnicourt at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.}} At {{nowrap|5:15 a.m.}} I/RIR 77 attacked Noreuil up the valley of the Hirondelle stream and III/RIR 77 tried to capture the Australian artillery near the village. On the left flank, RIR 15 were surprised to overrun the Australian artillery in the Lagnicourt valley, thought still to be near Vaulx-Vraucourt, whose move had not been seen by German air reconnaissance. At about {{nowrap|6:00 a.m.}} the German troops in the Hirondelle valley and the spur began to receive artillery-fire from the Australian guns west of Ecoust and at Morchies, directed by the crew of a British artillery-observation aircraft who flew over the battlefield at very low altitude.{{sfn|Bean|1982|pp=389\u2013399}}\n\nThe increasing quantity of artillery-fire stopped the German advance by {{nowrap|7:15 a.m.}} and reports arrived that RIR 15 was withdrawing, followed by the artillery-observation aircraft. The regiment was ordered to recapture the spur at about {{nowrap|8:15 a.m.}} but the commanders of III/RIR 77 and I/RIR 15 had conferred on the Noreuil\u2013Lagnicourt road and decided to withdraw. The 9th Company RIR 77 had advanced towards Noreuil over the spur and was cut off but the rest moved back under artillery- and machine-gun fire to a line about {{cvt|1000|yd|m|0}} in advance of the {{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}}, which was under severe bombardment, until {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} when the troops returned to their positions behind a line of outposts; the bombardment died down and the troops in the outposts returned by {{nowrap|11:50 a.m.}} The division claimed to have demolished 22 guns, damaged another eleven and taken 283 prisoners as pioneers blocked wells in Lagnicourt by detonating demolition charges not blown when the village had been captured on 26 March. Paperwork showing the dispositions of the 1st Australian Division were also recovered.{{sfn|Bean|1982|p=399}}\n\n===1st Australian Division===\nAt {{nowrap|4:05 a.m.}} a sentry alerted a post of the 3rd Australian Battalion, 1st Australian Brigade which opened rapid fire with Lewis guns and rifles and repulsed the troops of the 4th ''Ersatz'' Division but moments later all the posts on about {{cvt|1000|yd|m|0}} were attacked. The German troops were visible in the glare of their flares and were shot down or forced to retreat. On the left flank, the 4th Australian Battalion similarly repulsed attacks by the 38th Division but lost a post on the road east from Demicourt to a {{lang|de|Flammenwerfer}} attack and posts around the Bapaume\u2013Cambrai road were forced to retreat. Counter-attacks failed but the troops in Boursies held on with reinforcements. A post in a chapel about {{cvt|300|yd|m|0}} east of Boursies was subjected to a determined attack but survived and the brigade commander boldly sent two companies from Beaumetz to reinforce the 3rd Australian Brigade to the north, which was under attack by part of the 38th Division and the 3rd Guard Division.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=371\u2013372}}\n\nThe attack on the 3rd Australian Brigade had begun with a hurricane bombardment at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.;}} the 11th Australian Battalion on the right repulsed a frontal attack but German troops pressed forward along a gully on the Australian right and attacked the posts one by one from front and behind. The post garrisons fought on and gained time for a reserve company and the reinforcements from the 10th Battalion to form a line from the original position, bending back to the 4th Australian Battalion north of Boursies. The left flank of the 12th Australian Battalion was attacked first and the right flank about an hour later and easily repulsed the Germans but as the sun rose many troops of the 2nd Guard Reserve Division could be seen south of Lagnicourt. The left flank company of the 12th Australian Battalion and the right of the 17th Australian Battalion (5th Australian Brigade, 2nd Australian Division) were overrun without the warning of a preliminary bombardment. The German infantry rushed Lagnicourt and in places advancing Germans and retreating Australians moved in parallel in the twilight.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n===2nd Australian Division===\nOnly the 17th Australian Battalion of the 5th Australian Brigade, 2nd Australian Division was involved in the attack and was pushed back to the Bullecourt\u2013Lagnicourt road and then a trench further back covering Noreuil. The German infantry had captured four batteries of the II Australian Field Artillery Brigade at Lagnicourt and three of the I Australian Field Artillery Brigade further west. The Germans were within {{cvt|1500|yd|mi|0}} of another battery at Maricourt Wood and nine batteries south-west of Noreuil were also in danger. Two companies of the 12th Australian Battalion took over a sunken part of the Lagnicourt\u2013Beaumetz road, about {{cvt|300|yd|mi|0}} south of Lagnicourt and fought back-to-back against attacks from north and south. On the road to Beugny the HQ of the 12th Australian Battalion held its ground until reinforced. By {{nowrap|6:20 a.m.}} the centre and left flank artillery groups of the division barraged Lagnicourt and Noreuil and the heavy guns of the 1st Anzac Corps ignored the danger of being captured and continued to fire. Australian resistance prevented the Germans debouching from Lagnicourt to the south or south-east. The commander of the 5th Australian Brigade secured Noreuil, a ridge between it and Noreuil and higher ground near Bois de Vaulx.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\nThe 19th Australian Battalion at Noreuil and the ridge was just in time to defeat an attack from Lagnicourt and another up the valley of the Hirondelle Stream. The 20th Australian Battalion made a careful advance from Vaulx Vraucourt and reached the Morchies\u2013Noreuil road by {{nowrap|7:00 a.m.}} As soon as it was light, the Germans in the salient from Lagnicourt to south of Noreuil had come under fire from three sides and the 9th Australian Battalion began the Australian reply. The 20th Australian Battalion attacked soon after as did the 19th Australian Battalion around Noreuil as soon as the barrage was lifted. Many of the German troops surrendered and others shot while retreating. Reports from a reconnaissance aircraft led to every gun in range bombarding the Hindenburg Line wire to catch German troops as they returned. Lagnicourt was quickly recaptured and found that only five field guns and a howitzer had been destroyed. Others had explosive charges on them but these had not been detonated, despite the Germans occupying the village for about two hours (the Germans who got back claimed 22 guns destroyed). German covering posts from Lagnicourt to Demicourt returned at dusk.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=374\u2013375}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n\n[[File:Lewis Gun (derivated).jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|Lewis Gun}}]]\nIn 1933 [[Charles Bean]], the Australian official historian, wrote that 23 infantry battalions and attached storm troops, amounting to 16,000 men, had attacked 4,000 Australian troops, reached the objective in only one place and had soon been forced back, with about double the casualties that they had inflicted. Bean wrote that in his war diary (volume II, p.143 et seq.), Rupprecht had concluded that apart from the destruction of 22 guns {{lang|de|Sturmbock}}  had been something of a failure and cost about nine per cent of the attacking force. Rupprecht made no comment about the claim made by Moser that the attack had compelled the Australians to reinforce the area and OHL apparently did not believe that {{lang|de|Sturmbock}} reduced the pressure at Arras.{{sfn|Bean|1982|pp=399\u2013401}}\n\nThe only reserves that were moved after the attack were within the 1st Anzac Corps. German prisoners complained about the short notice of the attack and lack of time to reconnoitre, which was also noted in the divisional after-action reports read by Rupprecht. Moser called the operation the latest example of a big attack on the western front and that a memorandum was published containing a collation of the reports. The Germans had found that the Australian [[Lewis gun]]s had been of great effectiveness, \"cleverly emplaced and bravely fought\" and many reports noted the need for a similar weapon.{{sfn|Bean|1982|pp=399\u2013401}}\n\nIn 1939, the authors of volume XII of {{lang|de|Der Weltkrieg}}, the {{lang|de|Reichsarchiv}} official history, wrote that the success of the attack was limited by the short notice and insufficient artillery support. The authors agreed with Moser that several days were necessary to arrange a night attack but disagreed that the situation at Arras was too dangerous to delay; the preparations could have been carried out over a longer period and been camouflaged to retain surprise.{{sfn|Reichsarchiv|1939|p=242}} Jack Sheldon wrote in 2015 that the Fifth Army reacted to the attack by consolidating its positions in the area as quickly as possible. That the Australians had been surprised and that their artillery had been vulnerable led to more advanced posts being established and many more clashes between patrols in no man's land.{{sfn|Sheldon|2015|p=236}}\n\n{{quote|The British (sic) seemed not to have been expecting our morning visit.

The attack was described as a costly success, the German suffering {{nowrap|1,600 casualties}} and losing {{nowrap|360 prisoners.}} Most of the casualties came from well-positioned machine-guns and because some troops attacked late and were impeded by marshy ground, one battalion being delayed so badly that it attacked at dawn.{{sfn|Reichsarchiv|1939|p=242}} In the Australian Official History volume IV, ''The Australian Imperial Force in France, 1917'' (1933 [1982]) Charles Bean wrote that the attackers suffered {{nowrap|2,313 casualties,}} {{nowrap|829 in}} the 2nd Guard Reserve Division, {{nowrap|545 in}} the 3rd Guard Division, {{nowrap|519 in}} the 38th Division and {{nowrap|420 in}} the 4th {{lang|de|Ersatz}} Division; the Australians took {{nowrap|362 prisoners.}} Bean wrote that the German divisions exaggerated their bag of prisoners, the 2nd Guard Reserve Division claiming {{nowrap|283 alone.}} The 1st Anzac Corps suffered {{nowrap|1,010 casualties,}} of which {{nowrap|646 were}} suffered by the 1st Australian Division and {{nowrap|364 by}} the 2nd Australian Division; a minimum of {{nowrap|300 Australians}} were taken prisoner.{{sfn|Bean|1982|pp=399, 393}} [[Cyril Falls]], the British official historian, wrote in the ''[[History of the Great War]]'' (1917 part I, 1940 [1990]) that the 2nd Guard Reserve Division suffered more than {{nowrap|800 casualties,}} the greatest loss among the divisions involved.{{sfn|Falls|1992|p=377}} In ''The Blood Tub'' (1998 [2000]), Jonathan Walker wrote that the Australians suffered more than {{nowrap|1,000 casualties}} and the loss of five artillery pieces, inflicting {{nowrap|2,300 casualties}} on the attackers.{{sfn|Walker|2000|p=119}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n\nThe front of the 27th Division was quiet on 15 April but 16 April was a fine spring day and bombardments from artillery up to {{cvt|240|mm|in|0|order=flip}} fell on the area, indicating that another attack was likely. Grenadier Regiment 123 moved into line between Infantry Regiment 120 and Infantry Regiment 124 and the right flank of the 2nd Guard Reserve Division closed up to IR 124, narrowing the regimental frontages and  increasing the depth of the defence. The regiments had four companies in the front line, two in close support and two in reserve in the {{lang|de|Artillerieschutzstellung}}; the 1st {{lang|de|Musketen}} Company, equipped with light machine-guns, reinforced the infantry. Resting units only moved back {{cvt|4|-|5|km|mi|0|order=flip}} and were kept busy repairing defences and digging more reserve positions at night. An attack was anticipated on a line from Bullecourt to Riencourt and Qu\u00e9ant because of the extent of British artillery-fire and [[strafing]] attacks by British aircraft. German artillery replied with harassing and destructive bombardments which, at dawn every day, were directed at assembly areas and jumping-off lines.{{sfn|Sheldon|2015|pp=236\u2013237}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bean|1982}}\n|series=[[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914\u20131918]] |volume=IV |title=The Australian Imperial Force in France, 1917 |chapter=Chapter X: Lagnicourt \u2013 The German Counter-stroke |pages=355\u2013403 |last=Bean |first=C.

Four German divisions conducted a spoiling attack on the positions of the [[I ANZAC Corps|1st Anzac Corps]] of the British [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]]. The attack was to delay the advance of the Fifth Army towards the Hindenburg Line, causing as many casualties and destroying as much equipment, particularly artillery, as possible.\n\n{{lang|de|Sturmbock}} was also to deprive the British of the means to attack {{lang|de|Gruppe Arras}} ([[IX Reserve Corps (German Empire)|IX Reserve Corps]]) as it fought the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] (9 April to 16 May 1917) and {{lang|de|Gruppe Qu\u00e9ant}} ([[XIV Reserve Corps (German Empire)|XIV Reserve Corps]]) to the south. The German commanders hoped to gain time to prepare more defences and to show that the retirement to the [[Hindenburg Line]] had not diminished German morale or the ability to attack. The Fifth Army was recovering from the [[First attack on Bullecourt]] (11 April) and preparing for the [[Battle of Bullecourt]] 3\u201317 May 1917, a bigger effort.\n\nThe attack by two divisions of {{lang|de|Gruppe Qu\u00e9ant}} and two divisions of {{lang|de|Gruppe Cambrai}} to the south, fell on the positions of the [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Australian Division]] and [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Australian Division]]. The Australians repulsed the attacks, except at Lagnicourt, where German troops broke in, took prisoners destroyed six artillery pieces and recovered confidential documents. Australian counter-attacks cut off some of the attackers and inflicted {{nowrap|2,313 casualties}} against {{nowrap|1,010 Australian.}}\n\nThe Fifth Army hurried forward more artillery and consolidated its defences, adding more advanced posts. Preparations for the next attack at Bullecourt continued and the Germans reinforced the Hindenburg Line ({{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}}) defences in the area. The attack was criticised by German commanders, especially its rushed preparations, sparse results and severe casualties.

The German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line ({{lang|de|Siegfriedstellung}}) forestalled the British attack and the Fifth Army was ordered to push back German rearguards and prepare to attack the Hindenburg Line between Qu\u00e9ant and Bullecourt, to support the Third Army offensive, a much more difficult task. The Fifth Army had been stripped of divisions and artillery and bringing up the remaining guns and ammunition over the supply desert created by German demolitions was slow. The Hindenburg Line was far more formidable than the decrepit defences abandoned during the withdrawal but if the Fifth Army could penetrate the Hindenburg Line, the task of the Third Army, advancing south-eastwards down the Arras\u2013[[Cambrai]] road would be eased. Bullecourt was {{cvt|3.5|mi|km|0}} from the road at [[Vis-en-Artois]] and under {{cvt|2|mi|km|0}} at [[Fontaine-l\u00e8s-Croisilles]], the first objective of the [[Cavalry Corps (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Corps]] advancing in front of the Third Army.{{sfn|Falls|1992|p=357}}\n\nGough suggested that the Fifth Army could support the main offensive but for lack of means could only attack on a narrow front. Bullecourt was substituted for Qu\u00e9ant which was behind four defensive positions. The attack would then pivot to the right flank to capture the junction of the Hindenburg Line and the [[Drocourt, Pas-de-Calais|Drocourt]]\u2013Qu\u00e9ant Switch Line ({{lang|de|Wotanstellung}}). If successful, the [[1st Indian Cavalry Division|4th Cavalry Division]] would pass through to meet the Cavalry Corps from Arras. Fifth Army attacks on 2 April captured the German outpost villages from [[Doignies]] to Croisilles and Gough ordered that risks be taken to advance as much heavy artillery as possible. On 5 April Gough issued orders to the [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] and [[I ANZAC Corps|1st Anzac Corps]] for an attack on a {{cvt|3500|yd|mi+km}} front with Bullecourt in the centre. [[Riencourt]] was the second objective and [[Hendecourt-l\u00e8s-Cagnicourt|Hendecourt]] the third objective, where the 4th Cavalry Division was to advance to rendezvous with the Cavalry Corps. The Fifth Army received D Company, [[Royal Tank Regiment|Tank Corps]], five tanks for each corps and two in army reserve. The heavy guns were delayed by German road demolitions and the field artillery had to be moved in relays due to a shortage of horses. The 4th Australian Division was not able to use all its seven artillery brigades until 8 April, even after hauling field guns with crews and ammunition by lorry. On the right of V Corps to the north, the [[62nd (2nd West Riding) Division]] took over from the 7th Division on 5 April; both divisional artilleries moved forward in stages and began wire cutting on 7 April.

On the left flank, the 4th Australian Battalion similarly repulsed attacks by the 38th Division but lost a post on the road east from Demicourt to a {{lang|de|Flammenwerfer}} attack and posts around the Bapaume\u2013Cambrai road were forced to retreat. Counter-attacks failed but the troops in Boursies held on with reinforcements. A post in a chapel about {{cvt|300|yd|m|0}} east of Boursies was subjected to a determined attack but survived and the brigade commander boldly sent two companies from Beaumetz to reinforce the 3rd Australian Brigade to the north, which was under attack by part of the 38th Division and the 3rd Guard Division.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=371\u2013372}}\n\nThe attack on the 3rd Australian Brigade had begun with a hurricane bombardment at {{nowrap|4:00 a.m.;}} the 11th Australian Battalion on the right repulsed a frontal attack but German troops pressed forward along a gully on the Australian right and attacked the posts one by one from front and behind. The post garrisons fought on and gained time for a reserve company and the reinforcements from the 10th Battalion to form a line from the original position, bending back to the 4th Australian Battalion north of Boursies. The left flank of the 12th Australian Battalion was attacked first and the right flank about an hour later and easily repulsed the Germans but as the sun rose many troops of the 2nd Guard Reserve Division could be seen south of Lagnicourt. The left flank company of the 12th Australian Battalion and the right of the 17th Australian Battalion (5th Australian Brigade, 2nd Australian Division) were overrun without the warning of a preliminary bombardment. The German infantry rushed Lagnicourt and in places advancing Germans and retreating Australians moved in parallel in the twilight.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n===2nd Australian Division===\nOnly the 17th Australian Battalion of the 5th Australian Brigade, 2nd Australian Division was involved in the attack and was pushed back to the Bullecourt\u2013Lagnicourt road and then a trench further back covering Noreuil. The German infantry had captured four batteries of the II Australian Field Artillery Brigade at Lagnicourt and three of the I Australian Field Artillery Brigade further west. The Germans were within {{cvt|1500|yd|mi|0}} of another battery at Maricourt Wood and nine batteries south-west of Noreuil were also in danger. Two companies of the 12th Australian Battalion took over a sunken part of the Lagnicourt\u2013Beaumetz road, about {{cvt|300|yd|mi|0}} south of Lagnicourt and fought back-to-back against attacks from north and south. On the road to Beugny the HQ of the 12th Australian Battalion held its ground until reinforced. By {{nowrap|6:20 a.m.}} the centre and left flank artillery groups of the division barraged Lagnicourt and Noreuil and the heavy guns of the 1st Anzac Corps ignored the danger of being captured and continued to fire. Australian resistance prevented the Germans debouching from Lagnicourt to the south or south-east. The commander of the 5th Australian Brigade secured Noreuil, a ridge between it and Noreuil and higher ground near Bois de Vaulx.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\nThe 19th Australian Battalion at Noreuil and the ridge was just in time to defeat an attack from Lagnicourt and another up the valley of the Hirondelle Stream. The 20th Australian Battalion made a careful advance from Vaulx Vraucourt and reached the Morchies\u2013Noreuil road by {{nowrap|7:00 a.m.}} As soon as it was light, the Germans in the salient from Lagnicourt to south of Noreuil had come under fire from three sides and the 9th Australian Battalion began the Australian reply. The 20th Australian Battalion attacked soon after as did the 19th Australian Battalion around Noreuil as soon as the barrage was lifted. Many of the German troops surrendered and others shot while retreating. Reports from a reconnaissance aircraft led to every gun in range bombarding the Hindenburg Line wire to catch German troops as they returned. Lagnicourt was quickly recaptured and found that only five field guns and a howitzer had been destroyed. Others had explosive charges on them but these had not been detonated, despite the Germans occupying the village for about two hours (the Germans who got back claimed 22 guns destroyed). German covering posts from Lagnicourt to Demicourt returned at dusk.{{sfn|Falls|1992|pp=374\u2013375}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n\n[[File:Lewis Gun (derivated).jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|Lewis Gun}}]]\nIn 1933 [[Charles Bean]], the Australian official historian, wrote that 23 infantry battalions and attached storm troops, amounting to 16,000 men, had attacked 4,000 Australian troops, reached the objective in only one place and had soon been forced back, with about double the casualties that they had inflicted. Bean wrote that in his war diary (volume II, p.143 et seq.), Rupprecht had concluded that apart from the destruction of 22 guns {{lang|de|Sturmbock}}  had been something of a failure and cost about nine per cent of the attacking force. Rupprecht made no comment about the claim made by Moser that the attack had compelled the Australians to reinforce the area and OHL apparently did not believe that {{lang|de|Sturmbock}} reduced the pressure at Arras.{{sfn|Bean|1982|pp=399\u2013401}}\n\nThe only reserves that were moved after the attack were within the 1st Anzac Corps. German prisoners complained about the short notice of the attack and lack of time to reconnoitre, which was also noted in the divisional after-action reports read by Rupprecht. Moser called the operation the latest example of a big attack on the western front and that a memorandum was published containing a collation of the reports. The Germans had found that the Australian [[Lewis gun]]s had been of great effectiveness, \"cleverly emplaced and bravely fought\" and many reports noted the need for a similar weapon.{{sfn|Bean|1982|pp=399\u2013401}}\n\nIn 1939, the authors of volume XII of {{lang|de|Der Weltkrieg}}, the {{lang|de|Reichsarchiv}} official history, wrote that the success of the attack was limited by the short notice and insufficient artillery support. The authors agreed with Moser that several days were necessary to arrange a night attack but disagreed that the situation at Arras was too dangerous to delay; the preparations could have been carried out over a longer period and been camouflaged to retain surprise.{{sfn|Reichsarchiv|1939|p=242}} Jack Sheldon wrote in 2015 that the Fifth Army reacted to the attack by consolidating its positions in the area as quickly as possible. That the Australians had been surprised and that their artillery had been vulnerable led to more advanced posts being established and many more clashes between patrols in no man's land.{{sfn|Sheldon|2015|p=236}}\n\n{{quote|The British (sic) seemed not to have been expecting our morning visit.

The attack was described as a costly success, the German suffering {{nowrap|1,600 casualties}} and losing {{nowrap|360 prisoners.}} Most of the casualties came from well-positioned machine-guns and because some troops attacked late and were impeded by marshy ground, one battalion being delayed so badly that it attacked at dawn.{{sfn|Reichsarchiv|1939|p=242}} In the Australian Official History volume IV, ''The Australian Imperial Force in France, 1917'' (1933 [1982]) Charles Bean wrote that the attackers suffered {{nowrap|2,313 casualties,}} {{nowrap|829 in}} the 2nd Guard Reserve Division, {{nowrap|545 in}} the 3rd Guard Division, {{nowrap|519 in}} the 38th Division and {{nowrap|420 in}} the 4th {{lang|de|Ersatz}} Division; the Australians took {{nowrap|362 prisoners.}} Bean wrote that the German divisions exaggerated their bag of prisoners, the 2nd Guard Reserve Division claiming {{nowrap|283 alone.}} The 1st Anzac Corps suffered {{nowrap|1,010 casualties,}} of which {{nowrap|646 were}} suffered by the 1st Australian Division and {{nowrap|364 by}} the 2nd Australian Division; a minimum of {{nowrap|300 Australians}} were taken prisoner.{{sfn|Bean|1982|pp=399, 393}} [[Cyril Falls]], the British official historian, wrote in the ''[[History of the Great War]]'' (1917 part I, 1940 [1990]) that the 2nd Guard Reserve Division suffered more than {{nowrap|800 casualties,}} the greatest loss among the divisions involved.{{sfn|Falls|1992|p=377}} In ''The Blood Tub'' (1998 [2000]), Jonathan Walker wrote that the Australians suffered more than {{nowrap|1,000 casualties}} and the loss of five artillery pieces, inflicting {{nowrap|2,300 casualties}} on the attackers.{{sfn|Walker|2000|p=119}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n\nThe front of the 27th Division was quiet on 15 April but 16 April was a fine spring day and bombardments from artillery up to {{cvt|240|mm|in|0|order=flip}} fell on the area, indicating that another attack was likely. Grenadier Regiment 123 moved into line between Infantry Regiment 120 and Infantry Regiment 124 and the right flank of the 2nd Guard Reserve Division closed up to IR 124, narrowing the regimental frontages and  increasing the depth of the defence. The regiments had four companies in the front line, two in close support and two in reserve in the {{lang|de|Artillerieschutzstellung}}; the 1st {{lang|de|Musketen}} Company, equipped with light machine-guns, reinforced the infantry. Resting units only moved back {{cvt|4|-|5|km|mi|0|order=flip}} and were kept busy repairing defences and digging more reserve positions at night. An attack was anticipated on a line from Bullecourt to Riencourt and Qu\u00e9ant because of the extent of British artillery-fire and [[strafing]] attacks by British aircraft. German artillery replied with harassing and destructive bombardments which, at dawn every day, were directed at assembly areas and jumping-off lines.{{sfn|Sheldon|2015|pp=236\u2013237}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bean|1982}}\n|series=[[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914\u20131918]] |volume=IV |title=The Australian Imperial Force in France, 1917 |chapter=Chapter X: Lagnicourt \u2013 The German Counter-stroke |pages=355\u2013403 |last=Bean |first=C.

The faculty traces its history back to the [[Faculty of Theology, Old University of Leuven|Faculty of Theology founded in 1432]], with a hiatus between 1797 and 1834 due to the French Revolution. In 1968 the faculty was divided into Flemish and French speaking departments, and they exist today as faculties of two separate universities : the '''Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies''' of the [[KU Leuven|Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] (KU Leuven), and the '''Faculty of Theology''' of the [[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain|University of Louvain]] (UCLouvain), which moved to [[Louvain-la-Neuve]].\n\n==The Faculty of Theology of the Catholic University of Leuven from its foundation in 1834 to 1969==\n[[Image:Cardinal Mercier.png|thumb|left|[[Cardinal Mercier]]]]\n\nThe Faculty of Theology of the [[Catholic University of Mechlin]] then called [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] received primarily those students having already completed two years of philosophy and four years of theology as a part of their priestly education. A number of introductory courses were taught in the years 1853\u20131877. These courses were reorganized in 1898 as a ''Schola Minor'' in association with the American College in Leuven. From the very beginning Canon Law was taught by the Theological Faculty until both programs separated in accordance with the Apostolic Constitution ''Deus scientiarum Dominus'' in 1929.\n\nThe Faculty included among its first generation of professors prominent figures such as Jan Theodoor Beelen (Holy Scripture Chair) and Jean Baptiste Malou (Dogmatic Theology Chair). There was a revived preference for a positive and historically oriented theology in the form of historical-critical research at the end of the nineteenth century. In 1890 the rector [[Jean Baptiste Abbeloos]] appointed the German [[Bernard Jungmann]] to the newly organized ''Cours pratique d'histoire eccl\u00e9siastique''. Rapid progress was made in Biblical studies through a theological faculty, uniquely situated as embedded within a \u201ccomplete university,\u201d that played a role that should not be underestimated&mdash;particularly in the exchange of ideas, the application of the [[historical method]], and specialization in the study of ancient Eastern languages. Students followed lectures in Christian Archeology taught by [[Edmond Reusens]] and a new course: ''Histoire critique de l'Ancien Testament'', taught by [[Albin van Hoonacker]] in 1889. Six years later [[Alfred Cauchie]], who founded the ''[[Revue d'histoire eccl\u00e9siastique]]'', also became a professor in the theological faculty.\n\nAlong with the two previously mentioned professors, Professor [[Paulin Ladeuze]] joined the faculty as a specialist in the critical study of the New Testament. In addition, the faculty participated in the resurgence of [[Thomism]], which was propagated in Leuven by [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9-Joseph Mercier]] at the ''Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de Philosophie'', with the formation of a Chair of Philosophy of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] in 1882.\n\nAll of this enabled the Leuven Faculty of Theology to enter the twentieth century as a center of study built around the historical-critical approach to theology. During the [[Modernist Crisis]], Leuven theologians were spared from further censures thanks to the protection of Cardinal [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9-Joseph Mercier]]. The direction of critical research set by the faculty continued under a generation of professors who expanded the faculty's international reputation, specifically through contributions to the Second Vatican Council.\n\nAmong the theologians laboring during the Council's time were renowned exegetes such as Lucien Cerfaux, Joseph Coppens, and Albert Descamps, dogmatic theologians such as [[Charles Moeller (priest)|Charles Moeller]] and Gerard Philips and Gustave Thils; patristic theologians such as [[Joseph Lebon]] and Ren\u00e9 Draguet; church historians like Roger Aubert; and moral theologians such as Louis Janssens They all contributed to the renewing of theology in the twentieth century, including those that formed themselves in various movements ([[ecumenical movement]], [[liturgical movement]], renewal of Bible studies, and patristics). However, this had consequences for theologians like Ren\u00e9 Draguet, who agreed with the [[Nouvelle Th\u00e9ologie]] and, as a result, were condemned in 1942, along with theologians like [[Marie-Dominique Chenu]]. In the same year the Hoger Instituut voor Godsdienstwetenschappen ([[Higher Institute for Religious Studies]]) was established, where a theologian such as [[Edward Schillebeeckx]] briefly taught dogmatics. This institute was established with the goal of providing university level theological education to the laity. In 1958 the program developed into a complete four-year curriculum.\n[[File:Konzilseroeffnung 1.jpg|thumb|left|Second Session of [[Vatican II]]]]\nLeuven theologians also worked closely together with the Belgian episcopate, led by Cardinal [[Leo Joseph Suenens]], in Rome during the preparations for and the actual sessions of the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u20131965). Many of these theologians exerted a decisive influence upon a number of council documents (including ''[[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]'', ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', ''[[Dei verbum]]'', ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', and particularly ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', among others). This was made possible through their expertise, their willingness to collaborate with others (e.g. theologians such as [[Yves Congar]] were offered lodging at the [[Pontifical Belgian College]] in Rome) and by holding several key positions (e.g. Msgr. Gerard Philips' role as adjunct-secretary of the Doctrinal Commission made him into the key architect of [[Vatican II]]'s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church).\nA painful period for the theological faculty, as it was for the entire university, was the end of the 1960s. Discord flared up among professors and students regarding the question of which language should be used for educating students. This came to expression, among other ways, in the so-called Leuven Flemish-movement, and the linguistic conflict led to the splitting of the University into a Dutch-language and a French-language part in 1969; As a result, the Theological Faculty was also split in two: the Dutch-language faculty remained in the Flemish town of Leuven and the French-language group went to be a part of the newly established ''[[Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain]]'' in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]]. From this point on this article deals only with the Dutch-language Faculty of Theology in Leuven{{POV statement|date=March 2010}}.\n\n==The current Faculty in Leuven (1970\u20132015)==\nDivision of the Leuven University had further consequences for the Theological Faculty. Preeminently, the professor corps was divided, and henceforth it became a Dutch language education and research body, along with an international English language program. In 1974 a new library was opened (called the Maurits Sabbe Library since 2004), which is one of the most extensive theological libraries in the world. This library houses various archive collections as well, including the [http://www.theo.kuleuven.be/page/centr_vatii/ Centre for the Study of the Second Vatican Council].\n\nDuring the postconciliar period, the number of [[lay theologian]]s increased strongly among professors and students. In 1970 the Higher Institute of Religious Studies was integrated to a greater extent into the faculty's full-time program. Following the decree for universities in 1991, this institute was completely integrated into the faculty's academic training.\n\nThe current faculty is a Roman Catholic Faculty of Theology, and as such stands in the tradition of the Old Faculty established in 1432. Both state diplomas or degrees in Theology and Canonical degrees are granted by the faculty, which organizes its programs according to the [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Sapientia Christiana'' of 1979. Nevertheless, students from various backgrounds and confessional denominations are enrolled in faculty programs. This helps to account for the faculty's international appeal among theological students who come from around the world to study in Leuven, or who attend an ever growing number of affiliated institutes, such as the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]]. Because it offers a completely English language program, research and education on the faculty has shifted from the French-speaking to the English-speaking world. Through the internationalization of the program, the Leuven faculty belongs to the group of theological faculties with the highest number of students around the world. In the 2011-2012 academic year, over 300 students were enrolled in the Dutch-language program, and the number of international students increased to 309. Approximately 160 students are preparing a doctoral dissertation under the guidance of the Leuven professoral corps.\nAlso, the Faculty offers support for alumni engaged in teaching on the level of secondary education and in the pastoral field, through supportive websites such as ''[http://www.kuleuven.be/thomas/ Thomas]'' and ''[http://www.pastoralezorg.be/ Elisabeth]''\n\nThe present faculty is led by Dean Mathijs Lamberigts, and three Vice-Deans: Johan De Tavernier (education), Johan Leemans (research) and B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Lemmelijn (Internationalisation).

The faculty traces its history back to the [[Faculty of Theology, Old University of Leuven|Faculty of Theology founded in 1432]], with a hiatus between 1797 and 1834 due to the French Revolution. In 1968 the faculty was divided into Flemish and French speaking departments, and they exist today as faculties of two separate universities : the '''Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies''' of the [[KU Leuven|Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] (KU Leuven), and the '''Faculty of Theology''' of the [[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain|University of Louvain]] (UCLouvain), which moved to [[Louvain-la-Neuve]].\n\n==The Faculty of Theology of the Catholic University of Leuven from its foundation in 1834 to 1969==\n[[Image:Cardinal Mercier.png|thumb|left|[[Cardinal Mercier]]]]\n\nThe Faculty of Theology of the [[Catholic University of Mechlin]] then called [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] received primarily those students having already completed two years of philosophy and four years of theology as a part of their priestly education. A number of introductory courses were taught in the years 1853\u20131877. These courses were reorganized in 1898 as a ''Schola Minor'' in association with the American College in Leuven. From the very beginning Canon Law was taught by the Theological Faculty until both programs separated in accordance with the Apostolic Constitution ''Deus scientiarum Dominus'' in 1929.\n\nThe Faculty included among its first generation of professors prominent figures such as Jan Theodoor Beelen (Holy Scripture Chair) and Jean Baptiste Malou (Dogmatic Theology Chair). There was a revived preference for a positive and historically oriented theology in the form of historical-critical research at the end of the nineteenth century. In 1890 the rector [[Jean Baptiste Abbeloos]] appointed the German [[Bernard Jungmann]] to the newly organized ''Cours pratique d'histoire eccl\u00e9siastique''. Rapid progress was made in Biblical studies through a theological faculty, uniquely situated as embedded within a \u201ccomplete university,\u201d that played a role that should not be underestimated&mdash;particularly in the exchange of ideas, the application of the [[historical method]], and specialization in the study of ancient Eastern languages. Students followed lectures in Christian Archeology taught by [[Edmond Reusens]] and a new course: ''Histoire critique de l'Ancien Testament'', taught by [[Albin van Hoonacker]] in 1889. Six years later [[Alfred Cauchie]], who founded the ''[[Revue d'histoire eccl\u00e9siastique]]'', also became a professor in the theological faculty.\n\nAlong with the two previously mentioned professors, Professor [[Paulin Ladeuze]] joined the faculty as a specialist in the critical study of the New Testament. In addition, the faculty participated in the resurgence of [[Thomism]], which was propagated in Leuven by [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9-Joseph Mercier]] at the ''Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de Philosophie'', with the formation of a Chair of Philosophy of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] in 1882.\n\nAll of this enabled the Leuven Faculty of Theology to enter the twentieth century as a center of study built around the historical-critical approach to theology. During the [[Modernist Crisis]], Leuven theologians were spared from further censures thanks to the protection of Cardinal [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9-Joseph Mercier]]. The direction of critical research set by the faculty continued under a generation of professors who expanded the faculty's international reputation, specifically through contributions to the Second Vatican Council.\n\nAmong the theologians laboring during the Council's time were renowned exegetes such as Lucien Cerfaux, Joseph Coppens, and Albert Descamps, dogmatic theologians such as [[Charles Moeller (priest)|Charles Moeller]] and Gerard Philips and Gustave Thils; patristic theologians such as [[Joseph Lebon]] and Ren\u00e9 Draguet; church historians like Roger Aubert; and moral theologians such as Louis Janssens They all contributed to the renewing of theology in the twentieth century, including those that formed themselves in various movements ([[ecumenical movement]], [[liturgical movement]], renewal of Bible studies, and patristics). However, this had consequences for theologians like Ren\u00e9 Draguet, who agreed with the [[Nouvelle Th\u00e9ologie]] and, as a result, were condemned in 1942, along with theologians like [[Marie-Dominique Chenu]].

born 15 September 1942) is a Zimbabwean murderer and politician who has served as [[President of Zimbabwe]] since 24 November 2017. A member of [[ZANU\u2013PF]] and a longtime ally of former President [[Robert Mugabe]], he held a series of Cabinet portfolios and was Mugabe's [[Vice-President of Zimbabwe|Vice-President]] until November 2017, when he was dismissed before coming to power in [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup d'\u00e9tat]]. He was inaugurated as President in August 2018 following the [[2018 Zimbabwean general election|2018 general election]].\n\nMnangagwa was born in 1942 in [[Zvishavane|Shabani]], [[Southern Rhodesia]], to a large [[Shona people|Shona]] family. His parents were farmers, and in the 1950s he and his family were forced to move to [[Northern Rhodesia]] because of his father's political activism. There, he became active in anti-colonial politics, and in 1963, he joined the newly-formed [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]], the militant wing of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU). He returned to Rhodesia in 1964 as leader of a group called the \"Crocodile Gang\", which attacked white-owned farms in the [[Eastern Highlands]]. In 1965, he bombed a train near Fort Victoria (now [[Masvingo]]) and was imprisoned for ten years, after which he was released and deported to the recently independent [[Zambia]]. He studied law at the [[University of Zambia]], and practiced as an attorney for two years before going to [[Portuguese Mozambique]] to rejoin ZANU. There he was assigned to be [[Robert Mugabe]]'s assistant and bodyguard, and accompanied him to the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], which resulted in the recognised independence of [[Zimbabwe]] in 1980.\n\nAfter independence, Mnangagwa held a series of senior cabinet positions under Mugabe. From 1980 to 1988, he was the country's first [[Minister of State for National Security in the President's Office (Zimbabwe)|Minister of State Security]], and oversaw the [[Central Intelligence Organisation]]. His role in the ''[[Gukurahundi]]'' massacres, in which thousands of [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] civilians were killed and which occurred during his tenure, is controversial. Mnangagwa was [[Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs|Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs]] from 1989 to 2000 and then served as [[List of Speakers of the House of Assembly of Zimbabwe|Speaker of the Parliament]] from 2000 until 2005, when he was demoted to [[Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities (Zimbabwe)|Minister of Rural Housing]] for openly jockeying to succeed the aging Mugabe. He returned to favour during the [[2008 Zimbabwean general election|2008 general election]], in which he ran Mugabe's campaign, orchestrating political violence against the opposition [[Movement for Democratic Change \u2013 Tsvangirai]]. Mnangagwa served as [[Ministry of Defence (Zimbabwe)|Minister of Defence]] from 2009 until 2013, when he became justice minister again. He was also appointed First Vice-President in 2014 and was widely considered to be a leading candidate to succeed Mugabe.\n\nMnangagwa's ascendancy was opposed by the President's wife, [[Grace Mugabe]], and her [[Generation 40]] political faction. He was dismissed from his positions by Mugabe in November 2017, and fled to [[South Africa]]. Soon after, General [[Constantino Chiwenga]], backed by elements of the [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]] and members of Mnangagwa's [[Lacoste (political faction)|Lacoste]] political faction, launched a [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]. After losing the support of ZANU\u2013PF, Mugabe resigned, and Mnangagwa returned to Zimbabwe to assume the presidency. He secured his first full term as President in the July 2018 election with 50.8% of the vote.\n\nMnangagwa is nicknamed \"{{lang|sn|Garwe}}\" or \"{{lang|sn|Ngwena}}\", which means \"the crocodile\" in the [[Shona language]],<ref name=\"Bearak, 2017\" /><ref name=\"ShonaDict\" /> initially because that was the name of the guerrilla group he founded, but later because of his political shrewdness. The faction within ZANU\u2013PF that supports him is called [[Lacoste (political faction)|Lacoste]] after [[Lacoste|the French clothing company whose logo is a crocodile]].<ref>{{Cite

America).ogg|listen|help=no}}); born 15 September 1942) is a Zimbabwean murderer and politician who has served as [[President of Zimbabwe]] since 24 November 2017. A member of [[ZANU\u2013PF]] and a longtime ally of former President [[Robert Mugabe]], he held a series of Cabinet portfolios and was Mugabe's [[Vice-President of Zimbabwe|Vice-President]] until November 2017, when he was dismissed before coming to power in [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup d'\u00e9tat]]. He was inaugurated as President in August 2018 following the [[2018 Zimbabwean general election|2018 general election]].\n\nMnangagwa was born in 1942 in [[Zvishavane|Shabani]], [[Southern Rhodesia]], to a large [[Shona people|Shona]] family. His parents were farmers, and in the 1950s he and his family were forced to move to [[Northern Rhodesia]] because of his father's political activism. There, he became active in anti-colonial politics, and in 1963, he joined the newly-formed [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]], the militant wing of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU). He returned to Rhodesia in 1964 as leader of a group called the \"Crocodile Gang\", which attacked white-owned farms in the [[Eastern Highlands]]. In 1965, he bombed a train near Fort Victoria (now [[Masvingo]]) and was imprisoned for ten years, after which he was released and deported to the recently independent [[Zambia]]. He studied law at the [[University of Zambia]], and practiced as an attorney for two years before going to [[Portuguese Mozambique]] to rejoin ZANU. There he was assigned to be [[Robert Mugabe]]'s assistant and bodyguard, and accompanied him to the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], which resulted in the recognised independence of [[Zimbabwe]] in 1980.\n\nAfter independence, Mnangagwa held a series of senior cabinet positions under Mugabe. From 1980 to 1988, he was the country's first [[Minister of State for National Security in the President's Office (Zimbabwe)|Minister of State Security]], and oversaw the [[Central Intelligence Organisation]]. His role in the ''[[Gukurahundi]]'' massacres, in which thousands of [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] civilians were killed and which occurred during his tenure, is controversial. Mnangagwa was [[Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs|Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs]] from 1989 to 2000 and then served as [[List of Speakers of the House of Assembly of Zimbabwe|Speaker of the Parliament]] from 2000 until 2005, when he was demoted to [[Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities (Zimbabwe)|Minister of Rural Housing]] for openly jockeying to succeed the aging Mugabe. He returned to favour during the [[2008 Zimbabwean general election|2008 general election]], in which he ran Mugabe's campaign, orchestrating political violence against the opposition [[Movement for Democratic Change \u2013 Tsvangirai]]. Mnangagwa served as [[Ministry of Defence (Zimbabwe)|Minister of Defence]] from 2009 until 2013, when he became justice minister again. He was also appointed First Vice-President in 2014 and was widely considered to be a leading candidate to succeed Mugabe.\n\nMnangagwa's ascendancy was opposed by the President's wife, [[Grace Mugabe]], and her [[Generation 40]] political faction. He was dismissed from his positions by Mugabe in November 2017, and fled to [[South Africa]]. Soon after, General [[Constantino Chiwenga]], backed by elements of the [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]] and members of Mnangagwa's [[Lacoste (political faction)|Lacoste]] political faction, launched a [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]. After losing the support of ZANU\u2013PF, Mugabe resigned, and Mnangagwa returned to Zimbabwe to assume the presidency. He secured his first full term as President in the July 2018 election with 50.8% of the vote.\n\nMnangagwa is nicknamed \"{{lang|sn|Garwe}}\" or \"{{lang|sn|Ngwena}}\", which means \"the crocodile\" in the [[Shona language]],<ref name=\"Bearak, 2017\" /><ref name=\"ShonaDict\" /> initially because that was the name of the guerrilla group he founded, but later because of his political shrewdness. The faction within ZANU\u2013PF that supports him is called [[Lacoste (political faction)|Lacoste]] after [[Lacoste|the French clothing company whose logo is a crocodile]].<ref>{{Cite
