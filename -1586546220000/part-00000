His abusive father Aftab Shakir Ahmed ([[Vijay Raaz]]) brings home a much younger second wife, much to the chagrin of the family. Murad nurtures a fascination for [[rap]] music. His longtime and overtly possessive girlfriend Safeena Firdausi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) is training to be a surgeon and routinely meets him in secret. \n\nForced to work part-time as a chauffeur after his father is injured, Murad starts to write, with his lyrics informed by the inequalities he observes while on the job. Making the acquaintance of local rapper Shrikant \"MC Sher\" Bhosle ([[Siddhant Chaturvedi]]) whom he saw performing in his college fest, he is drawn into performing his lyrics at underground shows and rap battles and eventually uploading a video on YouTube.\n\n[[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College]] student Shweta \"Sky\" Mehta ([[Kalki Koechlin]]), an evolving musician, reaches out to Murad and Sher after seeing the video, offering to collaborate on a new song. The accompanying video, which is shot in Dharavi, rapidly becomes popular. Murad shares an intimate moment with Sky, later lying to Safeena about it. When Safeena finds out, she reacts violently towards Sky by smashing a bottle of beer on her head. \n\nAs a result, she is brought in by the police but is not arrested as Sky doesn't press charges against her. Murad eventually breaks up with Safeena due to her possessive attitude. As Aftab's violence towards him, his brother and his mother escalates, Murad decides to leave home with his mother and brother and work full-time for his uncle Ateeq Khan ([[Vijay Maurya]]).\n\nLater, when Sky expresses her romantic feelings for him, he declines her as he still loves Safeena and decides to reconcile with her. Murad and Sher enter a contest to open for [[Nas]] at his Mumbai concert, and Murad advances to the finals after a successful rap battle. Murad's confidence grows from interacting with rap fans' appreciation of his performances, and he finally stands up to Aftab and Ateeq when they belittle his passion. He later gets back together with Safeena. He goes on to win the contest and becomes one of India's top rappers. The film ends with his friends, family  and Safeena watching him happily as he begins his opening performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ranveer Singh]] as Murad Ahmed a.k.a.

{"title_page": "Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters", "text_new": "''Mufaro\u2019s Beautiful Daughters'' is a children's picture book published in 1987 by [[John Steptoe]]. With deep rural African roots, Steptoe teaches his audience about the power of kindness, thoughtfulness, and why it is important to always do the right thing- even if you think no one is watching. This book illustrates the \"[[Cinderella]]\" theme in a new light, and also highlights the theme of jealousy. ''Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters'' won many awards for Steptoe's illustrations, and went on to be adapted into many different children's literature curriculums.\n\n== Brief Plot Summary ==\nIn this book, The Great King calls upon his citizens to present him with the most beautiful and worthy young women in the village so he can choose a wife. Mufaro has two daughters, Nyasha and Manyara, who he believes are both worthy to be queen. However, Manyara is very mean to her sister and the other villagers. Both sisters travel to meet the king and the king picks Nyasha because she was kind to everyone (he knew this because he shape-shifted into many different animals to watch the daughter's actions). Manyara goes on to be a servant in Nyasha and the king's household, and the story ends there.\n\n== Pivotal Points ==\n\n# '''Manyara is introduced as the villain''' (Steptoe, page 2):  Steptoe clearly states to the audience that Manyara is rude to her sister and teases her endlessly. This sets Manyara up to be the antagonist in the picture book.\n# '''Nyasha is introduced as selfless''' (Steptoe, page 2): In the wake of tormenting by her sister, Nyasha states that she will always love her sister because she is \"cleaver and strong and beautiful\". This act of unnecessary niceness portrays Nyasha as kind, gentle, and loving, and sets her up to be the protagonist in our story. \n# '''Nyasha meets Nyoka''' (Steptoe, page 7): Nyasha is tending to her garden when she meets a small green snake who she names \"Nyoka\". Nyoka is always at her side when she is tending to her garden and acts as a friend to her. \n# '''The Great King calls for a wife''' (Steptoe, page 8): Word is sent to the village that the Great King is looking for a wife and that the village must send all beautiful and worthy young women to meet the king. Mufaro is adamant that both daughters should go to meet the king because he believes they are both worthy enough to be a queen. \n# '''Manyara leaves early for the kingdom and runs into trouble''' (Steptoe, page 10): Manyara is met with a young hungry boy, an old women who gave advice, and a slew of laughing trees. Manyara did not feed the hungry boy, did not listen to the advice of the old lady, and did not follow the instructions when she approached the laughing trees. \n# '''Nyasha leaves for the kingdom''' (Steptoe, page 12): Nyasha leaves with her family to travel to the kingdom. During her travels she runs into the same three things her sister saw : a hungry boy, an old woman, and some laughing trees. However, Nyasha fed the hungry boy, listened to the old women, and followed the instructions of the laughing trees. \n# '''The Great King chooses Nyasha to be his wife''' (Steptoe, page 18): It is not revealed to the audience (and the characters) that Nyoka, the garden snake, was actually the prince all along. Nyoka transforms from snake to his true form as a human male, and chooses to marry Manyara.\n\n== Inspiration ==\nSteptoe derived his inspiration from the folktale, [[Kaffir Folk-lore|''Kaffir Folk-lore'',]] published by author G.M. Theal in 1895. Steptoe's illustrations reflect his time in studying an ancient city in [[Zimbabwe]]; the images of flowers and trees are exact replicas of the ones that lived during the reign of this unknown ancient city.\n\n== Characters ==\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mufaro (moo-FAR-oh): means \u201chappy man\u201d in [[Shona language|Shona]] (native language of Steptoe); the father of Nyasha and Manyara; has some power in the village, but it is unclear the extent of it\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyasha (n\u00e9e-AH-sha): means \u201cmercy\u201d in Shona; one of Mufaro's daughters; becomes queen at the end of the story\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manyara (mahn-YAR-ah): means \u201cashamed\u201d in Shona; one of Mufaro's daughters; becomes servant at the end of the story; is consistently mean to her sister, animals, and the other villagers\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyoka (n\u00e9e-YO-kah): means \u201csnake\u201d in Shona; is the king but we do not know that until the end of the story; the king shape-shifted into a snake (hence the name) to spy on the village women to decide which one is suitable to be his wife.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n* \"[[Cinderella]]\": very similar to the classic tale, popularized by Disney's version of the story, Steptoe mimics the storyline of a king looking for a suitable wife.<ref>Weikle-Mills, C. (2019). The Obscure Histories of Goosee Shoo-shoo and Black Cinderella: Seeking Afro-Caribbean Children's Literature in the Nineteenth Century. ''Children's Literature'' ''47'', 57-78.  doi:10.1353/chl.2019.0004.</ref> In past Cinderella stories the king/ prince chooses his wife based on her looks, but in Steptoe's version, the queen is chosen based on her personality.\n*Jealousy: throughout the story, Manyara is jealous of Nyasha, directly stating that Nyasha is their father's \"favorite\" out of the sisters; Manyara acts out and picks on Nyasha because of this.

With deep rural African roots, Steptoe teaches his audience about the power of kindness, thoughtfulness, and why it is important to always do the right thing- even if you think no one is watching. This book illustrates the \"[[Cinderella]]\" theme in a new light, and also highlights the theme of jealousy. ''Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters'' won many awards for Steptoe's illustrations, and went on to be adapted into many different children's literature curriculums.\n\n== Brief Plot Summary ==\nIn this book, The Great King calls upon his citizens to present him with the most beautiful and worthy young women in the village so he can choose a wife. Mufaro has two daughters, Nyasha and Manyara, who he believes are both worthy to be queen. However, Manyara is very mean to her sister and the other villagers. Both sisters travel to meet the king and the king picks Nyasha because she was kind to everyone (he knew this because he shape-shifted into many different animals to watch the daughter's actions). Manyara goes on to be a servant in Nyasha and the king's household, and the story ends there.\n\n== Pivotal Points ==\n\n# '''Manyara is introduced as the villain''' (Steptoe, page 2):  Steptoe clearly states to the audience that Manyara is rude to her sister and teases her endlessly. This sets Manyara up to be the antagonist in the picture book.\n# '''Nyasha is introduced as selfless''' (Steptoe, page 2): In the wake of tormenting by her sister, Nyasha states that she will always love her sister because she is \"cleaver and strong and beautiful\". This act of unnecessary niceness portrays Nyasha as kind, gentle, and loving, and sets her up to be the protagonist in our story. \n# '''Nyasha meets Nyoka''' (Steptoe, page 7): Nyasha is tending to her garden when she meets a small green snake who she names \"Nyoka\". Nyoka is always at her side when she is tending to her garden and acts as a friend to her. \n# '''The Great King calls for a wife''' (Steptoe, page 8): Word is sent to the village that the Great King is looking for a wife and that the village must send all beautiful and worthy young women to meet the king. Mufaro is adamant that both daughters should go to meet the king because he believes they are both worthy enough to be a queen. \n# '''Manyara leaves early for the kingdom and runs into trouble''' (Steptoe, page 10): Manyara is met with a young hungry boy, an old women who gave advice, and a slew of laughing trees. Manyara did not feed the hungry boy, did not listen to the advice of the old lady, and did not follow the instructions when she approached the laughing trees. \n# '''Nyasha leaves for the kingdom''' (Steptoe, page 12): Nyasha leaves with her family to travel to the kingdom. During her travels she runs into the same three things her sister saw : a hungry boy, an old woman, and some laughing trees. However, Nyasha fed the hungry boy, listened to the old women, and followed the instructions of the laughing trees. \n# '''The Great King choses Nyasha to be his wife''' (Steptoe, page 18): It is not revealed to the audience (and the characters) that Nyoka, the garden snake, was actually the prince all along. Nyoka transforms from snake to his true form as a human male, and chooses to marry Manyara.\n\n== Inspiration ==\nSteptoe derived his inspiration from the folktale, [[Kaffir Folk-lore|''Kaffir Folk-lore'',]] published by author G.M. Theal in 1895. Steptoe's illustrations reflect his time in studying an ancient city in [[Zimbabwe]]; the images of flowers and trees are exact replicas of the ones that lived during the reign of this unknown ancient city.\n\n== Characters ==\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mufaro (moo-FAR-oh): means \u201chappy man\u201d in [[Shona language|Shona]] (native language of Steptoe); the father of Nyasha and Manyara; has some power in the village, but it is unclear the extent of it\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyasha (n\u00e9e-AH-sha): means \u201cmercy\u201d in Shona; one of Mufaro's daughters; becomes queen at the end of the story\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Manyara (mahn-YAR-ah): means \u201cashamed\u201d in Shona; one of Mufaro's daughters; becomes servant at the end of the story; is consistently mean to her sister, animals, and the other villagers\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nyoka (n\u00e9e-YO-kah): means \u201csnake\u201d in Shona; is the king but we do not know that until the end of the story; the king shape-shifted into a snake (hence the name) to spy on the village women to decide which one is suitable to be his wife.\n\n== Themes ==\n\n* \"[[Cinderella]]\": very similar to the classic tale, popularized by Disney's version of the story, Steptoe mimics the storyline of a king looking for a suitable wife.<ref>Weikle-Mills, C. (2019). The Obscure Histories of Goosee Shoo-shoo and Black Cinderella: Seeking Afro-Caribbean Children's Literature in the Nineteenth Century. ''Children's Literature'' ''47'', 57-78.  doi:10.1353/chl.2019.0004.</ref> In past Cinderella stories the king/ prince chooses his wife based on her looks, but in Steptoe's version, the queen is chosen based on her personality.\n*Jealousy: throughout the story, Manyara is jealous of Nyasha, directly stating that Nyasha is their father's \"favorite\" out of the sisters; Manyara acts out and picks on Nyasha because of this. In the end of the novel, the act of jealousy is punished and seen as unfavorable to readers because the king choose the non-jealous sister to be queen.\n\n== Awards for ''Mufaro\u2019s Beautiful Daughters''==\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The [[Caldecott Medal]] (1988): The Caldecott Medal is awarded annually to celebrate the achievement of picture book.<ref>\"The Randolph Caldecott Medal\", American Library Association, November 30, 1999.\n\n<nowiki>http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/caldecottmedal/aboutcaldecott/aboutcaldecott</nowiki> (Accessed March 22, 2020)</ref>\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0[[Coretta Scott King Award]] for Illustrators (1988): The Coretta Scott King Award for Illustrators is awarded annually to one African American illustrator who demonstrates \"appreciation of African American culture and universal human values\".<ref>\"The Coretta Scott King Book Awards\", American Library Association, January 18, 2009.\n\n<nowiki>http://www.ala.org/rt/emiert/cskbookawards</nowiki> (Accessed March 22, 2020)</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nDue to the book's progressive nature of putting value on kindness and the positives of living in a natural world, the book was welcomed among scholars and celebrated for its pointant tale along with beautiful illustrations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/clarita-kohen/mufaros-beautiful-daughters/|title=Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It went on to become a part of children's education about the need for generosity,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.learningtogive.org/resources/mufaros-beautiful-daughters-literature-guide|title=Mufaro\u2019s Beautiful Daughters Literature Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> the importance of black representation in children's books,<ref>Muse, Daphne. \u201cBlack American Classics in Fiction and Poetry for Young Readers.\u201d ''American Visions'', vol. 8, no. 6, Dec. 1993, p. 33.

However, it does feature a chapter on desserts made with the related ''[[qatayef|qat\u0101yif]]'', meaning [[cr\u00eape]]s, from which the Turkish word ''kaday\u0131f'' and Greek word ''kata\u00effi'' derive. In one recipe, ''qat\u0101yif'' are stuffed with nuts, deep-fried, and topped with honey-sugar syrup, which is essentially unchanged in today's version.

The traditional version consists of noodle-like pastry soaked in an orangy syrup and  filled with a salty-sweet cheese, then cut into diamond-shaped pieces. Israeli kanafe is less sweet than the variety sold in Arab towns in Israel.<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/.premium-where-do-you-go-to-get-the-best-knafeh-in-tel-aviv-1.8531740 Where Do You Go to Get the Best Knafeh in Tel Aviv?

In  ''khishnah kanafeh'' the cheese is rolled in the pastry. A thick syrup of sugar, water, and a few drops of [[rose water]] or [[orange blossom]] water is poured on the pastry during the final minutes of cooking.
