The people take their name from the Algonquian, which is a  tribal term meaning \u201cAt the Great Hill\u201d - referring to the [[Blue Hills Reservation|Blue Hills]] overlooking Boston Harbor from the south - which was a ceremonial and sacred area for the people of the region.\n\nAs some of the first people to make contact with the European explorers and English colonists, the Massachusett and other coastal peoples were severely decimated from an outbreak of [[leptospirosis]] circa 1619, which had mortality rates as high as 90% in these areas.  This was followed by devastating impacts of [[virgin soil epidemic]]s such as [[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[scarlet fever]] and others to which the indigenous people lacked natural immunity.  Their territories, on the more fertile and flat coastlines, with access to coastal resources, was mostly taken over by English colonists, as the Massachusett were too few in number to put up any effective resistance.\n\nUnder the missionary [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], the majority of the Massachusett were converted to Christianity and settled in '[[Praying town]]s' established where the converted Native Americans were expected to submit to the colonial laws, accept some elements of English culture and forced to abandon their traditional religion, but were allowed to use their language.  Through intermediaries, Eliot learned the language and even published a [[translation of the Bible]].  The language, related to other [[Eastern Algonquian languages]] but more specifically, the regional languages of southern New England, would slowly fade, ceasing to serve as the primary language of the Massachusett communities by the 1750s, and the language was likely extinct by the early years of the nineteenth century.  The Massachusett language was shared with several other peoples in the region, and the Wampanoag preserved their dialect of the language until the death of its last speaker sometime in the 1890s.\n\nThe last of their common lands were sold in the early nineteenth century, loosening the community and social bonds that held the Massachusett families together, and most of the Massachusett were forced to settle amongst their English neighbors, but mainly settled the poorer sections of towns where they were segregated with Blacks, recent immigrants and other Native Americans.  The Massachusett mainly assimilated and integrated into the surrounding communities.\n\nTwo groups of Massachusett have received state recognition after the creation of the Massachusetts Commission on Indian Affairs.  The Ponkapoag Massachusett, descendants of the Praying Indians of Ponkapoag, centered around what is now [[Canton, Massachusetts]], and the Natick Massachusett-Nipmuc.  As the Natick were formed from a substantial input of Nipmuc families, and maintained close connection with the Nipmuc communities, the Natick Massachusett-Nipmuc are recognized as a tribe of Nipmuc, via their involvement with the [[Nipmuc Nation]].\n\n==Ethnonyms==\n===Endonyms===\n[[File:CantonMA LittleBlueHill.jpg|thumb|right|View of Little Blue Hill from atop Great Blue Hill.

The earliest English colonial records reveal several quite variant spellings such as  'Masichewsetta,' 'Masstachusit,' 'Masathulets,' 'Masatusets,' 'Massachussett,' etc.  The English name and pronunciation was likely influenced by 'Moswetuset,' as in [[Moswetuset Hummock]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]].  The name refers to the 'Great Small Wigwam,' likely referring to the shape of the [[hummock]] like a small ''[[wetu]]'' and the fact it was often the home of the local ''sachem'', but was also an important meeting place for regional leaders.

The amalgamation of various tribes and peoples and settlements weakened ethnic identities as the new communities came to identify more with the community.  For example, the Neponset tribe of what is now the area around Quincy were converted and settled into the Praying town of Ponkapoag, in what is now Canton, where they were joined by a handful of members of local Massachusett tribes, and came to be known as the Praying Indians of Ponkapoag.

Within Algonquian, Massachusett is in the Southern New England Algonquian (SNEA) sub-branch of the [[Eastern Algonquian]] branch of Algonquian languages.  The SNEA languages are so closely related, they can be considered dialects of one another and differ mainly in treatment of Proto-Algonquian retroflexes of *''\u03b8'' which yielded /n/ in Massachusett, /l/ in Nipmuc, /j/ in Narragansett and /r/ in Quiripi, leaving Massachusett classified as an SNEA n-dialect in this scheme.

Eliot had learned the language through a series of Indian interpreters and translators, mostly at Natick, and devised an orthography based on English conventions of the time.  Eliot would later teach Indians to read and write using hand-written catechisms that were copied.  Funding was granted for the Indian mission, allowing Eliot to publish several translations, ultimately leading up to the ''[[Eliot Indian Bible|Mamusse Wunneetupanatamwe Up-Biblum God]]'', which literally translates as 'The Whole Holy His-Bible God,' which was completed in 1663.  Beginning in 1651 and lasting until 1747, almost thirty translations and other teaching aids were produced in the Massachusett language and distributed to the Indians of the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth Colonies.  A school was established in Natick, where Indian men were trained in reading and writing and Christian theology and would later serve as clerks, ministers, deacons, administrators, interpreters and constables of the newly created '[[Praying town]]s' established by Eliot.  As the Indians became literate, they taught others to read and write, thus spreading its use.  Just before the outbreak of Metacomet's Rebellion, one-third of Indians were literate in only twenty years after Eliot taught the first Indians.<ref>Bourne, R. (1674).

The names of the Massachusett literate are named in colonial sources, such as William Ahaton and Aaron Pomham, who served as preachers in Ponkapoag; John Neesnummin of Natick, who helped both Eliot and the Mayhew family in translating works for the Indian audience; John Simons of Titicut and James Speen, a Natick Indian who later became preacher to the Nipmuc Indians of Pakachoag (now [[Auburn, Massachusetts]]).<ref>Andrews, E.

When the cornstalks were sturdy enough, beans were planted to trail up the cornstalks and fertilize the soil with their association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria and various {{lang|alg|ask\ua74ftasquash}} ({{lang|wam|ashk8tasqash}}) {{IPA|/a\u0283ku\u02d0task\u02b7a\u0283/}}, a collective term for various pumpkins, squash and gourds, were planted at the base to shade the crops and prevent weeds.<ref>Bragdon, K.

Massachusett women were tasked venturing out into the marshes, woods, meadows and rocky coasts to gather various plants that supplemented the diet and, during years of crop failure, was a necessity for survival.

The slightly warmer climate and the sandier soils of the coast prevented the abundance of the various local maple and boxwood trees that were tapped for their sap and where available, greatly limited their production.  Nectar-filled blossoms or various fruits could be boiled with water, thickened until it formed a syrup that could be used to sweeten drinks, make instant teas or preserve foods over the winter.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=25em|\n* ''[[Acer (plant)|Acer]]'' sp., 'maple' and 'box elder'\n* ''[[Acorus americanus]]'', 'American sweetflag'\n* ''[[Betula alleghaniensis]]'', 'yellow birch'\n* ''[[Betula lenta]]'', 'black birch'\n* ''Tilia americana'', 'elderflower' ('basswood tree')\n* ''[[Viburnum]]'' sp., flowers in spring and later fruit could be boiled into syrup.\n|}}\n\n====Hunting, trapping, fishing and shellfish collection====\nAs the Massachusett inhabited a coastal area with numerous river estuaries, lakes and ponds, fish was an important protein source.  Fish were caught using baited hooks carved from soft stones and bone, cast from shore or from canoes.  Deep-sea fish were caught using weighted lines, or could be attracted to the surface where they could be netted with {{lang|alg|pummee}} ({{lang|wam|pumee}}) {{IPA|/p\u0259mi\u02d0/}}, 'grease,' but specifically the residue of oily fish that were boiled to extract oil, in a process akin to [[chumming]].<ref>'English in contact.'

Elaborate fish-weirs, such as the [[Boylston Street Fishweir]], were constructed to channel the fish in rivers, or trap them with the outgoing tide, where they could be easily netted, speared or simply gathered in baskets. Marine mammals were also hunted.  Seals were captured when they came to rest on coast, whilst large whales were hunted with teams of Indians in canoes or when they occasionally stranded on shore.<ref>Bragdon, K. J. (1999). pp. 122-137.</ref>\n\nMen hunted various game and waterfowl with [[bow and arrow]], spear alone or spear with [[spear-thrower|atlatl]] or were caught in spring traps.  Smaller animals were caught by hand, nets and smaller traps.  Deer was an important animal for its ample furs and meat, and deer drives, with groups of men scaring deer out of the woods towards hunters waiting in ambush.  In winter, snowshoes and dogs aided the hunt.  To increase deer numbers, sections of forest were cleared by fire to increase grassy meadows where the fed.<ref>Bragdon, K. J. (1999). pp. 117-119.</ref>  No part of the animal was wasted, with the skins processed into furs and leathers for blankets, clothing and shoes; feathers, bone beads and quills were used to make jewelry and decorate personal items; fats rendered into greases and oils for nutrition, cosmetics or medical salves; snakeskin was fashioned into belts; porcupine quills and small bones were used for sewing and the sinews were chewed into bowstrings and cordage.<ref>Bragdon, K. J. (1999). pp. 105-107, 171-175.</ref>  With the exception of bears, valued for their large fat stores, the Indians avoided hunting large predators and birds of prey due to their religious customs.<ref>Bragdon, K. J. (1999). pp. 183-185.</ref>\n\nShellfish harvesting was another activity of Massachusett women, picking them off rocks at low tide or digging them up from the sand.  Shellfish were a major part of the diet, and the New England tradition of the [[clambake]] was inherited from the local peoples.  Large clam shells were used as spoons, scrapers, bowls or fashioned into hoes for farming, but they could also be carved into small beads used for [[wampum]].<ref>Bragdon, K. J.

The Massachusett, unlike the Wampanoag under [[Massasoit]], were fearful of the incursions of settlers and began stirring the other tribes in rebellion.  Although relations between the Pilgrims and the local Wampanoag were good, some of the Pilgrims and a handful of new settlers established the [[Wessagusset Colony]] in what is now [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]] in the territory of the Massachusett.  Relations soured as the Massachusett were already fearful of incursions into their territory and the Wessagussett settlers were ill-prepared for life in New England, thus resorting to stealing from the local Massachusett. The Massachusett were weakened, and the warrior [[Pecksuot]] was his men were killed along with a handful of settlers.<ref>Tremblay, R. (1972).

As a result of natural increase and the arrival of incoming English Puritans fleeing the religious persecutions in England more than doubled the population.  The Europeans brought with them pathogens to which the local Indians had no immunity, thus ravaging as [[virgin soil epidemic]]s.  A particularly virulent outbreak of [[smallpox]] lay waste to coastal communities, still recovering from the plague of 1619, as well as the interior tribes in 1634, practically ending any resistance to English settlement.  Further outbreaks of smallpox, influenza, scarlet fever, mumps and measles would strike again in 1648 and 1666, but although not as devastating, would continue to inflict heavy tolls well into the nineteenth century.  With little to no resistance from dying Indians, the English believed that God Himself had cleared the land for their arrival.  By the 1630s, the Indians of New England were already a minority in their own lands.<ref>Kohn, G. C. (2010). ''Encyclopedia of Plague and Pestilence''. (pp. 255-256).

In most cases, it was because the land had already been alienated by English settlement, often because the locals had already died off from disease.  The ''sachems'' began selling land at a price, often with stipulations allowing the Indians to collect, gather, fish or forage, but these arrangements were seldom honored by the English.  The English also did not understand the Indian concept of leasing land from the sachem, and instead thought of their arrangements as permanent land sales.  As a result of the rapid loss of land, the Massachusett and other local tribes sent their leaders to Boston for the 1644 Acts of Submission, bringing the Indians under the control of the colonial government and subject to its laws and Christian missionary attempts.  By the time of the submission, the Massachusett, a coastal people, had lost access to the sea and their shellfish collection sites.<ref>Cogley, R. W. (1999). ''John Eliot's Mission to the Indians before King Philip's War'''. (pp. 23-51). Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref>\n\nThe presence of the English was detrimental in several other ways.  The English demand for furs as a trade item had extirpated the beaver from coastal New England, forcing the Massachusett deeper into enemy territory to procure beaver pelts, thus leading to retaliatory attacks from the Mahican, armed by the Dutch, and the Abenaki and Tarratine, armed by the French, whereas the English banned the sales of firearms to the local tribes, rendering them defenseless.  The use of [[wampum]] by the Natives, mainly as a record keeper, sacred or ceremonial gift and at times exchanged for goods was erroneously thought of as currency.  As the English were able to mass-produce beads of glass with iron drills, the value of wampum deflated.  As the Indians became increasingly dependent on trade items of the English, this led to debts.  Alcoholism ran rampant as it was previously unknown to the Indians, but proved a scourge, tearing families apart.  Some English even resorted to getting Indians drunk so as to run up credit or so that they would be fined and forced to cede their land, which led to the ban of sales of hard cider and other spirits to the Indians.<ref name=\"Massachusetts General Court 1814 pp. 33\u2013802\"/>\n\n====Praying towns and praying Indians (1651\u20131675)====\n[[File:Eliot Church.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The Eliot Church in south Natick.  The church was built in 1828 where the Indian Church once stood.]]\n\nJohn Eliot's success with learning the language with the aid of Indian interpreters, such [[John Sassamon]], led him to attempt to preach to the Neponset tribe, led by [[Cutshamekin]], son of Chickatawbut, in 1646 but was rebuffed.  A year later, with better language skills and understanding of Native culture, Eliot succeeded in converting the Nonantum tribe led by [[Waban]].  Eliot began to petition the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony to set aside designated lands for the Indians, to prevent future conflicts over land, ensure a space for the Indians and to give the Indians a place separate from the colonists and their unconverted brethren.  Natick was officially set aside in 1651, with construction of a school to teach literacy and religion and train new Indian missionaries and a church begun shortly thereafter.  Cutshamekin later accepted the mission, and land was granted at Ponkapoag in what is now Canton, Massachusetts in 1654.<ref>Cogley, R. W. (1999). pp. .105-107.</ref>  The Plymouth Colony established similar communities of Praying towns, with Mattakeeset, in what is now Pembroke, and Titicut, in what is now Middleborough and parts of Bridgewater, set aside for the Massachusett people.  In addition, there were the unofficial Praying Indian districts of Cowate, Magaehnak and Pequimmid, but these communities were never raised to official Praying towns.  Twelve additional Praying towns were established in Nipmuc and Pawtucket territory in a defensive ring around the coastal settlements of the English.<ref name=\"Swanton\"/>\n\n[[File:CantonMA PonkapoagNorthLineMarker.jpg|thumb|left|Historical marker standing on the northern boundary of what was once the Praying town of Ponkapoag, now contained in the town of [[Canton, Massachusetts]].]]\nLife in the Praying towns was an interesting blend of English and Indian culture.  The Praying Indians had to adopt the Puritan Christianity of their English neighbors, as well as English assimilatory rules such as patriarchy, as the Massachusett were traditionally a matrilineal society where woman were not restrained, as well as English ideas of decency.  The Praying Indians also had to submit to English laws and adopted the administrative practices of the English town in their governance.  Otherwise, the daily affairs of administration and the Indian churches was conducted in the Massachusett language.  Some of the Praying Indians adopted English-style homes, [[animal husbandry]] and clothing.  However, the Indians were called to church by traditional drumming and not church bells, many of the Praying Indians continued to live a traditional lifestyle and live in the {{lang|alg|wetu}} and retained other aspects of traditional culture not in conflict with the tenets of Praying town life and English law.\n\nThe success of the Praying towns was in large part due to the traumatic experiences of European arrival.  Devastating epidemics that nearly wiped the people out could not be cured with traditional [[healing]] practices and spiritual rituals nor were the spirits of the land powerful enough to keep out the European invaders.  The promise of guaranteed land recognized by the invaders as untouchable to the onslaught of English colonists was also very promising.<ref>Cogley, R. W. (1999). pp. 111\u2013113.</ref>  The Native Americans viewed English land sales as [[lease]] agreements, as rights to land were granted by permission of the local ''sachem'' to use until it was no longer needed.  Indian land was sometimes just stolen by encroachment, squatting or allowing hungry cattle loose on their planting fields and ruining it.  Laws were passed allowing all \"unimproved\" land to be open to English settlement, opening hunting areas, coastal [[shellfish]] collection sites to eventual settlement.<ref name=\"Massachusetts General Court 1814 pp. 33\u2013802\">Massachusetts General Court.

Waite and Sons.</ref>  With the Praying towns granted official title to their land, the converts were able to continue some aspects of their cultural practices and subsistence patterns and removed some of the major threats to their land base.  The Praying Indians, however, often earned the ire of the traditionalist Indians for submitting to the English whereas the English questioned the loyalty of the Praying Indians to the colonial government and the sincerity of their [[religious conversion|conversions]].  In many ways, the grouping of Indians into land bases where they could be civilized of the Praying towns was a predecessor to the [[Indian reservation]]s that exist today.<ref>Cogley, R. W.

The submission of the local chiefs to the respective colonial governments and adoption of Christianity allowed the Indians to seek redress in the English court system and removed one of the prejudices against them.  The Praying Indians of Natick were brought to court several times by the English settlers of Dedham that claimed some of the land, but with Eliot's assistance, most of these attempts failed.  Most of the time, however, the Indians failed, as some of the Indian interpreters and chiefs ceded lands to curry favor from the English to maintain special privileges, such as the Nipmuc John Wampas, who betrayed the Nipmuc and Massachusett people by selling land to the settlers to which he had no claim, but these sales were upheld in later court challenges.  The Pawtucket sachem [[Wenepoykin]], son of [[Nanepashemet]] and [[Squaw Sachem of Mistick]], through kinship and family ties laid claim to much of Massachusett territory, and tried several times to petition the courts for lands lost in the turbulence of the 1633 epidemic that took both of his brothers to no avail, with most cases simply dismissed.<ref>Russel, F. (2018). ''An Early History of Malden''. Charleston, SC: The History Press.</ref>\n\nThe Massachusetts Bay Colony passed a series of harsh measures that earned the ire of the Native peoples.  All Indians, Christian and traditional religionists, were forced to observe the [[Christian Sabbath]] and were restricted from a wide range of activities, such as hunting, fishing and farming or entering the English towns, and heavy fines were imposed on those caught practicing the shamanic rights or consulting traditional spiritual leaders or healers.  Alcohol, firearms and many luxury goods were banned.  By this time, the Indians had already integrated into the economic system of the English, but were dealt a heavy blow as laws were passed restricting trade to appointed colonial agents, which gave the colonial government a monopoly on trade with the English and made the Indian farmers less competitive as they were not allowed direct access to English markets.  New laws allowed open settlement to any 'unimproved' lands, essentially anything that was not fenced in or with crops grown on it, threatening the wooded areas and meadows cleared by fire that were used for hunting and cultivation areas that were allowed to fallow.<ref name=\"Massachusetts General Court 1814 pp. 33\u2013802\"/>\n\n[[File:2017 Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant from Boston Harbor 1.jpg|thumb|left|Deer Island in Boston Harbor.  Construction of the wastewater treatment plant angered many local Native peoples for disturbing the remains of all those that died during forcible internment during King Philip's War due to lack of provisions, exposure and starvation.]]\n[[Waban]], leader of the Natick Praying Indians, had long warned the Massachusetts Bay Colony that the Nipmuc in the interior were growing impatient with the loss of their lands and that other tribal leaders were likely agitating for resistance, putting the leaders of the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies on high alert.  Tensions reached a boiling point for [[Metacomet]], also known as Philip, a son of Massasoit.  Metacomet's brother, [[Wamsutta]], was arrested and died in custody, likely murdered, for selling land to [[Roger Williams]] even though these lands and the Wampanoag tribe that sold the lands were not under the jurisdiction of the Plymouth Colony.  As rumors began to fly regarding Metacomet's plans, he ordered the death of his English-language interpreter, John Sassamon, who had earlier assisted Eliot, leading to a court trial in which several of Metacomet's men were charged and hanged for the murder.  Metacomet fled soon after, enlisting the aid of other tribes, such as the Nipmuc, Narragansett, Pawtucket, and drawing away some of the Praying Indians.  Even notable leaders that had worked with the English, such as Willlymachin, or Black James, ''sachem'' of the Praying town of Chaubanakongkomun (Chaubunagungamaug), and Wenepoykin, supported Metacomet's cause.\n\nThe Praying Indians mostly stayed neutral, and surrendered their weapons and accepted restrictions to their movements.  The Praying Indians endured attacks by their kinsfolk that supported Metacomet.  Just before the winter of 1675, colonial militia rounded up the Praying Indians forcibly interned them on [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]] in Boston Harbor.  Similarly, the Mattakeeset were marched to [[Clark's Island]].  With little food and clothing, many of the Indians perished from starvation, exposure and disease.  Many of the Praying Indians were recruited to serve as scouts, guides and to fill the ranks of the colonial militia, with a regiment recruited by [[Daniel Gookin]] sent to face Metacomet's warriors at Swansea, but it is known that other Massachusett aided the colonial militias in Lancaster, Brookfield and Mount Hope battles of the war.  Despite early victories, Metacomet was weakened by lack of resources and the help of the Praying Indians to the English.  Metacomet was later shot by a Wampanoag Praying Indian, [[John Alderman]], who was serving in the regiment of [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]], ending the war.<ref>Drake, J. D.

Most of the Odanak, although Western Abenaki speaking, were historically an amalgam of several Abenakian tribes with a significant part of their ancestry from the refugees of King Philip's War fleeing southern New England.]]The war proved very disruptive to Indian life in New England.  The warriors that supported Metacomet were executed in public displays, and like Metacomet's head, were kept on posts outside most major English settlements.  Those that were not executed, were gathered and sent to the slave markets in [[Bermuda]] where most would be forced to work on the sugar plantations, although some of the luckier ones, particularly women and children, were forced into servitude locally in English homes.  The Praying Indian survivors of internment, any Indians lucky enough to have been pardoned and any survivors regrouped at Natick, where they divided up amongst their old tribal groupings and pressed for a return to their lands.  By 1681, the Indians were allowed to return to their respective homes, but continued to face harassment, retaliatory attacks, local killings and abuse to their lands and property by their English neighbors.\n\nMany Indians fled the region, most seeking refuge with the Abenaki in the north or the Mahican to the west, away from English settlement.  Those that remained often joined kinsfolk in other tribes and people, leading to considerable internal migration as well.  The Wampanoag, such as Mashpee and Aquinnah, were able to hold onto a substantial land base and had better relations with their English neighbors as well as were closer to the whaling ports where Indian men could find employment.  It is known that Nohtooksaet and Mankutquet led their own groups of Massachusett to Martha's Vineyard and were eventually absorbed into neighboring Wampanoag tribes of the island.<ref>Swanton, J. R.

The [[Nashaway]] Nipmuc that inhabited the area sold their lands in 1701, a few staying behind, but most leaving to seek their relatives in Canada or New York or joining Natick.  Natick would attract and absorb numerous Nipmuc from the smaller Indian enclaves.]]\nThe Indians were allowed to return to their lands after the war.  The Indian mission was considered a failure, and the Praying Indians and their Praying towns came to simply be referred to as 'Indians' and their lands as 'reserves' or later, 'reservations.'  This was in part because of lack of support of the Indian mission, deemed a failure in the wake of the war.  In 1692, Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies merged into the Province of Massachusetts, in part to secure better response to the attacks of the Indians and tighter hold of the English Crown.  The English colonists, not eager to see a return of their Indian neighbors, harassed the returning Indians, attacked and murdered and vandalized Indian property or resorted to other means.  Natick absorbed many of the surrounding tribes, thus keeping the population balanced despite the large numbers of Indians that continued to leave, seeking their relatives amongst the Abenaki or tribes to the west.\n\n[[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Okommakamesit]] was sold by the colonial authorities in 1685, as the English courts upheld forged deeds of questionable and sales, forcing most of the Nipmuc and Pawtucket of the community to settle in Natick.  Most of the leaders of the Pawtucket sold or deeded off their lands and regrouped in Wamesit, but after experiencing harassment from the local English, most sold their land and joined [[Wonalancet (Sachem)|Wonalancet]] and the Pennacook, but Wenepoykin joined his nephew in Natick.  Similarly, the Nipmuc of [[Ashland, Massachusetts|Magunkaquog]] were forced away from their community when the last of their lands were sold in 1714 and armed men prevented their return.  Disease, outmigration and loss of land shrunk many of the former Indian communities below carrying capacity, and most young people often left for Natick to seek land, spouses and employment.<ref>O'Brien, J.

Natick was able to retain its traditional leadership, with the Natick elite serving the administrative roles of the community and holding the positions of the Indian church with daily affairs conducted in the Massachusett language.  This continued until 1721, when record keeping switched to English and Oliver Peabody, a monolingual English speaker, was appointed the minister of the Indian church.  Peabody used his position to encourage the Indians to sell land, in part so as to have English company in the Indian enclave.  By the 1750s, Natick had ceased to be an Indian town, as it was more a messy patchwork of Indian common lands and English property in between, and the town's governance and church had switched to English and was dominated by English interests, although a few Indians continued to serve the church.<ref>Goddard, I., & Bragdon, K.

Originally, the commissioner was charged to manage the timber resources, as most of the forests of New England had been felled to make way for farm and pasture, making the timber on Indian lands a valuable commodity.  Very quickly, the guardian of Natick came to control the exchange of land, once the domain of the ''sachems'', and any funds set up by the sale of Indian products, but mainly land.  As the guardians assumed more power and were rarely supervised, many instances of questionable land sales by the guardians and embezzlement of funds have been recorded.  The appointment of the guardians reduced the Indians to colonial wards, as they were no longer able to directly address the courts, vote in town elections and removed the power of the Indian chiefs.<ref>Order Accepting the Report in Regard to the Timber and Land of Natick Indians and Appointing a Committee Thereon., Province of Massachusetts.

Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.</ref>\n\nLoss of land continued.  As forest lands were lost, the Indians could no longer resort to seasonal movements on their land or eke out a living, forcing many into poverty.  Land was their only commodity, and was often sold by the guardians to pay for treatments for the sick, care of orphans and debts incurred by Indians, but Indians were also the victims of unfair credit schemes that often forced the land out of their hands.  Ponkapoag went from 1,000 acres (404.69 hectares) to only 411 acres (166.33 hectares) in 1757 in part to pay the medical care of its rapidly aging population.  In 1763, a damaging winter and the eleven children that became [[orphan]]s when their father Samuel Mohoo passed led to land being sold in 1769, 1773 and 1776, leaving a small fraction in Indian hands.<ref>Mandell, D. R. (2000). ''Behind the Frontier: Indians in Eighteenth-Century Eastern Massachusetts.'' (pp. 170\u2013171). Lincoln, NE: University of Nebreaska Press.</ref>  Without land to farm or forage, Indians were forced to seek employment and settle in the ''de facto'' [[residential segregation|segregated]] sections of cities.  Although no longer bound to the traditional cycle of the seasons, Indians often were restricted to menial and dangerous professions by [[racism|racial prejudice]].  Men were often conscripted to work on vessels of whaling, merchant and fishing vessels in the growing [[whaling]] cities such as New Bedford or the docks of Boston, or worked in construction or as laborers, which often drew them away from their families for months at a time.  Women peddled traditional baskets and herbal medicines, and alongside children, worked as domestics in English homes.<ref name=\"Muckamugg\">Mandell, D. R.

The English colonists enlisted the help of the men of the Indian communities to fight in engagements such as [[King William's War]] (1689\u20131699), [[Queen Anne's War]] (1704\u20131713), [[Dummer's War]] (1722\u20131724), [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748), [[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749\u20131755) and the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131760).  As many of the Abenaki allies were New England Indians they had absorbed, some battles pitted kin against kin.  Many fought with distinction as guides, interpreters and scouts in units such as [[Gorham's Rangers]], such as Abraham Speen, John Babysuck and Jonathan Womsquam, all of whom had ties to Natick's old families.<ref>Calloway, C.

With the exception of the regime change, most of the policies and laws concerning the Indians of the colonial period were adopted unaltered.  The Indians became wards of the Commonwealth, as the guardian system remained intact.  By the end of the [[Federalist Era|Federal Period]], the common lands of the Massachusett people were sold off, with a small number of Indians able to buy or were granted lots of land, but most were evicted and forced to eke out an existence in greater society, but were still restricted the right to vote and guardians continued to control payments to the tribes from the final land sales and annuities set up for the old and infirm.<ref>Simmons, W.

In a letter written to the General Court sometime after the American Revolutionary War, the Natick women write '... almost all that were able did go into the Service of the United States and either died in the service or soon after their return home.  We are their widows, there being not one male left now that was then of age to go to war.'<ref>Quintal, Jr., G. (2004). ''Patriots of Color: \"a Peculiar Beauty and Merit\": African Americans and Native Americans at Battle Road & Bunker Hill.'' (pp. 29\u201330). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.</ref>  If not lost to battle, most Indian men could only find work in dangerous professions such as crewmen on whaling ships out at sea or were contracted as laborers, bringing them far from the dwindling remains of their communities and also taking numerous Indian lives.<ref name=\"Muckamugg\"/>\n\nA staggering gender imbalance was the result, with Indian females outnumbering Indian males.  Intermarriage, which had begun as a slow trickle, greatly accelerated by the end of the eighteenth century.  Many Indian women took Black slaves as their partners.  Slavery was not abolished in Massachusetts until 1781.  Although African slave labor did not reach the level in the south, the New England elite often acquired a few slaves to work as servants and laborers, but few women were imported to New England, thus suffering an inverse gender imbalance.  As Indian women were often employed as domestics in English households, it increased this type of interaction.  As the status of the children were inherited from the mother, the children of such unions were born free, and as long as they maintained social ties with other Indians, were accepted into the community, especially in the traditional [[matrilineal]] and [[matrilocal]] culture of the Massachusett and other Native peoples.  Intermarriage with White men was not as common, as the English did not suffer a gender imbalance and anti-miscegenation laws prevented them, but nevertheless, these rates spiked too, often with pariahs and those of lesser means.<ref>Katz, William Loren (1996). \"Their Mixing is to be Prevented\". ''Black Indians: A Hidden Heritage''. pp. 109\u2013125. New York, NY: Athenaeum Books for Young Readers.</ref>\n\nThe presence of so many non-Indian spouses was generally not a threat to Indian land and traditions as although they may have been accepted as kin, they were not recognized as Indians and were thus barred from participating in communal affairs and the tribal guardians carefully maintained the distinction between Indian and non-Indian.  Tensions arose as Indian men remained were threatened by intrusion of outsiders into their lands and competition for spouses, and several letters of complaint regarding their number and influence over their wives were written to the guardians.<ref name=\"Muckamugg\"/>\n\nIn the eyes of White neighbors, the mixed-race offspring were no longer considered Indian.  This was mainly in part because of the '[[one-drop rule]]' which made a person designated Black if there was any known or visible African ancestry.  The descendants of the English settlers, likely influenced by notions of the '[[noble savage]]' idealized in works such as ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'' and depictions of the newly subjugated and unmixed peoples of the Western Frontier, often believed that the 'real' Indians were gone and that the bi- or tri-racial descendant 'mongrel Indians' no longer had claim to legitimacy because of miscegenation and two centuries of assimilation.<ref name=\"Muckamugg\"/>  Indians disappear from the record, by the time of the first Federal Census in 1790, the Massachusett and other local peoples are instead listed as 'Black,' 'Mulatto' or 'Colored' in census records, based on guesses of the census taker to the amount of assumed African ancestry.<ref>Minardi, M.

Loss of land prevented the Indians from supplementing their diet with foraged foods, such as wild [[Vaccinium macrocarpon|cranberries]], [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|cowberries]] and [[Gaylussacia baccata|black huckleberries]] from bogs, that were part of the traditional cuisine.  The Ponkapoag Reservation was whittled away until the Indians were evicted and the lands sold by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1827.]]\nThe last communal lands of Ponkapoag were sold in 1827.  A small plot was not sold until 1840, but the Ponkapoag had already been restricted from its use.  The last lands of Natick were sold in 1828 in part to raise funds for the care of the oldest and ill members of the tribe.  The loss of land did not remove the restrictions of the guardians.<ref>Canton Historical Society.

Many Indians dispersed, settling in the African-American neighborhoods of Boston and other cities or joining other remnant Indian communities.  A small handful of Ponkapoag Indians had become proprietors, forming a small hamlet of Indian families on Indian Lane that would last until the early twentieth century.  Instead of community, Indian identity and structure was rooted in family relations.  For instance, Rebecca Davis, who had lived in Boston her entire adult life, continued to return to Indian Lane to visit family members and friends to stock up on jams, corn and other foodstuffs every autumn until she reached her seventies.  Others tried their luck at the few remaining Indian lands, such as the outflow of the Natick Pegan family to [[Chaubunagungamaug Reservation|Chaubunagungamaug]].<ref>Simmons. W. S. (1986).

Lebanon, NH: University Press of New England.</ref>\n\n====Censuses and Indian Enfranchisement====\nThe Massachusett people were still wards of the state under guardians who handled what funds were left from previous land sales.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts ordered reports on the condition of the Indians, mainly for the purposes of keeping track of the expenses and check up on the guardians, who more or less operated autonomously with little oversight from the General Court.  The first was Denny Report of 1848, which was a very preliminary look.  The report only found four Ponkapoag and made no effort to determine the number of Natick.  A year later, a more detailed report was released, which came to be known as the Briggs Report of 1849, which records 10 Ponkapoag but again does not list any Natick.  The most detailed, and last, of the reports conducted by John Milton Earle was started in 1859 and published in 1861, includes even more information, such as surnames, location and profession.  Even Earle, who provides the most detailed information, lamented '... the temptations to a race naturally inclined to a roving and unsettled life, are too great to be resisted ... they frequently remove from place to place, keeping up no correspondence or communication with those they have left; till at last their place of residence ceases to be known to their friends, and all trace of them is lost.' He goes on to state that tracing them was difficult due to the 'humble social position and obscure station in life, known only to a few directly about them ... [and are] frequently not recognized as Indians, by the people among whom they dwell.'  Earle was also aware that his research was not an exhaustive list, as 'This lack of reliable statistics prevents the making of any comparison of the present number with what it has been at former periods so as to show whether the tribe is increasing or diminishing.'<ref>Earle, J. M. (1861). ''Report to the Governor and Council, Concerning the Indians of the Commonwealth, Under the Act of April 6, 1859.'' (pp. 7\u20138). Boston, MA: W.

Bird, Griswold and Weeks, the three commissioners tasked with reporting on the Indians in 1849 presented their preliminary findings to Briggs later that year, that report is now known to historians as the Briggs Report.]]None of the reports offer any insight into the small remnant groups of the [[Mahican]] of [[The Berkshires]] or the [[Pocomtuc]] and Nipmuc-related peoples of the [[Pioneer Valley]].  The Earle Report was the first report, however, that provided any information regarding the Natick Indians or the Pembroke Indians (Matakeesett or in the Earle Report, 'Mamatakeeset').  The Earle Report also mentions another Indian group known as the Tumpum that also lived in the vicinity.  As Pembroke was more or less on the frontier of two closely related peoples that often intermarried, it is uncertain if the Tumpum can be considered a Massachusett group, but descendants of the Tumpum have mostly intermarried into and have descendants in contemporary Wampanoag communities.  The three reports due more or less point out the difficulties of Indian life, as they were not considered citizens of the United States, were alienated from their lands, mostly lived in poverty due to lack of land and lack of suitable employment due to prejudice and racism, were not recognized as Indian because of their racial mixture and still had guardians that managed what little financial benefits they had, either as annuities paid by the state for the eldest and sick members of the tribe, or interest accrued from the tribal fund, funded from the sale of the last of the reservation lands.  The reports also highlight the general marginalization of Indians, the fracturing of Indian communities and the higher mortality rate compared to the general population.  A good number of the Indians had already assimilated into the surrounding communities, attending the same churches, schools and participating in larger society.   The Earle report does list employment, showing most of the Massachusett with known employment were either laborers, mariners, barbers, caterers or farmers.<ref name=\"Natick Number\">Earle, J. M. (1861). p. xli.</ref>\n\nThe growth of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist movement]] in the northern United States was especially prevalent in the then [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] dominated government.  Boston was a hotbed, attracting notable abolitionist leaders to set up offices and raise funds for their cause, as well as attracting numerous speakers on a growing political circuit, many of whom were either from Massachusetts or stayed for extended periods, such as [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[Maria W. Stewart]], [[Frederick Douglass]], [[William Cooper Nell]], [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Robert Gould Shaw]].<ref>Boston African American. (2010).

Retrieved 3 September 2017.</ref>  The Indians more or less became an embarrassment to the abolitionist cause, as a small minority of colored people, with varying degrees of African heritage, were denied citizenship and the right to vote as wards of the state.  Furthermore, many Indians participated in the Civil War, enlisting in Black regiments.  In the wake of the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 and more re-assuring signs of a Union victory, Massachusetts passed the Massachusetts Enfranchisement Act in 1869.  The Act extended these rights, but also '[[Detribalization|detribalized]]' the Indians, similar to effects of the [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 at the federal level.  This ended the guardianship of the Indians, and any remaining funds were disbursed to Indians recorded on the Earle Report or their known descendants and removed any remaining legal prohibitions against the sale of Indian lands.  The Indians of the Commonwealth were no longer under its patronage and few steps were taken to care for the Indians, although a handful of the Natick and Ponkapoag continued to receive state benefits because of old age, illness and lack of kin.<ref>O'Brien, J.

The end of Manifest Destiny meant the Indians were no longer enemies of the expanding American frontier, but instead, integral and unique parts of the local landscape that were being lost.  A spike in anthropological, linguistic and cultural evaluation began.  Renowned Iroquoian and Algonquian culture expert [[Frank Speck]] made several trips to New England in the 1920s, collecting information on language, history, folklore and meeting with Indians, even paying respects to Mary Chapelle (''n\u00e9e'' Crowd), who steadfastly proclaimed Indian identity and preserved some of the last traditional knowledge of the tribe.  Speck, as well as anthropologist/linguist [[Gladys Tantaquidgeon]], were even able to compile small word lists in the Massachusett language\u2014albeit its Wampanoag dialect\u2014by rememberers in the Mashpee and Aquinnah Wampanoag tribes, respectively.  Some Indians began publicly confessing Indian identity with the adoption of Plains Indian clothing and powwows, as these were the most well-known symbols of Indian culture, and began participating in pan-Indian cultural meetings and associations, aiming to pool their knowledge and re-establish ties with other Indians.<ref>Harkin, M.

The people take their name from the Algonquian, which is a  tribal term meaning \u201cAt the Great Hill\u201d - referring to the [[Blue Hills Reservation|Blue Hills]] overlooking Boston Harbor from the south - which was a ceremonial and sacred area for the people of the region.\n\nAs some of the first people to make contact with the European explorers and English colonists, the Massachusett and other coastal peoples were severely decimated from an outbreak of [[leptospirosis]] circa 1619, which had mortality rates as high as 90% in these areas.  This was followed by devastating impacts of [[virgin soil epidemic]]s such as [[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[scarlet fever]] and others to which the indigenous people lacked natural immunity.  Their territories, on the more fertile and flat coastlines, with access to coastal resources, was mostly taken over by English colonists, as the Massachusett were too few in number to put up any effective resistance.\n\nUnder the missionary [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]], the majority of the Massachusett were converted to Christianity and settled in '[[Praying town]]s' established where the converted Native Americans were expected to submit to the colonial laws, accept some elements of English culture and forced to abandon their traditional religion, but were allowed to use their language.  Through intermediaries, Eliot learned the language and even published a [[translation of the Bible]].  The language, related to other [[Eastern Algonquian languages]] but more specifically, the regional languages of southern New England, would slowly fade, ceasing to serve as the primary language of the Massachusett communities by the 1750s, and the language was likely extinct by the early years of the nineteenth century.  The Massachusett language was shared with several other peoples in the region, and the Wampanoag preserved their dialect of the language until the death of its last speaker sometime in the 1890s.\n\nThe last of their common lands were sold in the early nineteenth century, loosening the community and social bonds that held the Massachusett families together, and most of the Massachusett were forced to settle amongst their English neighbors, but mainly settled the poorer sections of towns where they were segregated with Blacks, recent immigrants and other Native Americans.  The Massachusett mainly assimilated and integrated into the surrounding communities.\n\nTwo groups of Massachusett have received state recognition after the creation of the Massachusetts Commission on Indian Affairs.  The Ponkapoag Massachusett, descendants of the Praying Indians of Ponkapoag, centered around what is now [[Canton, Massachusetts]], and the Natick Massachusett-Nipmuc.  As the Natick were formed from a substantial input of Nipmuc families, and maintained close connection with the Nipmuc communities, the Natick Massachusett-Nipmuc are recognized as a tribe of Nipmuc, via their involvement with the [[Nipmuc Nation]].\n\n==Ethnonyms==\n===Endonyms===\n[[File:CantonMA LittleBlueHill.jpg|thumb|right|View of Little Blue Hill from atop Great Blue Hill.

The earliest English colonial records reveal several quite variant spellings such as  'Masichewsetta,' 'Masstachusit,' 'Masathulets,' 'Masatusets,' 'Massachussett,' etc.  The English name and pronunciation was likely influenced by 'Moswetuset,' as in [[Moswetuset Hummock]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]].

For example, the Neponset tribe of what is now the area around Quincy were converted and settled into the Praying town of Ponkapoag, in what is now Canton, where they were joined by a handful of members of local Massachusett tribes, and came to be known as the Praying Indians of Ponkapoag.

Within Algonquian, Massachusett is in the Southern New England Algonquian (SNEA) sub-branch of the [[Eastern Algonquian]] branch of Algonquian languages.  The SNEA languages are so closely related, they can be considered dialects of one another and differ mainly in treatment of Proto-Algonquian retroflexes of *''\u03b8'' which yielded /n/ in Massachusett, /l/ in Nipmuc, /j/ in Narragansett and /r/ in Quiripi, leaving Massachusett classified as an SNEA n-dialect in this scheme.

Eliot had learned the language through a series of Indian interpreters and translators, mostly at Natick, and devised an orthography based on English conventions of the time.  Eliot would later teach Indians to read and write using hand-written catechisms that were copied.  Funding was granted for the Indian mission, allowing Eliot to publish several translations, ultimately leading up to the ''[[Eliot Indian Bible|Mamusse Wunneetupanatamwe Up-Biblum God]]'', which literally translates as 'The Whole Holy His-Bible God,' which was completed in 1663.  Beginning in 1651 and lasting until 1747, almost thirty translations and other teaching aids were produced in the Massachusett language and distributed to the Indians of the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth Colonies.  A school was established in Natick, where Indian men were trained in reading and writing and Christian theology and would later serve as clerks, ministers, deacons, administrators, interpreters and constables of the newly created '[[Praying town]]s' established by Eliot.  As the Indians became literate, they taught others to read and write, thus spreading its use.  Just before the outbreak of Metacomet's Rebellion, one-third of Indians were literate in only twenty years after Eliot taught the first Indians.<ref>Bourne, R. (1674).

The names of the Massachusett literate are named in colonial sources, such as William Ahaton and Aaron Pomham, who served as preachers in Ponkapoag; John Neesnummin of Natick, who helped both Eliot and the Mayhew family in translating works for the Indian audience; John Simons of Titicut and James Speen, a Natick Indian who later became preacher to the Nipmuc Indians of Pakachoag (now [[Auburn, Massachusetts]]).<ref>Andrews, E.

Elaborate fish-weirs, such as the [[Boylston Street Fishweir]], were constructed to channel the fish in rivers, or trap them with the outgoing tide, where they could be easily netted, speared or simply gathered in baskets. Marine mammals were also hunted.  Seals were captured when they came to rest on coast, whilst large whales were hunted with teams of Indians in canoes or when they occasionally stranded on shore.<ref>Bragdon, K. J. (1999). pp. 122-137.</ref>\n\nMen hunted various game and waterfowl with [[bow and arrow]], spear alone or spear with [[spear-thrower|atlatl]] or were caught in spring traps.  Smaller animals were caught by hand, nets and smaller traps.  Deer was an important animal for its ample furs and meat, and deer drives, with groups of men scaring deer out of the woods towards hunters waiting in ambush.  In winter, snowshoes and dogs aided the hunt.  To increase deer numbers, sections of forest were cleared by fire to increase grassy meadows where the fed.<ref>Bragdon, K. J. (1999). pp. 117-119.</ref>  No part of the animal was wasted, with the skins processed into furs and leathers for blankets, clothing and shoes; feathers, bone beads and quills were used to make jewelry and decorate personal items; fats rendered into greases and oils for nutrition, cosmetics or medical salves; snakeskin was fashioned into belts; porcupine quills and small bones were used for sewing and the sinews were chewed into bowstrings and cordage.<ref>Bragdon, K. J. (1999). pp. 105-107, 171-175.</ref>  With the exception of bears, valued for their large fat stores, the Indians avoided hunting large predators and birds of prey due to their religious customs.<ref>Bragdon, K. J. (1999). pp. 183-185.</ref>\n\nShellfish harvesting was another activity of Massachusett women, picking them off rocks at low tide or digging them up from the sand.  Shellfish were a major part of the diet, and the New England tradition of the [[clambake]] was inherited from the local peoples.  Large clam shells were used as spoons, scrapers, bowls or fashioned into hoes for farming, but they could also be carved into small beads used for [[wampum]].<ref>Bragdon, K. J.

In 1605, [[Samuel de Champlain]] sailed south from [[New France]], bringing an [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] guide and his ''Almouchiquois'' wife, said to be from the region and able to speak the local language.

The Massachusett, unlike the Wampanoag under [[Massasoit]], were fearful of the incursions of settlers and began stirring the other tribes in rebellion.  Although relations between the Pilgrims and the local Wampanoag were good, some of the Pilgrims and a handful of new settlers established the [[Wessagusset Colony]] in what is now [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]] in the territory of the Massachusett.  Relations soured as the Massachusett were already fearful of incursions into their territory and the Wessagussett settlers were ill-prepared for life in New England, thus resorting to stealing from the local Massachusett. The Massachusett were weakened, and the warrior [[Pecksuot]] was his men were killed along with a handful of settlers.<ref>Tremblay, R. (1972).

As a result of natural increase and the arrival of incoming English Puritans fleeing the religious persecutions in England more than doubled the population.  The Europeans brought with them pathogens to which the local Indians had no immunity, thus ravaging as [[virgin soil epidemic]]s.  A particularly virulent outbreak of [[smallpox]] lay waste to coastal communities, still recovering from the plague of 1619, as well as the interior tribes in 1634, practically ending any resistance to English settlement.  Further outbreaks of smallpox, influenza, scarlet fever, mumps and measles would strike again in 1648 and 1666, but although not as devastating, would continue to inflict heavy tolls well into the nineteenth century.  With little to no resistance from dying Indians, the English believed that God Himself had cleared the land for their arrival.  By the 1630s, the Indians of New England were already a minority in their own lands.<ref>Kohn, G. C. (2010). ''Encyclopedia of Plague and Pestilence''. (pp. 255-256).

In most cases, it was because the land had already been alienated by English settlement, often because the locals had already died off from disease.  The ''sachems'' began selling land at a price, often with stipulations allowing the Indians to collect, gather, fish or forage, but these arrangements were seldom honored by the English.  The English also did not understand the Indian concept of leasing land from the sachem, and instead thought of their arrangements as permanent land sales.  As a result of the rapid loss of land, the Massachusett and other local tribes sent their leaders to Boston for the 1644 Acts of Submission, bringing the Indians under the control of the colonial government and subject to its laws and Christian missionary attempts.  By the time of the submission, the Massachusett, a coastal people, had lost access to the sea and their shellfish collection sites.<ref>Cogley, R. W. (1999).

The English demand for furs as a trade item had extirpated the beaver from coastal New England, forcing the Massachusett deeper into enemy territory to procure beaver pelts, thus leading to retaliatory attacks from the Mahican, armed by the Dutch, and the Abenaki and Tarratine, armed by the French, whereas the English banned the sales of firearms to the local tribes, rendering them defenseless.  The use of [[wampum]] by the Natives, mainly as a record keeper, sacred or ceremonial gift and at times exchanged for goods was erroneously thought of as currency.  As the English were able to mass-produce beads of glass with iron drills, the value of wampum deflated.  As the Indians became increasingly dependent on trade items of the English, this led to debts.  Alcoholism ran rampant as it was previously unknown to the Indians, but proved a scourge, tearing families apart.  Some English even resorted to getting Indians drunk so as to run up credit or so that they would be fined and forced to cede their land, which led to the ban of sales of hard cider and other spirits to the Indians.<ref name=\"Massachusetts General Court 1814 pp. 33\u2013802\"/>\n\n====Praying towns and praying Indians (1651\u20131675)====\n[[File:Eliot Church.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The Eliot Church in south Natick.  The church was built in 1828 where the Indian Church once stood.]]\n\nJohn Eliot's success with learning the language with the aid of Indian interpreters, such [[John Sassamon]], led him to attempt to preach to the Neponset tribe, led by [[Cutshamekin]], son of Chickatawbut, in 1646 but was rebuffed.  A year later, with better language skills and understanding of Native culture, Eliot succeeded in converting the Nonantum tribe led by [[Waban]].  Eliot began to petition the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony to set aside designated lands for the Indians, to prevent future conflicts over land, ensure a space for the Indians and to give the Indians a place separate from the colonists and their unconverted brethren.  Natick was officially set aside in 1651, with construction of a school to teach literacy and religion and train new Indian missionaries and a church begun shortly thereafter.  Cutshamekin later accepted the mission, and land was granted at Ponkapoag in what is now Canton, Massachusetts in 1654.<ref>Cogley, R. W. (1999). pp. .105-107.</ref>  The Plymouth Colony established similar communities of Praying towns, with Mattakeeset, in what is now Pembroke, and Titicut, in what is now Middleborough and parts of Bridgewater, set aside for the Massachusett people.  In addition, there were the unofficial Praying Indian districts of Cowate, Magaehnak and Pequimmid, but these communities were never raised to official Praying towns.  Twelve additional Praying towns were established in Nipmuc and Pawtucket territory in a defensive ring around the coastal settlements of the English.<ref name=\"Swanton\"/>\n\n[[File:CantonMA PonkapoagNorthLineMarker.jpg|thumb|left|Historical marker standing on the northern boundary of what was once the Praying town of Ponkapoag, now contained in the town of [[Canton, Massachusetts]].]]\nLife in the Praying towns was an interesting blend of English and Indian culture.  The Praying Indians had to adopt the Puritan Christianity of their English neighbors, as well as English assimilatory rules such as patriarchy, as the Massachusett were traditionally a matrilineal society where woman were not restrained, as well as English ideas of decency.  The Praying Indians also had to submit to English laws and adopted the administrative practices of the English town in their governance.  Otherwise, the daily affairs of administration and the Indian churches was conducted in the Massachusett language.  Some of the Praying Indians adopted English-style homes, [[animal husbandry]] and clothing.  However, the Indians were called to church by traditional drumming and not church bells, many of the Praying Indians continued to live a traditional lifestyle and live in the {{lang|alg|wetu}} and retained other aspects of traditional culture not in conflict with the tenets of Praying town life and English law.\n\nThe success of the Praying towns was in large part due to the traumatic experiences of European arrival.  Devastating epidemics that nearly wiped the people out could not be cured with traditional [[healing]] practices and spiritual rituals nor were the spirits of the land powerful enough to keep out the European invaders.  The promise of guaranteed land recognized by the invaders as untouchable to the onslaught of English colonists was also very promising.<ref>Cogley, R. W. (1999). pp. 111\u2013113.</ref>  The Native Americans viewed English land sales as [[lease]] agreements, as rights to land were granted by permission of the local ''sachem'' to use until it was no longer needed.  Indian land was sometimes just stolen by encroachment, squatting or allowing hungry cattle loose on their planting fields and ruining it.  Laws were passed allowing all \"unimproved\" land to be open to English settlement, opening hunting areas, coastal [[shellfish]] collection sites to eventual settlement.<ref name=\"Massachusetts General Court 1814 pp. 33\u2013802\">Massachusetts General Court.

Waite and Sons.</ref>  With the Praying towns granted official title to their land, the converts were able to continue some aspects of their cultural practices and subsistence patterns and removed some of the major threats to their land base.  The Praying Indians, however, often earned the ire of the traditionalist Indians for submitting to the English whereas the English questioned the loyalty of the Praying Indians to the colonial government and the sincerity of their [[religious conversion|conversions]].  In many ways, the grouping of Indians into land bases where they could be civilized of the Praying towns was a predecessor to the [[Indian reservation]]s that exist today.<ref>Cogley, R. W.

The submission of the local chiefs to the respective colonial governments and adoption of Christianity allowed the Indians to seek redress in the English court system and removed one of the prejudices against them.  The Praying Indians of Natick were brought to court several times by the English settlers of Dedham that claimed some of the land, but with Eliot's assistance, most of these attempts failed.  Most of the time, however, the Indians failed, as some of the Indian interpreters and chiefs ceded lands to curry favor from the English to maintain special privileges, such as the Nipmuc John Wampas, who betrayed the Nipmuc and Massachusett people by selling land to the settlers to which he had no claim, but these sales were upheld in later court challenges.  The Pawtucket sachem [[Wenepoykin]], son of [[Nanepashemet]] and [[Squaw Sachem of Mistick]], through kinship and family ties laid claim to much of Massachusett territory, and tried several times to petition the courts for lands lost in the turbulence of the 1633 epidemic that took both of his brothers to no avail, with most cases simply dismissed.<ref>Russel, F. (2018). ''An Early History of Malden''. Charleston, SC: The History Press.</ref>\n\nThe Massachusetts Bay Colony passed a series of harsh measures that earned the ire of the Native peoples.  All Indians, Christian and traditional religionists, were forced to observe the [[Christian Sabbath]] and were restricted from a wide range of activities, such as hunting, fishing and farming or entering the English towns, and heavy fines were imposed on those caught practicing the shamanic rights or consulting traditional spiritual leaders or healers.  Alcohol, firearms and many luxury goods were banned.  By this time, the Indians had already integrated into the economic system of the English, but were dealt a heavy blow as laws were passed restricting trade to appointed colonial agents, which gave the colonial government a monopoly on trade with the English and made the Indian farmers less competitive as they were not allowed direct access to English markets.  New laws allowed open settlement to any 'unimproved' lands, essentially anything that was not fenced in or with crops grown on it, threatening the wooded areas and meadows cleared by fire that were used for hunting and cultivation areas that were allowed to fallow.<ref name=\"Massachusetts General Court 1814 pp. 33\u2013802\"/>\n\n[[File:2017 Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant from Boston Harbor 1.jpg|thumb|left|Deer Island in Boston Harbor.

Tensions reached a boiling point for [[Metacomet]], also known as Philip, a son of Massasoit.  Metacomet's brother, [[Wamsutta]], was arrested and died in custody, likely murdered, for selling land to [[Roger Williams]] even though these lands and the Wampanoag tribe that sold the lands were not under the jurisdiction of the Plymouth Colony.  As rumors began to fly regarding Metacomet's plans, he ordered the death of his English-language interpreter, John Sassamon, who had earlier assisted Eliot, leading to a court trial in which several of Metacomet's men were charged and hanged for the murder.  Metacomet fled soon after, enlisting the aid of other tribes, such as the Nipmuc, Narragansett, Pawtucket, and drawing away some of the Praying Indians.  Even notable leaders that had worked with the English, such as Willlymachin, or Black James, ''sachem'' of the Praying town of Chaubanakongkomun (Chaubunagungamaug), and Wenepoykin, supported Metacomet's cause.\n\nThe Praying Indians mostly stayed neutral, and surrendered their weapons and accepted restrictions to their movements.  The Praying Indians endured attacks by their kinsfolk that supported Metacomet.  Just before the winter of 1675, colonial militia rounded up the Praying Indians forcibly interned them on [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]] in Boston Harbor.  Similarly, the Mattakeeset were marched to [[Clark's Island]].  With little food and clothing, many of the Indians perished from starvation, exposure and disease.  Many of the Praying Indians were recruited to serve as scouts, guides and to fill the ranks of the colonial militia, with a regiment recruited by [[Daniel Gookin]] sent to face Metacomet's warriors at Swansea, but it is known that other Massachusett aided the colonial militias in Lancaster, Brookfield and Mount Hope battles of the war.  Despite early victories, Metacomet was weakened by lack of resources and the help of the Praying Indians to the English.  Metacomet was later shot by a Wampanoag Praying Indian, [[John Alderman]], who was serving in the regiment of [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]], ending the war.<ref>Drake, J. D.

Most of the Odanak, although Western Abenaki speaking, were historically an amalgam of several Abenakian tribes with a significant part of their ancestry from the refugees of King Philip's War fleeing southern New England.]]The war proved very disruptive to Indian life in New England.  The warriors that supported Metacomet were executed in public displays, and like Metacomet's head, were kept on posts outside most major English settlements.  Those that were not executed, were gathered and sent to the slave markets in [[Bermuda]] where most would be forced to work on the sugar plantations, although some of the luckier ones, particularly women and children, were forced into servitude locally in English homes.  The Praying Indian survivors of internment, any Indians lucky enough to have been pardoned and any survivors regrouped at Natick, where they divided up amongst their old tribal groupings and pressed for a return to their lands.  By 1681, the Indians were allowed to return to their respective homes, but continued to face harassment, retaliatory attacks, local killings and abuse to their lands and property by their English neighbors.\n\nMany Indians fled the region, most seeking refuge with the Abenaki in the north or the Mahican to the west, away from English settlement.  Those that remained often joined kinsfolk in other tribes and people, leading to considerable internal migration as well.  The Wampanoag, such as Mashpee and Aquinnah, were able to hold onto a substantial land base and had better relations with their English neighbors as well as were closer to the whaling ports where Indian men could find employment.  It is known that Nohtooksaet and Mankutquet led their own groups of Massachusett to Martha's Vineyard and were eventually absorbed into neighboring Wampanoag tribes of the island.<ref>Swanton, J. R.

Natick would attract and absorb numerous Nipmuc from the smaller Indian enclaves.]]\nThe Indians were allowed to return to their lands after the war.  The Indian mission was considered a failure, and the Praying Indians and their Praying towns came to simply be referred to as 'Indians' and their lands as 'reserves' or later, 'reservations.'  This was in part because of lack of support of the Indian mission, deemed a failure in the wake of the war.  In 1692, Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies merged into the Province of Massachusetts, in part to secure better response to the attacks of the Indians and tighter hold of the English Crown.  The English colonists, not eager to see a return of their Indian neighbors, harassed the returning Indians, attacked and murdered and vandalized Indian property or resorted to other means.  Natick absorbed many of the surrounding tribes, thus keeping the population balanced despite the large numbers of Indians that continued to leave, seeking their relatives amongst the Abenaki or tribes to the west.\n\n[[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Okommakamesit]] was sold by the colonial authorities in 1685, as the English courts upheld forged deeds of questionable and sales, forcing most of the Nipmuc and Pawtucket of the community to settle in Natick.  Most of the leaders of the Pawtucket sold or deeded off their lands and regrouped in Wamesit, but after experiencing harassment from the local English, most sold their land and joined [[Wonalancet (Sachem)|Wonalancet]] and the Pennacook, but Wenepoykin joined his nephew in Natick.  Similarly, the Nipmuc of [[Ashland, Massachusetts|Magunkaquog]] were forced away from their community when the last of their lands were sold in 1714 and armed men prevented their return.  Disease, outmigration and loss of land shrunk many of the former Indian communities below carrying capacity, and most young people often left for Natick to seek land, spouses and employment.<ref>O'Brien, J.

Natick was able to retain its traditional leadership, with the Natick elite serving the administrative roles of the community and holding the positions of the Indian church with daily affairs conducted in the Massachusett language.  This continued until 1721, when record keeping switched to English and Oliver Peabody, a monolingual English speaker, was appointed the minister of the Indian church.  Peabody used his position to encourage the Indians to sell land, in part so as to have English company in the Indian enclave.  By the 1750s, Natick had ceased to be an Indian town, as it was more a messy patchwork of Indian common lands and English property in between, and the town's governance and church had switched to English and was dominated by English interests, although a few Indians continued to serve the church.<ref>Goddard, I., & Bragdon, K.

Originally, the commissioner was charged to manage the timber resources, as most of the forests of New England had been felled to make way for farm and pasture, making the timber on Indian lands a valuable commodity.  Very quickly, the guardian of Natick came to control the exchange of land, once the domain of the ''sachems'', and any funds set up by the sale of Indian products, but mainly land.  As the guardians assumed more power and were rarely supervised, many instances of questionable land sales by the guardians and embezzlement of funds have been recorded.  The appointment of the guardians reduced the Indians to colonial wards, as they were no longer able to directly address the courts, vote in town elections and removed the power of the Indian chiefs.<ref>Order Accepting the Report in Regard to the Timber and Land of Natick Indians and Appointing a Committee Thereon., Province of Massachusetts.

Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.</ref>\n\nLoss of land continued.  As forest lands were lost, the Indians could no longer resort to seasonal movements on their land or eke out a living, forcing many into poverty.  Land was their only commodity, and was often sold by the guardians to pay for treatments for the sick, care of orphans and debts incurred by Indians, but Indians were also the victims of unfair credit schemes that often forced the land out of their hands.  Ponkapoag went from 1,000 acres (404.69 hectares) to only 411 acres (166.33 hectares) in 1757 in part to pay the medical care of its rapidly aging population.  In 1763, a damaging winter and the eleven children that became [[orphan]]s when their father Samuel Mohoo passed led to land being sold in 1769, 1773 and 1776, leaving a small fraction in Indian hands.<ref>Mandell, D. R. (2000). ''Behind the Frontier: Indians in Eighteenth-Century Eastern Massachusetts.'' (pp. 170\u2013171). Lincoln, NE: University of Nebreaska Press.</ref>  Without land to farm or forage, Indians were forced to seek employment and settle in the ''de facto'' [[residential segregation|segregated]] sections of cities.  Although no longer bound to the traditional cycle of the seasons, Indians often were restricted to menial and dangerous professions by [[racism|racial prejudice]].  Men were often conscripted to work on vessels of whaling, merchant and fishing vessels in the growing [[whaling]] cities such as New Bedford or the docks of Boston, or worked in construction or as laborers, which often drew them away from their families for months at a time.  Women peddled traditional baskets and herbal medicines, and alongside children, worked as domestics in English homes.<ref name=\"Muckamugg\">Mandell, D. R.

The English colonists enlisted the help of the men of the Indian communities to fight in engagements such as [[King William's War]] (1689\u20131699), [[Queen Anne's War]] (1704\u20131713), [[Dummer's War]] (1722\u20131724), [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748), [[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749\u20131755) and the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131760).  As many of the Abenaki allies were New England Indians they had absorbed, some battles pitted kin against kin.  Many fought with distinction as guides, interpreters and scouts in units such as [[Gorham's Rangers]], such as Abraham Speen, John Babysuck and Jonathan Womsquam, all of whom had ties to Natick's old families.<ref>Calloway, C.

With the exception of the regime change, most of the policies and laws concerning the Indians of the colonial period were adopted unaltered.  The Indians became wards of the Commonwealth, as the guardian system remained intact.  By the end of the [[Federalist Era|Federal Period]], the common lands of the Massachusett people were sold off, with a small number of Indians able to buy or were granted lots of land, but most were evicted and forced to eke out an existence in greater society, but were still restricted the right to vote and guardians continued to control payments to the tribes from the final land sales and annuities set up for the old and infirm.<ref>Simmons, W.

In a letter written to the General Court sometime after the American Revolutionary War, the Natick women write '... almost all that were able did go into the Service of the United States and either died in the service or soon after their return home.  We are their widows, there being not one male left now that was then of age to go to war.'<ref>Quintal, Jr., G. (2004). ''Patriots of Color: \"a Peculiar Beauty and Merit\": African Americans and Native Americans at Battle Road & Bunker Hill.'' (pp. 29\u201330). Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office.</ref>  If not lost to battle, most Indian men could only find work in dangerous professions such as crewmen on whaling ships out at sea or were contracted as laborers, bringing them far from the dwindling remains of their communities and also taking numerous Indian lives.<ref name=\"Muckamugg\"/>\n\nA staggering gender imbalance was the result, with Indian females outnumbering Indian males.  Intermarriage, which had begun as a slow trickle, greatly accelerated by the end of the eighteenth century.  Many Indian women took Black slaves as their partners.  Slavery was not abolished in Massachusetts until 1781.  Although African slave labor did not reach the level in the south, the New England elite often acquired a few slaves to work as servants and laborers, but few women were imported to New England, thus suffering an inverse gender imbalance.  As Indian women were often employed as domestics in English households, it increased this type of interaction.  As the status of the children were inherited from the mother, the children of such unions were born free, and as long as they maintained social ties with other Indians, were accepted into the community, especially in the traditional [[matrilineal]] and [[matrilocal]] culture of the Massachusett and other Native peoples.  Intermarriage with White men was not as common, as the English did not suffer a gender imbalance and anti-miscegenation laws prevented them, but nevertheless, these rates spiked too, often with pariahs and those of lesser means.<ref>Katz, William Loren (1996). \"Their Mixing is to be Prevented\". ''Black Indians: A Hidden Heritage''. pp. 109\u2013125. New York, NY: Athenaeum Books for Young Readers.</ref>\n\nThe presence of so many non-Indian spouses was generally not a threat to Indian land and traditions as although they may have been accepted as kin, they were not recognized as Indians and were thus barred from participating in communal affairs and the tribal guardians carefully maintained the distinction between Indian and non-Indian.  Tensions arose as Indian men remained were threatened by intrusion of outsiders into their lands and competition for spouses, and several letters of complaint regarding their number and influence over their wives were written to the guardians.<ref name=\"Muckamugg\"/>\n\nIn the eyes of White neighbors, the mixed-race offspring were no longer considered Indian.  This was mainly in part because of the '[[one-drop rule]]' which made a person designated Black if there was any known or visible African ancestry.  The descendants of the English settlers, likely influenced by notions of the '[[noble savage]]' idealized in works such as ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'' and depictions of the newly subjugated and unmixed peoples of the Western Frontier, often believed that the 'real' Indians were gone and that the bi- or tri-racial descendant 'mongrel Indians' no longer had claim to legitimacy because of miscegenation and two centuries of assimilation.<ref name=\"Muckamugg\"/>  Indians disappear from the record, by the time of the first Federal Census in 1790, the Massachusett and other local peoples are instead listed as 'Black,' 'Mulatto' or 'Colored' in census records, based on guesses of the census taker to the amount of assumed African ancestry.<ref>Minardi, M.

Loss of land prevented the Indians from supplementing their diet with foraged foods, such as wild [[Vaccinium macrocarpon|cranberries]], [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|cowberries]] and [[Gaylussacia baccata|black huckleberries]] from bogs, that were part of the traditional cuisine.  The Ponkapoag Reservation was whittled away until the Indians were evicted and the lands sold by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1827.]]\nThe last communal lands of Ponkapoag were sold in 1827.  A small plot was not sold until 1840, but the Ponkapoag had already been restricted from its use.  The last lands of Natick were sold in 1828 in part to raise funds for the care of the oldest and ill members of the tribe.  The loss of land did not remove the restrictions of the guardians.<ref>Canton Historical Society.

Many Indians dispersed, settling in the African-American neighborhoods of Boston and other cities or joining other remnant Indian communities.  A small handful of Ponkapoag Indians had become proprietors, forming a small hamlet of Indian families on Indian Lane that would last until the early twentieth century.  Instead of community, Indian identity and structure was rooted in family relations.  For instance, Rebecca Davis, who had lived in Boston her entire adult life, continued to return to Indian Lane to visit family members and friends to stock up on jams, corn and other foodstuffs every autumn until she reached her seventies.  Others tried their luck at the few remaining Indian lands, such as the outflow of the Natick Pegan family to [[Chaubunagungamaug Reservation|Chaubunagungamaug]].<ref>Simmons. W. S. (1986).

Lebanon, NH: University Press of New England.</ref>\n\n====Censuses and Indian Enfranchisement====\nThe Massachusett people were still wards of the state under guardians who handled what funds were left from previous land sales.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts ordered reports on the condition of the Indians, mainly for the purposes of keeping track of the expenses and check up on the guardians, who more or less operated autonomously with little oversight from the General Court.  The first was Denny Report of 1848, which was a very preliminary look.  The report only found four Ponkapoag and made no effort to determine the number of Natick.  A year later, a more detailed report was released, which came to be known as the Briggs Report of 1849, which records 10 Ponkapoag but again does not list any Natick.  The most detailed, and last, of the reports conducted by John Milton Earle was started in 1859 and published in 1861, includes even more information, such as surnames, location and profession.  Even Earle, who provides the most detailed information, lamented '... the temptations to a race naturally inclined to a roving and unsettled life, are too great to be resisted ... they frequently remove from place to place, keeping up no correspondence or communication with those they have left; till at last their place of residence ceases to be known to their friends, and all trace of them is lost.' He goes on to state that tracing them was difficult due to the 'humble social position and obscure station in life, known only to a few directly about them ... [and are] frequently not recognized as Indians, by the people among whom they dwell.'  Earle was also aware that his research was not an exhaustive list, as 'This lack of reliable statistics prevents the making of any comparison of the present number with what it has been at former periods so as to show whether the tribe is increasing or diminishing.'<ref>Earle, J. M. (1861). ''Report to the Governor and Council, Concerning the Indians of the Commonwealth, Under the Act of April 6, 1859.'' (pp. 7\u20138). Boston, MA: W.

Bird, Griswold and Weeks, the three commissioners tasked with reporting on the Indians in 1849 presented their preliminary findings to Briggs later that year, that report is now known to historians as the Briggs Report.]]None of the reports offer any insight into the small remnant groups of the [[Mahican]] of [[The Berkshires]] or the [[Pocomtuc]] and Nipmuc-related peoples of the [[Pioneer Valley]].  The Earle Report was the first report, however, that provided any information regarding the Natick Indians or the Pembroke Indians (Matakeesett or in the Earle Report, 'Mamatakeeset').  The Earle Report also mentions another Indian group known as the Tumpum that also lived in the vicinity.  As Pembroke was more or less on the frontier of two closely related peoples that often intermarried, it is uncertain if the Tumpum can be considered a Massachusett group, but descendants of the Tumpum have mostly intermarried into and have descendants in contemporary Wampanoag communities.  The three reports due more or less point out the difficulties of Indian life, as they were not considered citizens of the United States, were alienated from their lands, mostly lived in poverty due to lack of land and lack of suitable employment due to prejudice and racism, were not recognized as Indian because of their racial mixture and still had guardians that managed what little financial benefits they had, either as annuities paid by the state for the eldest and sick members of the tribe, or interest accrued from the tribal fund, funded from the sale of the last of the reservation lands.  The reports also highlight the general marginalization of Indians, the fracturing of Indian communities and the higher mortality rate compared to the general population.  A good number of the Indians had already assimilated into the surrounding communities, attending the same churches, schools and participating in larger society.   The Earle report does list employment, showing most of the Massachusett with known employment were either laborers, mariners, barbers, caterers or farmers.<ref name=\"Natick Number\">Earle, J. M. (1861). p. xli.</ref>\n\nThe growth of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist movement]] in the northern United States was especially prevalent in the then [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] dominated government.  Boston was a hotbed, attracting notable abolitionist leaders to set up offices and raise funds for their cause, as well as attracting numerous speakers on a growing political circuit, many of whom were either from Massachusetts or stayed for extended periods, such as [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[Maria W. Stewart]], [[Frederick Douglass]], [[William Cooper Nell]], [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Robert Gould Shaw]].<ref>Boston African American. (2010).

Retrieved 3 September 2017.</ref>  The Indians more or less became an embarrassment to the abolitionist cause, as a small minority of colored people, with varying degrees of African heritage, were denied citizenship and the right to vote as wards of the state.  Furthermore, many Indians participated in the Civil War, enlisting in Black regiments.  In the wake of the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 and more re-assuring signs of a Union victory, Massachusetts passed the Massachusetts Enfranchisement Act in 1869.  The Act extended these rights, but also '[[Detribalization|detribalized]]' the Indians, similar to effects of the [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 at the federal level.  This ended the guardianship of the Indians, and any remaining funds were disbursed to Indians recorded on the Earle Report or their known descendants and removed any remaining legal prohibitions against the sale of Indian lands.  The Indians of the Commonwealth were no longer under its patronage and few steps were taken to care for the Indians, although a handful of the Natick and Ponkapoag continued to receive state benefits because of old age, illness and lack of kin.<ref>O'Brien, J.

The end of Manifest Destiny meant the Indians were no longer enemies of the expanding American frontier, but instead, integral and unique parts of the local landscape that were being lost.  A spike in anthropological, linguistic and cultural evaluation began.  Renowned Iroquoian and Algonquian culture expert [[Frank Speck]] made several trips to New England in the 1920s, collecting information on language, history, folklore and meeting with Indians, even paying respects to Mary Chapelle (''n\u00e9e'' Crowd), who steadfastly proclaimed Indian identity and preserved some of the last traditional knowledge of the tribe.

Some Indians began publicly confessing Indian identity with the adoption of Plains Indian clothing and powwows, as these were the most well-known symbols of Indian culture, and began participating in pan-Indian cultural meetings and associations, aiming to pool their knowledge and re-establish ties with other Indians.<ref>Harkin, M.

After the abolition of slavery in the Dutch colony of Suriname, the Dutch government signed [[Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870\u201371|a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers]]. Indians began migrating to Suriname in 1873 from what was then [[British Raj|British India]] as [[indenture]]d labourers, mostly from the modern-day Indian states of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]] and [[Tamil Nadu]]. However, among the immigrants there were also labourers from other parts of South Asia, such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Punjab]] and [[Haryana]].\n\nThe first ship transporting Indian indentured labourers, the ''Lalla Rookh'', arrived in the Paramaribo. Newly freed slaves in Suriname who witnessed Indian workers disembarking at the harbour, reportedly stated, \"''Jobo tanbasi''\", meaning \"The white man is still the boss\", suggesting that they viewed the development as a continuation of the slave trade. Initially, the transport and living conditions of Indian labourers in Suriname was worse than it had been prior to the abolition of the Dutch slave trade. The British Viceroy of India described it as \"a new system of slavery\". In 1870s, conditions were improved greatly following the passage of new legislation to protect the Indian workers. The Government of the United Kingdom and the colonial British Government in India feared comparisons to slavery would hurt their reputation, and enacted several legislations to make transportation of Indian workers safer and improve working conditions in plantations. The Dutch government, which had signed the agreement to recruit workers with the British after long and difficult negotiations, also feared jeopardizing the arrangement and meticulously followed the regulations imposed by the British. The Dutch were also concerned that they would be accused of reviving the slave trade.<ref name=\"Emmer\"/>\n\nIn order to reduce the mortality rate among workers being transported from India, the colonial British government required the presence of at least one doctor on every ship. As regulations required the doctor to be of European-origin, the regulations also required that one Indian indentured labourer be appointed as a translator and that he would be paid for his services at the end of the journey. Other regulations mandated that every ship have distilling apparatus with a capacity to produce at least 500 litres of drinking water from seawater daily, and also required ships to have a sickbay, male and female nursing staff, adequate food and medicine, and artificial ventilation in the passengers' quarters. Another regulation prohibited any ship transporting Indian indentured labourers from setting sail between the end of March and the beginning of August. Any shipping company that violated the regulations would be prohibited from transporting contact workers in the future. While the mortality rate among slaves working on plantations between 1680 and 1807 averaged 50.9 per thousand people, following the passage of the regulations post-1873, it dropped to 7.1 per thousand among Indian workers.<ref name=\"Emmer\">{{cite book|last1=Emmer|first1=P.

Other examples of his compositions appeared in the ''[[English Hymnal]]''.\n\n====Further Chieftains====\nWhile the Clan Chief is also chieftain of Oliphant of Condie, there are three further chieftains:\n\n*OLIPHANT OF GASK: Laurence Kington Blair Oliphant of Ardblair and Gask is Chieftain of Gask in the female line. The Gask branch produced Scotland's greatest poetess, Carolina Nairne, Lady Nairne. Later descendants through the female line, going by the name of Kington-Blair-Oliphant or Blair-Oliphant, include an Air Vice-Marshal and two composers in film and television.  Laurence lives at Ardblair Castle, a Clan Blair seat inherited by the Gask Oliphants by marriage to a Robertson of Struan. Ardblair contains not only the majority of the Gask Oliphant artifacts and portraits but also the Lords Oliphants' charters and known possessions, so remains hugely important to Clan Oliphant.  With his surname including that of Blair, Laurence is also in the female line a Chieftain of that Clan, as BLAIR of ARDBLAIR and thereby is Chieftain of the nearby Blairgowrie Games;\n*OLIPHANT OF ROSSIE:  Phillip Oliphant of Rossie is Chieftain in the female line of a branch which produced a Postmaster General of Scotland who appeared in Charles Lee's renowned 1847 painting \"The Golfers\" and, more recently, the late [[Betty Oliphant]], co-founder of [[Canada's National Ballet School]];\n*OLIPHANT OF BACHILTON:  David Olyphant of Bachilton is Chieftain in the male line, which is one of the earliest offshoot branches and is most closely linked to the Oliphants of Culteuchar, large landowners in Fife. From the Culteuchar Oliphants descend the largest number of American Oliphants.\n*OLIPHANT OF KELLIE: The Kellie Castle branch, currently without a chieftain, produced [[Margaret Oliphant]], the author.\n\n====Other branches====\nOther branches of Clan Oliphant do exist but as of today they still await rightful claimants for their chieftainly arms and the right to wear one or two eagle's feathers.  These have produced a US General, the renowned Australian scientist Sir [[Mark Oliphant]] who was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]], his nephew the influential cartoonist, [[Pat Oliphant]] and the ''Globe'' journalist, [[Thomas Oliphant]].\n\n==Tartan==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=10% |Tartan image\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=90% |Notes\n|-\n|[[File:Oliphant tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|180px]] || ''Olyfavnt'' [[tartan]], as published in 1842 in ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]''.\n|}\n\n==Castles and clan seat==\n\n*[[Kellie Castle]] was built and owned by Oliphants from 1360 to 1613.\n*[[Castle of Old Wick|Old Wick Castle]] and Berriedale Castle, held by [[Clan Sutherland]] in the 15th century, came to Sir William Oliphant of Berriedale (the progenitor of the Oliphant's of Berriedale) second son of the second Lord Oliphant, by his marriage to Christian, the daughter and heiress of Alexander Sutherland of Duffus in 1497.\n*[[Hatton Castle, Angus|Hatton Castle]] was built in 1575 by Laurence, the 4th Lord Oliphant and replaced the previous nearby wooden fortalice of [[Balcraig Castle]].  Hatton Castle was restored in the 20th century.\n*Following the decline in the Oliphant fortunes and the loss of Aberdalgie by the main branch of the family, by the 19th century the estates of Gask in Perthshire, [[List of listed buildings in Forgandenny, Perth and Kinross|Condie]], Rossie also in Perthshire and Kinneddar were those most associated with the Oliphant Clan. Although the land at Gask was held by Oliphants from the mid 14th century and although no Castle was ever built there, it is the site of 'The Auld Hoose' in Carolina Oliphant's song.\n*There is no Clan Seat currently but [[Ardblair Castle]], near Blairgowrie in Perthshire is the seat of one of the Clan Chieftains, the Oliphant of Gask.  Ardblair contains the largest collection of Oliphant heirlooms and portraits today.\n\n==See also==\n*[[David Olifard]]\n*[[Laurence, 1st Lord Oliphant]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant, 3rd Lord Oliphant]]\n*[[Lord Oliphant]]\n*[[Oliphant (disambiguation)]]\n*[[William Oliphant, Lord Newton]]\n*[[William Oliphant, Lord of Aberdalgie]]\n*[[Margaret Oliphant]]\n*[[Thomas Oliphant (musician and artist)]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (Scottish politician)|Laurence Oliphant, 8th of Condie]]\n*[[Anthony Oliphant|Sir Anthony Oliphant]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (author)]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (British Army officer)|Major General Sir Laurence James Oliphant]]\n*[[James Oliphant]]\n*[[Lancelot Oliphant|Sir Lancelot Oliphant]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (Jacobite)]]\n*[[Findo Gask]]\n*[[Rob Oliphant]]\n*[[Scottish clan]]\n*[[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Belgium]]\n*[[Maha Nuge Gardens]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n<ref>{{cite book|last1=Oxenham Hewlett|first1=William|title=Notes on dignities in the peerage of Scotland which are dormant or which have been forfeited|date=1882|publisher=Wildy & Sons|location=London|isbn=1342403894|edition=First|url=https://archive.org/details/notesondignities00hewluoft|accessdate=16 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.clanoliphant.com/ Oliphant Clan and Family Association]\n*[http://www.scotclans.com/scottish-clans/clan-oliphant/ Clan Oliphant at ScotClans.com]\n*[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/ntor/oliphan2.html http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/ntor/oliphan2.html]\n*[http://www.scotweb.co.uk/info/oliphant/]\n*[[John Riddell (genealogist)|John Riddell]], [https://archive.org/details/inquiryintolawa00riddgoog ''Inquiry into the law and practice in Scottish peerages: before, and after the union; involving the questions of jurisdiction, and forfeiture: together with an exposition of our genuine, original consistorial law'', pub.

Other examples of his compositions appeared in the ''[[English Hymnal]]''.\n\n====Further Chieftains====\nWhile the Clan Chief is also chieftain of Oliphant of Condie, there are three further chieftains:\n\n*OLIPHANT OF GASK: Laurence Kington Blair Oliphant of Ardblair and Gask is Chieftain of Gask in the female line. The Gask branch produced Scotland's greatest poetess, Carolina Nairne, Lady Nairne. Later descendants through the female line, going by the name of Kington-Blair-Oliphant or Blair-Oliphant, include an Air Vice-Marshal and two composers in film and television.  Laurence lives at Ardblair Castle, a Clan Blair seat inherited by the Gask Oliphants by marriage to a Robertson of Struan. Ardblair contains not only the majority of the Gask Oliphant artifacts and portraits but also the Lords Oliphants' charters and known possessions, so remains hugely important to Clan Oliphant.  With his surname including that of Blair, Laurence is also in the female line a Chieftain of that Clan, as BLAIR of ARDBLAIR and thereby is Chieftain of the nearby Blairgowrie Games;\n*OLIPHANT OF ROSSIE:  Phillip Oliphant of Rossie is Chieftain in the female line of a branch which produced a Postmaster General of Scotland who appeared in Charles Lee's renowned 1847 painting \"The Golfers\" and, more recently, the late [[Betty Oliphant]], co-founder of [[Canada's National Ballet School]];\n*OLIPHANT OF BACHILTON:  David Olyphant of Bachilton is Chieftain in the male line, which is one of the earliest offshoot branches and is most closely linked to the Oliphants of Culteuchar, large landowners in Fife. From the Culteuchar Oliphants descend the largest number of American Oliphants.\n*OLIPHANT OF KELLIE: The Kellie Castle branch, currently without a chieftain, produced [[Margaret Oliphant]], the author.\n\n====Other branches====\nOther branches of Clan Oliphant do exist but as of today they still await rightful claimants for their chieftainly arms and the right to wear one or two eagle's feathers.  These have produced a US General, the renowned Australian scientist Sir [[Mark Oliphant]] who was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]], his nephew the influential cartoonist, [[Pat Oliphant]] and the ''Globe'' journalist, [[Thomas Oliphant]].\n\n==Tartan==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=10% |Tartan image\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=90% |Notes\n|-\n|[[File:Oliphant tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|180px]] || ''Olyfavnt'' [[tartan]], as published in 1842 in ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]''.\n|}\n\n==Castles and clan seat==\n\n*[[Kellie Castle]] was built and owned by Oliphants from 1360 to 1613.\n*[[Castle of Old Wick|Old Wick Castle]] and Berriedale Castle, held by [[Clan Sutherland]] in the 15th century, came to Sir William Oliphant of Berriedale (the progenitor of the Oliphant's of Berriedale) second son of the second Lord Oliphant, by his marriage to Christian, the daughter and heiress of Alexander Sutherland of Duffus in 1497.\n*[[Hatton Castle, Angus|Hatton Castle]] was built in 1575 by Laurence, the 4th Lord Oliphant and replaced the previous nearby wooden fortalice of [[Balcraig Castle]].  Hatton Castle was restored in the 20th century.\n*Following the decline in the Oliphant fortunes and the loss of Aberdalgie by the main branch of the family, by the 19th century the estates of Gask in Perthshire, [[List of listed buildings in Forgandenny, Perth and Kinross|Condie]], Rossie also in Perthshire and Kinneddar were those most associated with the Oliphant Clan. Although the land at Gask was held by Oliphants from the mid 14th century and although no Castle was ever built there, it is the site of 'The Auld Hoose' in Carolina Oliphant's song.\n*There is no Clan Seat currently but [[Ardblair Castle]], near Blairgowrie in Perthshire is the seat of one of the Clan Chieftains, the Oliphant of Gask.  Ardblair contains the largest collection of Oliphant heirlooms and portraits today.\n\n==See also==\n*[[David Olifard]]\n*[[Laurence, 1st Lord Oliphant]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant, 3rd Lord Oliphant]]\n*[[Lord Oliphant]]\n*[[Oliphant (disambiguation)]]\n*[[William Oliphant, Lord Newton]]\n*[[William Oliphant, Lord of Aberdalgie]]\n*[[Margaret Oliphant]]\n*[[Thomas Oliphant (musician and artist)]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (Scottish politician)|Laurence Oliphant, 8th of Condie]]\n*[[Anthony Oliphant|Sir Anthony Oliphant]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (author)]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (British Army officer)|Major General Sir Laurence James Oliphant]]\n*[[James Oliphant]]\n*[[Lancelot Oliphant|Sir Lancelot Oliphant]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (Jacobite)]]\n*[[Findo Gask]]\n*[[Rob Oliphant]]\n*[[Scottish clan]]\n*[[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Belgium]]\n*[[Maha Nuge Gardens]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n<ref>{{cite book|last1=Oxenham Hewlett|first1=William|title=Notes on dignities in the peerage of Scotland which are dormant or which have been forfeited|date=1882|publisher=Wildy & Sons|location=London|isbn=1342403894|edition=First|url=https://archive.org/details/notesondignities00hewluoft|accessdate=16 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.clanoliphant.com/ Oliphant Clan and Family Association]\n*[http://www.scotclans.com/scottish-clans/clan-oliphant/ Clan Oliphant at ScotClans.com]\n*[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/ntor/oliphan2.html http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/ntor/oliphan2.html]\n*[http://www.scotweb.co.uk/info/oliphant/]\n*[[John Riddell (genealogist)|John Riddell]], [https://archive.org/details/inquiryintolawa00riddgoog ''Inquiry into the law and practice in Scottish peerages: before, and after the union; involving the questions of jurisdiction, and forfeiture: together with an exposition of our genuine, original consistorial law'', pub.

Founded by officials from several Cork clubs (including [[Cork United F.C. (1979\u20131982)|Cork United]] and [[Avondale United F.C. (Cork)|Avondale United]]), the new club was elected to the [[League of Ireland]]. [[Bobby Tambling]] was the first manager appointed to the club, but he was replaced by Tony 'Tucker' Allen after only 13 games.\n\nIn its first and second seasons, the young club barely averted relegation to the new First Division \u2013 failing to win a single game at home in [[Flower Lodge]] and avoiding relegation only on goal difference. The club reached the semi-finals of the FAI Cup, but were knocked-out by [[Shamrock Rovers]] \u2013 in the last match played at the Lodge.\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:10px;\"\n|-\n|<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:250 height:860\nPlotArea   = width:50 height:840 left:50 bottom:10\n\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:1984 till:2019\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:1984\n\n# there is no automatic collision detection,\n# so shift texts up or down manually to avoid overlap\n\nDefine $dx = 25 # shift text to right side of bar\nDefine $dy = -5\n\nPlotData=\n  bar:Leaders color:green width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:S\n\n  from:1984 till:1984 shift:($dx) text:[[Bobby Tambling]]\n  from:1984  till:1986 shift:($dx) text:[[Tony Allen (footballer)|Tony Allen]]\n  from:1986 till:1987 shift:($dx) text:[[Noel O'Mahony]]\n  from:1987  till:1988 shift:($dx) text:[[Eamonn O\u2019Keefe]]\n  from:1988 till:1992 shift:($dx,10) text:[[Noel O'Mahony]]~FAI League Cup Winners 1988~UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1989~UEFA Cup 1991~League of Ireland Champions 1992\n  from:1992  till:1993 shift:($dx) text:[[Damien Richardson (footballer)|Damien Richardson]]~UEFA European Cup 1993\n  from:1993  till:1994 shift:($dx,10) text:[[Noel O'Mahony]]~UEFA Cup 1994~FAI League Cup 1994\n  from:1994  till:1995 shift:($dx) text:[[Rob Hindmarch]]\n  from:1995  till:2000 shift:($dx) text:[[Dave Barry (Irish footballer)|Dave Barry]]~UEFA Intertoto Cup 1997~FAI Cup 1998~FAI League Cup 1998~UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1998~UEFA Cup 1999\n  from:2000  till:2000 shift:($dx) text:[[Derek Mountfield]]~[[Colin Murphy]]\n  from:2000  till:2003 shift:($dx) text:[[Liam Murphy (football)|Liam Murphy]]~UEFA Cup 2000~UEFA Intertoto Cup 2001\n  from:2003  till:2005 shift:($dx) text:[[Pat Dolan]]~UEFA Intertoto Cup 2004\n  from:2005  till:2008 shift:($dx,10) text:[[Damien Richardson (footballer)|Damien Richardson]]~League of Ireland Champions 2005~UEFA Cup 2005~UEFA Champions' League 2006~UEFA Intertoto Cup 2007~FAI Ford Cup 2007\n  from:2008  till:2009 shift:($dx) text:[[Alan Mathews]]~Setanta Sports Cup 2008\n  from:2009  till:2010 shift:($dx) text:[[Paul Doolin]]\n  from:2010  till:2013 shift:($dx) text:[[Tommy Dunne (footballer born 1972)|Tommy Dunne]]~LOI First Division 2011\n  from:2013  till:2019 shift:($dx,40) text:[[John Caulfield (Irish footballer)|John Caulfield]]~UEFA Europa League 2015~President's Cup 2016~UEFA Europa League 2016~FAI Cup 2016~President's Cup 2017~UEFA Europa League 2017~League of Ireland Champions 2017~FAI Cup 2017~President's Cup 2018\n  from:2019  till:2019 shift:($dx,-5) text:[[Neale Fenn]]</timeline>\n|}\n\nIn 1986 the club moved to a new home at [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]], where new manager [[Noel O'Mahony]] brought Cork to a midtable finish. The following year, former Ireland striker [[Eamon O'Keefe]] arrived as manager, delivering the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]], and the [[League of Ireland Cup]] (the club's first national silverware).\n\nBy 1988, O'Mahony was re-installed as manager, and the side finished eighth in the league, and a loss to champions [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] in the [[FAI Cup]] final earned the club its first European ticket. While [[Torpedo Moscow]] knocked the club out of the [[1989\u201390 European Cup Winners' Cup]], City earned a fifth-place finish in the Premier Division, and the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]] was reclaimed.\n\n===1990s===\nThe early 1990s saw lengthy unbeaten league runs, high league positions, retention of the Munster Senior Cup through four years, and a number of games in European competition. The most notable European game was a [[UEFA Cup]] tie with [[Bayern Munich]], which saw City hold the Germans 1:1 at [[Musgrave Park, Cork|Musgrave Park]] before falling 0:2 to late goals in Bavaria. 1993 saw Cork City land the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] title for the first time, after a [[1993 League of Ireland Championship Play-offs|complicated three team play-off]]. O'Mahoney resigned and the club moved to a [[Bishopstown Stadium|new stadium in Bishopstown]] at the end of the season.\n\n[[Damien Richardson (footballer)|Damien Richardson]] took the helm and the 1993/94 season began with City coming from three goals down to beat Welsh side [[Cwmbran Town F.C.|Cwmbran Town]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. In the following round they suffered odd-goal defeats both home and away to Turkish side [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]]. City finished in runners-up position in the league that year.\n\n1994/95 was a varied season for Cork City. After a strong start to the season, financial pressures forced Richardson to resign and with Bishopstown not being developed to plan, games were switched to [[Cobh]], [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]], and an enforced trip to [[Tolka Park]]. [[Noel O'Mahony]] was re-appointed as manager but the title challenge collapsed. The club did have successes in the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]] and [[League of Ireland Cup]] that season however.\n\n[[File:Turners.cross.jpg|thumb|left|Cork City returned to [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]] in 1996]]\nAt the start of the 1995/96 season [[Rob Hindmarch]] took the reins, but the club was in trouble. With the stadium dragging it under, the receiver was called in and the club left 'homeless'. Efforts to save the situation saw a new board installed and a move back to Turners Cross. With limited funds, Hindmarch had skimmed along but relegation still threatened, and a Cup exit saw [[Dave Barry (Irish footballer)|Dave Barry]] appointed. The team managed a ninth-place finish in the league, and for the first time in five years City lost the Munster Cup \u2013 to Waterford junior side [[Waterford Crystal F.C.|Waterford Crystal]].\n\n1996/97 saw City finish in fourth place. The club also narrowly lost out in the League Cup with an unexpected loss to First Division [[Galway United F.C.|Galway United]]. Crowds began to increase, and the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]] was recaptured. The following season Cork performed well in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|InterToto Cup]] and the team improved to third in the league. Dave Barry's reign reached its high point in that year, when City won the 1998 FAI Cup. Cork began the following season with eight straight wins but in the end had to settle for second place, as three defeats to champions [[St Patrick's Athletic]] were costly. After finishing runner up for the second season in a row in 1999/2000, Barry resigned to be replaced by [[Colin Murphy (footballer born 1950)|Colin Murphy]].\n\n===2000s===\nColin Murphy stayed for one [[FAI Super Cup]] game before departing to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] just days before a [[UEFA Cup]] game. His replacement, [[Derek Mountfield]], lasted less than a season and was replaced by former player Liam Murphy. Under Murphy, City embarked on a 13-game unbeaten run that brought an [[Intertoto]] ticket and a tenth Munster Cup success.\n\nIn 2001, a controversial link-up was proposed between City, English side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and local outfit Mayfield United. Fans protested however, and the link-up never materialised. Also in 2001, the board of directors stepped down and businessman [[Brian Lennox]] assumed control and lead the club to a [[History of football (soccer)#From amateurism to professionalism|professional era]].\n\n2002 was most notable as a time of transition, as several older players, who had been a mainstay of the team in the 1990s, left the club or joined the coach staff. They were replaced by younger signings \u2013 such as [[George O'Callaghan]], [[John O'Flynn]] and [[Dan Murray (English footballer)|Dan Murray]].\n\nIn February 2003 ex-[[St. Patrick's Athletic|St. Pat's]] manager [[Pat Dolan]] was unveiled as the new boss and he led City to third place in the new summer season. Dolan's second season as manager also proved successful, as City surpassed [[Malm\u00f6 FF]] and [[NEC Nijmegen]] in the Intertoto Cup and secured second place in the league.\n\nDolan was controversially sacked in pre-season 2005 and replaced by former manager Damien Richardson. In 2005, Richardson lead Cork City to their second league championship \u2013 winning on the final day of the season with a 2\u20130 victory over [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]]. In the same year, Cork City finished runners-up the [[FAI Cup]].\n\n[[Image:City-belgrade.jpg|thumb|right|UEFA Champions League qualifier- Cork City v Crvena Zvezda]]\n2006 saw further upgrade work begin at [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]] and City met [[Apollon Limassol]] and [[Red Star Belgrade]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. The club lost to Drogheda United in the Setanta Cup Final, finished 4th in the league, and secured a place in the Intertoto and Setanta Cup.\n\nAt the start of the 2007 season, two new signings [[FIFA Two|were deemed ineligible for play]]. This mirrored an inconsistent season start, with elimination from the Setanta Cup, a home win against St. Pat's and a record-equalling 4\u20131 defeat to [[Sligo Rovers]]. In August 2007, [[Roy O'Donovan]] left for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] for a record [[League of Ireland|LOI]] fee of \u20ac500,000. 2007 also saw the club's ownership change hands: from chairman Brian Lennox to venture capital firm \"Arkaga\". Despite an [[FAI Cup]] win, manager Damien Richardson's future at the club was in doubt, and \u2013 after some acrimony \u2013 he and the club parted ways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2007/1220/corkcity.html |publisher=RT\u00c9 |title=Richardson and Cork agree exit deal |date=20 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223045856/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2007/1220/corkcity.html |archivedate=23 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, former [[Longford Town FC|Longford Town]] boss [[Alan Mathews]] became manager,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/0115/corkcity.html |publisher=RT\u00c9 Sport |title=Mathews confirmed as new Cork manager |date=15 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517051335/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/0115/corkcity.html |archivedate=17 May 2008 }}</ref> and the club signed several players \u2013 including taking advantage of FIFA's changes to the \"3 club\" rule by re-signing [[George O'Callaghan]] from [[Ipswich Town]].

While David Mooney retained the league's top scorer spot, City failed to take points from Bohemians or St. Pats and finished fifth in the league.

Since the club's inception in 1984, the kits also featured a red trim \u2013 influenced in part by the traditional [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] colours of [[Cork GAA|County Cork]]. Over the years, these base colours were worn in different combinations:<ref name=\"kits\">{{cite web|url = http://www.corkcitykits.com/kitsindex.html | publisher = CorkCityKits.com | title = Cork City Kits - Kit Index |accessdate = 15 November 2017 }}</ref> originally green and white hoops in 1984, then white shirts with green and red trim in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.corkcityfc.ie/images/kits.gif | publisher = CorkCityFC.ie | title = Kits image | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616140909/http://www.corkcityfc.ie/images/kits.gif |archivedate=16 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the club broke with tradition to use a red and white kit \u2013 similar to the Cork County GAA kits. Subsequently, the club reverted to the green and white theme in 2002, initially with white sidings rather than stripes, but eventually returning to green white and red stripes.<ref name=\"kits\"/>\n\nFrom 1984 to 2004, the team never wore a kit with a single solid colour.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} However, in 2004, when playing [[Intertoto]] cup opponents [[N.E.C. (football club)|NEC Nijmegen]], the referee deemed that both of Cork City's kits clashed with both of NEC's kits. The club was forced to hurriedly source an alternative while en route to the [[Netherlands]]. The team wore all-white kits with a makeshift crest and sponsorship.\n\nThere was a recurring theme of black away kits \u2013 often with yellow trim \u2013 reflecting the kits of former Cork clubs.<ref name=\"kits\"/> In 2004, a Cork XI selection featuring a number of City players faced [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], wearing yellow and black. Black again became the colour of the team's away jersey in 2008, with a jersey from Danish maker [[Hummel International|Hummel]].\n\nIn 2010, the club kept with tradition by wearing a green home kit with red and white trim manufactured by Hummel. The away kit was red with white trim, similar to the 1997\u20132001 home kits, and Cork GAA kits. These kits were used for the 2010 and 2011 seasons. City wore red at home for the first time since the 2001/02 season on 10 September 2010 against Mervue United to show support for the Cork Gaelic Footballers who were due to face Down in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final the following weekend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkcityfc.net/home/2010/09/08/city-to-wear-red-on-friday/|title=corkcityfc.net: City to Wear Red on Friday |date=8 September 2010|work=airtricityleague.com|accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2011, the club announced [[Umbro]] Ireland as the club's official kit partner.<ref>{{cite web |last=Release |first=Press |url=http://www.wnl.ie/newsdesk/articles/7012/cork-city-sign-umbro-kit-deal/ |title=Cork City sign Umbro kit deal - Extratime.ie - League of Ireland ! |publisher=Wnl.ie |accessdate=15 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116101233/http://www.wnl.ie/newsdesk/articles/7012/cork-city-sign-umbro-kit-deal/ |archivedate=16 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For the 2015, 2016 and 2017 seasons, the club's official kit partner was [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], with gear provided by Teamwear Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|author=\u00c9anna Buckley |url=http://www.corkcityfc.ie/home/2014/09/30/kit-deal-agreed-with-teamwear-ireland/ |title=Kit Deal Agreed with Teamwear Ireland - Cork City Football Club |publisher=Corkcityfc.ie |date= |accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref> In September 2017 it was announced that Cork City had signed a three-year deal with kit supplier Adidas starting from the 2018 season.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.the42.ie/cork-city-will-be-back-in-adidas-kit-for-the-2018-season-3593836-Sep2017/ | publisher = The42.ie | title = Cork City FC will be back in adidas kits for the 2018 season | date = 12 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Supporters and rivalries==\n[[File:Turners Cross Stadium Shed End Cork City v Dundalk 24 April 2015 1.JPG|thumb|Colour from \"shed-end\" supporters ahead of a near-capacity game in April 2015<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.the42.ie/cork-city-dundalk-turners-cross-fans-2069310-Apr2015/ |date=25 April 2015 |title=Cork City apologise to fans who were locked out of Turner's Cross |publisher= TheJournal.ie }}</ref>]]\n[[File:Cork City decoration.jpg|thumb|upright|Graphic of a Cork City shirt decorating a bar on [[Grand Parade, Cork|Grand Parade]] ]]\nCork City have one of the biggest support bases in the [[League of Ireland]], and for example in early 2017 had average attendances of between four and five thousand per home game, compared to a league average of approximately 1,500.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.extratime.ie/articles/18756/league-of-ireland-attendances-2017---gameweek-1-8/ | publisher = ExtraTime.ie | title = League of Ireland Attendances 2017 - Gameweek 1-8 | date= 15 April 2017 }}</ref> The club had an average attendance of 4,453 during the 2015 season, the highest in Ireland, and approximately 1,000 higher than the next highest averages.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.extratime.ie/newsdesk/articles/14143/2015-league-of-ireland-attendances---the-story-so-far/ | publisher =\n ExtraTime.ie | title = 2015 League of Ireland Attendances - The Story so far | date= 27 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\n\"The Shed\" is a section of seating in the Curragh Road stand which is home to Cork City's more vocal supporters.

Founded by officials from several Cork clubs (including [[Cork United F.C. (1979\u20131982)|Cork United]] and [[Avondale United F.C. (Cork)|Avondale United]]), the new club was elected to the [[League of Ireland]]. [[Bobby Tambling]] was the first manager appointed to the club, but he was replaced by Tony 'Tucker' Allen after only 13 games.\n\nIn its first and second seasons, the young club barely averted relegation to the new First Division \u2013 failing to win a single game at home in [[Flower Lodge]] and avoiding relegation only on goal difference. The club reached the semi-finals of the FAI Cup, but were knocked-out by [[Shamrock Rovers]] \u2013 in the last match played at the Lodge.\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:10px;\"\n|-\n|<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:250 height:860\nPlotArea   = width:50 height:840 left:50 bottom:10\n\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:1984 till:2019\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:1984\n\n# there is no automatic collision detection,\n# so shift texts up or down manually to avoid overlap\n\nDefine $dx = 25 # shift text to right side of bar\nDefine $dy = -5\n\nPlotData=\n  bar:Leaders color:green width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:S\n\n  from:1984 till:1984 shift:($dx) text:[[Bobby Tambling]]\n  from:1984  till:1986 shift:($dx) text:[[Tony Allen (footballer)|Tony Allen]]\n  from:1986 till:1987 shift:($dx) text:[[Noel O'Mahony]]\n  from:1987  till:1988 shift:($dx) text:[[Eamonn O\u2019Keefe]]\n  from:1988 till:1992 shift:($dx,10) text:[[Noel O'Mahony]]~FAI League Cup Winners 1988~UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1989~UEFA Cup 1991~League of Ireland Champions 1992\n  from:1992  till:1993 shift:($dx) text:[[Damien Richardson (footballer)|Damien Richardson]]~UEFA European Cup 1993\n  from:1993  till:1994 shift:($dx,10) text:[[Noel O'Mahony]]~UEFA Cup 1994~FAI League Cup 1994\n  from:1994  till:1995 shift:($dx) text:[[Rob Hindmarch]]\n  from:1995  till:2000 shift:($dx) text:[[Dave Barry (Irish footballer)|Dave Barry]]~UEFA Intertoto Cup 1997~FAI Cup 1998~FAI League Cup 1998~UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1998~UEFA Cup 1999\n  from:2000  till:2000 shift:($dx) text:[[Derek Mountfield]]~[[Colin Murphy]]\n  from:2000  till:2003 shift:($dx) text:[[Liam Murphy (football)|Liam Murphy]]~UEFA Cup 2000~UEFA Intertoto Cup 2001\n  from:2003  till:2005 shift:($dx) text:[[Pat Dolan]]~UEFA Intertoto Cup 2004\n  from:2005  till:2008 shift:($dx,10) text:[[Damien Richardson (footballer)|Damien Richardson]]~League of Ireland Champions 2005~UEFA Cup 2005~UEFA Champions' League 2006~UEFA Intertoto Cup 2007~FAI Ford Cup 2007\n  from:2008  till:2009 shift:($dx) text:[[Alan Mathews]]~Setanta Sports Cup 2008\n  from:2009  till:2010 shift:($dx) text:[[Paul Doolin]]\n  from:2010  till:2013 shift:($dx) text:[[Tommy Dunne (footballer born 1972)|Tommy Dunne]]~LOI First Division 2011\n  from:2013  till:2019 shift:($dx,40) text:[[John Caulfield (Irish footballer)|John Caulfield]]~UEFA Europa League 2015~President's Cup 2016~UEFA Europa League 2016~FAI Cup 2016~President's Cup 2017~UEFA Europa League 2017~League of Ireland Champions 2017~FAI Cup 2017~President's Cup 2018\n  from:2019  till:2019 shift:($dx,-5) text:[[Neale Fenn]]</timeline>\n|}\n\nIn 1986 the club moved to a new home at [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]], where new manager [[Noel O'Mahony]] brought Cork to a midtable finish. The following year, former Ireland striker [[Eamon O'Keefe]] arrived as manager, delivering the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]], and the [[League of Ireland Cup]] (the club's first national silverware).\n\nBy 1988, O'Mahony was re-installed as manager, and the side finished eighth in the league, and a loss to champions [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] in the [[FAI Cup]] final earned the club its first European ticket. While [[Torpedo Moscow]] knocked the club out of the [[1989\u201390 European Cup Winners' Cup]], City earned a fifth-place finish in the Premier Division, and the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]] was reclaimed.\n\n===1990s===\nThe early 1990s saw lengthy unbeaten league runs, high league positions, retention of the Munster Senior Cup through four years, and a number of games in European competition. The most notable European game was a [[UEFA Cup]] tie with [[Bayern Munich]], which saw City hold the Germans 1:1 at [[Musgrave Park, Cork|Musgrave Park]] before falling 0:2 to late goals in Bavaria. 1993 saw Cork City land the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] title for the first time, after a [[1993 League of Ireland Championship Play-offs|complicated three team play-off]]. O'Mahoney resigned and the club moved to a [[Bishopstown Stadium|new stadium in Bishopstown]] at the end of the season.\n\n[[Damien Richardson (footballer)|Damien Richardson]] took the helm and the 1993/94 season began with City coming from three goals down to beat Welsh side [[Cwmbran Town F.C.|Cwmbran Town]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. In the following round they suffered odd-goal defeats both home and away to Turkish side [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]]. City finished in runners-up position in the league that year.\n\n1994/95 was a varied season for Cork City. After a strong start to the season, financial pressures forced Richardson to resign and with Bishopstown not being developed to plan, games were switched to [[Cobh]], [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]], and an enforced trip to [[Tolka Park]]. [[Noel O'Mahony]] was re-appointed as manager but the title challenge collapsed. The club did have successes in the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]] and [[League of Ireland Cup]] that season however.\n\n[[File:Turners.cross.jpg|thumb|left|Cork City returned to [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]] in 1996]]\nAt the start of the 1995/96 season [[Rob Hindmarch]] took the reins, but the club was in trouble. With the stadium dragging it under, the receiver was called in and the club left 'homeless'. Efforts to save the situation saw a new board installed and a move back to Turners Cross. With limited funds, Hindmarch had skimmed along but relegation still threatened, and a Cup exit saw [[Dave Barry (Irish footballer)|Dave Barry]] appointed. The team managed a ninth-place finish in the league, and for the first time in five years City lost the Munster Cup \u2013 to Waterford junior side [[Waterford Crystal F.C.|Waterford Crystal]].\n\n1996/97 saw City finish in fourth place. The club also narrowly lost out in the League Cup with an unexpected loss to First Division [[Galway United F.C.|Galway United]]. Crowds began to increase, and the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]] was recaptured. The following season Cork performed well in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|InterToto Cup]] and the team improved to third in the league. Dave Barry's reign reached its high point in that year, when City won the 1998 FAI Cup. Cork began the following season with eight straight wins but in the end had to settle for second place, as three defeats to champions [[St Patrick's Athletic]] were costly. After finishing runner up for the second season in a row in 1999/2000, Barry resigned to be replaced by [[Colin Murphy (footballer born 1950)|Colin Murphy]].\n\n===2000s===\nColin Murphy stayed for one [[FAI Super Cup]] game before departing to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] just days before a [[UEFA Cup]] game. His replacement, [[Derek Mountfield]], lasted less than a season and was replaced by former player Liam Murphy. Under Murphy, City embarked on a 13-game unbeaten run that brought an [[Intertoto]] ticket and a tenth Munster Cup success.\n\nIn 2001, a controversial link-up was proposed between City, English side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and local outfit Mayfield United. Fans protested however, and the link-up never materialised. Also in 2001, the board of directors stepped down and businessman [[Brian Lennox]] assumed control and lead the club to a [[History of football (soccer)#From amateurism to professionalism|professional era]].\n\n2002 was most notable as a time of transition, as several older players, who had been a mainstay of the team in the 1990s, left the club or joined the coach staff. They were replaced by younger signings \u2013 such as [[George O'Callaghan]], [[John O'Flynn]] and [[Dan Murray (English footballer)|Dan Murray]].\n\nIn February 2003 ex-[[St. Patrick's Athletic|St. Pat's]] manager [[Pat Dolan]] was unveiled as the new boss and he led City to third place in the new summer season. Dolan's second season as manager also proved successful, as City surpassed [[Malm\u00f6 FF]] and [[NEC Nijmegen]] in the Intertoto Cup and secured second place in the league.\n\nDolan was controversially sacked in pre-season 2005 and replaced by former manager Damien Richardson. In 2005, Richardson lead Cork City to their second league championship \u2013 winning on the final day of the season with a 2\u20130 victory over [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]]. In the same year, Cork City finished runners-up the [[FAI Cup]].\n\n[[Image:City-belgrade.jpg|thumb|right|UEFA Champions League qualifier- Cork City v Crvena Zvezda]]\n2006 saw further upgrade work begin at [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]] and City met [[Apollon Limassol]] and [[Red Star Belgrade]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. The club lost to Drogheda United in the Setanta Cup Final, finished 4th in the league, and secured a place in the Intertoto and Setanta Cup.\n\nAt the start of the 2007 season, two new signings [[FIFA Two|were deemed ineligible for play]]. This mirrored an inconsistent season start, with elimination from the Setanta Cup, a home win against St. Pat's and a record-equalling 4\u20131 defeat to [[Sligo Rovers]]. In August 2007, [[Roy O'Donovan]] left for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] for a record [[League of Ireland|LOI]] fee of \u20ac500,000. 2007 also saw the club's ownership change hands: from chairman Brian Lennox to venture capital firm \"Arkaga\". Despite an [[FAI Cup]] win, manager Damien Richardson's future at the club was in doubt, and \u2013 after some acrimony \u2013 he and the club parted ways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2007/1220/corkcity.html |publisher=RT\u00c9 |title=Richardson and Cork agree exit deal |date=20 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223045856/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2007/1220/corkcity.html |archivedate=23 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, former [[Longford Town FC|Longford Town]] boss [[Alan Mathews]] became manager,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/0115/corkcity.html |publisher=RT\u00c9 Sport |title=Mathews confirmed as new Cork manager |date=15 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517051335/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/0115/corkcity.html |archivedate=17 May 2008 }}</ref> and the club signed several players \u2013 including taking advantage of FIFA's changes to the \"3 club\" rule by re-signing [[George O'Callaghan]] from [[Ipswich Town]].

While David Mooney retained the league's top scorer spot, City failed to take points from Bohemians or St. Pats and finished fifth in the league.

Since the club's inception in 1984, the kits also featured a red trim \u2013 influenced in part by the traditional [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] colours of [[Cork GAA|County Cork]]. Over the years, these base colours were worn in different combinations:<ref name=\"kits\">{{cite web|url = http://www.corkcitykits.com/kitsindex.html | publisher = CorkCityKits.com | title = Cork City Kits - Kit Index |accessdate = 15 November 2017 }}</ref> originally green and white hoops in 1984, then white shirts with green and red trim in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.corkcityfc.ie/images/kits.gif | publisher = CorkCityFC.ie | title = Kits image | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616140909/http://www.corkcityfc.ie/images/kits.gif |archivedate=16 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the club broke with tradition to use a red and white kit \u2013 similar to the Cork County GAA kits. Subsequently, the club reverted to the green and white theme in 2002, initially with white sidings rather than stripes, but eventually returning to green white and red stripes.<ref name=\"kits\"/>\n\nFrom 1984 to 2004, the team never wore a kit with a single solid colour.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} However, in 2004, when playing [[Intertoto]] cup opponents [[N.E.C. (football club)|NEC Nijmegen]], the referee deemed that both of Cork City's kits clashed with both of NEC's kits. The club was forced to hurriedly source an alternative while en route to the [[Netherlands]]. The team wore all-white kits with a makeshift crest and sponsorship.\n\nThere was a recurring theme of black away kits \u2013 often with yellow trim \u2013 reflecting the kits of former Cork clubs.<ref name=\"kits\"/> In 2004, a Cork XI selection featuring a number of City players faced [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], wearing yellow and black. Black again became the colour of the team's away jersey in 2008, with a jersey from Danish maker [[Hummel International|Hummel]].\n\nIn 2010, the club kept with tradition by wearing a green home kit with red and white trim manufactured by Hummel. The away kit was red with white trim, similar to the 1997\u20132001 home kits, and Cork GAA kits. These kits were used for the 2010 and 2011 seasons. City wore red at home for the first time since the 2001/02 season on 10 September 2010 against Mervue United to show support for the Cork Gaelic Footballers who were due to face Down in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final the following weekend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkcityfc.net/home/2010/09/08/city-to-wear-red-on-friday/|title=corkcityfc.net: City to Wear Red on Friday |date=8 September 2010|work=airtricityleague.com|accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2011, the club announced [[Umbro]] Ireland as the club's official kit partner.<ref>{{cite web |last=Release |first=Press |url=http://www.wnl.ie/newsdesk/articles/7012/cork-city-sign-umbro-kit-deal/ |title=Cork City sign Umbro kit deal - Extratime.ie - League of Ireland ! |publisher=Wnl.ie |accessdate=15 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116101233/http://www.wnl.ie/newsdesk/articles/7012/cork-city-sign-umbro-kit-deal/ |archivedate=16 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For the 2015, 2016 and 2017 seasons, the club's official kit partner was [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], with gear provided by Teamwear Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|author=\u00c9anna Buckley |url=http://www.corkcityfc.ie/home/2014/09/30/kit-deal-agreed-with-teamwear-ireland/ |title=Kit Deal Agreed with Teamwear Ireland - Cork City Football Club |publisher=Corkcityfc.ie |date= |accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref> In September 2017 it was announced that Cork City had signed a three-year deal with kit supplier Adidas starting from the 2018 season.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.the42.ie/cork-city-will-be-back-in-adidas-kit-for-the-2018-season-3593836-Sep2017/ | publisher = The42.ie | title = Cork City FC will be back in adidas kits for the 2018 season | date = 12 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Supporters and rivalries==\n[[File:Turners Cross Stadium Shed End Cork City v Dundalk 24 April 2015 1.JPG|thumb|Colour from \"shed-end\" supporters ahead of a near-capacity game in April 2015<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.the42.ie/cork-city-dundalk-turners-cross-fans-2069310-Apr2015/ |date=25 April 2015 |title=Cork City apologise to fans who were locked out of Turner's Cross |publisher= TheJournal.ie }}</ref>]]\n[[File:Cork City decoration.jpg|thumb|upright|Graphic of a Cork City shirt decorating a bar on [[Grand Parade, Cork|Grand Parade]] ]]\nCork City have one of the biggest support bases in the [[League of Ireland]], and for example in early 2017 had average attendances of between four and five thousand per home game, compared to a league average of approximately 1,500.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.extratime.ie/articles/18756/league-of-ireland-attendances-2017---gameweek-1-8/ | publisher = ExtraTime.ie | title = League of Ireland Attendances 2017 - Gameweek 1-8 | date= 15 April 2017 }}</ref> The club had an average attendance of 4,453 during the 2015 season, the highest in Ireland, and approximately 1,000 higher than the next highest averages.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.extratime.ie/newsdesk/articles/14143/2015-league-of-ireland-attendances---the-story-so-far/ | publisher =\n ExtraTime.ie | title = 2015 League of Ireland Attendances - The Story so far | date= 27 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\n\"The Shed\" is a section of seating in the Curragh Road stand which is home to Cork City's more vocal supporters.
