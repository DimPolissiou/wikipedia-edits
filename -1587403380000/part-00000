Consumer electronics items were mainly sold to \"diplomats from all over the world\" on 120 m\u00b2. In 1968 the two founded the company Hansa-Foto. Since 1969, private customers have also been able to shop at Saturn and Hansa-Foto. In 1972, the Waffenschmidts opened the first technical department store in Cologne with what they claimed to be the \"largest [[phonograph record]] in the world\". In the early 1980s, a large branch was opened on the [[Theresienh\u00f6he]] in [[Munich]], followed in 1985 by a branch in [[Frankfurt]] with the participation of Kaufhof. Saturn was acquired by the [[Media Markt]] holding company in 1990, both of which were merged into the MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group.\n\nIn 1992 there were seven Saturn Hansa stores (Cologne, Frankfurt, Munich, Dortmund, Hanover, Nuremberg, Gelsenkirchen).\n\nThe area of \u200b\u200ba market is usually between 2,000 m\u00b2 and 10,000 m\u00b2. An exception can be found in Hamburg with 18,000 m\u00b2 and six floors which is the largest electronics store in the world. Its origins relate to the merger of the [[Horten AG|Horten]] and Kaufhof departament stores in the mid-1990s. In Hamburg, Knauhof and Horten had stores side by side in M\u00f6nckebergstrasse, at the main train station. Both Saturn and Kaufhof were part of the Metro Group, so the Horten store was closed and occupied in 1999 with the electronics store.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.saturn.eu/ Saturn Europe]\n* [http://www.saturn.at/ Saturn Austria]\n* [http://www.saturn.de/ Saturn Germany]\n* [http://www.saturn.lu/ Saturn Luxembourg]\n\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 1961]]\n[[Category:Consumer electronics retailers of Germany]]\n[[Category:Retail companies of Germany]]\n[[Category:Metro Group]]\n\n[[de:Media-Saturn-Holding#Marke \u201eSaturn\u201c]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{advert|date=March 2017}}\n{{original research|date=March 2017}}\n{{primary sources|date=March 2017}}\n}}\n:''Not to be confused with the [[Saturn Corporation]].''\n [[Image:Saturn-Logo.svg|260px|right]]\n[[Image:Saturn Hamburg-Altstadt, M\u00f6nckebergstra\u00dfe 1 (2006).jpg|260px|right|thumb|Saturn store in Hamburg at night]]\n'''Saturn''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[Chain store|chain]] of [[electronics]] stores, now found in several [[Europe]]an countries.

He lives with Juliet Higgins, a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent assigned by Masters to protect the estate, and native Hawaiian Kumu Tuileta, who is the estate's cultural curator. (Juliet Higgins replaces the male character Jonathan Higgins from the original series.) Juliet often assists Thomas with his cases, and becomes a full partner in the agency during season 2. Magnum is also frequently assisted by two former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]], Rick Wright and TC Calvin. Rick is now a bar owner, while TC is a pilot whose main business is running helicopter tours of the islands. Magnum tends to butt heads with HPD Detective Gordon Katsumoto, but the two also help each other when needed.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Jay Hernandez]] as [[Thomas Magnum]], a former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] who is a security consultant for the successful novelist Robin Masters, living in the guest house on his estate, while also working as a [[private investigator]]\n* [[Perdita Weeks]] as [[Jonathan Higgins#2018 reboot|Juliet Higgins]], a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent who is [[majordomo]] to Robin Masters; she and Magnum bicker but become allies\n* [[Zachary Knighton]] as Orville \"Rick\" Wright, a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] veteran and former [[door gunner]], who runs his own [[tiki bar]] and is also a [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]]\n* Stephen Hill as Theodore \"TC\" Calvin, a Marine veteran and [[helicopter]] pilot who runs helicopter tours of Hawaii and is a member of Magnum's team\n* [[Amy Hill]] as Teuila \"Kumu\" Tuileta, the cultural [[curator]] of Robin Masters' estate\n* [[Tim Kang]] as HPD Detective Gordon Katsumoto, who dislikes Magnum but usually comes to the team's aid when needed\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[James Remar]] as Captain Buck Greene, Magnum's former C.O.\n* [[Domenick Lombardozzi]] as Sebastian Nuzo, Magnum's friend who was killed in the pilot but recurs in flashbacks\n* [[Corbin Bernsen]] as Francis \"Icepick\" Hofstetler, Rick's underworld-connected father figure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tvline.com/2018/11/20/corbin-bernsen-cast-magnum-pi-icepick-prisoner/ |title=Corbin Bernsen Cast on ''Magnum P.I.'' as [Spoiler]'s Degenerate Father Figure |last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |work=TVLine |date=November 20, 2018 |access-date=November 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123200751/https://tvline.com/2018/11/20/corbin-bernsen-cast-magnum-pi-icepick-prisoner/ |archive-date=November 23, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bernsen guest starred in [[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0 ]] in another part.\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Luther H.

He lives with Juliet Higgins, a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent assigned by Masters to protect the estate, and native Hawaiian Kumu Tuileta, who is the estate's cultural curator. (Juliet Higgins replaces the male character Jonathan Higgins from the original series.) Juliet often assists Thomas with his cases, and becomes a full partner in the agency during season 2. Magnum is also frequently assisted by two former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]], Rick Wright and TC Calvin. Rick is now a bar owner, while TC is a pilot whose main business is running helicopter tours of the islands. Magnum tends to butt heads with HPD Detective Gordon Katsumoto, but the two also help each other when needed.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Jay Hernandez]] as [[Thomas Magnum]], a former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] who is a security consultant for the successful novelist Robin Masters, living in the guest house on his estate, while also working as a [[private investigator]]\n* [[Perdita Weeks]] as [[Jonathan Higgins#2018 reboot|Juliet Higgins]], a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent who is [[majordomo]] to Robin Masters; she and Magnum bicker but become allies\n* [[Zachary Knighton]] as Orville \"Rick\" Wright, a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] veteran and former [[door gunner]], who runs his own [[tiki bar]] and is also a [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]]\n* Stephen Hill as Theodore \"TC\" Calvin, a Marine veteran and [[helicopter]] pilot who runs helicopter tours of Hawaii and is a member of Magnum's team\n* [[Amy Hill]] as Teuila \"Kumu\" Tuileta, the cultural [[curator]] of Robin Masters' estate\n* [[Tim Kang]] as HPD Detective Gordon Katsumoto, who dislikes Magnum but usually comes to the team's aid when needed\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[James Remar]] as Captain Buck Greene, Magnum's former C.O.\n* [[Domenick Lombardozzi]] as Sebastian Nuzo, Magnum's friend who was killed in the pilot but recurs in flashbacks\n* [[Corbin Bernsen]] as Francis \"Icepick\" Hofstetler, Rick's underworld-connected father figure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tvline.com/2018/11/20/corbin-bernsen-cast-magnum-pi-icepick-prisoner/ |title=Corbin Bernsen Cast on ''Magnum P.I.'' as [Spoiler]'s Degenerate Father Figure |last=Mitovich |first=Matt Webb |work=TVLine |date=November 20, 2018 |access-date=November 23, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123200751/https://tvline.com/2018/11/20/corbin-bernsen-cast-magnum-pi-icepick-prisoner/ |archive-date=November 23, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bernsen guest starred in [[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0 ]] in another part.\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Luther H.
