There she befriends and becomes roommates with human Marco Diaz ([[Adam McArthur]]) and begins a semi-normal life in Echo Creek, attending school and meeting new friends. Throughout the first season, the two travel to exotic dimensions using dimensional scissors while preventing the Mewman monster Ludo ([[Alan Tudyk]]) from stealing Star's magic wand. As the series progresses, Star and Marco meet new friends, take on new enemies, and travel to even more weird and wild dimensions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/disney-tries-something-new-with-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil-a-woman-creator-102477.html|title=Disney Tries Something New With \u2018Star Vs.

The fourth season has a few more half-hour episodes than prior seasons. Greenlit for Disney Channel in 2013, the first episode aired there on January 18, 2015, as a preview, then the series moved over to Disney XD on March 30, 2015, where its premiere on Disney XD became the most-watched animated series debut in the network's history. The fourth and final season premiered on March 10, 2019, in its return to Disney Channel, with two new episodes airing every Sunday. The series concluded on May 19, 2019, with the episode \"Cleaved\".\n\n==Plot==\n{{Main|List of Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters}}\n[[Star Butterfly]] is a [[Magical girl|magical princess]] from the [[Parallel universes in fiction|dimension]] of Mewni and the heiress to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. As per tradition, she is given the family heirloom wand on her 14th birthday. After she accidentally sets fire to the family castle, her parents King River and Queen Moon Butterfly decide that a safer option is to send her to Earth as a [[foreign exchange student]], so she can continue her magic training there. She befriends Marco Diaz and lives with his family in suburban [[Los Angeles]] while attending Echo Creek Academy. Going in a series of misadventures using \"dimensional scissors\" that can open portals, Star and Marco must deal with everyday school life while protecting Star's wand from falling into the hands of Ludo, a half-bird half-man creature from Mewni who commands a group of monsters.\n\nAs the series progresses, new, more threatening antagonists appear in the show, including the mysterious monster Toffee, and the plot shifts from the defence of the wand from Ludo to a bigger and more complex narrative focusing on the various conflicts revolving around the rulership of Mewni. Several mysteries about the past of the Butterly royal family are also unveiled, mostly revolving around Eclipsa Butterfly, the \"Queen of Darkness\" and the most infamous member in the Butterflys' family history. Several secondary protagonists also appear more prominently or join the series in subsequent seasons, including Star's Mewman best friend Pony Head (who is a floating unicorn head), half-demon ex-boyfriend Tom, the mischievous Janna, and Magic High Commission member Hekapoo; Queen Moon also takes on a bigger role, especially with Toffee.\n\n==Background and production==\nNefcy said she originally created Star as a girl who wanted to be a [[magical girl]] like ''[[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]]'', and Marco as a boy who was obsessed with ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' and karate; they would be enemies instead of friends. In this earlier version, Star did not have any actual magical powers; she instead would approach and solve problems primarily through the force of her determination alone.<ref name=\"bloginterview 20150720\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2015/07/20/creator-daron-nefcy-guides-us-through-tonights-star-studded-episode-of-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil/|title=Creator Daron Nefcy Guides Us Through Tonight\u2019s Star-Studded Episode of Star Vs. the Forces of Evil|date=July 20, 2015|work=Disney Insider Blog|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"nerdist\">{{Cite web|last=Rutherford|first=Kristen|title=Interview: Daron Nefcy of Disney\u2019s Star vs. the Forces of Evil|url=http://nerdist.com/interview-daron-nefcy-of-disneys-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil/|work=[[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]]|date=March 26, 2015 }}</ref> Nefcy began pitching the show to [[Cartoon Network]] during the time when she was in her third year of college, when the network was actively soliciting the creation of pilots for prospective new shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UbQPpioOV0|title=Animation Success Stories - Season 2 - Episode 25 - Podcast with Daron Nefcy|first=|last=Animation Success Stories Podcast|date=February 10, 2019|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/StarVStheForcesofEvil/comments/apj88f/the_most_interesting_information_from_daron/|title=r/StarVStheForcesofEvil - The most interesting information from Daron Nefcy's ASS Podcast|website=reddit}}</ref><ref name=\"comicbook.com\"/> Nefcy originally placed Star in the fourth grade, reflecting on a time in her own childhood when she held a self-described obsession with the animated series ''[[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]]''. However, Nefcy later adjusted the character's age to fourteen during the time she made her series proposition to Disney rather than Cartoon Network originally.<ref name=\"bloginterview 20150720\"/><ref name=\"comicbook.com\"/><ref name=\"huffpost\">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/how-comic-con-helped-crea_b_5989262.html|title=How Comic-Con Helped Create Fans for Disney XD's ''Star vs. The Forces of Evil'' Six Months Before Its First Episode Airs - Jim Hill|author=|date=|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}</ref> An executive at that time made the suggestion for Star to have actual magical powers. Nefcy worked this concept into the show's current iteration, along with the idea of different dimensions as show locations, the framing device of Star being a foreign exchange student, and the plot aspects relating to Star being a princess and the subsequent consequences of her royal birthright.<ref name=\"nerdist\"/> Nefcy said that the overall concept has evolved over about six years.<ref name=\"huffpost\"/>\n\nIn addition to ''[[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', Nefcy has said that she had heavy influence in her youth from the animated Japanese shows ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'', ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'' and ''[[Unico]]'', the last of which featured a blue unicorn. She also cited shows unrelated to Japanese animation such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'',<ref name=\"nerdist\"/> and was influenced by independent comic series such as ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'' and ''The Dungeon''.<ref name=\"huffpost\"/> With regards to the development of more strong female characters, Nefcy said that she \"looked at TV over the years and I have had to go to Japan when I was younger to find the cartoons that had the characters that I wanted to see. It was always a question of 'Well, why isn't that on TV in the U.S.?'\"<ref name=\"bloginterview 20150720\"/>\n\nOne of the concepts she likes about the show is that it does not make high school the most important experience for teenagers. She also likes that Star does her own thing instead of being concerned about fitting in.<ref name=\"nerdist\"/> Nefcy did not want the gimmick about keeping the magic powers a secret from others as typical of magical girl shows, so she had the students already know about it and Marco's parents as well. She also portrays Star as not really a superhero as she does not specifically go after super-villains except when they attack her, and that she does not really save people.<ref name=\"comicbook.com\"/> Nefcy said that the episodes balance comedy and drama: \"we really want our characters to feel like teenagers and have them going through the normal emotions that teenagers go through, but in this magical setting.\"<ref name=\"bloginterview 20150720\"/>\n\nStoryboarding and design are done in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"huffpost\"/> In describing the process, Nefcy said that the show is storyboard-driven, with each episode mapped out by the storyboard artists. The storyboarders also do the writing, taking a two-page outline and turning it into a full script. A storyboard for 11 minutes would require about 2000 drawings to be done in a six-week period.<ref name=\"business insider 2015-3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/disney-animator-shares-best-and-worst-parts-of-her-job-2015-3|title=Disney animator shares best and worst parts of her job|work=[[Business Insider]]|first=Jacquelyn|last=Smith|date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}</ref> After pre-production in the US, the first season animation was done at [[Mercury Filmworks]] in Ottawa, Canada.

There she befriends and becomes roommates with human Marco Diaz ([[Adam McArthur]]) and begins a semi-normal life in Echo Creek, attending school and meeting new friends. Throughout the first season, the two travel to exotic dimensions using dimensional scissors while preventing the Mewman monster Ludo ([[Alan Tudyk]]) from stealing Star's magic wand. As the series progresses, Star and Marco meet new friends, take on new enemies, and travel to even more weird and wild dimensions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/disney-tries-something-new-with-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil-a-woman-creator-102477.html|title=Disney Tries Something New With \u2018Star Vs.

The fourth season has a few more half-hour episodes than prior seasons. Greenlit for Disney Channel in 2013, the first episode aired there on January 18, 2015, as a preview, then the series moved over to Disney XD on March 30, 2015, where its premiere on Disney XD became the most-watched animated series debut in the network's history. The fourth and final season premiered on March 10, 2019, in its return to Disney Channel, with two new episodes airing every Sunday. The series concluded on May 19, 2019, with the episode \"Cleaved\".\n\n==Plot==\n{{Main|List of Star vs. the Forces of Evil characters}}\n[[Star Butterfly]] is a [[Magical girl|magical princess]] from the [[Parallel universes in fiction|dimension]] of Mewni and the heiress to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. As per tradition, she is given the family heirloom wand on her 14th birthday. After she accidentally sets fire to the family castle, her parents King River and Queen Moon Butterfly decide that a safer option is to send her to Earth as a [[foreign exchange student]], so she can continue her magic training there. She befriends Marco Diaz and lives with his family in suburban [[Los Angeles]] while attending Echo Creek Academy. Going in a series of misadventures using \"dimensional scissors\" that can open portals, Star and Marco must deal with everyday school life while protecting Star's wand from falling into the hands of Ludo, a half-bird half-man creature from Mewni who commands a group of monsters.\n\nAs the series progresses, new, more threatening antagonists appear in the show, including the mysterious monster Toffee, and the plot shifts from the defence of the wand from Ludo to a bigger and more complex narrative focusing on the various conflicts revolving around the rulership of Mewni. Several mysteries about the past of the Butterly royal family are also unveiled, mostly revolving around Eclipsa Butterfly, the \"Queen of Darkness\" and the most infamous member in the Butterflys' family history. Several secondary protagonists also appear more prominently or join the series in subsequent seasons, including Star's Mewman best friend Pony Head (who is a floating unicorn head), half-demon ex-boyfriend Tom, the mischievous Janna, and Magic High Commission member Hekapoo; Queen Moon also takes on a bigger role, especially with Toffee.\n\n==Background and production==\nNefcy said she originally created Star as a girl who wanted to be a [[magical girl]] like ''[[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]]'', and Marco as a boy who was obsessed with ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and karate; they would be enemies instead of friends. In this earlier version, Star did not have any actual magical powers; she instead would approach and solve problems primarily through the force of her determination alone.<ref name=\"bloginterview 20150720\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/2015/07/20/creator-daron-nefcy-guides-us-through-tonights-star-studded-episode-of-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil/|title=Creator Daron Nefcy Guides Us Through Tonight\u2019s Star-Studded Episode of Star Vs. the Forces of Evil|date=July 20, 2015|work=Disney Insider Blog|accessdate=November 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"nerdist\">{{Cite web|last=Rutherford|first=Kristen|title=Interview: Daron Nefcy of Disney\u2019s Star vs. the Forces of Evil|url=http://nerdist.com/interview-daron-nefcy-of-disneys-star-vs-the-forces-of-evil/|work=[[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]]|date=March 26, 2015 }}</ref> Nefcy began pitching the show to [[Cartoon Network]] during the time when she was in her third year of college, when the network was actively soliciting the creation of pilots for prospective new shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UbQPpioOV0|title=Animation Success Stories - Season 2 - Episode 25 - Podcast with Daron Nefcy|first=|last=Animation Success Stories Podcast|date=February 10, 2019|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/StarVStheForcesofEvil/comments/apj88f/the_most_interesting_information_from_daron/|title=r/StarVStheForcesofEvil - The most interesting information from Daron Nefcy's ASS Podcast|website=reddit}}</ref><ref name=\"comicbook.com\"/> Nefcy originally placed Star in the fourth grade, reflecting on a time in her own childhood when she held a self-described obsession with the animated series ''[[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]]''. However, Nefcy later adjusted the character's age to fourteen during the time she made her series proposition to Disney rather than Cartoon Network originally.<ref name=\"bloginterview 20150720\"/><ref name=\"comicbook.com\"/><ref name=\"huffpost\">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/how-comic-con-helped-crea_b_5989262.html|title=How Comic-Con Helped Create Fans for Disney XD's ''Star vs. The Forces of Evil'' Six Months Before Its First Episode Airs - Jim Hill|author=|date=|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}</ref> An executive at that time made the suggestion for Star to have actual magical powers. Nefcy worked this concept into the show's current iteration, along with the idea of different dimensions as show locations, the framing device of Star being a foreign exchange student, and the plot aspects relating to Star being a princess and the subsequent consequences of her royal birthright.<ref name=\"nerdist\"/> Nefcy said that the overall concept has evolved over about six years.<ref name=\"huffpost\"/>\n\nIn addition to ''[[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', Nefcy has said that she had heavy influence in her youth from the animated Japanese shows ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'', ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'' and ''[[Unico]]'', the last of which featured a blue unicorn. She also cited shows unrelated to Japanese animation such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'',<ref name=\"nerdist\"/> and was influenced by independent comic series such as ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'' and ''The Dungeon''.<ref name=\"huffpost\"/> With regards to the development of more strong female characters, Nefcy said that she \"looked at TV over the years and I have had to go to Japan when I was younger to find the cartoons that had the characters that I wanted to see. It was always a question of 'Well, why isn't that on TV in the U.S.?'\"<ref name=\"bloginterview 20150720\"/>\n\nOne of the concepts she likes about the show is that it does not make high school the most important experience for teenagers. She also likes that Star does her own thing instead of being concerned about fitting in.<ref name=\"nerdist\"/> Nefcy did not want the gimmick about keeping the magic powers a secret from others as typical of magical girl shows, so she had the students already know about it and Marco's parents as well. She also portrays Star as not really a superhero as she does not specifically go after super-villains except when they attack her, and that she does not really save people.<ref name=\"comicbook.com\"/> Nefcy said that the episodes balance comedy and drama: \"we really want our characters to feel like teenagers and have them going through the normal emotions that teenagers go through, but in this magical setting.\"<ref name=\"bloginterview 20150720\"/>\n\nStoryboarding and design are done in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"huffpost\"/> In describing the process, Nefcy said that the show is storyboard-driven, with each episode mapped out by the storyboard artists. The storyboarders also do the writing, taking a two-page outline and turning it into a full script.

To progress through the game, players are tasked with moving between various  platforms and solving intricate puzzles. The game world unfolds to the player in the form of a [[Metroidvania]], with new movement abilities allowing the player to access previously inaccessible areas. Unlike its predecessor ''[[Ori and the Blind Forest|The Blind Forest]]'', ''Will of the Wisps'' relies on autosaving rather than manually placed \"soul links\", and the sequential upgrade system of the first title has been abandoned for a \"shard\" system that allows players to upgrade Ori in various ways, like sticking to walls and those that are equipped can be changed on the fly.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |title= Ori and the Will of the Wisps is taking serious inspiration from Zelda with its new focus on fluid combat |last= Loveridge |first= Sam |date= February 27, 2020 |accessdate= March 3, 2020 |work= [[GamesRadar+]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303061750/https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> Some of the foundational gameplay elements were inspired by the ''[[Rayman]]'' and ''[[Metroid]]'' franchises.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |title= Soul Links in Ori and the Will of the Wisps \"didn't make sense\", says developer |last= Donovan |first= Imogen |date= March 9, 2020 |accessdate= March 15, 2020 |work= VideoGamer |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200314191058/https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |archive-date= March 14, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nA new mode called Spirit Trials was revealed at [[Gamescom]] 2018.

Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to a baby owl whom Ori, Naru, and Gumo name Ku and, while also continuing their life together, raise her as a family. Ku soon becomes the age to start flying, but being born with a damaged wing, she is unable to until Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking them out of Nibel and into Niwen, where a storm causes them to be separated. \n\nRegaining consciousness from the fall, Ori's search for Ku leads them to Kwolok, a toad looking over the Inkwater Marsh and some of Niwen's inhabitants, the Moki. He tells Ori that Ku is in the Silent Woods, the Moki's former home now turned into a desolate graveyard of owls, but with the waters of Niwen unclean, Ori must set the wheels of The Wellspring back into motion to enter the Silent Woods. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]] to find them. Upon setting The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water, Ori proceeds to enter the Silent Woods. There they soon reunite with Ku, but shortly after encounters Shriek, a deformed owl ruling over the Silent Woods and terrorizing Niwen who was an orphan at birth and rejected by the rest of her kind, turning her vicious. Shriek attacks the pair and kills Ku.\n\nAfter mourning over Ku, Kwolok explains to Ori that the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to bring Ku back in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's prior passing, the light that it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori with seeking out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength, and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. Kwolok leaves his marsh to help Ori with finding one of the wisps, but his body is forcibly taken over by the Stink Spirit, a creature born out of the forest's decay whose body jamming the wheels of The Wellspring was the cause of it\u2019s non-functionality. Ori breaks the spirit's control over Kwolok, allowing him to kill it but leaving him mortally wounded. Before dying, Kwolok pleads to Ori to restore and protect Niwen in his place.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow and Seir revives it. However, the tree tells Ori that its time has passed and it can no longer carry Seir, asking Ori to merge with the light to restore Niwen, though they would have to leave their previous life behind. The Spirit Willow passes Seir onto Ori, but Shriek reappears and snatches it. Ori defeats Shriek, who returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her parents' husks. \n\nMeanwhile, Ori limps their way over to Seir and merges with it, healing Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru, and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they discover a Spirit Tree beginning to grow there. They help the tree flourish and continue their life together, with the Spirit Tree revealing that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the tree completely grows and life begins anew as a new spirit guardian falls from it.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience.

It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \"slightly underwhelming\".<ref name=\"GRadarreview\"/> Brandin Tyrrel of ''[[IGN]]'' also praised the game, saying that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting though, saying that \"it's not much fun\".<ref name=\"PCG review\"/> Writing for ''VideoGamer'', Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\". However, Wise pointed out some negatives towards the game's plot, calling it \"thin\".<ref name=\"VGreview\"/> Tola Onanuga of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the game, saying that \"More than anything else, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an intoxicating feast for the senses. From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \"melancholy at times\" and stating that fighting \"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\". She ended her review in a positive manner, saying that \"Peppered with devious puzzles, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisp[s]'' is an irresistible challenge. There is extraordinary attention to detail - the entire world feels alive with excitement and danger.\"<ref name=\"Guardianreview\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.orithegame.com/ Official website]\n*[https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/ori-will-of-the-wisps Official Xbox website for the game]\n{{Authority control}}{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n[[Category:Adventure games]]\n[[Category:Fantasy games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:Microsoft games]]\n[[Category:Orphans in fiction]]\n[[Category:Platform games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One X enhanced games]]\n[[Category:Metroidvania games]]\n[[Category:2020 video games]]\n[[Category:Video game art]]\n[[Category:Video game sequels]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring female antagonists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox video game\n| title = Ori and the Will of the Wisps\n| image = Ori and the Will of the Wisps.jpg\n| developer = [[Moon Studios]]\n| publisher = [[Xbox Game Studios]]\n| engine = [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]\n| director = Thomas Mahler\n| producer = B\u0142a\u017cej \u017bywiczy\u0144ski\n| writer = {{Unbulleted list|Jeremy Gritton||[[Alexander O.

To progress through the game, players are tasked with moving between various  platforms and solving intricate puzzles. The game world unfolds to the player in the form of a [[Metroidvania]], with new movement abilities allowing the player to access previously inaccessible areas. Unlike its predecessor ''[[Ori and the Blind Forest|The Blind Forest]]'', ''Will of the Wisps'' relies on autosaving rather than manually placed \"soul links\", and the sequential upgrade system of the first title has been abandoned for a \"shard\" system that allows players to upgrade Ori in various ways, like sticking to walls and those that are equipped can be changed on the fly.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |title= Ori and the Will of the Wisps is taking serious inspiration from Zelda with its new focus on fluid combat |last= Loveridge |first= Sam |date= February 27, 2020 |accessdate= March 3, 2020 |work= [[GamesRadar+]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303061750/https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> Some of the foundational gameplay elements were inspired by the ''[[Rayman]]'' and ''[[Metroid]]'' franchises.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |title= Soul Links in Ori and the Will of the Wisps \"didn't make sense\", says developer |last= Donovan |first= Imogen |date= March 9, 2020 |accessdate= March 15, 2020 |work= VideoGamer |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200314191058/https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |archive-date= March 14, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nA new mode called Spirit Trials was revealed at [[Gamescom]] 2018.

Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to a baby owl whom Ori, Naru, and Gumo name Ku and, while also continuing their life together, raise her as a family. Ku soon becomes the age to start flying, but being born with a damaged wing, she is unable to until Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking them out of Nibel and into Niwen, where a storm causes them to be separated. \n\nRegaining consciousness from the fall, Ori's search for Ku leads them to Kwolok, a toad looking over the Inkwater Marsh and some of Niwen's inhabitants, the Moki. He tells Ori that Ku is in the Silent Woods, the Moki's former home now turned into a desolate graveyard of owls, but with the waters of Niwen unclean, Ori must set the wheels of The Wellspring back into motion to enter the Silent Woods. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]] to find them. Upon setting The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water, Ori proceeds to enter the Silent Woods. There they soon reunite with Ku, but shortly after encounters Shriek, a deformed owl ruling over the Silent Woods and terrorizing Niwen who was an orphan at birth and rejected by the rest of her kind, turning her vicious. Shriek attacks the pair and kills Ku.\n\nAfter mourning over Ku, Kwolok explains to Ori that the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to bring Ku back in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's prior passing, the light that it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori with seeking out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength, and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. Kwolok leaves his marsh to help Ori with finding one of the wisps, but his body is forcibly taken over by the Stink Spirit, a creature born out of the forest's decay whose body jamming the wheels of The Wellspring was the cause of it\u2019s non-functionality. Ori breaks the spirit's control over Kwolok, allowing him to kill it but leaving him mortally wounded. Before dying, Kwolok pleads to Ori to restore and protect Niwen in his place.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow and Seir revives it. However, the tree tells Ori that its time has passed and it can no longer carry Seir, asking Ori to merge with the light to restore Niwen, though they would have to leave their previous life behind. The Spirit Willow passes Seir onto Ori, but Shriek reappears and snatches it. Ori defeats Shriek, who returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her parents' husks. \n\nMeanwhile, Ori limps their way over to Seir and merges with it, healing Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru, and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they find a Spirit Tree beginning to grow there. They help the tree flourish and continue their life together, with the Spirit Tree revealing that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the tree completely grows and life begins anew as a new spirit guardian falls from it.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience.

He described the game as \"A hallmark of excellence\", saying that \"There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage\".

However, he mentioned some [[frame rate]] issues regarding the Xbox One version of the game.<ref name=\"Carter\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s Michael Goroff stated positive opinions regarding the game, while pointing out the performance issues which the [[Xbox One]] edition of the game suffered from before the day-one [[patch (computing)|patch]] was released. Goroff further mentioned that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' does everything that a good sequel is supposed to do. It refines ''The Blind Forest''{{'}}s mechanics, expands on the world, and throws in a whole bunch of new moves and concepts. But in an era that's rich with 'emotional platformers', ''Will of the Wisps'' doesn't do anything to make itself stand out. It's a fine, if not forgettable, experience\".<ref name=\"EGMreview\"/> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner praised the game's graphics, story and combat, subsequently calling the game better than its predecessor. Reiner said that \"The story is fantastic, the world is breathtaking, and all of that pales in comparison to the wonderfully made gameplay that soars both as a platforming and combat game. Moon Studios has outdone itself with ''Will of the Wisps'', delivering an experience that doesn't have any lulls, makes the player feel clever, and just keeps getting better as it goes.\"<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s critic Steve Watts gave the game a positive review, commending the combat, exploring elements, story as well as the \"Gorgeous animation and environments\". Moreover, he highlighted occasional visual bugs as negative aspects of the game.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> \n\nAustin Wood, reviewer for ''[[GamesRadar+]]'', acclaimed the game and its \"breathtaking music\", world and its platforming. Wood stated that \"There are a few minor stumbles here and there, but make no mistake: I ''adore'' ''Ori and The Will of the Wisps''. It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \"slightly underwhelming\".<ref name=\"GRadarreview\"/> Brandin Tyrrel of ''[[IGN]]'' also praised the game, saying that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting though, saying that \"it's not much fun\".<ref name=\"PCG review\"/> Writing for ''VideoGamer'', Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\". However, Wise pointed out some negatives towards the game's plot, calling it \"thin\".<ref name=\"VGreview\"/> Tola Onanuga of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the game, saying that \"More than anything else, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an intoxicating feast for the senses. From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \"melancholy at times\" and stating that fighting \"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\". She ended her review in a positive manner, saying that \"Peppered with devious puzzles, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisp[s]'' is an irresistible challenge. There is extraordinary attention to detail - the entire world feels alive with excitement and danger.\"<ref name=\"Guardianreview\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.orithegame.com/ Official website]\n*[https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/ori-will-of-the-wisps Official Xbox website for the game]\n{{Authority control}}{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n[[Category:Adventure games]]\n[[Category:Fantasy games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:Microsoft games]]\n[[Category:Orphans in fiction]]\n[[Category:Platform games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One X enhanced games]]\n[[Category:Metroidvania games]]\n[[Category:2020 video games]]\n[[Category:Video game art]]\n[[Category:Video game sequels]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring female antagonists]]\n", "name_user": "UGM9", "label": "safe", "comment": "Plot: Word change.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ori_and_the_Will_of_the_Wisps"}

The iconic [[Nicholas Tower]], as well as other skyscrapers, are well known throughout the region. These buildings dominate the city's skyline.  Some of the tallest skyscrapers in the Caribbean are located in Port of Spain.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Government House Trinidad 1914.jpg|thumb|300px|Government House, Port of Spain, 1914]]\nThe Port of Spain was founded near the site of the [[Amerindian]] fishing village of Cumucurapo (\"place of the [[Ceiba pentandra|silk cotton trees]]\"), located in the area today known as Mucurapo, west of the city centre. The name Conquerabia is also recorded for an Amerindian settlement in this area; this may have been a separate village, another name for Cumucurapo, or the result of miscomprehension by early Spanish settlers, who established a port here: \"Puerto de los Espa\u00f1oles\", later \"Puerto de Espa\u00f1a\". In 1560, a Spanish garrison was posted near the foot of the [[Laventille]] Hills, which today form the city's eastern boundary.\n\nThe part of today's downtown Port of Spain closest to the sea was once an area of tidal mudflats covered by [[mangroves]]. The first Spanish buildings here, in the 16th and 17th centuries, were open mud-plastered ajoupas, interspersed between large silk cotton trees and other trees. The fort was a mud-walled enclosure with a shack inside, a flagpole, two or three cannon, and few Spanish soldiers. This was captured during [[Walter Raleigh]]'s [[Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition|expedition]] in April 1595. The [[Kalina people|Caribs]] were transient, travelling to the mainland (now [[Venezuela]]) and up the [[Orinoco River]]. The French naval commander [[Victor Marie, duc d'Estr\u00e9es|Comte D'Estr\u00e9es]] visited in 1680, and reported that there was no Port of Spain. But in 1690, Spanish governor Don Sebastien de Roteta reported in writing to the [[King of Spain]]:\nIn 1699, the [[alcalde]] of Trinidad reported to the king that the natives \"were in the habit of showering scorn and abuse upon the Holy Faith and ridiculed with jests the efforts of the Holy Fathers\".\n\nBy 1757, the old capital, San Jos\u00e9 de Oru\u00f1a (modern [[Saint Joseph (Trinidad and Tobago)|Saint Joseph]]), about {{convert|7|mi|km|order=flip|0}} inland, had fallen into disrepair, and [[List of Governors of Trinidad|Governor]] Don Pedro de la Moneda transferred his seat to Port of Spain, which thus became Trinidad's de facto capital. The last Spanish Governor of Trinidad, Don [[Jos\u00e9 Maria Chac\u00f3n]], devoted much of his time to developing the new capital. He compelled the island's Cabildo (governing council) to move to Port of Spain, and he limited its powers to the municipality. The 1783 Cedula of Population, which encouraged the settlement of French [[Catholics]] in the island, led to a rapid increase in the town's population and its geographical extension westwards.\n[[File:QRCClockTower2015.JPG|thumb|Historic [[Queen's Royal College]] Clock Tower 2015]]\nFrom the small cluster of buildings at the foot of the [[Laventille Hills]], eleven streets were laid out west to the area bounded by the St. Ann's River, thus establishing the grid pattern which has survived in downtown Port of Spain to the present day. Along the sea shore was the Plaza de la Marina (Marine Square), a parade ground. By 1786, the town had a population of about 3,000.\n[[File:RosarychurchHenrySt.jpg|thumb|Historic Gothic Rosary Church at the corner of Henry and Park Streets 2008]]\nRealising that the St. Ann's River, prone to flooding, was impeding the expansion of the town, Chac\u00f3n had its course diverted in 1787 so that it ran to the east of the city, along the foot of the Laventille Hills. (During the rainy season the river still had a tendency to overflow its banks, flooding parts of the city; over the decades its channel would be widened and paved. During the dry season the water level drops to a trickle; hence its nickname, the East Dry River.) Port of Spain was now able to continue spreading northwards and westwards, encroaching on the surrounding sugar-cane plantations.\n\nIn 1797, Trinidad was invaded by a British force under General Sir [[Ralph Abercromby]]. The British landed west of Port of Spain, at what is still called Invaders Bay, and marched towards the town. Realising his military resources were inadequate to defend the colony and wishing to avoid unnecessary destruction, Governor Chac\u00f3n capitulated and was able to negotiate generous terms with Abercromby. Port of Spain remained the capital; the new British colonial government renamed most of the streets after British royalty or military figures, but allowed Chac\u00f3n Street (which followed the old course of the St. Ann's River) to retain its name, in tribute to the former governor.\n\nIn 1803, Port of Spain began growing southwards, with the reclamation of the foreshore mudflats, using fill from the Laventille Hills. This began with the area immediately east of the diverted St. Ann's River; the district is still called Sea Lots today. Gradually the landfill crept west and the area south of Plaza del Marina became solid land. Further major reclamation efforts took place in the 1840s, the 1870s, and in 1906. In 1935 the Deep Water Harbour Scheme dredged the offshore area along Port of Spain's western neighbourhoods, and the dredged material was used to fill in the area south of Woodbrook. Wrightson Road, linking downtown Port of Spain to its western suburbs, was constructed at the same time. These reclaimed lands were originally called Docksite, and were home to US forces during World War II; later a number of government buildings were constructed here.\n\nPort of Spain continued to grow in size and importance during the 19th and early 20th centuries, peaking in size in the 1960s at about 100,000 people. Since then the population within the city limits has declined in size as the downtown area has become increasingly commercial and the suburbs in the valleys north, west, and north-east of the city have grown. Today Port of Spain is the western hub of a metropolitan area stretching from Carenage, {{convert|5|mi|km|order=flip|0}} west of the city, to Arima, {{convert|15|mi|km|order=flip|0}} east; this [[East\u2013West Corridor]] runs along the southern edge of Trinidad's [[Northern Range]].\n\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Port of Spain was the temporary capital of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]], though there were plans to build a new federal capital at [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]], on land occupied by the US military base established during [[World War II]]. [[Federation Park]], a residential neighbourhood in western Port of Spain intended to house employees of the federal government, is a memorial to that time.\n\nIn July 1990, an extremist Muslim group held the prime minister and members of parliament hostage for 5 days while rioting and looting shook Port of Spain.<ref name=r1/> The damage was a significant setback to the city's commercial district at a time of severe economic hardship, yet businesses returned. In 2005 there was an unprecedented series of small bombings in Port of Spain which caused injuries to bystanders. They ceased in October 2005 but the perpetrator has not been charged.<ref>[http://www.worldtravelwatch.com/05/10/trinidad-and-tobago-bombing-in-port-of-spain.html Trinidad and Tobago: Bombing in Port-of-Spain \u2013 Terrorist threats] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829115504/http://www.worldtravelwatch.com/05/10/trinidad-and-tobago-bombing-in-port-of-spain.html |date=2008-08-29 }}.

Much development still occurs on new land reclaimed near Invaders Bay (Movietowne, Invaders Bay Tower, Marriott) and in the surrounding Northern Range Mountains.]]\n\nPort of Spain measures about 10.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (c. 4 sq. mi) in area and is located in the northwest section of the island of Trinidad, between the [[Gulf of Paria]], [[Northern Range]] and the [[Caroni Swamp]].\n\nThe [[Northern Range]] is the range of tall, biodiverse hills across the northern portion of Trinidad and is considered an extension of the Andes mountains of South America, although that is geologically incorrect. Over 465 species of birds, and 100 species of mammals can be found in these mountains, making it one of the most biodiverse mountain ranges in the [[Caribbean]]. The Northern Range runs from the [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]] Peninsula in the west to [[Toco]] in the east and consists mainly of steeply dipping metasedimentary rocks and lush rainforest containing a wide variety of plants and animal species. Port of Spain lies at the western end and the city climbs into the hills and valleys which are settled and largely deforested. The two tallest peaks are [[El Cerro del Aripo]] and [[El Tucuche]] which top 900 m (3,000&nbsp;ft).\n\nThe 3278 hectare protected [[Caroni Swamp]] has long formed a physical barrier to the city's expansion to the south, forcing urban growth relentlessly eastward at the expense of a traffic relieving ring road. This west coast mangrove area is the island's second largest wetland after the east coast [[Nariva Swamp]] which is almost twice as large. It has well over 160 species of birds, including the national bird, the [[scarlet ibis]]. It is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions with visitor facilities and regular guided boat tours.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070417185254/http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Agri/agri_WETLANDS_theirsustainabledevelopment.htm Wetlands: Towards their sustainable development].

It is the oldest part of the city and spans between South Quay (to the south), Oxford Street (to the north), the St. Ann's River (to the east), and Richmond Street (to the west). It is the cultural and financial center of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and the wider [[Caribbean]] region and is home to the [[Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange]], the [[Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago]], Port of Spain City Hall, [[The Red House (Trinidad and Tobago)|The Red House]], [[Independence Square (Port of Spain)|Independence Square]], Port of Spain Magistrate Court, Hall of Justice, Ministry of National Security, Ministry of Legal Affairs, The Museum of the City of Port of Spain, [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Port of Spain|Holy Trinity Cathedral]], St. Marry's College, South East Port of Spain Government Secondary School, UWI School Of Business and Applied Studies, Woodfood Square, Colaort Mall, New City Mall, Espermania Plaza, Aboutique Mall, Excellent City Centre, and most of the country's and city's skyscrapers.<ref>https://www.google.com/maps/place/Downtown,+Port+of+Spain,+Trinidad+and+Tobago/@10.6597115,-61.5130843,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8c3607e288036ef9:0x151605af19573381?hl=en-us</ref>\n* '''[[Woodbrook, Port of Spain|Woodbrook]]''' is a large district which was formerly a sugar estate owned by the Siegert family, was sold to the Town Board in 1911 and developed into a residential neighbourhood and wider district. Woodbrook is known for its cultural gingerbread houses and many parks and green spaces and a distinctive architectural heritage.\n* '''[[Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago|Saint James]]''' is north of [[Woodbrook, Port of Spain|Woodbrook]] and west of Saint Clair and is the last district to be incorporated into the city limits. Since the late 19th century, Saint James has been the center of Port of Spain's [[Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Indian]] population and hence many streets in the district has been named after cities and districts in [[South Asia]]. The district is the city's main nightlife district and is given the nickname \"The City that never sleeps\".\n* '''[[Newtown, Port of Spain|Newtown]]''' is a district in north Port of Spain and is home to many churches and schools within the city. The Newtown district has well evolved into a developed business district with many diplomatic mission being situated there.\n* '''[[St Clair, Port of Spain|Saint Clair]]''' is an upscale business and residential district between the [[Queen's Park Savannah]] and the Maraval River. It is home to most of the city's grandest and largest mansions and also home to the [[Magnificent Seven Houses]]. [[Federation Park]] and [[Ellerslie Park]], two of Port of Spain's most upscale neighbourhoods are also located in the district.\n* '''[[Belmont, Port of Spain|Belmont]]''' is a district in the city located at the foot of the Laventille Hills, was the city's first suburb. In the 1840s\u201350s, parts of the area were settled by Africans rescued by the [[Royal Navy]] from illegal [[slave ships]]. In the 1880\u201390s, the population swelled rapidly, and the characteristic Belmont street pattern of narrow, winding lanes developed. The black professional class built large homes in Belmont, as they were excluded from the more expensive neighbourhoods such as St. Clair and Maraval; Belmont became known as \"the Black St. Clair\". Many of these large homes have been renovated and converted to business use, but some remain in family hands. Belmont currently is a lower-middle to middle-class residential neighbourhood. It was the birthplace and early home of many important Carnival designers and bandleaders. Belmont has 9,035 inhabitants.\n\n====Suburbs and Surrounding Towns====\n* '''[[Laventille]]''' is located East of the St. Ann's River, more commonly known as the East Dry River, is the working-class neighbourhood of [[Laventille]]. For visitors entering Port of Spain from the airport, this neighbourhood dominates the city as it spreads over the surrounding hills. The area is unfortunately portrayed as one of the most violent in the country due to drug, gun and turf wars among gangs (financed arguably by illicit drug wealth which does not remain in the community),<ref name=\"ttparliament.org\">[http://www.ttparliament.org/about.php?mid=83&q=engaging+youth+at+risk/ Trinidad and Tobago Parliament]. Ttparliament.org. Retrieved 2016-07-12.</ref> but it is also the birthplace of the [[steelpan]] and, some would argue, the spiritual capital of the city since [[Calypso music|calypso]].  Steelpan and carnival are the life source of many Trinidadians who live in the capital. South of Laventille are [[Beetham Estate Gardens|Beetham Estate]] and [[Sea Lots]], two other economically depressed neighbourhoods.\n\nImmediately north and northwest of Port of Spain lie the suburbs of Cascade, St. Ann's, Maraval and [[Diego Martin]]. The last two districts fall outside the municipal boundary, but are sometimes considered extensions of the city. St. Ann's is notable for being the location of the Prime Minister's official residence and diplomatic centre. Cascade, a mainly suburban area with treed lot type housing is located to the south-eastern area of St. Ann's. Cascade borders St. Ann's by a hill named Mount Hololo, a neighbourhood of both middle class and exclusive housing developments.\n\nMaraval is home to the exclusive Trinidad Country Club and right next door to the popular Long Circular Mall. Further afield, west of Diego Martin, lies the suburb of Westmoorings, which is known for its expensive Miami style highrise apartments facing the seafront. One of Trinidad's poshest shopping centres, The Falls at West-Mall, lies at the centre of these developments. As you head west beyond Carenage settlement is sparse, however the peninsula known as Chaguaramas, which was once a large US Army Base, has become a mecca for hundreds of international cruisers and a world major yacht storage and repair hub.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chagdev.com/ |title=Chaguaramas Development Authority website |publisher=Chagdev.com |date=2009-06-28 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref>\n\nTo the east along the East\u2013West Corridor, also falling outside city limits, lie the large towns of San Juan, Tunapuna and Arima. With congestion rendering downtown inaccessible during peak hours, major shopping centres like Valsayn Shopping Centre, Grand Bazaar and Trincity Mall have sprung up at highway intersections. The last two are noted for being among the largest shopping centres in the country and in the Caribbean, with {{convert|600000|sqft|m2|-4|order=flip}} of commercial space in each. Two large Universities have been established in the eastern section of the E-W corridor \u2013 the regional University of the West Indies, St. Augustine campus and the multi campus local University of Trinidad and Tobago whose main campus is on the Arima outskirts.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe city has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'') climate characterized by warm to hot temperatures year-round, with little seasonal variation due to its proximity to the equator, though nighttime temperatures dip somewhat during the winter months from January to March. Temperatures typically range from 19 to 34&nbsp;\u00b0C, rarely above 35 or below 17. The wet season lasts from May to December, and the dry season lasts from January to April of the following year.

Once sugar land, it was bought by the town council in 1817 from the Peschier family (except for a small parcel near its centre that served as the Peschier cemetery, which remains in private hands).\n\nAt first it was used as a vast cattle pasture in what was then the town's [[suburb]]s, but by the middle of the 19th century it had become established as a park. Until the early 1990s, horse racing was held frequently at the Savannah race track, and it also contains several [[cricket]], [[soccer|football]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]] pitches. Apart from a ring of trees round its perimeter, the Savannah was never really landscaped, except for the small area in its northwest corner called the Hollows, a former [[reservoir]] now drained and planted with flowering shrubs.\n\n[[File:Botanic Gardens Trinidad 2006-03-22.JPG|thumb|Royal Botanic Gardens]]\n\nImmediately north of the Savannah\u2014also the northern limit of the city of Port of Spain\u2014are the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Trinidad|Royal Botanic Gardens]], the [[Emperor Valley Zoo]], [[President's House, Trinidad and Tobago|President's House]] (recently abandoned after one end fell down), the official residence of the prime minister, and Queen's Hall, the city's major performing arts venue. Lady Chancellor Road, which ascends the hills overlooking the Savannah, is one of Port of Spain's most exclusive residential areas and is the current home of former West Indies cricketer and record breaking batsman, Brian Lara.\n\nOn the Savannah's southern side is the Grand Stand, formerly used for viewing horse races, now used for various cultural events, most notably [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival|Carnival]], when a temporary North Stand and raised stage are constructed in front of the Grand Stand, creating the \"Big Yard\", Carnival's central location since the early 20th century (previously, the main viewing area for Carnival was in downtown Port of Spain). From this location the Parade of Bands is broadcast live to the nation on Carnival Monday and Tuesday; it is also the venue for the [[Calypso Monarch]] and Carnival King and Queen Competitions and the finals of the Panorama [[steelpan]] competition. The architecturally soothing arches and curves of the Port of Spain National Academy for the Performing Arts (see picture and caption) dominate the south boundary of the Savannah between the green trimmed landmarks of Memorial Park (in remembrance of fallen soldiers during World Wars I and II) and the gingerbread styled, limestone built, colourful splendour of the Knowsley Ministry of Foreign Affairs Building.\n\nThe western edge of the Savannah, along Maraval Road, is the location of the Magnificent Seven, a group of late Victorian and Edwardian buildings built in an eccentric and flamboyant variety of styles. These are the recently well restored [[Queen's Royal College]]; the residences of the Anglican bishop and the Roman Catholic archbishop; Whitehall, once a private residence, then the office of the prime minister from 1963 to 2010 ; Mille Fleurs, once a private residence, is undergoing full restoration as a public museum and headquarters for the National Heritage Trust and was sold to the Government in 1979; Roomor, an ornate black-and-white ch\u00e2teau-like building that remains a private residence; and Stollmeyer's Castle, a turreted house supposedly modelled on [[Balmoral Castle]].

There are 12 councillors and 4 aldermen. The mayor is elected from the membership of the council.\nThe council is presided over by the mayor, who is effectively the chief custodian of the city. It formulates policy and gives direction for the running of the city through a number of standing committees which each meet at least once per month.\n\nDecisions are then ratified at the statutory meeting of the council, which takes place on the last Wednesday of each month. The policies and directives of the council are executed by the administrative arm of the corporation, which is headed by the chief executive officer and has under her charge a number of senior officers and a workforce of about 3,000 daily-paid and 300 monthly-paid employees.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer and her staff are public servants functioning under the regulations of the Statutory Authorities Service Commissions Ordinance.<ref name=r2>[http://cityofportofspain.gov.tt/ The Port of Spain City Corporation website]. cityofportofspain.org.tt</ref>\n\n===Mayors===\nFollowing an election in 1887, [[Michel Maxwell Philip]] became the mayor, a position that had previously been held by only whites.

Two of the largest banks in the Caribbean, [[Republic Bank, Trinidad and Tobago Limited]] and [[Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago]] (RBTT, reacquired by the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Royal Bank]] in 2008) are headquartered here or base their Caribbean operations in the city.\n\nTrinidad's economy is based on natural gas and oil.

While the popularity of the major shopping area around Frederick Street as a nightspot centre has remained steady or declined, expansion of entertainment venues into the malls and outlying towns has occurred. [[Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago|St. James]], 'uptown' Port of Spain ([[St Clair, Port of Spain|St. Clair]] and [[Woodbrook, Port of Spain|Woodbrook]]) have seen a boom in nightclubs, sports bars and fine dining restaurants as workers from government offices and large corporations disgorge on evenings from high-rise headquarters built in newly commercialized formerly upscale neighbourhoods.\n<!--\n===Scenery/attractions===\n===Media===\n-->\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Port of Spain.JPG|thumb|[[Queen's Park Oval]]]]\nPort of Spain hosts major sporting venues including the [[Queen's Park Oval]], [[Hasely Crawford Stadium]], the Jean Pierre Complex and various sporting fields on the [[Queen's Park Savannah]].

Many of them are referred to as squares or parks. Although some of the Squares have retained some of their \"original framework\" which consists of lengths of metal placed in concrete, which surround the exterior of the space, with each Square having at least four gates. These gates are positioned on the corners so as to allow the main paths of the Square to form an X. Some of the Squares have not retained nor do they give the appearance of having had the lengths of metal placed on its exterior points as lines of demarcation. By virtue of the gates to the Squares not being closed at any time and the lack of metal enclosures on others, there is the impression that these Squares and places are also open to the public at all hours. In some of the Squares, there are street lights to illuminate the interior of the square at nighttime.\n\nSome of the more famous squares are as follows:\n\nLord Harris Square which is located between Pembroke, New and Abercromby Sts. was \"established in the early 1900s, (and) is named as a tribute to Lord Harris, governor of Trinidad between 1846 and 1854\".<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2013-04-19/lord-harris-innovator \"Lord Harris, an innovator\"].

The [[city]] has a municipal population of 37,074 (2011 census),<ref name=census2011/> an urban population of 81,142 (2011 estimate) and a transient daily population of 250,000.<ref name=r2/> It is located on the [[Gulf of Paria]], on the northwest coast of the island of [[Trinidad]] and is part of [[East\u2013West Corridor|a larger conurbation]] stretching from [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]] in the west to [[Arima]] in the east with an estimated population of 600,000.<ref name=\"nationsencyclopedia1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Trinidad-and-Tobago.html |title=Trinidad and Tobago \u2013 Country overview, Location and size, Population, Industry, Oil and gas, Manufacturing, Services, Tourism |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref>\n\nThe city serves primarily as a retail and administrative centre and it has been the capital of the island since 1757. It is also an important [[financial services]] centre for the [[Caribbean]]<ref name=CIA>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/td.html CIA World Factbook Trinidad and Tobago]. cia.gov</ref> and is home to two of the largest banks in the region.\n\nPort of Spain was also the ''[[de facto]]'' capital of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]], which united the Caribbean.\n\nThe city is also home to the largest container port on the island and is one of several shipping hubs of the Caribbean, exporting both agricultural products and manufactured goods. [[Bauxite]] from [[Guyana]] is trans-shipped via facilities at [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|order=flip|0}} west of the city. The pre-lenten [[Carnival]] is the city's main annual cultural festival and tourist attraction.\n\nToday, Port of Spain is a leading city in the Caribbean region. [[Trinidad and Tobago]] hosted the [[Fifth Summit of the Americas]] in 2009 whose guests included [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Barack Obama]] and [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://fifthsummitoftheamericas.org/home/ |title=The website for the secretariat for the fifth summit of the Americas |access-date=2009-03-21 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080218102124/http://fifthsummitoftheamericas.org/home/ |archive-date=2008-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nPort of Spain is also home to the biggest and most successful stock exchange in the Caribbean, the [[Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange]] (TTSE). The iconic [[Nicholas Tower]], as well as other skyscrapers, are well known throughout the region. These buildings dominate the city's skyline.  Some of the tallest skyscrapers in the Caribbean are located in Port of Spain.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Government House Trinidad 1914.jpg|thumb|300px|Government House, Port of Spain, 1914]]\nThe Port of Spain was founded near the site of the [[Amerindian]] fishing village of Cumucurapo (\"place of the [[Ceiba pentandra|silk cotton trees]]\"), located in the area today known as Mucurapo, west of the city centre. The name Conquerabia is also recorded for an Amerindian settlement in this area; this may have been a separate village, another name for Cumucurapo, or the result of miscomprehension by early Spanish settlers, who established a port here: \"Puerto de los Espa\u00f1oles\", later \"Puerto de Espa\u00f1a\". In 1560, a Spanish garrison was posted near the foot of the [[Laventille]] Hills, which today form the city's eastern boundary.\n\nThe part of today's downtown Port of Spain closest to the sea was once an area of tidal mudflats covered by [[mangroves]]. The first Spanish buildings here, in the 16th and 17th centuries, were open mud-plastered ajoupas, interspersed between large silk cotton trees and other trees. The fort was a mud-walled enclosure with a shack inside, a flagpole, two or three cannon, and few Spanish soldiers. This was captured during [[Walter Raleigh]]'s [[Raleigh's El Dorado Expedition|expedition]] in April 1595. The [[Kalina people|Caribs]] were transient, travelling to the mainland (now [[Venezuela]]) and up the [[Orinoco River]]. The French naval commander [[Victor Marie, duc d'Estr\u00e9es|Comte D'Estr\u00e9es]] visited in 1680, and reported that there was no Port of Spain. But in 1690, Spanish governor Don Sebastien de Roteta reported in writing to the [[King of Spain]]:\nIn 1699, the [[alcalde]] of Trinidad reported to the king that the natives \"were in the habit of showering scorn and abuse upon the Holy Faith and ridiculed with jests the efforts of the Holy Fathers\".\n\nBy 1757, the old capital, San Jos\u00e9 de Oru\u00f1a (modern [[Saint Joseph (Trinidad and Tobago)|Saint Joseph]]), about {{convert|7|mi|km|order=flip|0}} inland, had fallen into disrepair, and [[List of Governors of Trinidad|Governor]] Don Pedro de la Moneda transferred his seat to Port of Spain, which thus became Trinidad's de facto capital. The last Spanish Governor of Trinidad, Don [[Jos\u00e9 Maria Chac\u00f3n]], devoted much of his time to developing the new capital. He compelled the island's Cabildo (governing council) to move to Port of Spain, and he limited its powers to the municipality. The 1783 Cedula of Population, which encouraged the settlement of French [[Catholics]] in the island, led to a rapid increase in the town's population and its geographical extension westwards.\n[[File:QRCClockTower2015.JPG|thumb|Historic [[Queen's Royal College]] Clock Tower 2015]]\nFrom the small cluster of buildings at the foot of the [[Laventille Hills]], eleven streets were laid out west to the area bounded by the St. Ann's River, thus establishing the grid pattern which has survived in downtown Port of Spain to the present day. Along the sea shore was the Plaza de la Marina (Marine Square), a parade ground. By 1786, the town had a population of about 3,000.\n[[File:RosarychurchHenrySt.jpg|thumb|Historic Gothic Rosary Church at the corner of Henry and Park Streets 2008]]\nRealising that the St. Ann's River, prone to flooding, was impeding the expansion of the town, Chac\u00f3n had its course diverted in 1787 so that it ran to the east of the city, along the foot of the Laventille Hills. (During the rainy season the river still had a tendency to overflow its banks, flooding parts of the city; over the decades its channel would be widened and paved. During the dry season the water level drops to a trickle; hence its nickname, the East Dry River.) Port of Spain was now able to continue spreading northwards and westwards, encroaching on the surrounding sugar-cane plantations.\n\nIn 1797, Trinidad was invaded by a British force under General Sir [[Ralph Abercromby]]. The British landed west of Port of Spain, at what is still called Invaders Bay, and marched towards the town. Realising his military resources were inadequate to defend the colony and wishing to avoid unnecessary destruction, Governor Chac\u00f3n capitulated and was able to negotiate generous terms with Abercromby. Port of Spain remained the capital; the new British colonial government renamed most of the streets after British royalty or military figures, but allowed Chac\u00f3n Street (which followed the old course of the St. Ann's River) to retain its name, in tribute to the former governor.\n\nIn 1803, Port of Spain began growing southwards, with the reclamation of the foreshore mudflats, using fill from the Laventille Hills. This began with the area immediately east of the diverted St. Ann's River; the district is still called Sea Lots today. Gradually the landfill crept west and the area south of Plaza del Marina became solid land. Further major reclamation efforts took place in the 1840s, the 1870s, and in 1906. In 1935 the Deep Water Harbour Scheme dredged the offshore area along Port of Spain's western neighbourhoods, and the dredged material was used to fill in the area south of Woodbrook. Wrightson Road, linking downtown Port of Spain to its western suburbs, was constructed at the same time. These reclaimed lands were originally called Docksite, and were home to US forces during World War II; later a number of government buildings were constructed here.\n\nPort of Spain continued to grow in size and importance during the 19th and early 20th centuries, peaking in size in the 1960s at about 100,000 people. Since then the population within the city limits has declined in size as the downtown area has become increasingly commercial and the suburbs in the valleys north, west, and north-east of the city have grown. Today Port of Spain is the western hub of a metropolitan area stretching from Carenage, {{convert|5|mi|km|order=flip|0}} west of the city, to Arima, {{convert|15|mi|km|order=flip|0}} east; this [[East\u2013West Corridor]] runs along the southern edge of Trinidad's [[Northern Range]].\n\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Port of Spain was the temporary capital of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]], though there were plans to build a new federal capital at [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]], on land occupied by the US military base established during [[World War II]]. [[Federation Park]], a residential neighbourhood in western Port of Spain intended to house employees of the federal government, is a memorial to that time.\n\nIn July 1990, an extremist Muslim group held the prime minister and members of parliament hostage for 5 days while rioting and looting shook Port of Spain.<ref name=r1/> The damage was a significant setback to the city's commercial district at a time of severe economic hardship, yet businesses returned. In 2005 there was an unprecedented series of small bombings in Port of Spain which caused injuries to bystanders. They ceased in October 2005 but the perpetrator has not been charged.<ref>[http://www.worldtravelwatch.com/05/10/trinidad-and-tobago-bombing-in-port-of-spain.html Trinidad and Tobago: Bombing in Port-of-Spain \u2013 Terrorist threats] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829115504/http://www.worldtravelwatch.com/05/10/trinidad-and-tobago-bombing-in-port-of-spain.html |date=2008-08-29 }}.

Much development still occurs on new land reclaimed near Invaders Bay (Movietowne, Invaders Bay Tower, Marriott) and in the surrounding Northern Range Mountains.]]\n\nPort of Spain measures about 10.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (c. 4 sq. mi) in area and is located in the northwest section of the island of Trinidad, between the [[Gulf of Paria]], [[Northern Range]] and the [[Caroni Swamp]].\n\nThe [[Northern Range]] is the range of tall, biodiverse hills across the northern portion of Trinidad and is considered an extension of the Andes mountains of South America, although that is geologically incorrect. Over 465 species of birds, and 100 species of mammals can be found in these mountains, making it one of the most biodiverse mountain ranges in the [[Caribbean]]. The Northern Range runs from the [[Chaguaramas, Trinidad|Chaguaramas]] Peninsula in the west to [[Toco]] in the east and consists mainly of steeply dipping metasedimentary rocks and lush rainforest containing a wide variety of plants and animal species. Port of Spain lies at the western end and the city climbs into the hills and valleys which are settled and largely deforested. The two tallest peaks are [[El Cerro del Aripo]] and [[El Tucuche]] which top 900 m (3,000&nbsp;ft).\n\nThe 3278 hectare protected [[Caroni Swamp]] has long formed a physical barrier to the city's expansion to the south, forcing urban growth relentlessly eastward at the expense of a traffic relieving ring road. This west coast mangrove area is the island's second largest wetland after the east coast [[Nariva Swamp]] which is almost twice as large. It has well over 160 species of birds, including the national bird, the [[scarlet ibis]]. It is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions with visitor facilities and regular guided boat tours.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070417185254/http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Agri/agri_WETLANDS_theirsustainabledevelopment.htm Wetlands: Towards their sustainable development].

It is the oldest part of the city and spans between South Quay (to the south), Oxford Street (to the north), the St. Ann's River (to the east), and Richmond Street (to the west). It is the cultural and financial center of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and the wider [[Caribbean]] region and is home to the [[Trinidad and Tobago Stock Exchange]], the [[Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago]], Port of Spain City Hall, [[The Red House (Trinidad and Tobago)|The Red House]], [[Independence Square (Port of Spain)|Independence Square]], Port of Spain Magistrate Court, Hall of Justice, Ministry of National Security, Ministry of Legal Affairs, The Museum of the City of Port of Spain, [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Port of Spain|Holy Trinity Cathedral]], St. Marry's College, South East Port of Spain Government Secondary School, UWI School Of Business and Applied Studies, Woodfood Square, Colaort Mall, New City Mall, Espermania Plaza, Aboutique Mall, Excellent City Centre, and most of the country's and city's skyscrapers.<ref>https://www.google.com/maps/place/Downtown,+Port+of+Spain,+Trinidad+and+Tobago/@10.6597115,-61.5130843,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x8c3607e288036ef9:0x151605af19573381?hl=en-us</ref>\n* '''[[Woodbrook, Port of Spain|Woodbrook]]''' is a large district which was formerly a sugar estate owned by the Siegert family, was sold to the Town Board in 1911 and developed into a residential neighbourhood and wider district. Woodbrook is known for its cultural gingerbread houses and many parks and green spaces and a distinctive architectural heritage.\n* '''[[Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago|Saint James]]''' is north of [[Woodbrook, Port of Spain|Woodbrook]] and west of Saint Clair and is the last district to be incorporated into the city limits. Since the late 19th century, Saint James has been the center of Port of Spain's [[Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Indian]] population and hence many streets in the district has been named after cities and districts in [[South Asia]]. The district is the city's main nightlife district and is given the nickname \"The City that never sleeps\".\n* '''[[Newtown, Port of Spain|Newtown]]''' is a district in north Port of Spain and is home to many churches and schools within the city. The Newtown district has well evolved into a developed business district with many diplomatic mission being situated there.\n* '''[[St Clair, Port of Spain|Saint Clair]]''' is an upscale business and residential district between the [[Queen's Park Savannah]] and the Maraval River. It is home to most of the city's grandest and largest mansions and also home to the [[Magnificent Seven Houses]]. [[Federation Park]] and [[Ellerslie Park]], two of Port of Spain's most upscale neighbourhoods are also located in the district.\n* '''[[Belmont, Port of Spain|Belmont]]''' is a district in the city located at the foot of the Laventille Hills, was the city's first suburb. In the 1840s\u201350s, parts of the area were settled by Africans rescued by the [[Royal Navy]] from illegal [[slave ships]]. In the 1880\u201390s, the population swelled rapidly, and the characteristic Belmont street pattern of narrow, winding lanes developed. The black professional class built large homes in Belmont, as they were excluded from the more expensive neighbourhoods such as St. Clair and Maraval; Belmont became known as \"the Black St. Clair\". Many of these large homes have been renovated and converted to business use, but some remain in family hands. Belmont currently is a lower-middle to middle-class residential neighbourhood. It was the birthplace and early home of many important Carnival designers and bandleaders. Belmont has 9,035 inhabitants.\n\n====Suburbs and Surrounding Towns====\n* '''[[Laventille]]''' is located East of the St. Ann's River, more commonly known as the East Dry River, is the working-class neighbourhood of [[Laventille]]. For visitors entering Port of Spain from the airport, this neighbourhood dominates the city as it spreads over the surrounding hills. The area is unfortunately portrayed as one of the most violent in the country due to drug, gun and turf wars among gangs (financed arguably by illicit drug wealth which does not remain in the community),<ref name=\"ttparliament.org\">[http://www.ttparliament.org/about.php?mid=83&q=engaging+youth+at+risk/ Trinidad and Tobago Parliament]. Ttparliament.org. Retrieved 2016-07-12.</ref> but it is also the birthplace of the [[steelpan]] and, some would argue, the spiritual capital of the city since [[Calypso music|calypso]].  Steelpan and carnival are the life source of many Trinidadians who live in the capital. South of Laventille are [[Beetham Estate Gardens|Beetham Estate]] and [[Sea Lots]], two other economically depressed neighbourhoods.\n\nImmediately north and northwest of Port of Spain lie the suburbs of Cascade, St. Ann's, Maraval and [[Diego Martin]]. The last two districts fall outside the municipal boundary, but are sometimes considered extensions of the city. St. Ann's is notable for being the location of the Prime Minister's official residence and diplomatic centre. Cascade, a mainly suburban area with treed lot type housing is located to the south-eastern area of St. Ann's. Cascade borders St. Ann's by a hill named Mount Hololo, a neighbourhood of both middle class and exclusive housing developments.\n\nMaraval is home to the exclusive Trinidad Country Club and right next door to the popular Long Circular Mall. Further afield, west of Diego Martin, lies the suburb of Westmoorings, which is known for its expensive Miami style highrise apartments facing the seafront. One of Trinidad's poshest shopping centres, The Falls at West-Mall, lies at the centre of these developments. As you head west beyond Carenage settlement is sparse, however the peninsula known as Chaguaramas, which was once a large US Army Base, has become a mecca for hundreds of international cruisers and a world major yacht storage and repair hub.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chagdev.com/ |title=Chaguaramas Development Authority website |publisher=Chagdev.com |date=2009-06-28 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref>\n\nTo the east along the East\u2013West Corridor, also falling outside city limits, lie the large towns of San Juan, Tunapuna and Arima. With congestion rendering downtown inaccessible during peak hours, major shopping centres like Valsayn Shopping Centre, Grand Bazaar and Trincity Mall have sprung up at highway intersections. The last two are noted for being among the largest shopping centres in the country and in the Caribbean, with {{convert|600000|sqft|m2|-4|order=flip}} of commercial space in each. Two large Universities have been established in the eastern section of the E-W corridor \u2013 the regional University of the West Indies, St. Augustine campus and the multi campus local University of Trinidad and Tobago whose main campus is on the Arima outskirts.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe city has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'') climate characterized by warm to hot temperatures year-round, with little seasonal variation due to its proximity to the equator, though nighttime temperatures dip somewhat during the winter months from January to March. Temperatures typically range from 19 to 34&nbsp;\u00b0C, rarely above 35 or below 17. The wet season lasts from May to December, and the dry season lasts from January to April of the following year.

From this location the Parade of Bands is broadcast live to the nation on Carnival Monday and Tuesday; it is also the venue for the [[Calypso Monarch]] and Carnival King and Queen Competitions and the finals of the Panorama [[steelpan]] competition. The architecturally soothing arches and curves of the Port of Spain National Academy for the Performing Arts (see picture and caption) dominate the south boundary of the Savannah between the green trimmed landmarks of Memorial Park (in remembrance of fallen soldiers during World Wars I and II) and the gingerbread styled, limestone built, colourful splendour of the Knowsley Ministry of Foreign Affairs Building.\n\nThe western edge of the Savannah, along Maraval Road, is the location of the Magnificent Seven, a group of late Victorian and Edwardian buildings built in an eccentric and flamboyant variety of styles. These are the recently well restored [[Queen's Royal College]]; the residences of the Anglican bishop and the Roman Catholic archbishop; Whitehall, once a private residence, then the office of the prime minister from 1963 to 2010 ; Mille Fleurs, once a private residence, is undergoing full restoration as a public museum and headquarters for the National Heritage Trust and was sold to the Government in 1979; Roomor, an ornate black-and-white ch\u00e2teau-like building that remains a private residence; and Stollmeyer's Castle, a turreted house supposedly modelled on [[Balmoral Castle]]. The slow pace of building restorations over the years remains a concern.<ref>Kalifa Clyne (2012-03-26).

There are 12 councillors and 4 aldermen. The mayor is elected from the membership of the council.\nThe council is presided over by the mayor, who is effectively the chief custodian of the city. It formulates policy and gives direction for the running of the city through a number of standing committees which each meet at least once per month.\n\nDecisions are then ratified at the statutory meeting of the council, which takes place on the last Wednesday of each month. The policies and directives of the council are executed by the administrative arm of the corporation, which is headed by the chief executive officer and has under her charge a number of senior officers and a workforce of about 3,000 daily-paid and 300 monthly-paid employees.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer and her staff are public servants functioning under the regulations of the Statutory Authorities Service Commissions Ordinance.<ref name=r2>[http://cityofportofspain.gov.tt/ The Port of Spain City Corporation website]. cityofportofspain.org.tt</ref>\n\n===Mayors===\nFollowing an election in 1887, [[Michel Maxwell Philip]] became the mayor, a position that had previously been held by only whites.

Most government offices are also located in the city and many important government services can only be accessed in the Ministry offices located downtown. Within recent years, local banks headquartered here have helped it become a financial centre for the Caribbean and Central America region. Two of the largest banks in the Caribbean, [[Republic Bank, Trinidad and Tobago Limited]] and [[Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago]] (RBTT, reacquired by the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Royal Bank]] in 2008) are headquartered here or base their Caribbean operations in the city.\n\nTrinidad's economy is based on natural gas and oil.

While the popularity of the major shopping area around Frederick Street as a nightspot centre has remained steady or declined, expansion of entertainment venues into the malls and outlying towns has occurred. [[Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago|St. James]], 'uptown' Port of Spain ([[St Clair, Port of Spain|St. Clair]] and [[Woodbrook, Port of Spain|Woodbrook]]) have seen a boom in nightclubs, sports bars and fine dining restaurants as workers from government offices and large corporations disgorge on evenings from high-rise headquarters built in newly commercialized formerly upscale neighbourhoods.\n<!--\n===Scenery/attractions===\n===Media===\n-->\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Port of Spain.JPG|thumb|[[Queen's Park Oval]]]]\nPort of Spain hosts major sporting venues including the [[Queen's Park Oval]], [[Hasely Crawford Stadium]], the Jean Pierre Complex and various sporting fields on the [[Queen's Park Savannah]].

Many of them are referred to as squares or parks. Although some of the Squares have retained some of their \"original framework\" which consists of lengths of metal placed in concrete, which surround the exterior of the space, with each Square having at least four gates. These gates are positioned on the corners so as to allow the main paths of the Square to form an X. Some of the Squares have not retained nor do they give the appearance of having had the lengths of metal placed on its exterior points as lines of demarcation. By virtue of the gates to the Squares not being closed at any time and the lack of metal enclosures on others, there is the impression that these Squares and places are also open to the public at all hours. In some of the Squares, there are street lights to illuminate the interior of the square at nighttime.\n\nSome of the more famous squares are as follows:\n\nLord Harris Square which is located between Pembroke, New and Abercromby Sts. was \"established in the early 1900s, (and) is named as a tribute to Lord Harris, governor of Trinidad between 1846 and 1854\".<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2013-04-19/lord-harris-innovator \"Lord Harris, an innovator\"].

Originally an open minded person, he becomes cynical and distrustful of others due to being looked down by his fellow heroes, subjected to religious prejudice from citizens, and being robbed and falsely accused of rape by Malty. It is only after Raphtalia defended him and proclaimed her loyalty that Naofumi began to slowly open up to those around him and realizing his mistakes. Viewing his role as a Hero burdensome, having been summoned against his will, Naofumi shows little remorse in using underhanded tactics to ensure the survival of his party despite the criticism of his fellow Heroes/allies. Generally reluctant to trust strangers, often asking to be paid upfront or using slave curses to prevent lying, he tries his best to live up to the expectations of those who have placed their faith in him or treat him as an equal.\n:After defeating Kyo and ending the threat of the Spirit Tortoise (the Cal Mira Wave in the Anime), Naofumi is given control of Raphtalia's hometown. He soon plans to rebuild and make a makeshift army to fight against the Waves and remaining Guardian Beasts, purchasing the original displaced inhabitants and other slaves to repopulate. He often enjoys pretending to be the villain, much to Raphtalia's annoyance and the amusement of his allies, and working as a merchant/craftsman in his spare time. Believing he'll one day return home, he considers himself a foster parent to Raphtalia and Filo and desires to make sure they can protect themselves in his absence.\n:Although Naofumi has a slow start because of the public's perception of him and being unable to attack enemies directly, he is still able to keep up with his fellow heroes and even outshine them due to unlocking a wide variety of shields that boost his allies and passive skills. Given his high defenses, he is able to shrug off most attacks and displays immunity to most poisons, being only vulnerable to attacks that use his stats against him such as Hengen Muso. His strongest shield, the cursed Shield of Wrath, allows him to counterattack opponents with black flames that rise with his anger at the cost of temporarily decreasing his stats and threatening to allow his inner darkness to take control.  \n\n;{{nihongo|Raphtalia|\u30e9\u30d5\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2|Rafutaria}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Asami Set\u014d]]<ref name=\"Characters\"/>|[[Erica Mendez]]<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}\n: The Vassal Katana Hero and Tanuki Demi-human. Originally living in a village on Melromarc's coast, Raphatalia was left orphaned in the wake of the first Wave to strike the world. Shortly after, she and her fellow villagers were captured and sold into slavery by Melromarc's Royal Knights. First purchased by a nobleman, she is physically and emotionally tortured out of racial resentment towards Demi-humans and left a shell of her former self. Near death and suffering from panic attacks, she was sold back and later purchased by Naofumi who, unable to fight himself and spite towards Malty, desired to use her as his sword in the coming Waves. \n:Under Naofumi's protection, Raphtalia becomes a skilled swordfighter and is able to find closure from her past traumas. Able to see past Naofumi's cynical nature, she falls in love with him and does her best to help him overcome his resentment towards others and losing himself to the Shield of Wrath, even volunteering to have her slave curse re-applied after it is forcibly removed as a sign of devotion. It is later revealed that through her Tanuki herritage, she is an heir to the throne of Q'Ten Lo, her father having eloped to Meloromarc and putting her at odds with her distant relatives.\n:Technically a 10 year old girl, being a Demi-human, Raphtalia's body is able to age to that of a young woman as her levels increase. Due to this, she often gets annoyed when Naofumi treats her as his daughter or is oblivious to her feelings; the latter believing she is only focused on getting stronger. While traveling in Kizuna's world, she is chosen as the wielder of the Vassal Katana (Sever Star Hammer in the Web Novel). She also specializes in Light/Dark magic and is able to turn herself and allies invisible or generate illusions.\n: Raphtalia was selected as the Best Girl in the [[Crunchyroll Anime Awards]] in 2020.<ref>https://www.crunchyroll.com/animeawards/en/vote/index.html</ref>\n\n;{{nihongo|Filo|\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30ed|F\u012bro}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Rina Hidaka]]<ref name=\"cast1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-11-06/the-rising-of-the-shield-hero-anime-casts-rina-hidaka-maaya-uchida/.139132|title=The Rising of The Shield Hero Anime Casts Rina Hidaka, Maaya Uchida|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 6, 2018|access-date=2018-11-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106132240/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-11-06/the-rising-of-the-shield-hero-anime-casts-rina-hidaka-maaya-uchida/.139132|archive-date=2018-11-06|url-status=live}}</ref>|Brianna Knickerbocker<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}\n:A Filolial Queen. Hatching her from an egg purchased from the Slave Trader, Filo is the youngest of Naofumi's allies. She is part of a monster species called Filolials that enjoy pulling carts, and having been raised by a Hero, develops into a Queen. As a Queen, she resembles a large flightless owl and possesses higher attack strength and speed than normal members of her species. In addition, she possesses the unique ability to shapeshift into a young blonde girl with wings, retaining the strength of her true form.\n:Young and boisterous, she has a short attention span, has a ravenous appetite, and often fights Raphtalia and Gaelion for Naofumi's attention, much to his and others annoyance. Also highly impressionable, she has been shown to pick up on some of Naofumi's habits much to Raphtalia's distress. A capable learner, she is able to use advanced wind magic spells and many of the teachings of Hengen Muso with minimal instruction. Her skills are recognized by her Queen predecessor, Fitoria, and is given some of her power.\n:In spite of her sometimes overbearing personality, Filo is able to quickly make friends with others and takes other Filolials on as her underlings. True to her Filolial instincts, her favorite hobby is to pull a custom cart Naofumi made for her. While in Kizuna's world, due to Filolial's not existing, she is transformed into a species called a Humming Fairy, losing her strength in favor of being able to fly and cast magic through singing.\n\n==Summoned Heroes==\n===Legendary Heroes===\n;{{nihongo|Motoyasu Kitamura|\u5317\u6751 \u5143\u5eb7|Kitamura Motoyasu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Makoto Takahashi]]<ref name=\"Characters\"/>|[[Xander Mobus]]<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}\n:The Hero of the Spear. Motoyasu was a university student before he was summoned, having been stabbed to death after a misunderstanding by childhood friend and a classmate. While generally a kindhearted person, he is immensely gullible and thick-headed; showing near complete unawareness of the actions of his manipulative party members or the foresight to plan ahead. A heavy womanizer, he is looked down upon by his fellow heroes for his skirt chasing habits, and is extremely trusting of women to his own detriment. He also displays a Lolita Complex towards Filo, as she resembles a video game character in his home-world.\n:Initially the leader of a party composed entirely of women who act as his cheerleaders and, unaware of her true nature, Motoyasu sympathizes with Malty's claims against Naofumi and invites her to join him; initially leading Naofumi to believe the two were working together. Despite warnings from his fellow Heroes and Melromarc's Queen, he believes Malty\u2019s claims of Naofumi brainwashing others and clashes with him repeatedly, even after Malty\u2019s true nature is exposed. Later, he is abandoned by his party and left for dead during the battle with the Spirit Turtle, leaving him critically depressed. Comforted by Filo, he chooses to re-dedicate his efforts to winning her heart and seeks approval from Naofumi to marry her; leading many to question his mental stability and causing Filo distress with his unwanted advances.\n:Motoyasu is shown to be physically the strongest of the Heroes. He unlocks the cursed Spears of Lust and Envy after Malty\u2019s betrayal, and as a result of their cursed aftereffects: literally seeing/hearing women as squealing pigs, his mental state deteriorates even further. Unaware of the curse, he creates a party composed of Filolials.\n:The title protagonist of ''The Reprise of the Spear Hero,'' Motoyasu, upon being killed in battle, unlocks the ability to time travel and returns to the start of the series with his stats and memories of Filo intact. Proclaiming himself: \"The Love Hunter,\" he dedicates himself again to trying to win Filo's heart and protecting Naofumi from the events that turned him cynical; generally with mixed results.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ren Amaki|\u5929\u6728 \u932c|Amaki Ren}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yoshitsugu Matsuoka]]<ref name=\"Characters\"/>|Alan Lee<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}\n:The Hero of the Sword. Youngest of the Heroes, Ren was a high school student before he was summoned after being killed trying to save a childhood friend. A loner by nature, he does his best to keep his image as a cool guy intact; at one point resorting to cheating when in a losing duel against Eclair. Commanding the most loyalty, he prefers to run his party like a guild and only working directly together when a powerful monster appears believing each member is only responsible for themselves. While the most willing of the Heroes to hear out Naofumi's claims and advice, his condescending nature towards those at lower levels than himself still leads to tension between the two. To the amusement of his fellow heroes, he has a fear of water and is unable to swim.\n:After his entire party is killed by the Spirit Tortoise, he falls into a state of denial and grief. Despite Naofumi's initial attempts to help him, he instead turns to Malty for emotional support and is soon robbed of his belongings. Donning a disguise, he resorts to stealing to get by and becomes the leader of a group of bandits; unlocking the cursed Swords of Greed and Gluttony in the process. \n:In his cursed state, he is re-challenged by Eclair and is easily defeated. Finally willing to accept responsibility for his past mistakes and unable to gain experience or money as a result of using his cursed weapons, he chooses to stay in Naofumi's village and become Eclair's student. He now believes the next step to becoming stronger is to focus on his swordsmanship skills.\n\n;{{nihongo|Itsuki Kawasumi|\u5ddd\u6f84 \u6a39|Kawasumi Itsuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yoshitaka Yamaya]]<ref name=\"Characters\"/>|[[Erik Scott Kimerer]]<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}\n: The Hero of the Bow. Itsuki was a high school student before he was summoned, having been killed after a large truck took a sudden left turn. Calling himself an ally of Justice, he holds a superiority complex and has an innate need for attention, often bragging about his exploits to others. He chooses to run his party in a vigilante-like fashion, primarily taking on missions that involve corrupt officials and assisting others at the most opportune moments. He runs his party within a strict hierarchy of seniority, treating new party members as servants. Due to his self-indulgent attitude and treatment of his party members, Naofumi dislikes him the most of his fellow Heroes. Itsuki's feud with Naofumi comes to a head after he frames Rishia for a crime as a thinly veiled excuse to kick her out of his party; viewing her as weak, a burden, and for upstaging him during the Wave in Cal Mira.\n:His remaining party later betrays him during the battle with the Spirit Tortoise by tying him up and leaving him for dead. In a state of denial, he is soon tricked by Malty into fighting on her behalf in tournaments in Zeltoble; believing he was raising money to help her stop Naofumi from abusing his slaves and extorting citizens for money. Unlocking the cursed Bow of Pride, he fights against Rishia and is defeated as Naofumi and Ren expose the truth. Left in debt by Malty and having lost his volition as a result of his cursed weapon, he begs Rishia for forgiveness and chooses to stay in Naofumi's village as he recovers.\n: Coming from a world where humans have recently developed psychic powers, Itsuki was born with the precision ability called 'Accuracy.' Initally over-confident at a young age, as he grew older and learned that his ability was classified as low-ranking, he turned to games as an escape. Itsuki comes to believe that Naofumi might also have psychic powers due to his ability to inability to be intoxicated & how animals take a natural liking to him.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kizuna Kazeyama|\u98a8\u5c71 \u7d46|Kazeyama Kitzuna}}\n:The Hunting Hero. One of the four Legendary Heroes of the parallel world, Kizuna was playing virtual reality game when she was summoned. Unlike the other Heroes called upon to fight the Waves, she was summoned prior to their appearance and was tasked with defeating a corrupt Dragon Emperor. A strong-willed woman, she has an easy time making friends and enjoys traveling the world. An avid fisherman, her party members sometimes have to restrain her to help keep her focus on tasks at hand. Despite her looks, she is eighteen years old and takes pride in being an otaku. She lives in a home she built herself alongside Glass; later inspiring Naofumi to found his own village. \n:After her party defeated the Demon Dragon, she found herself in a hostile country and was cast into a magic labyrinth. By the time she meets Naofumi and Rishia, having been cast themselves into the labyrinth by Kyo, several years had passed. With Naofumi's assistance, they are able to escape and work together to find their displaced party members. Initially unaware of the threat of the Waves, she orders her party to stop cease their attacks on Naofumi's world. She and her party join Naofumi in defeating Kyo and vow to work together to solve the mystery of the Waves and save their worlds without resorting to killing their opposing Legendary Heroes. \n:Her Legendary Weapon can turn into a large hunting knife or fishing rod. Not unlike Naofumi, she is restricted in her attacking capabilities in that she can only attack monsters. Kizuna does not appear in the original web novel, although Glass, near the end of the story, mentions a close friend gone missing, probably referring to Kizuna.\n\n===Seven Star and Vassal Heroes===\n;{{nihongo|Rishia Ivyred|\u30ea\u30fc\u30b7\u30a2\uff1d\u30a2\u30a4\u30f4\u30a3\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9|Rishia Aivireddo}}\n:{{voiced by|Natsuko Hara|[[Kira Buckland]]}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ValenNamikaze/status/1150463077265092609|title=@KiraBuckland hello Kira, hope you are doing OK.

The daughter of a lesser noble family, she was originally kidnapped by a corrupt nobleman and was saved by Itsuki. Having fallen in love with him and admiring his sense of justice, Rishia joined Itsuki's party. Itsuki, however, seeing her as a burden, tries to drive her away by treating her as more of a servant than a teammate. After inadvertently upstaging him during the Cal Mira Wave, Itsuki resorts to framing her for breaking an important item and kicks her out. Left emotionally frail, Rishia attempts to commit suicide but is rescued by Naofumi and Filo. Sensing a kindred spirit in her and wanting to prove Itsuki wrong, Naofumi takes her into his party, hoping to train her into a capable fighter.\n:Upon meeting the Hengen Muso Master, she is selected to be her apprentice and undergoes heavy training to be able to utilize chi. Later, when Itsuki is corrupted by his cursed weapon, she challenges him to duel with the intent of teaching him the difference between justice and self-righteousness. For her courage, the Legendary Bow chooses her to wield the Seven Star Projectile (Knives/Boomerangs/Throwing Stars); with its true power being released upon its liberation from Takt. Defeating him, she re-joins Itsuki's party and works to help him recover from his curse.\n:A shy young girl with poor stamina, Rishia has lack of confidence in herself but learns to open up after joining Naofumi's party. Despite being at a high level, her stats are notably weak and have poor growths. It is only in times of crisis does her hidden power shine through, allowing her to take on powerful opponents such as Kyo single handed. She also displays a remarkable learning ability and is a budding scholar; leading Naofumi to believe that there are hidden stats she specializes in. \n\n;{{nihongo|Aultcray Melromarc XXXII|\u30aa\u30eb\u30c8\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\uff1d\u30e1\u30eb\u30ed\u30de\u30eb\u30af|Orutokurai Meromaruku XXXII}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yutaka Nakano]]<ref name=\"More cast\"/>|[[Jamieson K.

His hatred of demi-humans is intensified after his sister is murdered by the Hakuko (not realizing she was in love with Siltvelt's Hakuko Prince), and leading him to follow the Church of the Three Heroes.\n:Taking charge of the Melromarc while his wife is away on diplomatic business, Aultcray turned a blind eye to Melromarc's knights when they enslaved Raphtalia's village, and at the behest of the Church, has all four of the Legendary Heroes summoned. Initially tolerant of Naofumi being the Shield Hero, he stages a kangaroo court after his daughter Malty accuses Naofumi of rape and puts in place obstacles to make his life more difficult. Having broken several treaties and degrading the status of the Shield Hero, he is placed under arrest by his wife in an attempt to prevent war from breaking out. He is stripped of his nobility and, in lieu of Naofumi's push for the death penalty, has his named legally changed to: \"Trash.\"\n: Still firm in his beliefs that the Shield Hero will bring nothing but ruin to Melromarc, Aultcray initally remained defiant of Mirellia's attempts to make ammends with Naofumi. Falling into a deep depression upon the deaths of both his wife & his niece Atla, Aultcray is convinced to by Naofumi to live up to Mirellia's final request, both reassuming his role as protector of Melromarc as the Staff Hero; choosing to remain being called \"Trash\" in recognition of his past mistakes.\n\n; {{nihongo|Fohl|\u30d5\u30a9\u30a6\u30eb|Fouru}}\n:The Seven Star Gauntlet Hero and a White Tiger Demi-human.

Deeply overprotective of his younger sister, he often clashes with Atla's adamant personality and leaving him on the receiving end of her attacks; causing Naofumi to wonder who is stronger between two. Despite being half Demi-human, he obtains the ability transform into a Therianthrope and later, with Naofumi's help, gains the ability to use the even stronger: Beast Transformation.

Initially looking down upon Naofumi, she comes to respect him and is grateful for his help in rescuing Kizuna. As a sign of friendship, Naofumi leaves her with a recipe for Soul-Healing Water, to help her cover her weakness in future battles.\n:A member of a race known as Spirit People, at any given time her level and stats are tied directly to her Soul Power. As such, Glass is vulnerable to attacks that can drain this stat. Using her fans, she fights using a graceful form of martial arts.

Unlike her older sister, she is good natured and kind. She holds extreme fondness for Filolials and quickly becomes Filo's best friend. Initially, Naofumi assumed she was like her sister, ignoring her attempts to have him repair relations with her father. Only after being nearly assassinated by her sister and same knights who protected her, Naofumi accepts her as an ally, offering his protection. She later leaves Naofumi's party to focus on her responsibilities to her kingdom.\n:She specializes in water magic and is a skilled diplomat, having traveled the world with her mother. Often teasing her young age, Naofumi respects her wisdom and governing ability and hopes to leave Filo in her care should he return home.

In the web novel she was one of the first batch of slaves from the village that Naofumi bought, while in the light novel she was imprisoned in the dungeon of the noble who'd previously tortured Raphtalia. Initially jealous of Naofumi's relationship with Raphtalia, she comes to view him as an older brother figure giving him the nickname: \"Bubba Shield.\" Wanting to help protect her friends, she asks to join Naofumi's party as well as choosing to become his slave as to take advantage of the stat bonuses of the Legendary Shield. She later becomes the un-official leader of Naofumi's younger slaves, often poking holes in Naofumi's attempts to act tough and helping train to defend themselves. She also assists in Naofumi's merchant business, dressing up to help attract customers of both genders.\n:Wanting to be like her Father, Keel initially thought she was a boy; having not learned the differences between genders. It is only after her friends point out her misconception does she come to realize her misunderstanding. Initially distraught, Naofumi comforts her, explaining and reaffirming his belief in gender equality; stating she's still welcome in his party and he'd be supportive of her seeking a relationship with Raphtalia.

The daughter of a nobleman selected by Mirellia to watch over a Demi-human friendly province. Shortly after the first Wave, of which her father fell victim to, she conducted her own investigation into the Royal Knights that had enslaved Raphtalia's village but was charged with treason and imprisoned by the Church of the Three Heroes. Upon Mirellia's return, she is released and tasked with helping train the Legendary Heroes' Parties; though only Naofumi's party take her instruction seriously. \n: Appointed to look after her late father's territory, she and Naofumi often argue with each other over her greater interest in training instead of governing and Naofumi's morals. Despite this, Naofumi respects her as a swordswoman, being able to outmatch enemies of higher levels such as Raphtalia & Ren using skill alone and assisting in the battle against the Spirit Tortoise & Demon Dragon.\n: In ''The Reprise of the Spear Hero'', having been rescued from her imprisonment by Motoyasu during his fourth time reset, Eclair joins him in acting as Naofumi's bodyguard. Thus far she is the only woman unaffected by Motoyasu's curse, which Motoyasu attributes to her strong moral character.\n\n;{{nihongo|Sadeena|\u30b5\u30c7\u30a3\u30ca|Sadina}}\n:An Orca Demi-human. Hailing from Q'Ten Lo, Sadeena is a former shrine priestess. Viewed as a child prodigy within her clan, Sadeena was forcibly trained from a young age to act as the royal executioner and leading her to distest her family and Q'Ten Lo's leadership. Loyal to Raphtalia's Father, an heir to the Q'Ten Lo throne, she joined him and Raphtalia's mother in their elopement. Away on a fishing trip during the First Wave, Sadeena was unable to protect her fellow villagers or prevent their enslavement by Melromarc's Royal Knights. She tracks the survivors down to Zeltoble, and enslaves herself as a coliseum fighter to buy back their freedom and leading her to a chance meeting with Naofumi's party.\n:A motherly figure to her fellow villagers, she deeply regrets her initial failure to protect her home and Raphtalia in particular. Acting as an older sister, she tries her best to protect Raphtalia from her family history, knowing it could spark a war. An avid alcoholic, she often flirts with Naofumi, who unwittingly beat her in a drinking contest; though it is unknown how true her feelings are. An extremely capable veteran fighter, she possesses enough power to hold her own against Naofumi's entire party and willingly break free of her slave curse; a feat that would kill most. Wielding a trident, she uses a mix of water and lightning magic and can increase her stats by using her Therianthrope form. With Naofumi's assistance, she is later able to unlock her Beast Transformation, allowing her to fly through the air as if she was swimming.\n\n;{{nihongo|Atla|\u30a2\u30c8\u30e9|Atora}}\n:A White Tiger Demi-human, and sister to Fohl.

Able to sense the kindness in his heart, she falls in love with Naofumi and dedicates herself to winning his heart and helping him fight the Waves. \n:Adamant and highly assertive, she often tries to micro-manage and speak on Naofumi's behalf, praising those who show him favor and vowing death to his enemies, much to Naofumi's frustration. She sees Raphtalia as her rival and becomes her sparring partner. Able to naturally sense chi to help her see her surroundings, she uses a gentle fist type of martial arts, often imitating the teachings of Hengen Muso. Considered a prodigy, she is able to easily overpower and outmaneuver opponents of greater physical or defensive strength, outshining her brother despite her lack of combat experience and former afflictions.\n:During the battle against the Guardian Beast Phoenixes, Alta sacrifices herself to protect Naofumi & the Coalition Army. Dying in Naofumi's arms, she confesses her love and kisses him, asking for him to be more aware of the feelings of those around him. To Naofumi's surprise, her body subsequently is absorbed into Legendary Shield unlocking the Blessed Shield of Compassion. \n: Alta, alongside Ost, her soul now being inside the Legendary Shield, later appear before Naofumi to reveal to him the nature of the Legendary & Vassel Weapons and warning of the dark entity behind the Waves.\n\n===Melromarc===\n;{{nihongo|Mirellia Q.

Furious at her husband and eldest daughter for their crimes, she disowns them and revokes their nobility as punishment. Outlawing the Church of the Three Heroes, she wishes to make things right with Naofumi and does her best to support him.\n:Specializing in ice magic, Mirellia is a skilled diplomat and politician and employs several ninja-like bodyguards called \"Shadows\" to keep watch on each of the Heroes. Naofumi comes to hold deep respect for her, having successfully convinced him to punish her family in other ways in lieu of the death penalty and noting the lack of international stability in Kizuna's world. Unlike most of Melromarc's citizens, she holds no prejudice towards Demi-humans and tries her best to improve relations by setting up friendly provinces. Despite their mistakes, she still loves her family and even goes as far as offering to take her life in-exchange for Naofumi's help in fighting the Waves; which he turns down. Mirellia later issues orders for Malty's arrest after she abandons Motoyasu during the battle with the Spirit Tortoise. \n: Joining the Heroes in their investigation of the aftermath of the Guardian Beast Phoenix battle, Mirellia is killed in an ambush set up by Takt & Malty. Using the last of her strength, she asks her husband to put aside his differences with Naofumi and reclaim his role as the Staff Hero.\n\n===Other Characters===\n;{{nihongo|Fitoria|\u30d5\u30a3\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Sakura Tange]]|[[Cristina Vee]]}}<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1123667453240803328|user=CristinaVee| title=I\u2019m Fitoria in the Rising of the Shield Hero!

Acting in secret, Fitoria and her army fight the waves that affect areas left unprotected by the current Legendary Heroes.\n: She first appears before Naofumi's party and offers a safe haven while they're on the run from the Church of the Three Heroes. Threatening to kill him and the other Legendary Heroes to continue the summoning cycle, Fitoria orders Naofumi to work with his fellow Legendary Heroes. Upon Naofumi's refusal, she takes Melty as a hostage and challenges Filo to a duel. Recognizing her potential, she chooses Filo as a potential successor and to trust in Naofumi, gifting Filo with some of her power. Using Filo as a medium, she is able to contact Naofumi with telepathy and assists his party in the battle against the Kyo controlled Spirit Tortoise.\n: A stern figure, Fitoria has come to hold a pessimistic view of humanity. Immensely powerful and taking her duties seriously, she's willing to resort to any measure to protect the world even if it means forcibly continuing the Legendary Hero cycle or allowing the Guardian Beasts to rampage. Like Filo, she can take on the appearance of a young girl.\n\n;{{nihongo|Therese Alexanderite|\u30c6\u30ea\u30b9\uff1d\u30a2\u30ec\u30ad\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8|Terisu Arekisandoraito}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Saori Hayami]]|[[Erika Harlacher]]}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ErikaHarlacher/status/1143934631592386560?s=20|title=Apparently an episode I'm in came out soooo I play Therese in Rising of the Shield Hero!

Originally an open minded person, he becomes cynical and distrustful of others due to being looked down by his fellow heroes, subjected to religious prejudice from citizens, and being robbed and falsely accused of rape by Malty. It is only after Raphtalia defended him and proclaimed her loyalty that Naofumi began to slowly open up to those around him and realizing his mistakes. Viewing his role as a Hero burdensome, having been summoned against his will, Naofumi shows little remorse in using underhanded tactics to ensure the survival of his party despite the criticism of his fellow Heroes/allies. Generally reluctant to trust strangers, often asking to be paid upfront or using slave curses to prevent lying, he tries his best to live up to the expectations of those who have placed their faith in him or treat him as an equal.\n:After defeating Kyo and ending the threat of the Spirit Tortoise (the Cal Mira Wave in the Anime), Naofumi is given control of Raphtalia's hometown. He soon plans to rebuild and make a makeshift army to fight against the Waves and remaining Guardian Beasts, purchasing the original displaced inhabitants and other slaves to repopulate. He often enjoys pretending to be the villain, much to Raphtalia's annoyance and the amusement of his allies, and working as a merchant/craftsman in his spare time. Believing he'll one day return home, he considers himself a foster parent to Raphtalia and Filo and desires to make sure they can protect themselves in his absence.\n:Although Naofumi has a slow start because of the public's perception of him and being unable to attack enemies directly, he is still able to keep up with his fellow heroes and even outshine them due to unlocking a wide variety of shields that boost his allies and passive skills. Given his high defenses, he is able to shrug off most attacks and displays immunity to most poisons, being only vulnerable to attacks that use his stats against him such as Hengen Muso. His strongest shield, the cursed Shield of Wrath, allows him to counterattack opponents with black flames that rise with his anger at the cost of temporarily decreasing his stats and threatening to allow his inner darkness to take control.  \n\n;{{nihongo|Raphtalia|\u30e9\u30d5\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2|Rafutaria}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Asami Set\u014d]]<ref name=\"Characters\"/>|[[Erica Mendez]]<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}\n: The Vassal Katana Hero and Tanuki Demi-human. Originally living in a village on Melromarc's coast, Raphatalia was left orphaned in the wake of the first Wave to strike the world. Shortly after, she and her fellow villagers were captured and sold into slavery by Melromarc's Royal Knights. First purchased by a nobleman, she is physically and emotionally tortured out of racial resentment towards Demi-humans and left a shell of her former self. Near death and suffering from panic attacks, she was sold back and later purchased by Naofumi who, unable to fight himself and spite towards Malty, desired to use her as his sword in the coming Waves. \n:Under Naofumi's protection, Raphtalia becomes a skilled swordfighter and is able to find closure from her past traumas. Able to see past Naofumi's cynical nature, she falls in love with him and does her best to help him overcome his resentment towards others and losing himself to the Shield of Wrath, even volunteering to have her slave curse re-applied after it is forcibly removed as a sign of devotion. It is later revealed that through her Tanuki herritage, she is an heir to the throne of Q'Ten Lo, her father having eloped to Meloromarc and putting her at odds with her distant relatives.\n:Technically a 10 year old girl, being a Demi-human, Raphtalia's body is able to age to that of a young woman as her levels increase. Due to this, she often gets annoyed when Naofumi treats her as his daughter or is oblivious to her feelings; the latter believing she is only focused on getting stronger. While traveling in Kizuna's world, she is chosen as the wielder of the Vassal Katana (Sever Star Hammer in the Web Novel). She also specializes in Light/Dark magic and is able to turn herself and allies invisible or generate illusions.\n: Raphtalia was selected as the Best Girl in the [[Crunchyroll Anime Awards]] in 2020.<ref>https://www.crunchyroll.com/animeawards/en/vote/index.html</ref>\n\n;{{nihongo|Filo|\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30ed|F\u012bro}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Rina Hidaka]]<ref name=\"cast1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-11-06/the-rising-of-the-shield-hero-anime-casts-rina-hidaka-maaya-uchida/.139132|title=The Rising of The Shield Hero Anime Casts Rina Hidaka, Maaya Uchida|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 6, 2018|access-date=2018-11-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106132240/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-11-06/the-rising-of-the-shield-hero-anime-casts-rina-hidaka-maaya-uchida/.139132|archive-date=2018-11-06|url-status=live}}</ref>|Brianna Knickerbocker<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}\n:A Filolial Queen. Hatching her from an egg purchased from the Slave Trader, Filo is the youngest of Naofumi's allies. She is part of a monster species called Filolials that enjoy pulling carts, and having been raised by a Hero, develops into a Queen. As a Queen, she resembles a large flightless owl and possesses higher attack strength and speed than normal members of her species. In addition, she possesses the unique ability to shapeshift into a young blonde girl with wings, retaining the strength of her true form.\n:Young and boisterous, she has a short attention span, has a ravenous appetite, and often fights Raphtalia and Gaelion for Naofumi's attention, much to his and others annoyance. Also highly impressionable, she has been shown to pick up on some of Naofumi's habits much to Raphtalia's distress. A capable learner, she is able to use advanced wind magic spells and many of the teachings of Hengen Muso with minimal instruction. Her skills are recognized by her Queen predecessor, Fitoria, and is given some of her power.\n:In spite of her sometimes overbearing personality, Filo is able to quickly make friends with others and takes other Filolials on as her underlings. True to her Filolial instincts, her favorite hobby is to pull a custom cart Naofumi made for her. While in Kizuna's world, due to Filolial's not existing, she is transformed into a species called a Humming Fairy, losing her strength in favor of being able to fly and cast magic through singing.\n\n==Summoned Heroes==\n===Legendary Heroes===\n;{{nihongo|Motoyasu Kitamura|\u5317\u6751 \u5143\u5eb7|Kitamura Motoyasu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Makoto Takahashi]]<ref name=\"Characters\"/>|[[Xander Mobus]]<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}\n:The Hero of the Spear. Motoyasu was a university student before he was summoned, having been stabbed to death after a misunderstanding by childhood friend and a classmate. While generally a kindhearted person, he is immensely gullible and thick-headed; showing near complete unawareness of the actions of his manipulative party members or the foresight to plan ahead. A heavy womanizer, he is looked down upon by his fellow heroes for his skirt chasing habits, and is extremely trusting of women to his own detriment. He also displays a Lolita Complex towards Filo, as she resembles a video game character in his home-world.\n:Initially the leader of a party composed entirely of women who act as his cheerleaders and, unaware of her true nature, Motoyasu sympathizes with Malty's claims against Naofumi and invites her to join him; initially leading Naofumi to believe the two were working together. Despite warnings from his fellow Heroes and Melromarc's Queen, he believes Malty\u2019s claims of Naofumi brainwashing others and clashes with him repeatedly, even after Malty\u2019s true nature is exposed. Later, he is abandoned by his party and left for dead during the battle with the Spirit Turtle, leaving him critically depressed. Comforted by Filo, he chooses to re-dedicate his efforts to winning her heart and seeks approval from Naofumi to marry her; leading many to question his mental stability and causing Filo distress with his unwanted advances.\n:Motoyasu is shown to be physically the strongest of the Heroes. He unlocks the cursed Spears of Lust and Envy after Malty\u2019s betrayal, and as a result of their cursed aftereffects: literally seeing/hearing women as squealing pigs, his mental state deteriorates even further. Unaware of the curse, he creates a party composed of Filolials.\n:The title protagonist of ''The Reprise of the Spear Hero,'' Motoyasu, upon being killed in battle, unlocks the ability to time travel and returns to the start of the series with his stats and memories of Filo intact. Proclaiming himself: \"The Love Hunter,\" he dedicates himself again to trying to win Filo's heart and protecting Naofumi from the events that turned him cynical; generally with mixed results.\n\n;{{nihongo|Ren Amaki|\u5929\u6728 \u932c|Amaki Ren}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yoshitsugu Matsuoka]]<ref name=\"Characters\"/>|Alan Lee<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}\n:The Hero of the Sword. Youngest of the Heroes, Ren was a high school student before he was summoned after being killed trying to save a childhood friend. A loner by nature, he does his best to keep his image as a cool guy intact; at one point resorting to cheating when in a losing duel against Eclair. Commanding the most loyalty, he prefers to run his party like a guild and only working directly together when a powerful monster appears believing each member is only responsible for themselves. While the most willing of the Heroes to hear out Naofumi's claims and advice, his condescending nature towards those at lower levels than himself still leads to tension between the two. To the amusement of his fellow heroes, he has a fear of water and is unable to swim.\n:After his entire party is killed by the Spirit Tortoise, he falls into a state of denial and grief. Despite Naofumi's initial attempts to help him, he instead turns to Malty for emotional support and is soon robbed of his belongings. Donning a disguise, he resorts to stealing to get by and becomes the leader of a group of bandits; unlocking the cursed Swords of Greed and Gluttony in the process. \n:In his cursed state, he is re-challenged by Eclair and is easily defeated. Finally willing to accept responsibility for his past mistakes and unable to gain experience or money as a result of using his cursed weapons, he chooses to stay in Naofumi's village and become Eclair's student. He now believes the next step to becoming stronger is to focus on his swordsmanship skills.\n\n;{{nihongo|Itsuki Kawasumi|\u5ddd\u6f84 \u6a39|Kawasumi Itsuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yoshitaka Yamaya]]<ref name=\"Characters\"/>|[[Erik Scott Kimerer]]<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}\n: The Hero of the Bow. Itsuki was a high school student before he was summoned, having been killed after a large truck took a sudden left turn. Calling himself an ally of Justice, he holds a superiority complex and has an innate need for attention, often bragging about his exploits to others. He chooses to run his party in a vigilante-like fashion, primarily taking on missions that involve corrupt officials and assisting others at the most opportune moments. He runs his party within a strict hierarchy of seniority, treating new party members as servants. Due to his self-indulgent attitude and treatment of his party members, Naofumi dislikes him the most of his fellow Heroes. Itsuki's feud with Naofumi comes to a head after he frames Rishia for a crime as a thinly veiled excuse to kick her out of his party; viewing her as weak, a burden, and for upstaging him during the Wave in Cal Mira.\n:His remaining party later betrays him during the battle with the Spirit Tortoise by tying him up and leaving him for dead. In a state of denial, he is soon tricked by Malty into fighting on her behalf in tournaments in Zeltoble; believing he was raising money to help her stop Naofumi from abusing his slaves and extorting citizens for money. Unlocking the cursed Bow of Pride, he fights against Rishia and is defeated as Naofumi and Ren expose the truth. Left in debt by Malty and having lost his volition as a result of his cursed weapon, he begs Rishia for forgiveness and chooses to stay in Naofumi's village as he recovers.\n: Coming from a world where humans have recently developed psychic powers, Itsuki was born with the precision ability called 'Accuracy.' Initally over-confident at a young age, as he grew older and learned that his ability was classified as low-ranking, he turned to games as an escape. Itsuki comes to believe that Naofumi might also have psychic powers due to his ability to inability to be intoxicated & how animals take a natural liking to him.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kizuna Kazeyama|\u98a8\u5c71 \u7d46|Kazeyama Kitzuna}}\n:The Hunting Hero.

Unlike the other Heroes called upon to fight the Waves, she was summoned prior to their appearance and was tasked with defeating a corrupt Dragon Emperor. A strong-willed woman, she has an easy time making friends and enjoys traveling the world. An avid fisherman, her party members sometimes have to restrain her to help keep her focus on tasks at hand. Despite her looks, she is eighteen years old and takes pride in being an otaku. She lives in a home she built herself alongside Glass; later inspiring Naofumi to found his own village. \n:After her party defeated the Demon Dragon, she found herself in a hostile country and was cast into a magic labyrinth. By the time she meets Naofumi and Rishia, having been cast themselves into the labyrinth by Kyo, several years had passed. With Naofumi's assistance, they are able to escape and work together to find their displaced party members. Initially unaware of the threat of the Waves, she orders her party to stop cease their attacks on Naofumi's world.

The daughter of a lesser noble family, she was originally kidnapped by a corrupt nobleman and was saved by Itsuki. Having fallen in love with him and admiring his sense of justice, Rishia joined Itsuki's party. Itsuki, however, seeing her as a burden, tries to drive her away by treating her as more of a servant than a teammate. After inadvertently upstaging him during the Cal Mira Wave, Itsuki resorts to framing her for breaking an important item and kicks her out. Left emotionally frail, Rishia attempts to commit suicide but is rescued by Naofumi and Filo. Sensing a kindred spirit in her and wanting to prove Itsuki wrong, Naofumi takes her into his party, hoping to train her into a capable fighter.\n:Upon meeting the Hengen Muso Master, she is selected to be her apprentice and undergoes heavy training to be able to utilize chi. Later, when Itsuki is corrupted by his cursed weapon, she challenges him to duel with the intent of teaching him the difference between justice and self-righteousness. For her courage, the Legendary Bow chooses her to wield the Seven Star Projectile (Knives/Boomerangs/Throwing Stars); with it's true power being released upon it's liberation from Takt. Defeating him, she re-joins Itsuki's party and works to help him recover from his curse.\n:A shy young girl with poor stamina, Rishia has lack of confidence in herself but learns to open up after joining Naofumi's party. Despite being at a high level, her stats are notably weak and have poor growths. It is only in times of crisis does her hidden power shine through, allowing her to take on powerful opponents such as Kyo single handed. She also displays a remarkable learning ability and is a budding scholar; leading Naofumi to believe that there are hidden stats she specializes in. \n\n;{{nihongo|Aultcray Melromarc XXXII|\u30aa\u30eb\u30c8\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\uff1d\u30e1\u30eb\u30ed\u30de\u30eb\u30af|Orutokurai Meromaruku XXXII}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yutaka Nakano]]<ref name=\"More cast\"/>|[[Jamieson K.

After his parents are killed by the Hakuko of Siltvelt and losing his right to the throne as a result, he and his blind younger sister changed their names and moved Melromarc. Shortly after, he joined Melromarc's army and rose through the ranks, becoming the Staff Hero, winning an on-going war with Siltvelt, and marrying Mirellia. His hatred of demi-humans is intensified after his sister is murdered by the Hakuko (not realizing she was in love with Siltvelt's Hakuko Prince), and leading him to follow the Church of the Three Heroes.\n:Taking charge of the Melromarc while his wife is away on diplomatic business, Aultcray turned a blind eye to Melromarc's knights when they enslaved Raphtalia's village, and at the behest of the Church, has all four of the Legendary Heroes summoned. Initially tolerant of Naofumi being the Shield Hero, he stages a kangaroo court after his daughter Malty accuses Naofumi of rape and puts in place obstacles to make his life more difficult. Having broken several treaties and degrading the status of the Shield Hero, he is placed under arrest by his wife in an attempt to prevent war from breaking out. He is stripped of his nobility and, in lieu of Naofumi's push for the death penalty, has his named legally changed to: \"Trash.\"\n: Still firm in his beliefs that the Shield Hero will bring nothing but ruin to Melromarc, Aultcray initally remained defiant of Mirellia's attempts to make ammends with Naofumi. Falling into a deep depression upon the deaths of both his wife & his niece Atla, Aultcray is convinced to by Naofumi to live up to Mirellia's final request, both reassuming his role as protector of Melromarc as the Staff Hero; choosing to remain being called \"Trash\" in recognition of his past mistakes.\n\n; {{nihongo|Fohl|\u30d5\u30a9\u30a6\u30eb|Fouru}}\n:The Seven Star Gauntlet Hero and a White Tiger Demi-human.

Grateful to Naofumi for curing his sister's disease, Fohl vows to pull his fair share of work to pay him back by fighting in the Waves.\n:A member of the Hakuko, a rare and powerful species of Demi-humans, Fohl is both proud, stubborn, and a natural martial artist. Deeply overprotective of his younger sister, he often clashes with Atla's adamant personality and leaving him on the receiving end of her attacks; causing Naofumi to wonder who is stronger between two. Despite being half Demi-human, he obtains the ability transform into a Therianthrope and later, with Naofumi's help, gains the ability to use the even stronger: Beast Transformation. Vowing to continue fighting to honor his late sister's final wishes, Fohl is chosen to wield the Seven Star Gauntlet. \n\n;{{nihongo|Glass|\u30b0\u30e9\u30b9|Gurasu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Megumi Han]]|Morgan Berry<ref name=\"Dub\"/>}}\n:The Vassal Fan Hero.

After Kizuna's disappearance, as an act of desperation, Glass and Kizuna's remaining allies decide to invade Naofumi's world upon learning their world may be spared from the Waves should the opposing world's Legendary Heroes perish.\n:Glass first appears before the Legendary Heroes during the third Wave and challenges Naofumi to a duel, recognizing him as the only true hero among them. Overwhelmed by her power, Naofumi's party narrowly survives. She appears again before Naofumi during the Cal Mira Wave to aid her allies in killing him, but are forced to retreat after Naofumi discovers her weakness. Ordered by her weapon to kill Kyo after he goes rogue, she forms an alliance with Naofumi to defeat him; eventually reuniting with Kizuna in the process. Initially looking down upon Naofumi, she comes to respect him and is grateful for his help in rescuing Kizuna. As a sign of friendship, Naofumi leaves her with a recipe for Soul-Healing Water, to help her cover her weakness in future battles.\n:A member of a race known as Spirit People, at any given time her level and stats are tied directly to her Soul Power. As such, Glass is vulnerable to attacks that can drain this stat. Using her fans, she fights using a graceful form of martial arts. At the peak of her power, she is able to hold her own in battle against the Legendary Heroes and defeat boss monsters in a single blow. \n\n;{{nihongo|L'Arc Berg|\u30e9\u30eb\u30af\u30d9\u30eb\u30af|Rarukuberuku}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Jun Fukuyama]]|Alejandro Saab}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KaggyFilms/status/1143913926498902018?s=20|title=Well kiddos, I have the awesome honor to voice in @ShieldHeroEN as L'arc Berg!

Using \"Myne Sophia\" as her adventurer name, Malty was the first and only person to join Naofumi in the beginning, but shortly after, she stole his money and equipment, and then claimed he raped her. She joins Motoyasu's party, believing his good looks will be able to help her standing within Melromarc's nobility. While in Motoyasu's party she acts as his second-in-command, taking advantage of his gullibility and manipulating him into doing her dirty work or making Naofumi's life more miserable. Despite Motoyasu's kindness, she insults him behind his back and sells her fellow party members into sexual slavery should they get in her way.\n:After the defeat of the Church of the Three Heroes, whose members she worked with in an attempt to assassinate her sister Melty and frame Naofumi, Malty's true nature is exposed by her mother. Disowned from the royal family, Malty is placed under a special slave curse and is forced to reveal the rest of her crimes. In lieu of Naofumi's push for the death penalty, her name is legally changed to \"Bitch.\" She stays in Motoyasu's party so she can repay her debts; Motoyasu still believing her lies.

Traveling to Faubery, she briefly joins Takt's harem of women and works with him to steal the Legendary Weapons & killing her family inexchange for removing her slave curse.\n:Specializing in fire magic, Malty is sadistic, power hungry, and manipulative. She uses her looks and status to control others, often appealing to their egos or taking advantage of their naivety. Believing her unfit to rule, prior to the start of the series, Mirellia placed her second-in-line to the throne after her younger sister. \n\n; Church of the Three Heroes\n:The primary religion of Melromarc who view the Shield Hero as a demon. Originally a part of the Church of the Four Heroes, which worshiped the Legendary Heroes equally, the Church broke off due to racial resentment when a former Shield Hero assisted in the founding of Demi-Human nations such as Siltvelt. Helping found Melromarc in opposition, the Church holds sway among Melromarc's citizens and guards the country's Dragon Vein Hourglass; a tool used to Class Up, predict the Waves, and can be used as warp points by Legendary Heroes.\n:After Queen Mirellia, who doesn't subscribe to their beliefs, left on a diplomatic tour of the world, the Church used sway with King Aultcray to prematurely summon the Legendary Heroes; hoping to manipulate Motoyasu, Ren, and Itsuki to gain more power while making Naofumi's life more difficult. Yet despite their efforts, Naofumi's heroics and the general incompetence of the remaining Three Heroes causes them to start losing influence among the populace. Taking drastic measures, they attempt to frame Naofumi for assassinating, later kidnapping, Princess Melty. Coming to the conclusion that Motoyasu, Ren, and Itsuki are fake Heroes and proclaiming himself to be a God, the High Priest (\"Bicas T. Balmus\" in the anime) leads his followers in an attempt to eliminate all four of the Legendary Heroes. With assistance from a returning Mirellia, Naofumi kills the High Priest with the Shield of Wrath as his followers are arrested.

Mirellia later issues orders for Malty's arrest after she abandons Motoyasu during the battle with the Spirit Tortoise. \n: Joining the Heroes in their investigation of the aftermath of the Guardian Beast Phoenix battle, Mirellia is killed in an ambush set up by Takt & Malty. Using the last of her strength, she asks her husband to put aside his differences with Naofumi and reclaim his role as the Staff Hero.\n\n===Other Characters===\n;{{nihongo|Fitoria|\u30d5\u30a3\u30c8\u30ea\u30a2}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Sakura Tange]]|[[Cristina Vee]]}}<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1123667453240803328|user=CristinaVee| title=I\u2019m Fitoria in the Rising of the Shield Hero!

Several hundred years old, Fitoria is the last surviving party member of the previous generation of the Legendary Heroes. Before their passing, the previous Legendary Heroes tasked her with protecting the world from the Waves upon their return. Acting in secret, Fitoria and her army fight the waves that affect areas left unprotected by the current Legendary Heroes.\n: She first appears before Naofumi's party and offers a safe haven while they're on the run from the Church of the Three Heroes. Threatening to kill him and the other Legendary Heroes to continue the summoning cycle, Fitoria orders Naofumi to work with his fellow Legendary Heroes. Upon Naofumi's refusal, she takes Melty as a hostage and challenges Filo to a duel. Recognizing her potential, she chooses Filo as a potential successor and to trust in Naofumi, gifting Filo with some of her power. Using Filo as a medium, she is able to contact Naofumi with telepathy and assists his party in the battle against the Kyo controlled Spirit Tortoise.\n: A stern figure, Fitoria has come to hold a pessimistic view of humanity. Immensely powerful and taking her duties seriously, she's willing to resort to any measure to protect the world even if it means forcibly continuing the Legendary Hero cycle or allowing the Guardian Beasts to rampage. Like Filo, she can take on the appearance of a young girl.\n\n;{{nihongo|Therese Alexanderite|\u30c6\u30ea\u30b9\uff1d\u30a2\u30ec\u30ad\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8|Terisu Arekisandoraito}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Saori Hayami]]|[[Erika Harlacher]]}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ErikaHarlacher/status/1143934631592386560?s=20|title=Apparently an episode I'm in came out soooo I play Therese in Rising of the Shield Hero!

Traveling together with L'Arc to defeat the Legendary Heroes and save their parallel world, she meets Naofumi's party on their way to the Cal Mira islands to train. She unwittingly befriends Naofumi, believing him to be a good person unlike the circulating rumors about the Shield Hero being a criminal. She regretfully joins L'Arc & Glass in their fight against Naofumi's party during the Cal Mira wave. Along with the rest of her party members, she joins Naofumi in the fight against Kyo.\n: A member of a race known as Jewels, Therese was born with a large gemstone on her head. Her heritage allows to her communicate with special gemstones and receive power from them: being able to cast offensive magic that doesn't harm allies. Generally a reserved individual, she comes to obsess over Naofumi's crafting abilities and enjoys watching him at work; making L'arc jealous.
