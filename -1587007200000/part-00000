She met a young economist, Juan Carlos G\u00f3mez Sabaini, and married him in secret in 1959; the couple had two children. As a student in the [[National University Art Institute]], she first exhibited her work in a 1959 show at the Teatro Ag\u00f3n. A scholarship from the [[w:es:Fondo nacional de las Artes|National Arts Foundation]] allowed her to travel to [[Paris]] as one of the young Argentine artists featured in ''[[Pablo Curatella Manes]] and Thirty Argentines of the New Generation'', a 1960 exhibit organized by the prominent sculptor and [[Paris Biennale]] judge.<ref name=clarin>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/07/06/conexiones/t-1008529.htm ''Clar\u00edn'': 'Super\u00e9 todos mis problemas, como Maradona' (7/6/2005) {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\nWhile in Paris, Minuj\u00edn was inspired by the experimental work of the Nouveaux Realistes, and especially their transformation of art into life.

This 1963 creation would be one of her first \"[[Happening]]s\"{{spaced ndash}}events as works of arts in themselves; among her hosts during her stay was Finance Minister [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] (later President of [[France]]).<ref name=pagina12>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/las12/13-639-2003-05-25.html ''P\u00e1gina/12'': Pop-ular (5/25/2003) {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\nShe earned a National Award in 1964 at Buenos Aires' [[Torcuato di Tella Institute]], where she prepared two happenings: ''Er\u00f3ticos en technicolor'' and the interactive ''Revu\u00e9lquese y viva'' (''Roll Around in Bed and Live''). Her ''Cabalgata'' (''Cavalcade'') aired on [[Canal 7 Argentina|Public Television]] that year, and involved horses with paint buckets tied to their tails. These displays took her to nearby [[Montevideo]], where she organized ''Sucesos'' (''Events'') at the [[Uruguay]]an capital's [[Estadio Luis Tr\u00f3ccoli|Tr\u00f3ccoli Stadium]] with 500 chickens, artists of contrasting physical shape, motorcycles, and other elements.<ref name=clarin/>\n\nShe joined [[Rub\u00e9n Santanton\u00edn]] at the di Tella Institute in 1965 to create ''[[La Menesunda]]'' (''Mayhem''), where participants were asked to go through sixteen chambers, each separated by a human-shaped entry. Led by [[neon]] lights, groups of eight visitors would encounter rooms with television sets at full blast, couples making love in bed, a cosmetics counter (complete with an attendant), a dental office from which dialing an oversized rotary phone was required to leave, a walk-in freezer with dangling fabrics (suggesting sides of beef), and a mirrored room with [[black light]]ing, falling confetti, and the scent of frying food. The use of advertising throughout suggested the influence of [[pop art]] in Minuj\u00edn's \"mayhem.\"<ref name=clarin/>\n\nThese works earned her a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1966, by which she relocated to [[New York City]]. The ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' by General [[Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda]] in June of that year made her fellowship all the more fortuitous, as the new regime would frequently censor and ban irreverent displays such as hers. Minuj\u00edn delved into [[psychedelic art]] in New York, of which among her best-known creations was that of the \"Minuphone,\" where patrons could enter a telephone booth, dial a number, and be surprised by colors projecting from the glass panels, sounds, and seeing themselves on a television screen in the floor.<ref name=\"time\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899583,00.html ''Time'' (July 7, 1967).

Assembling 30,000 [[censorship|books banned]] between 1976 and 1983 (including works as diverse as those by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Ra\u00fal Scalabrini Ortiz]], and [[Darcy Ribeiro]], as well as satires such as ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'', reference volumes such as ''[[Enciclopedia Salvat]]'', and even children's texts, notably ''[[The Little Prince]]'' by [[Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry]]), she designed the \"Parthenon of Books [Homage to Democracy].\"  Following President [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]]'s December 10 inaugural, Minuj\u00edn had this temple-like structure mounted on a boulevard median along the [[Nueve de Julio Avenue|Ninth of July Avenue]]. Dismantled after three weeks, its mass of newly unbanned titles was distributed to the public below and given back to their owners, symbolically putting the tools for rebuilding a free society back in the hands of the people.<ref name=pagina12/><ref>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=986759 ''La Naci\u00f3n'': Pol\u00edtica y concepto {{in lang|es}}]</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nA conversation with Warhol in New York regarding the [[Latin American debt crisis]] inspired one of her most publicized \"happenings:\" ''The Debt''. Purchasing a shipment of [[maize]], Minuj\u00edn dramatized the Argentine cost of servicing the foreign debt with a 1985 photo series in which she symbolically handed the maize to Warhol \"in payment\" for the debt; she never again saw Warhol, who died in 1987.<ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/imprimir/diario/suplementos/radar/9-2323-2005-06-20.html ''P\u00e1gina/12'': Andy y yo (6/19/2005) {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Minuj\u00edn went on to make a second ''Partheon of Banned Books'' in Kassel, Germany. Arranging 100,000 banned books into a replica of the Partheon in Athens, Minuj\u00edn honors those books that were censored and subsequently burned by the Nazis in the 1930s and 1940s.

Minuj\u00edn delved into [[psychedelic art]] in New York, of which among her best-known creations was that of the \"Minuphone,\" where patrons could enter a telephone booth, dial a number, and be surprised by colors projecting from the glass panels, sounds, and seeing themselves on a television screen in the floor.<ref name=\"time\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899583,00.html ''Time'' (July 7, 1967).

The latter, a [[sheet metal]] creation, was stuffed with cotton and lit, creating a metaphor for the legendary crooner's untimely 1935 death in a Medell\u00edn plane crash.<ref name=pagina12/> She was awarded the first of a series of [[Konex Award]]s, the highest in the Argentine cultural realm, in 1982.<ref name=konex>[http://www.fundacionkonex.com.ar/premios/curriculum.asp?id=741 Fundaci\u00f3n Konex: Marta Minuj\u00edn {{in lang|es}}]</ref> She also created a conceptual proposal for Manhattan based on a prone replica of the [[Statue of Liberty]] re-imagined as a public park.<ref name=radicalwomen>{{cite book |last=Fajardo-Hill |first=Cecilia | last2=Giunta | first2=Andrea |author2-link=Andrea Giunta |date=2017 |title=Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960-1985 |publisher= Prestel |isbn=9783791356808}}</ref> \n\nMinuj\u00edn returned to Buenos Aires in 1983, and the [[Argentine general election, 1983|return of democracy]] the same year, following seven years of a generally failed dictatorship, prompted her to create a monument to a glaring, inanimate victim of the regime: [[freedom of expression]]. Assembling 30,000 [[censorship|books banned]] between 1976 and 1983 (including works as diverse as those by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]], [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Ra\u00fal Scalabrini Ortiz]], and [[Darcy Ribeiro]], as well as satires such as ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'', reference volumes such as ''[[Enciclopedia Salvat]]'', and even children's texts, notably ''[[The Little Prince]]'' by [[Antoine de Saint Exup\u00e9ry]]), she designed the \"Parthenon of Books [Homage to Democracy].\"  Following President [[Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn]]'s December 10 inaugural, Minuj\u00edn had this temple-like structure mounted on a boulevard median along the [[Nueve de Julio Avenue|Ninth of July Avenue]]. Dismantled after three weeks, its mass of newly unbanned titles was distributed to the public below and given back to their owners, symbolically putting the tools for rebuilding a free society back in the hands of the people.<ref name=pagina12/><ref>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=986759 ''La Naci\u00f3n'': Pol\u00edtica y concepto {{in lang|es}}]</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nA conversation with Warhol in New York regarding the [[Latin American debt crisis]] inspired one of her most publicized \"happenings:\" ''The Debt''. Purchasing a shipment of [[maize]], Minuj\u00edn dramatized the Argentine cost of servicing the foreign debt with a 1985 photo series in which she symbolically handed the maize to Warhol \"in payment\" for the debt; she never again saw Warhol, who died in 1987.<ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/imprimir/diario/suplementos/radar/9-2323-2005-06-20.html ''P\u00e1gina/12'': Andy y yo (6/19/2005) {{in lang|es}}]</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Minuj\u00edn went on to make a second ''Partheon of Banned Books'' in Kassel, Germany. Arranging 100,000 banned books into a replica of the Partheon in Athens, Minuj\u00edn honors those books that were censored and subsequently burned by the Nazis in the 1930s and 1940s.

Such success was unprecedented for a \"kid from East Los Angeles\", albeit a very talented, hard-working, and cocky kid.

Russell was viewed as the typical crooner, in the Sinatra style, who extended and drew out the words, while adding delightful shades and nuances to the phrases in his songs. He was not considered a [[bolero]] singer in the classic sense (of Latin America singers), but his execution of romantic songs had some of the best and most sincere phrasing.<ref name=\"hernan\"/> Russell's 4 top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart in 1944 sold millions of records, and opened the door later in the decade for touring around the country and appearances on radio programs, motion pictures, and television.

He wound up making only five films. These movies were of the light-hearted, comedic, and musical-variety kind, where he had a fair amount of dialogue and singing duties to perform. Since they were being marketed not just for Mexico and Latino communities in the United States, but for all of Latin America and Spain, Russell was paired up with a diverse cast of Latin American movie stars, along with established and popular Mexican actors like [[Evangelina Elizondo]], who appeared with him in three of his motion pictures. In these Mexican productions, Russell's roles were spoken in Spanish and peppered with some English phrases; in contrast, the roles in his American movies were spoken only in English; however, he sang bilingually in both. Russell had to learn \"enough Spanish to star in film in Mexico and in Spain.

His character declares, of course, much love for Mexico, but he only manages to disrupt the typical tropical setting, where the women defend their honor against the attraction caused by their own sensuality ... Russell's character is not a threat to these heroines; one could say he only wishes to flirt with them in the style of a Hollywood B-grade musical-comedy. However, the response to frighten the 'pocho' from defiling the honor of a woman is wholly disproportionate, and he is dismissed with dishonor.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garc\u00eda Riera|first1=Emilio|title=Historia Documental del Cine Mexicano: Tomo 7, 1953-1954|date=1993|publisher=Universidad de Guadalajara|location=Mexico|pages=254\u201355}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe following year in 1956, Russell starred in three movies, the first being ''Mi canci\u00f3n eres t\u00fa'' (''You Are My Song''), directed again by Roberto Rodr\u00edguez and co-starring Mexican actress and singer Evangelina Elizondo. Filming began on April 1, 1955, in the Churubusco Studios, and the premiere was March 28, 1956, at Cinema Orfe\u00f3n, where it played for two weeks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garc\u00eda Riera|first1=Emilio|title=Historia Documental del Cine Mexicano: Tomo 8, 1955-1956|date=1993|publisher=Universidad de Guadalajara|location=Mexico|page=47}}</ref>\n\nGarc\u00eda Riera starts off his film review by noting that previously he, like many others, viewed Russell as the epitome of conceitedness and extremely stuck-up. In this Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez production, Russell represented a threat of hybridization. His character, called \"Danny\" more often than \"Daniel\", at 15-years-old beat it out of Mexico to go to the United States, and he returned with bilingual crooning abilities.  His family members called him \"bracero\" (farm laborer), so as to not call him \"pocho\", He has future possibilities of entering the \"gringo\" middle-class due to his success on television, singing in high-priced cabarets, and the sale of records ...<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garc\u00eda Riera|first1=Emilio|title=Historia Documental del Cine Mexicano: Tomo 8, 1955-1956|date=1993|publisher=Universidad de Guadalajara|location=Mexico|pages=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\nThe film has good pacing in the beginning, but it gets lost, dispersed, and ends up being a victim of its bewildering musical numbers, which include: Russell, Freddy Fern\u00e1ndez, and Gustavo Villacampa singing \"Perfida\" while shirtless in the bathroom; Russell wearing a straw hat and singing \"Muchachita\" (his big hit) to Irma Castill\u00f3n, as they both tap-dance in the Hollywood style; in an audition, Russell singing \"Qui\u00e9reme mucho\" in Spanish and English, while Antonio Raxel makes the comment that if Russell sings in English, would he want his salary to be paid in dollars instead of pesos; and Russell singing \"Amor, Amor, Amor\" in a disconcerting musical number, complete with a couple from prehistoric times, another from the 8th century, an Arab with his harem, and Cupid. It's shocking and absurd. But in its defense, one can say that Russell, from a distance, does not appear to be so stuck-up anymore.

He had already felt somewhat constrained when performing before Mexican audiences, as they often did not appreciate the changes or updates he would make to traditional songs. In general, [[Mexican people|Mexicans]], and Latin Americans, preferred that Russell sing in Spanish and respect the traditional forms of music. If he were performing before a Mexican audience, he could not use special material because they might mock him by saying, \"He's getting fancy.\"<ref name=\"training ground\"/>\n\nIt seemed that \"the gimmick (singing bilingually) that brought him fame in his native country was unwanted south of the U.S. border. He felt negative responses from audiences when he sang in English.<ref name=\"lamparski151\"/>\n\nYet, despite the resistance and conservative leanings of his Latin-American audiences, Russell could observe that by the early to mid-1960s, Mexican musicians and the public were opening up and becoming receptive to combining musical styles as he himself had already done in the 1940s and 1950s. He addressed this issue in a 1967 interview with ''Billboard'' magazine:\n\n{{quote|You can turn the radio on today in Mexico and hear American music played by Mexican boys and it's rock. Mexico is changing. Before, everything was Mexican music. Now there are other influences being heard ... Years ago, it was a crime for a performer to change the authentic musical forms. A bolero was a bolero. I drew a lot of criticism for jazzing up 'Perfidia'. Today, the young musicians are making rock versions of standards.  \n|author=Source:   \n|source=''Billboard''. December 16, 1967. page M-24}}\n\nThus, although Russell received some criticism for his bilingual ballads and mixing of American and Latin American musical rhythms, he can also be considered to have been a musical pioneer in Mexico, due to the fact that his versatility influenced the next generation of Mexican rockers to be receptive to and combine musical genres.\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:El Show del Andy Russell, Argentina.jpg|thumb|left|Publicity photo for ''El show de Andy Russell''.]]\nFrom 1956\u201365, Russell traveled back-and-forth from Mexico City to [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]], where he had a television variety show called ''El Show de Andy Russell'' on channel 7.

Andy Russell is more than a singer ... blessed with a voice, a personality, and a sense of showmanship, which, combined, attract the envy of less-gifted performers. He has spectacularly catapulted into the foremost ranks of entertainers since 1943 and accomplished Herculean results in furthering the friendship of the North American peoples with those of Central and South America to the south.\n\n\"Andy is a handsome, young American, born and reared in Los Angeles, with a deep insight into the music of Latin America and with a flair for singing songs in both English and Spanish that has won him the plaudits of millions.\n\n\"Andy's selections for this collection of 'favoritos' include Just Friends, Let's Fall in Love, I'll See You in My Dreams, Imagination, Mar\u00eda Elena, La Borrachita, Cielito Lindo, and the plaintive Adios, Muchachos. All eight selections are beloved the world over. 'They're my favorites, too,' Russell confesses.\n\n\"Capitol is privileged to present Andy Russell and this smart package of unforgettable music.

He also indicates that at the urging of bandleader [[Gus Arnheim]], Russell accepted to change his original name of \"Andr\u00e9s R\u00e1bago\" to the anglicized \"Andy Russell\". He seems to imply, then, that Russell simply gave up his name and cultural identity in exchange for musical and economic opportunities otherwise reserved for Anglo-American musicians. Furthermore, Avant-Mier contends, Russell acquiesced because, from an early age, he seemed to be more comfortable with his American rather than Mexican culture.\n\nHowever, Avant-Mier does not take into consideration (as explained earlier) the context of the place and period that Russell had been born and reared in the United States during the first half of the 20th century and its influence on one's self-identity. The country experienced two World Wars, a Great Depression, and a wave of nationalism and patriotism that fostered a common and united national identity, rather than ethnic pride. Yet, although Russell spoke and understood more English than Spanish, and was exposed more to American than Mexican culture during the initial stage of his career, however, in no way did this signify a rejection of his Mexican culture. It was solely a temporary accommodation, as Russell stated: \"Part of the reason I changed my name--as did many Jewish entertainers--was that I did not want to be stereotyped [as just a Latin singer]. But now I'm hard to sell in my own country--except to those who already know me.\"<ref name=\"lamparski151\"/>\n\nYet Avant-Mier rejects Russell's nuanced argument by concluding that \"Russell eventually attributed his phenomenal success to the fact that his light skin and European features allowed him to pass as Anglo- or European-American.\" (Avant-Mier, 59) To support his conclusion, Avant-Mier simply references all nine pages (142-150) of Loza's ''Barrio Rhythm: Mexican-American Music in Los Angeles'' without specifying exactly where Russell admits to \"selling out\", which Avant-Mier seems to imply.\n\nAvant-Mier overlooks Russell's talent, drive, and work ethic as essential components to his success. Plus, no credit is given to Russell for having the flexibility to manage his identity in order to capitalize on the few opportunities available for a Mexican-American in a racist society, while being faithful to aspects of both his Mexican and American identities. While some may call this \"selling out\", others might view it as \"[[when life gives you lemons, make lemonade]]\",\n\nAvant-Mier continues: \"The case of Andy Russell also reminds us of social structures that often required Latino/as to perform whiteness in order to have any chance of success in the mainstream music business.\" (Avant-Mier, 59) Deborah Pacini Hern\u00e1ndez states as much on page 10 of her book ''Oye Como Va!: Hybridity and Identity in Latino Popular Music'' when she makes the same casual argument: \"Latinos who could 'pass' as white could access the mainstream market, although only if they hid their ethnicity by changing their names, as did Andy Russell and Ritchie Valens, respectively born Andr\u00e9s R\u00e1bago P\u00e9rez and Ricardo Valenzuela.\" <ref>{{cite book|last1=Hern\u00e1ndez|first1=Deborah Pacini|title=Oye Como Va!: Hybridity and Identity in Latino Popular Music|date=2010|publisher=Temple University Press|location=U.S.A.|isbn=978-1-4399-0090-1|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zNcJkzg1OuQC&dq=besame+mucho+most+recorded+song&q=andy+russell#v=snippet&q=andy%20russell&f=false|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThus, neither seem to lend credence to Russell's claim that his Mexican-American ethnicity was clearly evidenced by his singing in Spanish and his continual affirmation of being of Mexican descent. Specifically, once he had a huge hit with \"[[B\u00e9same Mucho]]\", Russell's trademark was his bilingual singing ability, which would not only be a feature of many of his songs, but a reflection of his cultural upbringing. As Loza states: \"Because he was singing bilingually, Andy felt that the public would know his background by the Spanish songs in his repertoire\" <ref name=\"loza146\"/> and realize he was a Mexican who had simply adopted a stage name, as was the norm for many performers of all ethnicities in that era.\n\nRussell has also stated that he was always upfront about his Mexican heritage: \"You know, I would tell everybody, I'd say, 'I'm Mexican ... ' and they'd say, 'No, Andy, you must be Spanish.' I'd say, 'No, I'm Mexican ... ' and they'd say, 'No, Andy, but you're so light.' And I'd say, 'No, no, I'm Mexican. My father's Mexican. My mother's Mexican ... '\" <ref name=\"loza144\"/> Clearly, his ethnic identity was not up for negotiation.\n\nIn truth, there was not much the talented, hard-working Russell could do about his personal appearance, who just happened to be \"six feet tall, weighs 170 pounds, has hazel colored eyes, and black hair.\"<ref name=\"triple\">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=New Manpower on the Sing Shift: Andy Russell, Triple Threat on Radio, Records, and Personal Appearances |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA108&dq=andy+russell+singer&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BlsNVP3hGIWrogTp6oDICQ&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=andy%20russell%20singer&f=false |magazine=The Billboard 1944 Music Year Book |location=New York |date=1944 |accessdate=September 8, 2014}}</ref> Russell's distinct racial characteristics apparently were classified as being \"Anglo\", although they fall within the diversity of Mexican racial identity with its three main components being Spanish, Indian, and Negro ancestry (in varying degrees). In Russell's case, his preponderance of European stock was a reaffirmation, and an extension, of his Mexican identity. There was no need for him to \"perform whiteness\" or \"pass as white\", as it was already a part of his racial heritage and identity\u2014-but as a Mexican, not European-American.\n\nRussell's nationality was American, but, at the same time, he never denied his Mexican ethnicity. The name change was simply a means to an end. The explanation could be as simple as Arnheim did not like the sound, wanted something easier to pronounce, and chose \"Russell\" because it reminded him of [[Russ Columbo]] (a vocalist and violin player associated with Arnheim and his Orchestra who had already gained popularity before his untimely death). \"Russ Columbo\" was a stage name, as his birth name was \"Ruggiero Eugenio di Rodolpho Colombo\".\n\nAnother adherent who claimed that Russell's success was due to his \"whiteness\" was Lalo Guerrero, Mexican-American composer, singer, and musician. He stated that he might have had mainstream success, if he, too, were \"g\u00fcero\" (light-skinned), like Russell or [[Vikki Carr]].<ref name=\"loza162\">{{cite book|last=Loza|first=Steven |title=Barrio Rhythm: Mexican American Music in Los Angeles|url=https://archive.org/details/barriorhythmmexi0000loza|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/barriorhythmmexi0000loza/page/162 162]}}</ref> In addition, according to Guerrero, they were the only Mexican-Americans who were accepted and successful in Mexico.<ref name=\"loza162\"/> This simple, almost naive explanation belies Guerrero's own stature as a legendary musician of some renown, known as the \"Father of Chicano Music\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Horn|first1=David|editor1-last=Shepherd|editor1-first=John|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8: Genres: North America|date=2012|publisher=The Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1441160782|page=133|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HZQemZyozqwC&pg=PA133&dq=eduardo+%27lalo%27+guerrero+continuum+volume+8#v=onepage|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs stated previously, one must take note that there were also examples of other Mexican-Americans and Mexicans who were successful and who did not anglicize their names: actors [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]], [[Katy Jurado]], [[Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez]], etc. Other dark-complexioned recording artists who were known during the period were Mexican singer [[To\u00f1a la Negra]] and Cuban singers [[Celia Cruz]] and [[Benny Mor\u00e9]] and musician [[P\u00e9rez Prado]]. In addition, [[Germ\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s]], Tin Tan, a Mexican comic, actor, and singer who grew up in the border area of [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], [[Chihuahua City|Chihuahua]], south of [[El Paso, Texas]], was exposed to Mexican-American pachucos and cal\u00f3. He used this knowledge to create his comical version of a pachuco, using bilingual dialogue to hilarious effect and enormous popularity.\n\nSurely, Guerrero must have appreciated and understood the fact that, despite the shade of a Mexican's skin tone, starting and maintaining a successful career in the entertainment industry mainly took a lot of hard work, dedication, talent, networking, and luck.\n\nBut, the assessment of Avant-Mier that Russell's success was mainly due to the fact that he \"Anglicized\" his name and used his \"European\" features to bypass American society racist structure and perform \"whiteness\" is short-sighted. In contrast, for Russell, the \"name-change\" was not that important in the big picture, since he would always claim, sometimes emphatically so, that he was ethnically Mexican. Some newspaper articles, books, and liner notes support this statement (see section What's in a Name? II).\n\nAs such, this whole construct needs to be reframed:  Russell as a Mexican was involved in a give-and-take, push-and-pull dynamic where, at times, he was on the forefront singing bilingually and declaring his Mexican ethnicity; and, at other times, conforming to American society's stereotypical notions of Mexicans performers in order to have the opportunity to perform and earn a living.\n\nFurthermore, to describe Russell as performing \"whiteness\" brings up images of performing \"[[blackface]]\" which would be a misnomer, as this term is applied within the context of the racial discrimination exhibited by Anglo-Americans against African-Americans, so it seems out of place when referring to Mexicans or Mexican-Americans who not only have a distinct racial, ethnic, and cultural heritage, but a different history in the United States, as well.\n\nMoreover, Russell's ability to sing in Spanish would prove to be a double-edged sword: it gave him popularity and acceptance at the onset, but it also typecast him as a Latin singer, leaving him out of work when the popular wave of Latin music passed. But what bothered Russell the most was that his identity as an American singer could be called into question.\n\nThis same ability to sing in Spanish, however, then opened up a whole new market for him in Mexico, Latin America and Europe, where his brand of music was not only accepted but celebrated. Unfortunately, here, Russell was subject to the Mexican brand of discrimination which tended to label him a \"pocho\". (see \"Mexican Films\" section above)\n\nOne must question if Guerrero's assertion regarding skin color and success in the music industry (and validation of this by later Latino scholars) is correct and universal: that light-skin and European features allowed for upward mobility, while tan or dark-skinned performers were penalized. One cannot deny the preponderance of light-skinned musical stars, but the dark-complexioned stars were also present in United States (and Mexico).\n\nMost important, the expression of Chicano artistic and musical creations were finding an outlet within and outside of the mainstream, for reasons that go beyond just skin color and discrimination. In Russell's case, he was gifted with an incredible voice, had a flair for showmanship, along with charisma and good looks.\n\nOn a personal level, just like in the United States, his need to sing and perform were validated in Mexico and Latin America; moreover, he must have surely felt more ethnically Mexican than ever before, when in 1956, he married the daughter of a Mexican diplomat, who gave birth to his only son ...\n\nBut after 11 years of living and performing in Mexico and Latin America, Russell once again felt the blade of the double-edged sword when he said he \"felt that he was losing his professional identity and also being subtly pressured into becoming a citizen of Mexico,\" <ref name=\"lamparski151\"/> which precipitated his return to the United States in the mid-1960s, and, again, having to resort to a temporary accommodation in terms of his Mexican-American identity. The pendulum now swung the other way, as he sang mainly in English and married a blue-eyed, blond former Mrs. Houston.\n\nIn conclusion, questions regarding Russell's identity, appearance, acceptance, success, and influence over a career spanning 50 years and several continents is much more complex and layered than what Avant-Mier, Pacini Hernandez, and Guerrero have presented.\n\n===What's in a name? II===\nRussell had been emphatic about his Mexican ethnicity, over the course of his career from 1942 to 1989, which spanned almost 50 years.  Notwithstanding, his racial ethnicity was described using different terms in newspapers, magazines, and on albums.\n\nOn the inside flap of his debut album \"Favoritos\" (1943), Capitol described him as: \"a handsome young '''American''', born and reared in Los Angeles{{nbsp}}...\"\n\nIn a 1944 newspaper article, he was called: a \"talented, 23-year-old '''Mexican'''\".<ref name=\"coatikook\">{{cite news|last1=Lilley|first1=George|title=Little Things about the Stars|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=407&dat=19440901&id=DcsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4144,1218087|accessdate=18 September 2014|agency=The Coatikook Observer|date=September 1, 1944}}</ref>\n\nIn another newspaper article from 1944, he was described as: \"...{{nbsp}}a fellow of '''Spanish extraction'''{{nbsp}}...\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gaver|first1=Jack|title=Now if he's as Funny as he is Fat--|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19440819&id=OisaAAAAIBAJ&pg=4330,1189228|accessdate=19 September 2014|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=August 19, 1944}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1945 article, he was described as a '''Los Angeles-born Mexican lad'.''<ref name=\"doings\">{{cite news|title=Close-Ups of Movie Doings|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19450519&id=gHNWAAAAIBAJ&pg=4085,4430914&hl=en|accessdate=25 March 2015|agency=The Spokesman Review|date=19 May 1945}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1946 article, he was called: \"an '''American Spaniard'''\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Winchell|first1=Walter|title=Notes of an Innocent Bystander|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&dat=19460305&id=YGEoAAAAIBAJ&pg=5357,1142832|accessdate=18 September 2014|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|date=March 5, 1946}}</ref>\n\nOn the back cover of his album \"The Magic of Andy Russell\" (1958), RCA described his singing style, \"...{{nbsp}}which stems from his '''Mexican-American''' upbringing{{nbsp}}...\"\n\nAmong many names, he has also been labeled as: \"Hispano\", \"Latin\",<ref>{{cite news|title=This and That|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19450906&id=9vAZAAAAIBAJ&pg=1329,1996750|accessdate=12 March 2015|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=September 6, 1945}}</ref> \"Spanish-Mexican\", \"of Mexican parentage\", \"Mexican of Spanish descent\", \"a Californian of Mexican descent\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Andy Russell is at Top of World|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1870&dat=19721008&id=OE8fAAAAIBAJ&pg=4673,2344017|accessdate=9 October 2014|agency=Dayton Beach Sunday News|date=8 Oct 1972}}</ref> \"Mexican-Spanish\",<ref>{{cite news|last1=Richards|first1=Ramona|title=Interview Provides Thrill - School Girl Quizzes Crooner|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19480910&id=2zsuAAAAIBAJ&pg=5934,3424629|accessdate=12 March 2015|newspaper=The Miami News|date=September 10, 1948}}</ref> \"mexicano-norteamericano\",<ref>{{cite news|title=El mundo del artista|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1706&dat=19750813&id=fGc0AAAAIBAJ&pg=937,486907|newspaper=El Tiempo|date=August 13, 1975}}</ref> \"norteamericano\" and \"Chicano\".<ref name=\"seattle\"/>\n\n===The prodigal son returns ... ?===\n[[File:Andy Russell - \"More Amor\" Album (Front).JPG|thumb|Andy Russell, \"More Amor!\" LP, Capitol Records, 1967]]  \n[[File:Andy Russell - More Amor Album Cover (Back) - Capitol Records (1967).JPG|thumb|Andy Russell, \"More Amor!\" LP (back cover), Capitol Records, 1967]]\nAfter releasing the Capitol singles \"Longin'\" and \"Enamorado\" in 1966 (neither charted), Russell's comeback album in the United States was \"More Amor!\" (Capitol Records, 1967). On the back cover, there is a certain awkwardness and palpable confusion in the explanation about why Russell had left the United States for Mexico, and why he had returned.\n\nRussell apparently divorced his third wife, Velia S\u00e1nchez Belmont, sometime in the early 1960s (a September 7, 1963, newspaper article states that his new romance was the Countess Joaquina de Navas of [[Madrid]]).<ref name=\"countess\">{{cite news|last1=Winchell|first1=Walter|title=Winchell Back with Celebs|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19630907&id=DzYsAAAAIBAJ&pg=3399,900916|accessdate=September 20, 2014|publisher=Herald-Journal|date=September 7, 1963}}</ref> His television show in Argentina ended in 1964. His waning popularity was also evidenced by the popularity of a new wave of younger singers in Mexico, such as [[C\u00e9sar Costa]], [[Enrique Guzm\u00e1n]], and Alberto V\u00e1squez, who in many ways, were his musical heirs. They took up the mantle that he had initially carried into Mexico, and these young singers performed Spanish covers of [[American popular music#1960s rock|American]] and [[British Invasion]] hit songs of the 1960s to an enthusiastic, young female fan base, as Russell had once done as a crooner in the 1940s. Furthermore, and most tellingly, these younger singers were Mexican nationals, unlike Russell who was an American of Mexican ancestry.\n\nRussell probably saw the writing on the wall. He had now become pass\u00e9. All these reasons most likely played a factor in Russell looking toward the United States for a fresh start.\n\nIn any case, this time around, the visions of grandeur turned out to be a mirage, as none of the songs on \"More Amor!\" charted on Billboard.  The album followed the same Russell formula: a nice balance of songs, some in English and some in his \"bilingual style\", which had proven so successful in the decade of the 1940s and in Latin America.\n\nNeedless to say, regardless of what was written on the back cover and his situation in Mexico, Russell did not have the same success in 1967 in the United States as he had had in 1944 for a plethora of reasons, many dealing with issues ''other'' than identity\u2014he was older, musical tastes had changed, he had been effectively gone for 11 years, the milieu was certainly different, as the country was caught up in the social and political turmoil of the 1960s, etc. Yet, the notes on the back cover are a fascinating testament to where Russell believed he was in terms of his public persona in 1967, after having been out of the country for 11 years.\n\nNotwithstanding, Russell continued working. His comeback appearance at the Chauteau Madrid nightclub in New York was a phenomenal success.  He also performed in Las Vegas, at other nightclubs, and was a frequent guest on television programs. Plus, he continued to make periodic trips to perform in Mexico and Latin America. Apparently, he continued being a captivating and charismatic performer during his live appearances.\n\nThat same year another album followed: \"...{{nbsp}}Such a Pretty World Today\" (Capitol, 1967), this time with all songs sung in English, except for \"Lady\", the last chorus of which he sings in his \"flawless Spanish\". This was followed by a single, \"I'm Not Through Missing You\". (Capitol 45 rpm, 1967). This approach seemed to work better as both songs charted in the top ten of Billboard's Easy Listening Chart.\n\nAt this point, it may seem that Russell was nudging towards being the American singer who sang in English, while not totally abandoning the Latin singer persona, in order to gain a modicum of success in the American recording industry. Less was being said about his name change at this point, as many people already knew that he was the Latin or Mexican singer with the American-sounding name.\n\nRussell considered his nationality to be, first and foremost, American but ethnically he was Mexican-American. He corrected people who said he was Spanish based on his appearance (tall, light-skinned, and hazel eyes) by stating that he was Mexican.\n\nHe found the term Mexican-American to be acceptable, but he had a difficult time accepting the term \"[[Chicano]]\".\n\nHe stated: \"My parents were born in Mexico, but I hate the word 'Chicano'. I am an American.\"<ref name=\"lamparski151\"/>\n\nIn a later interview, he elaborated on the subject:\n\n{{quote|I hated the word 'Chicano' at that time, 'cause at that time it was that, 'He's nothing but a Chicano, you know?' That was a terrible word at that time. Yeah, 'Pachuco' or 'Chicano', you know? That's a horrible word. I says, 'I'm not Chicano. I'm Mexican American. First I'm Mexican because my mother and dad are Mexican and I'm Mexican, and I'm American 'cause I was born here. I'm a Mexican American, I'm not a Chicano, you know? I just didn't like that word. It stuck with me. I don't like it even today. I'm sorry, I don't like it ... Just don't like the sound.  \n|author=Source   \n|source=Loza, Steven. (1993) ''Barrio Rhythm:  Mexican American Music in Los Angeles''. University of Illinois Press, page 147}}\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the term \"Chicano\" was an insulting, disparaging term used by upper class Mexicans who lived in the United States to refer to indigent Mexican immigrants who had just crossed the border. Thus, Russell is not using the term as it was reclaimed and redefined as a source of pride and political power in the 1960s, although he does agree with the principal. In spite of this, Russell meant no offense or disrespect to those people who embraced the term Chicano; he just stated that it was not for him.\n\nSteven Loza, director of Ethnic Musicology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of ''Barrio Rhythm:  Mexican-American Music in Los Angeles'' may have had a different take than Russell on the term \"Chicano\" when he stated: \"Chicano music is Andrew Russell ...

Such success was unprecedented for a \"kid from East Los Angeles\", albeit a very talented, hard-working, and cocky kid. He was a part of the era when popular singers, or [[crooner]]s, were beginning to take the spotlight away from the bands.

Russell was viewed as the typical crooner, in the Sinatra style, who extended and drew out the words, while adding delightful shades and nuances to the phrases in his songs. He was not considered a [[bolero]] singer in the classic sense (of Latin America singers), but his execution of romantic songs had some of the best and most sincere phrasing.<ref name=\"hernan\"/> Russell's 4 top-ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart in 1944 sold millions of records, and opened the door later in the decade for touring around the country and appearances on radio programs, motion pictures, and television.

He wound up making only five films. These movies were of the light-hearted, comedic, and musical-variety kind, where he had a fair amount of dialogue and singing duties to perform. Since they were being marketed not just for Mexico and Latino communities in the United States, but for all of Latin America and Spain, Russell was paired up with a diverse cast of Latin American movie stars, along with established and popular Mexican actors like [[Evangelina Elizondo]], who appeared with him in three of his motion pictures. In these Mexican productions, Russell's roles were spoken in Spanish and peppered with some English phrases; in contrast, the roles in his American movies were spoken only in English; however, he sang bilingually in both. Russell had to learn \"enough Spanish to star in film in Mexico and in Spain.

His character declares, of course, much love for Mexico, but he only manages to disrupt the typical tropical setting, where the women defend their honor against the attraction caused by their own sensuality ... Russell's character is not a threat to these heroines; one could say he only wishes to flirt with them in the style of a Hollywood B-grade musical-comedy. However, the response to frighten the 'pocho' from defiling the honor of a woman is wholly disproportionate, and he is dismissed with dishonor.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garc\u00eda Riera|first1=Emilio|title=Historia Documental del Cine Mexicano: Tomo 7, 1953-1954|date=1993|publisher=Universidad de Guadalajara|location=Mexico|pages=254\u201355}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe following year in 1956, Russell starred in three movies, the first being ''Mi canci\u00f3n eres t\u00fa'' (''You Are My Song''), directed again by Roberto Rodr\u00edguez and co-starring Mexican actress and singer Evangelina Elizondo. Filming began on April 1, 1955, in the Churubusco Studios, and the premiere was March 28, 1956, at Cinema Orfe\u00f3n, where it played for two weeks.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garc\u00eda Riera|first1=Emilio|title=Historia Documental del Cine Mexicano: Tomo 8, 1955-1956|date=1993|publisher=Universidad de Guadalajara|location=Mexico|page=47}}</ref>\n\nGarc\u00eda Riera starts off his film review by noting that previously he, like many others, viewed Russell as the epitome of conceitedness and extremely stuck-up. In this Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez production, Russell represented a threat of hybridization. His character, called \"Danny\" more often than \"Daniel\", at 15-years-old beat it out of Mexico to go to the United States, and he returned with bilingual crooning abilities.  His family members called him \"bracero\" (farm laborer), so as to not call him \"pocho\", He has future possibilities of entering the \"gringo\" middle-class due to his success on television, singing in high-priced cabarets, and the sale of records ...<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garc\u00eda Riera|first1=Emilio|title=Historia Documental del Cine Mexicano: Tomo 8, 1955-1956|date=1993|publisher=Universidad de Guadalajara|location=Mexico|pages=47\u201348}}</ref>\n\nThe film has good pacing in the beginning, but it gets lost, dispersed, and ends up being a victim of its bewildering musical numbers, which include: Russell, Freddy Fern\u00e1ndez, and Gustavo Villacampa singing \"Perfida\" while shirtless in the bathroom; Russell wearing a straw hat and singing \"Muchachita\" (his big hit) to Irma Castill\u00f3n, as they both tap-dance in the Hollywood style; in an audition, Russell singing \"Qui\u00e9reme mucho\" in Spanish and English, while Antonio Raxel makes the comment that if Russell sings in English, would he want his salary to be paid in dollars instead of pesos; and Russell singing \"Amor, Amor, Amor\" in a disconcerting musical number, complete with a couple from prehistoric times, another from the 8th century, an Arab with his harem, and Cupid. It's shocking and absurd. But in its defense, one can say that Russell, from a distance, does not appear to be so stuck-up anymore. There have been others who have been worse.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garc\u00eda Riera|first1=Emilio|title=Historia Documental del Cine Mexicano: Tomo 8, 1955-1956|date=1993|publisher=Universidad de Guadalajara|location=Mexico|page=48}}</ref>\n\nHis next film was his most popular:  ''\u00a1Viva la juventud!''

He had already felt somewhat constrained when performing before Mexican audiences, as they often did not appreciate the changes or updates he would make to traditional songs. In general, [[Mexican people|Mexicans]], and Latin Americans, preferred that Russell sing in Spanish and respect the traditional forms of music. If he were performing before a Mexican audience, he could not use special material because they might mock him by saying, \"He's getting fancy.\"<ref name=\"training ground\"/>\n\nIt seemed that \"the gimmick (singing bilingually) that brought him fame in his native country was unwanted south of the U.S. border. He felt negative responses from audiences when he sang in English.<ref name=\"lamparski151\"/>\n\nYet, despite the resistance and conservative leanings of his Latin-American audiences, Russell could observe that by the early to mid-1960s, Mexican musicians and the public were opening up and becoming receptive to combining musical styles as he himself had already done in the 1940s and 1950s. He addressed this issue in a 1967 interview with ''Billboard'' magazine:\n\n{{quote|You can turn the radio on today in Mexico and hear American music played by Mexican boys and it's rock. Mexico is changing. Before, everything was Mexican music. Now there are other influences being heard ... Years ago, it was a crime for a performer to change the authentic musical forms. A bolero was a bolero. I drew a lot of criticism for jazzing up 'Perfidia'. Today, the young musicians are making rock versions of standards.  \n|author=Source:   \n|source=''Billboard''. December 16, 1967. page M-24}}\n\nThus, although Russell received some criticism for his bilingual ballads and mixing of American and Latin American musical rhythms, he can also be considered to have been a musical pioneer in Mexico, due to the fact that his versatility influenced the next generation of Mexican rockers to be receptive to and combine musical genres.\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:El Show del Andy Russell, Argentina.jpg|thumb|left|Publicity photo for ''El show de Andy Russell''.]]\nFrom 1956\u201365, Russell traveled back-and-forth from Mexico City to [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]], where he had a television variety show called ''El Show de Andy Russell'' on channel 7.

These lines are from the inside sleeve of the record jacket of ''Favoritos'', Russell's first album for Capitol Records back in 1943:\n\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:Andy Russell LP Favoritos (cover) by Capitol Records, 1943.JPG|thumb|Andy Russell, ''Favoritos'' LP, Capitol Records, 1943]] \n| [[File:Andy Russell LP Favoritos by Capitol Records, 1943.JPG|thumb|Andy Russell, ''Favoritos'' LP (inside), Capitol Records, 1943]]\n| [[File:Andy Russell LP- Favoritos (Singing Ambassador sleeve) by Capitol Records, 1943.JPG|thumb|Andy Russell, ''Favoritos'' LP, (inside flap), Capitol Records, 1943]]\n|}\n\n\"Singing Ambassador ... Andy Russell is more than a singer ... blessed with a voice, a personality, and a sense of showmanship, which, combined, attract the envy of less-gifted performers. He has spectacularly catapulted into the foremost ranks of entertainers since 1943 and accomplished Herculean results in furthering the friendship of the North American peoples with those of Central and South America to the south.\n\n\"Andy is a handsome, young American, born and reared in Los Angeles, with a deep insight into the music of Latin America and with a flair for singing songs in both English and Spanish that has won him the plaudits of millions.\n\n\"Andy's selections for this collection of 'favoritos' include Just Friends, Let's Fall in Love, I'll See You in My Dreams, Imagination, Mar\u00eda Elena, La Borrachita, Cielito Lindo, and the plaintive Adios, Muchachos. All eight selections are beloved the world over. 'They're my favorites, too,' Russell confesses.\n\n\"Capitol is privileged to present Andy Russell and this smart package of unforgettable music. His songs serve to establish him as a friendly ambassador without portfolio. Good neighbors of the south ... Good neighbors of the north ... are brought together by his virile, baritone voice. Saludos, amigos!\"\n\n==In popular culture==\nRussell is mentioned in the [[Chicano]] seminal work ''[[The Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo]]'' (1972) by [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]] on page 73:\n\n\"And unless we bathed and washed the dishes, we couldn't turn on the little brown radio to listen to ''[[The Whistler]]'', ''[[The Shadow]]'', or ''[[Your Hit Parade|The Saturday Night Hit Parade]]'' with Andy Russell, the only [[Mexican music|Mexican]] I ever heard on the radio as a kid. We would sit and listen while we shined our shoes. During the commercials, my mother would sing beautiful Mexican songs, which I then thought were corny, while she dried the dishes. 'When you grow up, you'll like this music, too,' my ma always prophesied. In the summer of '67, as a buffalo on the run, I still thought Mexican music was corny.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zeta-Acosta|first1=Oscar|title=The Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo|year=1989|publisher=First Vintage Books|location=U.S.A.|isbn=0-679-72213-0|page=73}}</ref>\n\nIn his short story ''[[Zona Rosa, Mexico City|Zona Rosa]], 1965'' (2004), Vicente Le\u00f1ero envisions this fashionable neighborhood in Mexico City as a female energy \"who is well versed in literature; she's chatted with [[Carlos Fuentes]] at Caf\u00e9 Tirol; she's become a [[bullfighting]] buff after seeing [[List of bullfighters#Spain|Paco Camino]] leaving Hotel Presidente.

He also indicates that at the urging of bandleader [[Gus Arnheim]], Russell accepted to change his original name of \"Andr\u00e9s R\u00e1bago\" to the anglicized \"Andy Russell\". He seems to imply, then, that Russell simply gave up his name and cultural identity in exchange for musical and economic opportunities otherwise reserved for Anglo-American musicians. Furthermore, Avant-Mier contends, Russell acquiesced because, from an early age, he seemed to be more comfortable with his American rather than Mexican culture.\n\nHowever, Avant-Mier does not take into consideration (as explained earlier) the context of the place and period that Russell had been born and reared in the United States during the first half of the 20th century and its influence on one's self-identity. The country experienced two World Wars, a Great Depression, and a wave of nationalism and patriotism that fostered a common and united national identity, rather than ethnic pride. Yet, although Russell spoke and understood more English than Spanish, and was exposed more to American than Mexican culture during the initial stage of his career, however, in no way did this signify a rejection of his Mexican culture. It was solely a temporary accommodation, as Russell stated: \"Part of the reason I changed my name--as did many Jewish entertainers--was that I did not want to be stereotyped [as just a Latin singer]. But now I'm hard to sell in my own country--except to those who already know me.\"<ref name=\"lamparski151\"/>\n\nYet Avant-Mier rejects Russell's nuanced argument by concluding that \"Russell eventually attributed his phenomenal success to the fact that his light skin and European features allowed him to pass as Anglo- or European-American.\" (Avant-Mier, 59) To support his conclusion, Avant-Mier simply references all nine pages (142-150) of Loza's ''Barrio Rhythm: Mexican-American Music in Los Angeles'' without specifying exactly where Russell admits to \"selling out\", which Avant-Mier seems to imply.\n\nAvant-Mier overlooks Russell's talent, drive, and work ethic as essential components to his success. Plus, no credit is given to Russell for having the flexibility to manage his identity in order to capitalize on the few opportunities available for a Mexican-American in a racist society, while being faithful to aspects of both his Mexican and American identities. While some may call this \"selling out\", others might view it as \"[[when life gives you lemons, make lemonade]]\",\n\nAvant-Mier continues: \"The case of Andy Russell also reminds us of social structures that often required Latino/as to perform whiteness in order to have any chance of success in the mainstream music business.\" (Avant-Mier, 59) Deborah Pacini Hern\u00e1ndez states as much on page 10 of her book ''Oye Como Va!: Hybridity and Identity in Latino Popular Music'' when she makes the same casual argument: \"Latinos who could 'pass' as white could access the mainstream market, although only if they hid their ethnicity by changing their names, as did Andy Russell and Ritchie Valens, respectively born Andr\u00e9s R\u00e1bago P\u00e9rez and Ricardo Valenzuela.\" <ref>{{cite book|last1=Hern\u00e1ndez|first1=Deborah Pacini|title=Oye Como Va!: Hybridity and Identity in Latino Popular Music|date=2010|publisher=Temple University Press|location=U.S.A.|isbn=978-1-4399-0090-1|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zNcJkzg1OuQC&dq=besame+mucho+most+recorded+song&q=andy+russell#v=snippet&q=andy%20russell&f=false|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThus, neither seem to lend credence to Russell's claim that his Mexican-American ethnicity was clearly evidenced by his singing in Spanish and his continual affirmation of being of Mexican descent. Specifically, once he had a huge hit with \"[[B\u00e9same Mucho]]\", Russell's trademark was his bilingual singing ability, which would not only be a feature of many of his songs, but a reflection of his cultural upbringing. As Loza states: \"Because he was singing bilingually, Andy felt that the public would know his background by the Spanish songs in his repertoire\" <ref name=\"loza146\"/> and realize he was a Mexican who had simply adopted a stage name, as was the norm for many performers of all ethnicities in that era.\n\nRussell has also stated that he was always upfront about his Mexican heritage: \"You know, I would tell everybody, I'd say, 'I'm Mexican ... ' and they'd say, 'No, Andy, you must be Spanish.' I'd say, 'No, I'm Mexican ... ' and they'd say, 'No, Andy, but you're so light.' And I'd say, 'No, no, I'm Mexican. My father's Mexican. My mother's Mexican ... '\" <ref name=\"loza144\"/> Clearly, his ethnic identity was not up for negotiation.\n\nIn truth, there was not much the talented, hard-working Russell could do about his personal appearance, who just happened to be \"six feet tall, weighs 170 pounds, has hazel colored eyes, and black hair.\"<ref name=\"triple\">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=New Manpower on the Sing Shift: Andy Russell, Triple Threat on Radio, Records, and Personal Appearances |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA108&dq=andy+russell+singer&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BlsNVP3hGIWrogTp6oDICQ&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=andy%20russell%20singer&f=false |magazine=The Billboard 1944 Music Year Book |location=New York |date=1944 |accessdate=September 8, 2014}}</ref> Russell's distinct racial characteristics apparently were classified as being \"Anglo\", although they fall within the diversity of Mexican racial identity with its three main components being Spanish, Indian, and Negro ancestry (in varying degrees). In Russell's case, his preponderance of European stock was a reaffirmation, and an extension, of his Mexican identity. There was no need for him to \"perform whiteness\" or \"pass as white\", as it was already a part of his racial heritage and identity\u2014-but as a Mexican, not European-American.\n\nRussell's nationality was American, but, at the same time, he never denied his Mexican ethnicity. The name change was simply a means to an end. The explanation could be as simple as Arnheim did not like the sound, wanted something easier to pronounce, and chose \"Russell\" because it reminded him of [[Russ Columbo]] (a vocalist and violin player associated with Arnheim and his Orchestra who had already gained popularity before his untimely death). \"Russ Columbo\" was a stage name, as his birth name was \"Ruggiero Eugenio di Rodolpho Colombo\".\n\nAnother adherent who claimed that Russell's success was due to his \"whiteness\" was Lalo Guerrero, Mexican-American composer, singer, and musician. He stated that he might have had mainstream success, if he, too, were \"g\u00fcero\" (light-skinned), like Russell or [[Vikki Carr]].<ref name=\"loza162\">{{cite book|last=Loza|first=Steven |title=Barrio Rhythm: Mexican American Music in Los Angeles|url=https://archive.org/details/barriorhythmmexi0000loza|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/barriorhythmmexi0000loza/page/162 162]}}</ref> In addition, according to Guerrero, they were the only Mexican-Americans who were accepted and successful in Mexico.<ref name=\"loza162\"/> This simple, almost naive explanation belies Guerrero's own stature as a legendary musician of some renown, known as the \"Father of Chicano Music\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Horn|first1=David|editor1-last=Shepherd|editor1-first=John|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8: Genres: North America|date=2012|publisher=The Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1441160782|page=133|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HZQemZyozqwC&pg=PA133&dq=eduardo+%27lalo%27+guerrero+continuum+volume+8#v=onepage|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs stated previously, one must take note that there were also examples of other Mexican-Americans and Mexicans who were successful and who did not anglicize their names: actors [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]], [[Katy Jurado]], [[Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez]], etc. Other dark-complexioned recording artists who were known during the period were Mexican singer [[To\u00f1a la Negra]] and Cuban singers [[Celia Cruz]] and [[Benny Mor\u00e9]] and musician [[P\u00e9rez Prado]]. In addition, [[Germ\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s]], Tin Tan, a Mexican comic, actor, and singer who grew up in the border area of [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], [[Chihuahua City|Chihuahua]], south of [[El Paso, Texas]], was exposed to Mexican-American pachucos and cal\u00f3. He used this knowledge to create his comical version of a pachuco, using bilingual dialogue to hilarious effect and enormous popularity.\n\nSurely, Guerrero must have appreciated and understood the fact that, despite the shade of a Mexican's skin tone, starting and maintaining a successful career in the entertainment industry mainly took a lot of hard work, dedication, talent, networking, and luck.\n\nBut, the assessment of Avant-Mier that Russell's success was mainly due to the fact that he \"Anglicized\" his name and used his \"European\" features to bypass American society racist structure and perform \"whiteness\" is short-sighted. In contrast, for Russell, the \"name-change\" was not that important in the big picture, since he would always claim, sometimes emphatically so, that he was ethnically Mexican. Some newspaper articles, books, and liner notes support this statement (see section What's in a Name? II).\n\nAs such, this whole construct needs to be reframed:  Russell as a Mexican was involved in a give-and-take, push-and-pull dynamic where, at times, he was on the forefront singing bilingually and declaring his Mexican ethnicity; and, at other times, conforming to American society's stereotypical notions of Mexicans performers in order to have the opportunity to perform and earn a living.\n\nFurthermore, to describe Russell as performing \"whiteness\" brings up images of performing \"[[blackface]]\" which would be a misnomer, as this term is applied within the context of the racial discrimination exhibited by Anglo-Americans against African-Americans, so it seems out of place when referring to Mexicans or Mexican-Americans who not only have a distinct racial, ethnic, and cultural heritage, but a different history in the United States, as well.\n\nMoreover, Russell's ability to sing in Spanish would prove to be a double-edged sword: it gave him popularity and acceptance at the onset, but it also typecast him as a Latin singer, leaving him out of work when the popular wave of Latin music passed. But what bothered Russell the most was that his identity as an American singer could be called into question.\n\nThis same ability to sing in Spanish, however, then opened up a whole new market for him in Mexico, Latin America and Europe, where his brand of music was not only accepted but celebrated. Unfortunately, here, Russell was subject to the Mexican brand of discrimination which tended to label him a \"pocho\". (see \"Mexican Films\" section above)\n\nOne must question if Guerrero's assertion regarding skin color and success in the music industry (and validation of this by later Latino scholars) is correct and universal: that light-skin and European features allowed for upward mobility, while tan or dark-skinned performers were penalized. One cannot deny the preponderance of light-skinned musical stars, but the dark-complexioned stars were also present in United States (and Mexico).\n\nMost important, the expression of Chicano artistic and musical creations were finding an outlet within and outside of the mainstream, for reasons that go beyond just skin color and discrimination. In Russell's case, he was gifted with an incredible voice, had a flair for showmanship, along with charisma and good looks.\n\nOn a personal level, just like in the United States, his need to sing and perform were validated in Mexico and Latin America; moreover, he must have surely felt more ethnically Mexican than ever before, when in 1956, he married the daughter of a Mexican diplomat, who gave birth to his only son ...\n\nBut after 11 years of living and performing in Mexico and Latin America, Russell once again felt the blade of the double-edged sword when he said he \"felt that he was losing his professional identity and also being subtly pressured into becoming a citizen of Mexico,\" <ref name=\"lamparski151\"/> which precipitated his return to the United States in the mid-1960s, and, again, having to resort to a temporary accommodation in terms of his Mexican-American identity. The pendulum now swung the other way, as he sang mainly in English and married a blue-eyed, blond former Mrs. Houston.\n\nIn conclusion, questions regarding Russell's identity, appearance, acceptance, success, and influence over a career spanning 50 years and several continents is much more complex and layered than what Avant-Mier, Pacini Hernandez, and Guerrero have presented.\n\n===What's in a name? II===\nRussell had been emphatic about his Mexican ethnicity, over the course of his career from 1942 to 1989, which spanned almost 50 years.  Notwithstanding, his racial ethnicity was described using different terms in newspapers, magazines, and on albums.\n\nOn the inside flap of his debut album \"Favoritos\" (1943), Capitol described him as: \"a handsome young '''American''', born and reared in Los Angeles{{nbsp}}...\"\n\nIn a 1944 newspaper article, he was called: a \"talented, 23-year-old '''Mexican'''\".<ref name=\"coatikook\">{{cite news|last1=Lilley|first1=George|title=Little Things about the Stars|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=407&dat=19440901&id=DcsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4144,1218087|accessdate=18 September 2014|agency=The Coatikook Observer|date=September 1, 1944}}</ref>\n\nIn another newspaper article from 1944, he was described as: \"...{{nbsp}}a fellow of '''Spanish extraction'''{{nbsp}}...\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gaver|first1=Jack|title=Now if he's as Funny as he is Fat--|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19440819&id=OisaAAAAIBAJ&pg=4330,1189228|accessdate=19 September 2014|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=August 19, 1944}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1945 article, he was described as a '''Los Angeles-born Mexican lad'.''<ref name=\"doings\">{{cite news|title=Close-Ups of Movie Doings|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19450519&id=gHNWAAAAIBAJ&pg=4085,4430914&hl=en|accessdate=25 March 2015|agency=The Spokesman Review|date=19 May 1945}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1946 article, he was called: \"an '''American Spaniard'''\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Winchell|first1=Walter|title=Notes of an Innocent Bystander|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&dat=19460305&id=YGEoAAAAIBAJ&pg=5357,1142832|accessdate=18 September 2014|newspaper=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|date=March 5, 1946}}</ref>\n\nOn the back cover of his album \"The Magic of Andy Russell\" (1958), RCA described his singing style, \"...{{nbsp}}which stems from his '''Mexican-American''' upbringing{{nbsp}}...\"\n\nAmong many names, he has also been labeled as: \"Hispano\", \"Latin\",<ref>{{cite news|title=This and That|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19450906&id=9vAZAAAAIBAJ&pg=1329,1996750|accessdate=12 March 2015|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=September 6, 1945}}</ref> \"Spanish-Mexican\", \"of Mexican parentage\", \"Mexican of Spanish descent\", \"a Californian of Mexican descent\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Andy Russell is at Top of World|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1870&dat=19721008&id=OE8fAAAAIBAJ&pg=4673,2344017|accessdate=9 October 2014|agency=Dayton Beach Sunday News|date=8 Oct 1972}}</ref> \"Mexican-Spanish\",<ref>{{cite news|last1=Richards|first1=Ramona|title=Interview Provides Thrill - School Girl Quizzes Crooner|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19480910&id=2zsuAAAAIBAJ&pg=5934,3424629|accessdate=12 March 2015|newspaper=The Miami News|date=September 10, 1948}}</ref> \"mexicano-norteamericano\",<ref>{{cite news|title=El mundo del artista|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1706&dat=19750813&id=fGc0AAAAIBAJ&pg=937,486907|newspaper=El Tiempo|date=August 13, 1975}}</ref> \"norteamericano\" and \"Chicano\".<ref name=\"seattle\"/>\n\n===The prodigal son returns ... ?===\n[[File:Andy Russell - \"More Amor\" Album (Front).JPG|thumb|Andy Russell, \"More Amor!\" LP, Capitol Records, 1967]]  \n[[File:Andy Russell - More Amor Album Cover (Back) - Capitol Records (1967).JPG|thumb|Andy Russell, \"More Amor!\" LP (back cover), Capitol Records, 1967]]\nAfter releasing the Capitol singles \"Longin'\" and \"Enamorado\" in 1966 (neither charted), Russell's comeback album in the United States was \"More Amor!\" (Capitol Records, 1967). On the back cover, there is a certain awkwardness and palpable confusion in the explanation about why Russell had left the United States for Mexico, and why he had returned.\n\nRussell apparently divorced his third wife, Velia S\u00e1nchez Belmont, sometime in the early 1960s (a September 7, 1963, newspaper article states that his new romance was the Countess Joaquina de Navas of [[Madrid]]).<ref name=\"countess\">{{cite news|last1=Winchell|first1=Walter|title=Winchell Back with Celebs|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19630907&id=DzYsAAAAIBAJ&pg=3399,900916|accessdate=September 20, 2014|publisher=Herald-Journal|date=September 7, 1963}}</ref> His television show in Argentina ended in 1964. His waning popularity was also evidenced by the popularity of a new wave of younger singers in Mexico, such as [[C\u00e9sar Costa]], [[Enrique Guzm\u00e1n]], and Alberto V\u00e1squez, who in many ways, were his musical heirs. They took up the mantle that he had initially carried into Mexico, and these young singers performed Spanish covers of [[American popular music#1960s rock|American]] and [[British Invasion]] hit songs of the 1960s to an enthusiastic, young female fan base, as Russell had once done as a crooner in the 1940s. Furthermore, and most tellingly, these younger singers were Mexican nationals, unlike Russell who was an American of Mexican ancestry.\n\nRussell probably saw the writing on the wall. He had now become pass\u00e9. All these reasons most likely played a factor in Russell looking toward the United States for a fresh start.\n\nIn any case, this time around, the visions of grandeur turned out to be a mirage, as none of the songs on \"More Amor!\" charted on Billboard.  The album followed the same Russell formula: a nice balance of songs, some in English and some in his \"bilingual style\", which had proven so successful in the decade of the 1940s and in Latin America.\n\nNeedless to say, regardless of what was written on the back cover and his situation in Mexico, Russell did not have the same success in 1967 in the United States as he had had in 1944 for a plethora of reasons, many dealing with issues ''other'' than identity\u2014he was older, musical tastes had changed, he had been effectively gone for 11 years, the milieu was certainly different, as the country was caught up in the social and political turmoil of the 1960s, etc. Yet, the notes on the back cover are a fascinating testament to where Russell believed he was in terms of his public persona in 1967, after having been out of the country for 11 years.\n\nNotwithstanding, Russell continued working. His comeback appearance at the Chauteau Madrid nightclub in New York was a phenomenal success.  He also performed in Las Vegas, at other nightclubs, and was a frequent guest on television programs. Plus, he continued to make periodic trips to perform in Mexico and Latin America. Apparently, he continued being a captivating and charismatic performer during his live appearances.\n\nThat same year another album followed: \"...{{nbsp}}Such a Pretty World Today\" (Capitol, 1967), this time with all songs sung in English, except for \"Lady\", the last chorus of which he sings in his \"flawless Spanish\". This was followed by a single, \"I'm Not Through Missing You\". (Capitol 45 rpm, 1967). This approach seemed to work better as both songs charted in the top ten of Billboard's Easy Listening Chart.\n\nAt this point, it may seem that Russell was nudging towards being the American singer who sang in English, while not totally abandoning the Latin singer persona, in order to gain a modicum of success in the American recording industry. Less was being said about his name change at this point, as many people already knew that he was the Latin or Mexican singer with the American-sounding name.\n\nRussell considered his nationality to be, first and foremost, American but ethnically he was Mexican-American. He corrected people who said he was Spanish based on his appearance (tall, light-skinned, and hazel eyes) by stating that he was Mexican.\n\nHe found the term Mexican-American to be acceptable, but he had a difficult time accepting the term \"[[Chicano]]\".\n\nHe stated: \"My parents were born in Mexico, but I hate the word 'Chicano'. I am an American.\"<ref name=\"lamparski151\"/>\n\nIn a later interview, he elaborated on the subject:\n\n{{quote|I hated the word 'Chicano' at that time, 'cause at that time it was that, 'He's nothing but a Chicano, you know?' That was a terrible word at that time. Yeah, 'Pachuco' or 'Chicano', you know? That's a horrible word. I says, 'I'm not Chicano. I'm Mexican American. First I'm Mexican because my mother and dad are Mexican and I'm Mexican, and I'm American 'cause I was born here. I'm a Mexican American, I'm not a Chicano, you know? I just didn't like that word. It stuck with me. I don't like it even today. I'm sorry, I don't like it ... Just don't like the sound.  \n|author=Source   \n|source=Loza, Steven. (1993) ''Barrio Rhythm:  Mexican American Music in Los Angeles''. University of Illinois Press, page 147}}\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the term \"Chicano\" was an insulting, disparaging term used by upper class Mexicans who lived in the United States to refer to indigent Mexican immigrants who had just crossed the border. Thus, Russell is not using the term as it was reclaimed and redefined as a source of pride and political power in the 1960s, although he does agree with the principal. In spite of this, Russell meant no offense or disrespect to those people who embraced the term Chicano; he just stated that it was not for him.\n\nSteven Loza, director of Ethnic Musicology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of ''Barrio Rhythm:  Mexican-American Music in Los Angeles'' may have had a different take than Russell on the term \"Chicano\" when he stated: \"Chicano music is Andrew Russell ... He personified that whole experience.\" <ref name=\"seattle\"/>\n\n==Charted hits==\nThe following tables list records by Russell that were sold and charted in the United States. He also made recordings in Mexico, however these \"received little exposure in the U.S. but were hits all over Latin America and in Spain.\"<ref name=\"lamparski151\"/> One would have to consult each country's record charts to see how Russell's records rated in each individual country for a complete overview.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Song<ref name=\"chart\"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Whitburn|first1=Joel|title=Pop Memories 1890-1954: The History of American Popular Music|date=1991|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|isbn=0898200830|pages=[https://archive.org/details/joelwpopmemories00whit/page/375 375\u201376]|url=https://archive.org/details/joelwpopmemories00whit/page/375}}</ref>\n!Date recorded<ref name=\"laredo7-8\">{{cite book|last=Laredo|first=Joseph F.|title=Liner Notes from Spotlight on Andy Russell CD|date=1995|publisher=Capitol Records, Inc.|location=USA|pages=7\u20138}}</ref>\n!Date entered \n[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]\n<br>Hot 100 \n<br>Record Chart\n!Highest position\n!Weeks on chart\n!Catalog number\n!Notes\n|-\n|\"[[B\u00e9same Mucho|B\u00e9same mucho]]\" (\"Kiss Me Much\")\n|December 17, 1943\n|April 15, 1944\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n| 10\n|[[Capitol Records|Capitol]] 149\n|With [[Al Sack]] and his Orchestra, composed by [[Consuelo Vel\u00e1zquez]] and [[Sunny Skylar]]\n|-\n|\"[[Amor (1943 song)|Amor]]\"\n|March 10, 1944\n|June 1, 1944\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 10\n| 5\n|Capitol 156\n|With Al Sack and his Orchestra, composed by [[Sunny Skylar]], [[Ricardo L\u00f3pez M\u00e9ndez]], and [[Gabriel Ruiz (composer)|Gabriel Ru\u00edz]].\n|-\n|\"[[What a Difference a Day Makes (song)|What a Diff'rence a Day Made\" / \"Cuando vuelva a tu lado]]\"\n|May 19, 1944\n|October 21, 1944\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 8\n| 14\n|Capitol 167\n|With [[Paul Weston]] and his Orchestra, composed by [[Mar\u00eda Grever]] and [[Stanley Adams (singer)|Stanley Adams]]\n|-\n|\"[[I Dream of You (More Than You Dream I Do)|I Dream of You]]\"\n| ? 1944\n|December 30, 1944\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n| 5\n|Capitol 175\n|With Paul Weston and his Orchestra, composed by Osser and Goetschius\n|-\n|\"[[I Can't Begin to Tell You]]\"\n| ? 1945\n|December 27, 1945\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 9\n| 7\n|Capitol 221\n|With Paul Weston and his Orchestra, composed by [[James V.
