He served as [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain]] for fourteen years and under four Prime Ministers.\n\n== Early life==\nBorn at Bracon Ash, [[Norfolk]], Thurlow was the eldest son of Reverend Thomas Thurlow. [[Thomas Thurlow (bishop)|Thomas Thurlow]], [[Bishop of Durham]], was his brother. He studied at [[King's School, Canterbury]] and at [[Caius College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=THRW748E|name=Thurlow, Edward}}</ref> However, he was forced to leave Cambridge in 1751 without a degree after coming into conflict with the authorities of the university. He was for some time articled to a solicitor in [[Lincoln's Inn]], but in 1754 he was called to the Bar, [[Inner Temple]]. After a slow start, Thurlow eventually established a successful legal practice. He was made a [[King's Counsel]] in 1761 and was elected a [[bencher]] of the Inner Temple in 1762.{{sfn|Renton|1911}}\n\n== Political career==\n[[File:Edward Thurlow.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Lord Chancellor Thurlow]]\n[[File:Sin-Death-and-the-Devil-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''Sin, Death, and the Devil'' (1792), [[James Gillray]] caricatured the political battle between [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] (Death) and Thurlow (Satan), with [[Queen Charlotte]] (Sin) in the middle, protecting Pitt.]]\nThurlow then turned to politics, and in 1768 he was elected Member of Parliament for [[Tamworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Tamworth]] as a [[Tory]]. Two years later, as a recognition of his defence the previous January of the expulsion of [[John Wilkes]] he was appointed [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] in the government of [[Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford|Lord North]].{{sfn|Renton|1911}} He held this post until 1772, when he was promoted to [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]]. He was to remain in this office for six years, during which period he became known as an ardent opponent of the American colonists' strive for [[American Revolution|independence]].  He is noted for his defeat in the case of [[Henry Sampson Woodfall|Woodfall]], who was publisher of the [[Letters of Junius]], upon which a verdict of mistrial was entered by [[Lord Mansfield]].\n\nIn 1778 Thurlow was admitted to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], raised to the peerage as '''Baron Thurlow''', of Ashfield in the County of Suffolk,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=11880 |date=2 June 1778 |page=1 }}</ref> and appointed [[Lord Chancellor]] by [[Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford|Lord North]]. In this post he notably opposed the economical and constitutional reforms proposed by [[Edmund Burke]] and [[John Dunning, 1st Baron Ashburton|John Dunning]]. The Tory administration of Lord North fell in March 1782, after twelve years in office. The [[Whig Party (UK)|Whigs]] under [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]] came to power, but Thurlow managed to cling on as Lord Chancellor. Rockingham died in July 1782, but Thurlow remained Lord Chancellor also when [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] became Prime Minister. The latter government fell in April 1783, when a coalition government under [[Charles James Fox]] and Lord North was formed (with the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] as titular Prime Minister). Thurlow was not invited to resume the role of Lord Chancellor, and instead the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] was put into commission. He went into opposition and contributed to the downfall of the coalition in December 1783. [[William Pitt the Younger]] became Prime Minister and reinstated Thurlow as Lord Chancellor. The relationship between Pitt and Thurlow was always fragile, and Thurlow often relied on his friendship with [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to be able to remain in office. He opposed a bill for the restoration to the heirs of estates forfeited in the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]. Partly to please the king, he consistently and strongly supported [[Warren Hastings]], and negotiated with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] to ensure his continued power in the event of a change of government. In 1792, when he attacked Pitt's bill to establish a fund to redeem the national debt, he was finally dismissed.{{sfn|Renton|1911}}\n\n==Personal life==\nThurlow had a number of illegitimate children<ref>{{cite book|title=Quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjkRAAAAIAAJ|year=1953|publisher=The Society|page=415}}</ref> Two of his daughters, Maria and Catharine, had their portrait painted by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] in 1783.

However, in 1797 he intrigued for the formation of a government from which Pitt and Fox should be excluded, and in which the [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Earl of Moira]] should be Prime Minister and himself Lord Chancellor.{{sfn|Renton|1911}} Despite the tacit support of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] the enterprise failed. His last recorded appearance in the House of Lords was in 1802.{{sfn|Renton|1911}}\n\n[[File:Maria and Catherine, daughters of Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow, by George Romney.jpg|thumb|Maria and Catherine, daughters of Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow ([[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]], 1783)]]\nLord Thurlow never married, but left three natural daughters. He died at [[Brighton]] on 12 September 1806, aged 76, and was buried in the Temple Church.{{sfn|Renton|1911}} The barony of 1778 became extinct on his death, while he was succeeded in the barony of 1792 according to the special remainder by his nephew [[Edward Hovell-Thurlow, 2nd Baron Thurlow|Edward]], who was the eldest son of the first baron's brother, Right Reverend Thomas Thurlow, [[Bishop of Durham]].\n\n==In popular culture==\nThurlow appears as a character in [[Alan Bennett]]'s play ''[[The Madness of George III]]'' and the subsequent [[The Madness of King George|film adaptation]], in which he was played by [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]].\n\n[[John Poynder]]'s ''Literary Extracts'' (1844) attributes to Thurlow the following widely quoted saying:<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/literaryextracts01poynuoft/page/268/mode/2up |page=268 |title=Literary Extracts |first=John |last=Poynder |location=London |publisher=John Hatchard & Son |volume=i |date=n.d. |origyear=1844}}</ref>  {{quote|Corporations have neither bodies to be punished, nor souls to be condemned; they therefore do as they like.}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite DNB|wstitle=Thurlow, Edward (1731-1806)|volume=56|first= James McMullen |last=Rigg}}\n*{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Thurlow, Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron |volume=26 |pages=903\u2013904 |first=Alexander Wood |last=Renton |authorlink=Alexander Wood Renton}} Endnotes:\n** [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|Lord Campbell]]'s ''Lives of the Chancellors'', vii. 153\u2013333\n** [[Edward Foss|Foss]]'s ''Judges of England'', viii. 374\u2013385\n** ''Public Characters'' (1798)\n** ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', 2nd series, vol. iii. p.&nbsp;283; 3rd series, vol. iii. p.&nbsp;122\n** ''[[Nominate reports|Reports]]'' of his decisions by Brown, Dickens and Vesey (jun.)\n** [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Brougham]]'s ''Statesmen of the Time of George III.''\n* {{cite ODNB|first=G.

He served as [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain]] for fourteen years and under four Prime Ministers.\n\n== Early life==\nBorn at Bracon Ash, [[Norfolk]], Thurlow was the eldest son of Reverend Thomas Thurlow. [[Thomas Thurlow (bishop)|Thomas Thurlow]], [[Bishop of Durham]], was his brother. He studied at [[King's School, Canterbury]] and at [[Caius College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=THRW748E|name=Thurlow, Edward}}</ref> However, he was forced to leave Cambridge in 1751 without a degree after coming into conflict with the authorities of the university. He was for some time articled to a solicitor in [[Lincoln's Inn]], but in 1754 he was called to the Bar, [[Inner Temple]]. After a slow start, Thurlow eventually established a successful legal practice. He was made a [[King's Counsel]] in 1761 and was elected a [[bencher]] of the Inner Temple in 1762.{{sfn|Renton|1911}}\n\n== Political career==\n[[File:Edward Thurlow.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Lord Chancellor Thurlow]]\n[[File:Sin-Death-and-the-Devil-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''Sin, Death, and the Devil'' (1792), [[James Gillray]] caricatured the political battle between [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] (Death) and Thurlow (Satan), with [[Queen Charlotte]] (Sin) in the middle, protecting Pitt.]]\nThurlow then turned to politics, and in 1768 he was elected Member of Parliament for [[Tamworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Tamworth]] as a [[Tory]]. Two years later, as a recognition of his defence the previous January of the expulsion of [[John Wilkes]] he was appointed [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] in the government of [[Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford|Lord North]].{{sfn|Renton|1911}} He held this post until 1772, when he was promoted to [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]]. He was to remain in this office for six years, during which period he became known as an ardent opponent of the American colonists' strive for [[American Revolution|independence]].  He is noted for his defeat in the case of [[Henry Sampson Woodfall|Woodfall]], who was publisher of the [[Letters of Junius]], upon which a verdict of mistrial was entered by [[Lord Mansfield]].\n\nIn 1778 Thurlow was admitted to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], raised to the peerage as '''Baron Thurlow''', of Ashfield in the County of Suffolk,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=11880 |date=2 June 1778 |page=1 }}</ref> and appointed [[Lord Chancellor]] by [[Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford|Lord North]]. In this post he notably opposed the economical and constitutional reforms proposed by [[Edmund Burke]] and [[John Dunning, 1st Baron Ashburton|John Dunning]]. The Tory administration of Lord North fell in March 1782, after twelve years in office. The [[Whig Party (UK)|Whigs]] under [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]] came to power, but Thurlow managed to cling on as Lord Chancellor. Rockingham died in July 1782, but Thurlow remained Lord Chancellor also when [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] became Prime Minister. The latter government fell in April 1783, when a coalition government under [[Charles James Fox]] and Lord North was formed (with the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] as titular Prime Minister). Thurlow was not invited to resume the role of Lord Chancellor, and instead the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] was put into commission. He went into opposition and contributed to the downfall of the coalition in December 1783. [[William Pitt the Younger]] became Prime Minister and reinstated Thurlow as Lord Chancellor. The relationship between Pitt and Thurlow was always fragile, and Thurlow often relied on his friendship with [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to be able to remain in office. He opposed a bill for the restoration to the heirs of estates forfeited in the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]. Partly to please the king, he consistently and strongly supported [[Warren Hastings]], and negotiated with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] to ensure his continued power in the event of a change of government. In 1792, when he attacked Pitt's bill to establish a fund to redeem the national debt, he was finally dismissed.{{sfn|Renton|1911}}\n\n==Personal life==\nThurlow had a number of illegitimate children<ref>{{cite book|title=Quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sjkRAAAAIAAJ|year=1953|publisher=The Society|page=415}}</ref> Two of his daughters, Maria and Catharine, had their portrait painted by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] in 1783.

However, in 1797 he intrigued for the formation of a government from which Pitt and Fox should be excluded, and in which the [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Earl of Moira]] should be Prime Minister and himself Lord Chancellor.{{sfn|Renton|1911}} Despite the tacit support of the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] the enterprise failed. His last recorded appearance in the House of Lords was in 1802.{{sfn|Renton|1911}}\n\n[[File:Maria and Catherine, daughters of Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow, by George Romney.jpg|thumb|Maria and Catherine, daughters of Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow ([[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]], 1783)]]\nLord Thurlow never married, but left three natural daughters.

Through the course of his career he authored nearly 500 publications, described approximately 3,000 new plant species, and amassed over one million [[herbarium]] specimens. In addition to his scientific work he was an accomplished administrator, college dean, university professor and editor of scientific journals.<ref name=\"Arnold\">Archives of the Arnold Arboretum</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMerrill and his twin brother, [[Dana T. Merrill]], were born and raised in the small village of [[Auburn, Maine|East Auburn, Maine]]. They were the youngest of six children by Daniel C. Merrill and Mary (Noyes) Merrill. Merrill showed an early interest in natural history, collecting and identifying plants, birds' eggs, rocks, and minerals. In 1894 he entered the [[University of Maine]] with the intention of studying engineering but soon switched to a general science curriculum where he focused on the biology and classification of flowering plants. He was the valedictorian of his graduation class in 1898 and then stayed on for an additional year working as an assistant in the Department of Natural Science. During his time in college Merrill built a sizable herbarium of almost 2,000 specimens which he eventually donated to the New England Botanical Club.<ref name=\"Robbins\">Robbins, 1958</ref>\n\nIn 1899 Merrill accepted a position with the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] in Washington D.C. as an assistant to [[Frank Lamson-Scribner]], an authority on the classification of grasses and a pioneer plant pathologist. At the USDA he learned the principles of plant taxonomy and became proficient in the development and management of a herbarium. His training was supplemented by fieldwork in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.\n\n==Philippines==\nAt the end of the Spanish\u2013American War, the United States [[Taft Commission]] established the [[Bureau of Agricultural Research (Philippines)|Insular Bureau of Agriculture]] in Manila. Merrill was appointed to the post of botanist in the new organization and arrived in 1902 in Manila where he was to work for the next twenty-two years. Merrill was dismayed to discover that the herbarium he was expecting to find had been destroyed during the war, along with the botanical library and scientific equipment.  Nevertheless, starting with just an empty building, he set out to rebuild the herbarium and library.<ref name=\"Hay\">Hay, 1998</ref>\n\nWithin a few months his role was expanded to include a joint appointment with the Bureau of Forestry. Over the years Merrill's responsibilities continued to grow until he became both the Director of the Bureau of Sciences and a Professor of Botany at the [[University of the Philippines]]. He collected and studied plants not only from the Philippines but also from the greater Asia-Pacific region including Indonesia, Malaysia, Indochina, China, and Guam. Eventually the herbarium grew to over 250,000 specimens and the botanical library was recognized as one of the best in Asia.<ref name=\"Robbins\"/><ref name=\"Hay\"/>\n\nMerrill published more than 100 taxonomic papers on Philippine flora and several additional papers on the flora of the region. Many of his papers were published in ''The Philippine Journal of Science'', a journal he helped establish and edited from 1907 to 1918. In 1912 he published a 500-page ''Flora of Manila'' covering some 1,000 species. In 1921 he completed a ''Bibliographic Enumeration of Bornean Plants'', a volume of 637 pages. His most ambitious work was the ''Enumeration of Philippine Flowering Plants'' published in sections between 1923 and 1926. As documented by his ''Enumeration'' the list of known Philippine species had been extended from 2,500 plants of all types in 1900 to 8,120 species of flowering plants, 1,000 species of ferns, and 3,000 species of [[cryptogams]].<ref name=\"Hay\"/>\n\n==University of California, Berkeley==\nIn 1924 Merrill returned to the United States to join the University of California, Berkeley. There he was appointed Dean of the College of Agriculture and Director of the Agricultural Experiment Station. At Berkeley he led a reorganization of the faculty, revised the  curriculum, emphasized academic training of staff, added buildings and equipment, and stressed fundamental research. In 1925, Merrill established the journal ''Hilgardia'', named for [[Eugene W. Hilgard]] who organized the Agriculture Department and was the founding director of the Agricultural Experiment Station. During his spare time, Merrill continued to work on systematic botany of the Asia-Pacific flora and added more than  100,000 specimens from that region to the University herbarium.<ref name=\"Robbins\"/>\n\nIn 1926 a proposal was developed to establish the California Botanic Garden in Los Angeles. Merrill took part-time leave from the College to become director of the Garden Foundation.{{sfn|Masters|2012}} The plan involved the purchase of {{convert|4500|acre}} at [[Mandeville Canyon, Los Angeles|Mandeville Canyon]] in the Santa Monica Mountains. About 800 acres in the center of the tract were to be developed as a botanical garden financed by the sale of surrounding property for residential homes. During his short tenure as director Merrill built administrative offices and greenhouses, started a library, established an herbarium of 180,000 specimens and planted 1,200 species in the gardens. Unfortunately, not long after Merrill left, the plans collapsed when property prices plummeted as a result of the Great Depression. The herbarium was transferred to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and the gardens were subdivided and sold for housing.<ref name=\"Arnold\"/><ref name=\"Robbins\"/>\n\n==New York Botanic Garden==\nIn 1929 Merrill accepted dual appointments as Director of the [[New York Botanic Garden]] and Professor of Botany at [[Columbia University]]. He started his new job at the onset of the Great Depression and the Garden was facing severe financial constraints. Despite these difficulties, he was able to continue many of the programs by taking advantage of personnel provided by the [[Works Progress Administration]]. Up to 300 personnel were employed building walks, roads, fences and other infrastructure in the gardens; or they worked in the herbarium as mounters, artists, secretaries, librarians, clerks and technicians.<ref name=\"NYBG\">Archives of the New York Botanical Garden</ref>\n\nThe herbarium collection was completely rearranged, operations were improved, and specimens inventoried for the first time. Once\nthe substantial backlog of unmounted material was complete, specimens were mounted for other institutions including the Arnold Arboretum and the Gray Herbarium. In 1931 Merrill established a new journal focused on systematic botany and plant geography, named ''Brittonia'' after [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]], a co-founder of the Garden.\n\n==Harvard==\nIn 1935 Merrill left the Botanic Garden and took a job as Administrator of Botanical Collections at [[Harvard University]], a new position created to consolidate the supervision of eight separate Harvard botanical units. A year after his arrival Merrill also became the Arnold Professor of Botany, and in 1937 the Director of the [[Arnold Arboretum]]. In his new roles Merrill devoted significant time to expanding the herbarium of the Arnold Arboretum and to research on Asiatic plants. Over the next ten years 220,000 plant specimens were acquired from all parts of Asia and the Asia-Pacific. Meanwhile, Merrill continued to publish numerous papers on Asia flora as well as articles dealing with the cultivation and dispersion of domesticated plants. During the Second World War he consulted with the [[United States War Department]] and wrote a handbook, ''Emergency Food Plants and Poisonous Plants of the Islands of the Pacific''.<ref name=\"Arnold\"/>\n\nIn 1946, at the age of seventy Merrill retired from his administrative duties and became Professor Emeritus in 1948. He continued with his research at Harvard and traveled as much as his age and health would allow.  One of his last major contributions was ''The Botany of Cook's Voyages and its Unexpected Significance in Relation to Anthropology, Biogeography and History'', published in 1952.<ref name=\"Robbins\"/>\n\nMerrill died on February 25, 1956, in Forest Hills, Massachusetts.  His library of 2,600 titles was donated to the New York Botanical Garden and a fund was established to award an annual medal to \u201cthat individual within the entire field of botany irrespective of race, creed or nationality who was considered worthy of such an award\u201d.<ref name=\"NYBG\"/>\n\n==Recognition and honors==\nMerrill was widely recognized for his many accomplishments. He received honorary doctorate degrees from the University of Maine in 1926, Harvard University in 1936, the University of California in 1936, and Yale University in 1951.  He was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1951\u20131952.<ref>{{cite web|title=E. D.

Through the course of his career he authored nearly 500 publications, described approximately 3,000 new plant species, and amassed over one million [[herbarium]] specimens. In addition to his scientific work he was an accomplished administrator, college dean, university professor and editor of scientific journals.<ref name=\"Arnold\">Archives of the Arnold Arboretum</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMerrill and his twin brother, [[Dana T. Merrill]], were born and raised in the small village of [[Auburn, Maine|East Auburn, Maine]]. They were the youngest of six children by Daniel C. Merrill and Mary (Noyes) Merrill. Merrill showed an early interest in natural history, collecting and identifying plants, birds' eggs, rocks, and minerals. In 1894 he entered the [[University of Maine]] with the intention of studying engineering but soon switched to a general science curriculum where he focused on the biology and classification of flowering plants. He was the valedictorian of his graduation class in 1898 and then stayed on for an additional year working as an assistant in the Department of Natural Science. During his time in college Merrill built a sizable herbarium of almost 2,000 specimens which he eventually donated to the New England Botanical Club.<ref name=\"Robbins\">Robbins, 1958</ref>\n\nIn 1899 Merrill accepted a position with the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] in Washington D.C. as an assistant to [[Frank Lamson-Scribner]], an authority on the classification of grasses and a pioneer plant pathologist. At the USDA he learned the principles of plant taxonomy and became proficient in the development and management of a herbarium. His training was supplemented by fieldwork in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.\n\n==Philippines==\nAt the end of the Spanish\u2013American War, the United States [[Taft Commission]] established the [[Bureau of Agricultural Research (Philippines)|Insular Bureau of Agriculture]] in Manila. Merrill was appointed to the post of botanist in the new organization and arrived in 1902 in Manila where he was to work for the next twenty-two years. Merrill was dismayed to discover that the herbarium he was expecting to find had been destroyed during the war, along with the botanical library and scientific equipment.  Nevertheless, starting with just an empty building, he set out to rebuild the herbarium and library.<ref name=\"Hay\">Hay, 1998</ref>\n\nWithin a few months his role was expanded to include a joint appointment with the Bureau of Forestry. Over the years Merrill's responsibilities continued to grow until he became both the Director of the Bureau of Sciences and a Professor of Botany at the [[University of the Philippines]]. He collected and studied plants not only from the Philippines but also from the greater Asia-Pacific region including Indonesia, Malaysia, Indochina, China, and Guam. Eventually the herbarium grew to over 250,000 specimens and the botanical library was recognized as one of the best in Asia.<ref name=\"Robbins\"/><ref name=\"Hay\"/>\n\nMerrill published more than 100 taxonomic papers on Philippine flora and several additional papers on the flora of the region. Many of his papers were published in ''The Philippine Journal of Science'', a journal he helped establish and edited from 1907 to 1918. In 1912 he published a 500-page ''Flora of Manila'' covering some 1,000 species. In 1921 he completed a ''Bibliographic Enumeration of Bornean Plants'', a volume of 637 pages. His most ambitious work was the ''Enumeration of Philippine Flowering Plants'' published in sections between 1923 and 1926. As documented by his ''Enumeration'' the list of known Philippine species had been extended from 2,500 plants of all types in 1900 to 8,120 species of flowering plants, 1,000 species of ferns, and 3,000 species of [[cryptogams]].<ref name=\"Hay\"/>\n\n==University of California, Berkeley==\nIn 1924 Merrill returned to the United States to join the University of California, Berkeley. There he was appointed Dean of the College of Agriculture and Director of the Agricultural Experiment Station. At Berkeley he led a reorganization of the faculty, revised the  curriculum, emphasized academic training of staff, added buildings and equipment, and stressed fundamental research. In 1925, Merrill established the journal ''Hilgardia'', named for [[Eugene W. Hilgard]] who organized the Agriculture Department and was the founding director of the Agricultural Experiment Station. During his spare time, Merrill continued to work on systematic botany of the Asia-Pacific flora and added more than  100,000 specimens from that region to the University herbarium.<ref name=\"Robbins\"/>\n\nIn 1926 a proposal was developed to establish the California Botanic Garden in Los Angeles. Merrill took part-time leave from the College to become director of the Garden Foundation.{{sfn|Masters|2012}} The plan involved the purchase of {{convert|4500|acre}} at [[Mandeville Canyon, Los Angeles|Mandeville Canyon]] in the Santa Monica Mountains. About 800 acres in the center of the tract were to be developed as a botanical garden financed by the sale of surrounding property for residential homes. During his short tenure as director Merrill built administrative offices and greenhouses, started a library, established an herbarium of 180,000 specimens and planted 1,200 species in the gardens. Unfortunately, not long after Merrill left, the plans collapsed when property prices plummeted as a result of the Great Depression. The herbarium was transferred to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and the gardens were subdivided and sold for housing.<ref name=\"Arnold\"/><ref name=\"Robbins\"/>\n\n==New York Botanic Garden==\nIn 1929 Merrill accepted dual appointments as Director of the [[New York Botanic Garden]] and Professor of Botany at [[Columbia University]]. He started his new job at the onset of the Great Depression and the Garden was facing severe financial constraints. Despite these difficulties, he was able to continue many of the programs by taking advantage of personnel provided by the [[Works Progress Administration]]. Up to 300 personnel were employed building walks, roads, fences and other infrastructure in the gardens; or they worked in the herbarium as mounters, artists, secretaries, librarians, clerks and technicians.<ref name=\"NYBG\">Archives of the New York Botanical Garden</ref>\n\nThe herbarium collection was completely rearranged, operations were improved, and specimens inventoried for the first time.

It was the fastest conventional aircraft of [[World War II]]&nbsp;\u2013 although there were faster aircraft propelled by unconventional means, such as the rocket-powered [[Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet]]. The [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] had first flown on April 18, 1941, with initial plans drawn up by Dr Waldemar Voigt's design team in April 1939, but mass production did not start until early 1944 with the first squadrons operational that year, too late for a decisive effect on the outcome of the war.\n\n[[File:Gloster Meteor III ExCC.jpg|thumb|right|Gloster Meteor F.3s. The [[Gloster Meteor]] was the first British jet fighter and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies']] only jet aircraft to achieve combat operations during World War II.]]\n\nAround this time, mid 1944, the United Kingdom's [[Gloster Meteor]] was being committed to defence of the UK against the [[V-1 flying bomb]]&nbsp;\u2013 itself a [[pulsejet]]-powered aircraft&nbsp;and direct ancestor of the [[cruise missile]]\u2013 and then ground-attack operations over Europe in the last months of the war. In 1944 Germany introduced into service the [[Arado Ar 234]] jet reconnaissance and bomber, though chiefly used in the former role, with the [[Heinkel He 162]] ''Spatz'' single-jet [[light fighter]]  premiering as 1944 ended. USSR tested its own [[Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1]] in 1942, but the project was scrapped by [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1945. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] also developed jet aircraft in 1945, including the [[Nakajima Kikka|Nakajima J9Y Kikka]], a modified, and slightly smaller version of the Me 262 that had folding wings. By the end of 1945, the US had introduced their first jet fighter, the [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]] into service and the UK its second fighter design, the [[de Havilland Vampire]].\n\n[[File:Lufthansa B737-330 (D-ABXS) approaching London Heathrow Airport.jpg|thumb|left|The Boeing 737-300, part of the [[Boeing 737]] family is the most produced jet aircraft that is still operating.]]\n\nThe US introduced the [[North American B-45 Tornado]], their first jet bomber, into service in 1948. Although capable of carrying nuclear weapons it was used for reconnaissance over Korea. On November 8, 1950, during the [[Korean War]], [[United States Air Force]] Lt. Russell J. Brown, flying in an [[P-80 Shooting Star|F-80]], intercepted two [[North Korea]]n [[MiG-15]]s near the [[Yalu River]] and shot them down in the first jet-to-jet [[dogfight]] in history. The UK put the [[English Electric Canberra]] into service in 1951 as a [[light bomber]]. It was designed to fly higher and faster than any [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]].\n\n[[File:BOAC Comet 1952 Entebbe.jpg|thumb|[[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] Comet 1 was the first passenger jet airliner]]\n[[File:Boeing 707-138B Qantas Jett Clipper Ella N707JT.jpg|thumb|Boeing 707]]\n\n[[BOAC]] operated the first commercial jet service, from [[London]] to [[Johannesburg]], in 1952 with the [[de Havilland Comet]] [[jet airliner|jetliner]]. This highly innovative aircraft travelled far faster and higher than the propeller aircraft, was much quieter, smoother, and had stylish blended wings containing hidden jet engines. However, due to a design defect, and use of aluminium alloys, the aircraft suffered catastrophic [[metal fatigue]] which led to several crashes.<ref name=\"ruled\">Jet! When Britain Ruled the Skies - BBC</ref>\n\nThe series of crashes gave time for the [[Boeing 707]] to enter service in 1958 and this came to dominate the market for civilian airliners. The underslung engines were found to be advantageous in the event of a propellant leak, and so the 707 looked rather different from the Comet: the 707 has a shape that is effectively the same as that of contemporary aircraft, with marked commonality still evident today for example with the [[Boeing 737|737]] (fuselage) and [[Airbus A340|A340]] (single deck, swept wing, four below-wing engines).\n\n[[Turbofan]] aircraft began entering service in the 1950s and 1960s, bringing far greater [[fuel efficiency]], and this is the type of jet in widespread use today.\n[[File:Tu-144LL_in_flight.jpg|thumb|[[Tu-144]],  the world's first commercial [[supersonic transport]] aircraft (SST) ]]\n\nThe [[Tu-144]] [[supersonic transport]] was the fastest commercial jet plane at Mach 2.35 (1,555&nbsp;mph, 2,503&nbsp;km/h). It went into service in 1975, but soon stopped flying. The Mach 2 [[Concorde]] aircraft entered service in 1976 and flew for 27 years.\n\nThe fastest military jet plane was the [[SR-71 Blackbird]] at Mach 3.35 (2,275&nbsp;mph, 3,661&nbsp;km/h).\n\n==Other jets==\nMost people use the term 'jet aircraft' to denote gas turbine based [[airbreathing jet engine]]s, but rockets and scramjets are both also propelled by jet propulsion.\n\n[[Cruise missile]]s are single-use unmanned jet aircraft, powered predominately by ramjets or turbojets or sometimes turbofans, but they will often have a rocket propulsion system for initial propulsion.\n\nThe fastest airbreathing jet aircraft is the unmanned [[NASA X-43|X-43]] scramjet at around Mach 9\u201310.\n\nThe fastest manned (rocket) aircraft is the [[X-15]] at Mach 6.85.\n\nThe [[Space Shuttle]], while far faster than the X-43 or X-15, was not regarded as an aircraft during ascent as it was carried [[ballistics|ballistically]] by rocket thrust, rather than the air. During re-entry it was classed (like a glider) as an unpowered aircraft. The first flight was in 1981.\n\nThe [[Bell 533]] (1964), [[Lockheed XH-51]] (1965), and [[Sikorsky S-69]] (1977-1981) are examples of [[compound helicopter]] designs where jet exhaust added to forward thrust.<ref name=ieee>{{cite web|url= https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/the-fastest-helicopter-on-earth |title=The Fastest Helicopter on Earth |authors=Thomas Lawrence and David Jenney|publisher=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |date=31 Aug 2010|accessdate=1 August 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170130223834/https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/the-fastest-helicopter-on-earth |archivedate=30 January 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Hiller YH-32 Hornet]] and [[Fairey Ultra-light Helicopter]] were among the many helicopters where the rotors were driven by [[tip jet]]s.\n\nJet-powered [[Wingsuit flying|wingsuits]] exist - powered by model aircraft jet engines - but of short duration and needing to be launched at height.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/07/how-to-fly-like-jetman/|title=\u2018Jetman\u2019 Yves Rossy Shows Us How to Fly His Carbon Fiber Jet Wing|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=31 July 2013 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170102151845/https://www.wired.com/2013/07/how-to-fly-like-jetman/ |archivedate=2 January 2017 |url-status= live  }}</ref>\n\n==Aerodynamics==\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30(ER), Biman Bangladesh AN0547320.jpg|thumb|A [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], an example of a [[Trijet]] configuration]]\nBecause of the way they work, the typical exhaust speed of jet engines is transonic or faster, therefore most jet aircraft need to fly at high speeds, either [[supersonic]] or speeds just below the speed of sound (\"[[transonic]]\") so as to achieve efficient flight. Aerodynamics is therefore an important consideration.\n\nJet aircraft are usually designed using the [[Whitcomb area rule]], which says that the total area of cross-section of the aircraft at any point along the aircraft from the nose must be approximately the same as that of a [[Sears-Haack body]]. A shape with that property minimises the production of shockwaves which would waste energy.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Jet engines==\n{{Main|Jet engine}}\n\nJet engines come in several main types:\n*[[turbojet]]\n*[[turbofan]] (which come in two main forms [[low bypass turbofan]] and [[high bypass turbofan]])\n*[[rocket]]\n\nThe different types are used for different purposes.\n\nRockets are the oldest type and are mainly used when extremely high speeds or extremely high altitudes are needed. Due to the extreme, typically [[hypersonic]], exhaust velocity and the necessity of oxidiser being carried on board, they consume propellant extremely quickly. For this reason, they are not practical for routine transportation.\n\nTurbojets are the second oldest type; it has a high, usually supersonic, exhaust speed and low frontal cross-section, and so is best suited to high-speed, usually supersonic, flight. Although once widely used, they are relatively inefficient compared to [[turboprop]] and turbofans for subsonic flight. The last major aircraft to use turbojets were Concorde and Tu-144 [[supersonic transport]]s.\n\nLow bypass turbofans have a lower exhaust speed than turbojets and are mostly used for high sonic, transonic, and low supersonic speeds. High bypass turbofans are used for subsonic aircraft and are quite efficient and are widely used for airliners.\n\n==Flying characteristics==\nJet aircraft fly considerably differently to propeller aircraft.\n\nOne difference is that jet engines respond relatively slowly. This complicates takeoff and landing maneuvers.\nIn particular, during takeoff, propeller aircraft engines blow air over their wings and that gives more lift and a shorter takeoff. These differences caught out some early BOAC Comet pilots.<ref name=ruled/>\n\n==Propulsive efficiency==\n{{main|Propulsive efficiency}}\nIn aircraft ''overall propulsive efficiency'' <math>\\eta</math> is the efficiency, in percent, with which the energy contained in a vehicle's propellant is converted into useful energy, to replace losses due to [[air drag]], gravity, and acceleration. It can also be stated as the proportion of the mechanical energy actually used to propel the aircraft. It is always less than 100% because of kinetic energy loss to the exhaust, and less-than-ideal efficiency of the propulsive mechanism, whether a [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]], a jet exhaust, or a fan. In addition, propulsive efficiency is greatly dependent on [[air density]] and airspeed.\n\nMathematically, it is represented as <math>\\eta = \\eta_c \\eta_p</math><ref>[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm ch10-3<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914184628/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm |date=2010-09-14 }}</ref> where <math>\\eta_c</math> is the [[cycle efficiency]] and <math>\\eta_p</math> is the propulsive efficiency. The cycle efficiency, in percent, is the proportion of energy that can be derived from the energy source that is converted to mechanical energy by the [[engine]].\n\n[[File:Propulsive efficiency.png|thumb|right|Dependence of the propulsive efficiency (<math>\\eta_p</math>) upon the vehicle speed/exhaust speed ratio (v/c) for rocket and jet engines]]\n\nFor jet aircraft the ''propulsive efficiency'' (essentially [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]]) is highest when the engine emits an exhaust jet at a speed that is the same as, or nearly the same as, the vehicle velocity.

It was the fastest conventional aircraft of [[World War II]]&nbsp;\u2013 although there were faster aircraft propelled by unconventional means, such as the rocket-powered [[Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet]]. The [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] had first flown on April 18, 1941, with initial plans drawn up by Dr Waldemar Voigt's design team in April 1939, but mass production did not start until early 1944 with the first squadrons operational that year, too late for a decisive effect on the outcome of the war.\n\n[[File:Gloster Meteor III ExCC.jpg|thumb|right|Gloster Meteor F.3s. The [[Gloster Meteor]] was the first British jet fighter and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies']] only jet aircraft to achieve combat operations during World War II.]]\n\nAround this time, mid 1944, the United Kingdom's [[Gloster Meteor]] was being committed to defence of the UK against the [[V-1 flying bomb]]&nbsp;\u2013 itself a [[pulsejet]]-powered aircraft&nbsp;and direct ancestor of the [[cruise missile]]\u2013 and then ground-attack operations over Europe in the last months of the war. In 1944 Germany introduced into service the [[Arado Ar 234]] jet reconnaissance and bomber, though chiefly used in the former role, with the [[Heinkel He 162]] ''Spatz'' single-jet [[light fighter]]  premiering as 1944 ended. USSR tested its own [[Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1]] in 1942, but the project was scrapped by [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1945. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] also developed jet aircraft in 1945, including the [[Nakajima Kikka|Nakajima J9Y Kikka]], a modified, and slightly smaller version of the Me 262 that had folding wings. By the end of 1945, the US had introduced their first jet fighter, the [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]] into service and the UK its second fighter design, the [[de Havilland Vampire]].\n\n[[File:Lufthansa B737-330 (D-ABXS) approaching London Heathrow Airport.jpg|thumb|left|The Boeing 737-300, part of the [[Boeing 737]] family is the most produced jet aircraft that is still operating.]]\n\nThe US introduced the [[North American B-45 Tornado]], their first jet bomber, into service in 1948. Although capable of carrying nuclear weapons it was used for reconnaissance over Korea. On November 8, 1950, during the [[Korean War]], [[United States Air Force]] Lt. Russell J. Brown, flying in an [[P-80 Shooting Star|F-80]], intercepted two [[North Korea]]n [[MiG-15]]s near the [[Yalu River]] and shot them down in the first jet-to-jet [[dogfight]] in history. The UK put the [[English Electric Canberra]] into service in 1951 as a [[light bomber]]. It was designed to fly higher and faster than any [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]].\n\n[[File:BOAC Comet 1952 Entebbe.jpg|thumb|[[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] Comet 1 was the first passenger jet airliner]]\n[[File:Boeing 707-138B Qantas Jett Clipper Ella N707JT.jpg|thumb|Boeing 707]]\n\n[[BOAC]] operated the first commercial jet service, from [[London]] to [[Johannesburg]], in 1952 with the [[de Havilland Comet]] [[jet airliner|jetliner]]. This highly innovative aircraft travelled far faster and higher than the propeller aircraft, was much quieter, smoother, and had stylish blended wings containing hidden jet engines. However, due to a design defect, and use of aluminium alloys, the aircraft suffered catastrophic [[metal fatigue]] which led to several crashes.<ref name=\"ruled\">Jet! When Britain Ruled the Skies - BBC</ref>\n\nThe series of crashes gave time for the [[Boeing 707]] to enter service in 1958 and this came to dominate the market for civilian airliners. The underslung engines were found to be advantageous in the event of a propellant leak, and so the 707 looked rather different from the Comet: the 707 has a shape that is effectively the same as that of contemporary aircraft, with marked commonality still evident today for example with the [[Boeing 737|737]] (fuselage) and [[Airbus A340|A340]] (single deck, swept wing, four below-wing engines).\n\n[[Turbofan]] aircraft began entering service in the 1950s and 1960s, bringing far greater [[fuel efficiency]], and this is the type of jet in widespread use today.\n[[File:Tu-144LL_in_flight.jpg|thumb|[[Tu-144]],  the world's first commercial [[supersonic transport]] aircraft (SST) ]]\n\nThe [[Tu-144]] [[supersonic transport]] was the fastest commercial jet plane at Mach 2.35 (1,555&nbsp;mph, 2,503&nbsp;km/h). It went into service in 1975, but soon stopped flying. The Mach 2 [[Concorde]] aircraft entered service in 1976 and flew for 27 years.\n\nThe fastest military jet plane was the [[SR-71 Blackbird]] at Mach 3.35 (2,275&nbsp;mph, 3,661&nbsp;km/h).\n\n==Other jets==\nMost people use the term 'jet aircraft' to denote gas turbine based [[airbreathing jet engine]]s, but rockets and scramjets are both also propelled by jet propulsion.\n\n[[Cruise missile]]s are single-use unmanned jet aircraft, powered predominately by ramjets or turbojets or sometimes turbofans, but they will often have a rocket propulsion system for initial propulsion.\n\nThe fastest airbreathing jet aircraft is the unmanned [[NASA X-43|X-43]] scramjet at around Mach 9\u201310.\n\nThe fastest manned (rocket) aircraft is the [[X-15]] at Mach 6.85.\n\nThe [[Space Shuttle]], while far faster than the X-43 or X-15, was not regarded as an aircraft during ascent as it was carried [[ballistics|ballistically]] by rocket thrust, rather than the air. During re-entry it was classed (like a glider) as an unpowered aircraft. The first flight was in 1981.\n\nThe [[Bell 533]] (1964), [[Lockheed XH-51]] (1965), and [[Sikorsky S-69]] (1977-1981) are examples of [[compound helicopter]] designs where jet exhaust added to forward thrust.<ref name=ieee>{{cite web|url= https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/the-fastest-helicopter-on-earth |title=The Fastest Helicopter on Earth |authors=Thomas Lawrence and David Jenney|publisher=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |date=31 Aug 2010|accessdate=1 August 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170130223834/https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/the-fastest-helicopter-on-earth |archivedate=30 January 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Hiller YH-32 Hornet]] and [[Fairey Ultra-light Helicopter]] were among the many helicopters where the rotors were driven by [[tip jet]]s.\n\nJet-powered [[Wingsuit flying|wingsuits]] exist - powered by model aircraft jet engines - but of short duration and needing to be launched at height.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/07/how-to-fly-like-jetman/|title=\u2018Jetman\u2019 Yves Rossy Shows Us How to Fly His Carbon Fiber Jet Wing|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=31 July 2013 |accessdate=1 August 2017 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170102151845/https://www.wired.com/2013/07/how-to-fly-like-jetman/ |archivedate=2 January 2017 |url-status= live  }}</ref>\n\n==Aerodynamics==\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30(ER), Biman Bangladesh AN0547320.jpg|thumb|A [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], an example of a [[Trijet]] configuration]]\nBecause of the way they work, the typical exhaust speed of jet engines is transonic or faster, therefore most jet aircraft need to fly at high speeds, either [[supersonic]] or speeds just below the speed of sound (\"[[transonic]]\") so as to achieve efficient flight. Aerodynamics is therefore an important consideration.\n\nJet aircraft are usually designed using the [[Whitcomb area rule]], which says that the total area of cross-section of the aircraft at any point along the aircraft from the nose must be approximately the same as that of a [[Sears-Haack body]]. A shape with that property minimises the production of shockwaves which would waste energy.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Jet engines==\n{{Main|Jet engine}}\n\nJet engines come in several main types:\n*[[turbojet]]\n*[[turbofan]] (which come in two main forms [[low bypass turbofan]] and [[high bypass turbofan]])\n*[[rocket]]\n\nThe different types are used for different purposes.\n\nRockets are the oldest type and are mainly used when extremely high speeds or extremely high altitudes are needed. Due to the extreme, typically [[hypersonic]], exhaust velocity and the necessity of oxidiser being carried on board, they consume propellant extremely quickly. For this reason, they are not practical for routine transportation.\n\nTurbojets are the second oldest type; it has a high, usually supersonic, exhaust speed and low frontal cross-section, and so is best suited to high-speed, usually supersonic, flight. Although once widely used, they are relatively inefficient compared to [[turboprop]] and turbofans for subsonic flight. The last major aircraft to use turbojets were Concorde and Tu-144 [[supersonic transport]]s.\n\nLow bypass turbofans have a lower exhaust speed than turbojets and are mostly used for high sonic, transonic, and low supersonic speeds. High bypass turbofans are used for subsonic aircraft and are quite efficient and are widely used for airliners.\n\n==Flying characteristics==\nJet aircraft fly considerably differently to propeller aircraft.\n\nOne difference is that jet engines respond relatively slowly. This complicates takeoff and landing maneuvers.\nIn particular, during takeoff, propeller aircraft engines blow air over their wings and that gives more lift and a shorter takeoff. These differences caught out some early BOAC Comet pilots.<ref name=ruled/>\n\n==Propulsive efficiency==\n{{main|Propulsive efficiency}}\nIn aircraft ''overall propulsive efficiency'' <math>\\eta</math> is the efficiency, in percent, with which the energy contained in a vehicle's propellant is converted into useful energy, to replace losses due to [[air drag]], gravity, and acceleration. It can also be stated as the proportion of the mechanical energy actually used to propel the aircraft. It is always less than 100% because of kinetic energy loss to the exhaust, and less-than-ideal efficiency of the propulsive mechanism, whether a [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]], a jet exhaust, or a fan. In addition, propulsive efficiency is greatly dependent on [[air density]] and airspeed.\n\nMathematically, it is represented as <math>\\eta = \\eta_c \\eta_p</math><ref>[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm ch10-3<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914184628/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-468/ch10-3.htm |date=2010-09-14 }}</ref> where <math>\\eta_c</math> is the [[cycle efficiency]] and <math>\\eta_p</math> is the propulsive efficiency. The cycle efficiency, in percent, is the proportion of energy that can be derived from the energy source that is converted to mechanical energy by the [[engine]].\n\n[[File:Propulsive efficiency.png|thumb|right|Dependence of the propulsive efficiency (<math>\\eta_p</math>) upon the vehicle speed/exhaust speed ratio (v/c) for rocket and jet engines]]\n\nFor jet aircraft the ''propulsive efficiency'' (essentially [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]]) is highest when the engine emits an exhaust jet at a speed that is the same as, or nearly the same as, the vehicle velocity.
