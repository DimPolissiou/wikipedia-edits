Please see the talk page for discussion.-->American [[comedy-drama]] television series created and primarily written by [[Aaron Sorkin]]. The series was about the production of a live comedy series, similar to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'' ran on [[NBC]] for 22 episodes, from September 18, 2006 to June 28, 2007. On May 14, 2007, NBC cancelled the series after one season. It is the only one of the [[Aaron Sorkin#Television 2|four television shows created]] by Sorkin not to air for more than one season.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series takes place behind the scenes of a live sketch comedy show (also called ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'' or ''Studio 60'') on the fictional television network NBS (National Broadcasting System), whose format is similar to that of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. National Broadcasting System is owned by the TMG Corporation. The [[Story within a story|show-within-a-show]] is run by executive producers [[Matt Albie]] ([[Matthew Perry]]) and [[Danny Tripp]] ([[Bradley Whitford]]). Matt serves as the [[head writer]] and Danny produces the show.\n\n==Cast and crew==\n{{see also|List of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip characters}}\n''Studio 60'' features an [[ensemble cast]] portraying the personnel involved in the production of a late-night comedy show.\n\n===Major roles===\n* [[Danny Tripp]] ([[Bradley Whitford]]) is a former segment producer for ''Studio 60'' who is asked to return as director/executive producer when executive producer Wes Mendell is fired.

She is also Matt Albie's ex-girlfriend. She also dated Luke Scott, a former writer (and Matt's rival) at ''Studio 60'', now a big-time director. The character of Harriet is partially based on [[Kristin Chenoweth]], whom Sorkin previously dated before she worked on ''[[The West Wing]]''.<ref>Chenoweth, Kristin. ''A Little Bit Wicked: Life, Love, and Faith in Stages'', page 201. Touchstone, 2009.</ref>\n* [[Tom Jeter]] ([[Nate Corddry]]) is another of the show's \"Big Three.\" He is from the Midwest, and his brother is serving as an airman in the US Air Force who is deployed in Afghanistan. During the course of the show, he begins dating Lucy Kenwright, one of the staff writers.\n* [[Simon Stiles]] ([[D. L. Hughley]]) is the final member of the \"Big Three.\" An alumnus of the Yale School of Drama, his original intention was to become a dramatic actor, rather than a comedian.\n* [[Jack Rudolph (character)|Jack Rudolph]] ([[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]]) is the chairman of the National Broadcasting System, and Jordan's boss.

Lucy and Darius were supposed to get their first sketch on the air in \"B-12\". The sketch was about a bungling hostage taker, but was cancelled when a real-life hostage-taker killed his entire family and then himself just after that evening's show started. During the course of the show, Lucy begins dating Tom Jeter.\n* [[Darius Hawthorne]] ([[Columbus Short]]) is Matt's assistant writer. Matt and Simon hired Darius after seeing his stand-up act in \"The Wrap Party\". During \"The Harriet Dinner\" he argues with Simon because Darius passed a sketch, pitched by Simon, to Lucy.\n* [[Andy Mackinaw]] ([[Mark McKinney]]) was introduced in \"B-12\" after Ricky and Ron's departure when Matt needed an extra writer's help.

Andy is very serious and has only been seen smiling once.\n* Suzanne ([[Merritt Wever]]) is a former production assistant on the show who becomes Matt's assistant in the episode \"B-12\". She confronts Matt about his drug use in the episode \"Breaking News\".\n* Hallie Galloway (Stephanie Childers) is the vice-president of alternative programming (a.k.a. reality TV) for NBS and has developed an adversarial relationship with Jordan. She first appeared in the episode \"Monday\". McDeere has expressed her fear that Galloway is being groomed to take her place after the rocky start to McDeere's tenure as president of the network.\n* Mary Tate ([[Kari Matchett]]) is a lawyer from [[List of fictional law firms|law firm]] Gage Whitney Pace who is hired by NBS and has a sexual interest in Matt. Between \"Breaking News\" and \"What Kind of Day Has It Been\", Mary is used as a second option to get Tom's brother out of the hostage situation.\n* Shelly Green ([[Wendy Phillips]]) is head of publicity for NBS.\n\n===Guest appearances===\n* Wes Mendell ([[Judd Hirsch]]) is the creator of ''Studio 60'' who is fired by Jack Rudolph after going on a long on-air rant against the current state of television. Although he appeared only in the pilot, Wes has been referred to as a big influence on Matt and Danny.\n* Lenny Gold ([[Fred Stoller]]) is a comedian in \"West Coast Delay\" from whom a ''Studio 60'' staff writer may have stolen material.\n* Martha O'Dell ([[Christine Lahti]]) is a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning journalist working on a story for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' about the new leadership of ''Studio 60''. In \"The West Coast Delay\" and \"The Long Lead Story\" she ends up easily uncovering almost every detail of the cast and crew's personal lives. Martha's character is based on the columnist [[Maureen Dowd]], who once dated Sorkin.<ref name=\"EW-Infectious\">{{cite magazine |title=Infectious Laughter |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/commentary/0,6115,1563534_3_0_,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829221816/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/commentary/0,6115,1563534_3_0_,00.html |archive-date=2008-08-29 |last=Susman |first=Gary |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=2007-04-28 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Kim Tao ([[Julia Ling]]) guest starred in five episodes (\"Nevada Day Part 1,\" \"Nevada Day Part 2,\" \"Monday,\" \"Harriet Dinner Part 1,\" \"Harriet Dinner Part 2\") as the viola prodigy who speaks five languages.

Cast member [[Mark McKinney]] wrote an episode of ''Sports Night''. The character ''Andy Mackinaw'' (played by [[Mark McKinney]], 10 episodes) is loosely based on the real life Studio 60 writer [[T. Rafael Cimino]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485842/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip|date=September 18, 2006|publisher=|accessdate=April 8, 2017|via=IMDb}}</ref> whose work appeared in 19 episodes.

The duo determine that they could raise extra money by remaking the stage as a form of product placement. This mirrors the real-world struggle of the show and its constant attempts to reduce the budget of the show and also generate more money. The new stage and its advertisements would have generated money for Studio 60, the fictional show, as well as the real life Studio 60 program.

Please see the talk page for discussion.-->American [[comedy-drama]] television series created and primarily written by [[Aaron Sorkin]]. The series was about the production of a live comedy series, similar to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'' ran on [[NBC]] for 22 episodes, from September 18, 2006 to June 28, 2007. On May 14, 2007, NBC cancelled the series after one season. It is the only one of the [[Aaron Sorkin#Television 2|four television shows created]] by Sorkin not to air for more than one season.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series takes place behind the scenes of a live sketch comedy show (also called ''Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip'' or ''Studio 60'') on the fictional television network NBS (National Broadcasting System), whose format is similar to that of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. National Broadcasting System is owned by the TMG Corporation. The [[Story within a story|show-within-a-show]] is run by executive producers [[Matt Albie]] ([[Matthew Perry]]) and [[Danny Tripp]] ([[Bradley Whitford]]). Matt serves as the [[head writer]] and Danny produces the show.\n\n==Cast and crew==\n{{see also|List of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip characters}}\n''Studio 60'' features an [[ensemble cast]] portraying the personnel involved in the production of a late-night comedy show.\n\n===Major roles===\n* [[Danny Tripp]] ([[Bradley Whitford]]) is a former segment producer for ''Studio 60'' who is asked to return as director/executive producer when executive producer Wes Mendell is fired.

She is also Matt Albie's ex-girlfriend. She also dated Luke Scott, a former writer (and Matt's rival) at ''Studio 60'', now a big-time director. The character of Harriet is partially based on [[Kristin Chenoweth]], whom Sorkin previously dated before she worked on ''[[The West Wing]]''.<ref>Chenoweth, Kristin.

Touchstone, 2009.</ref>\n* [[Tom Jeter]] ([[Nate Corddry]]) is another of the show's \"Big Three.\" He is from the Midwest, and his brother is serving as an airman in the US Air Force who is deployed in Afghanistan.

During the course of the show, Lucy begins dating Tom Jeter.\n* [[Darius Hawthorne]] ([[Columbus Short]]) is Matt's assistant writer.

In \"The West Coast Delay\" and \"The Long Lead Story\" she ends up easily uncovering almost every detail of the cast and crew's personal lives. Martha's character is based on the columnist [[Maureen Dowd]], who once dated Sorkin.<ref name=\"EW-Infectious\">{{cite magazine |title=Infectious Laughter |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/commentary/0,6115,1563534_3_0_,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829221816/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/commentary/0,6115,1563534_3_0_,00.html |archive-date=2008-08-29 |last=Susman |first=Gary |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=2007-04-28 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Kim Tao ([[Julia Ling]]) guest starred in five episodes (\"Nevada Day Part 1,\" \"Nevada Day Part 2,\" \"Monday,\" \"Harriet Dinner Part 1,\" \"Harriet Dinner Part 2\") as the viola prodigy who speaks five languages.

The duo determine that they could raise extra money by remaking the stage as a form of product placement. This mirrors the real-world struggle of the show and its constant attempts to reduce the budget of the show and also generate more money.

He uses rather unorthodox methods to get inside the patient's head to help cure them; however, this usually gains him spite from his fellow doctors. He enjoys riding his bike and has a mentally unstable sister whom he is trying to find, and has been for four years. At the end of the episode entitled, Do Over, he finds Becky and she is put into the hospital with schizophrenia. Jack's mother and stepfather come and try to convince him to let them take Becky to Florida for treatment. Jack is skeptical, but Becky decides to leave with her parents. In the season finale, Jack is seen talking to an anonymous therapist (who turns out to be himself), and admits that he has an irrational fear of developing schizophrenia, which is why he is afraid of commitment. It is also revealed that he, most likely, is dealing with clinical depression at this point. In the final scene, he punches Carl, and is subsequently fired. Jack then leaves and the season, as well as the series, ends.  The last shot of the series shows us Dr. Gallagher now \"vagrant\" and without direction, in opposition to his recently vagrant sister, who has chosen to return home with her family.  The season ends in direct opposition to the season opening\u2014an extremely ironic ending.\n\n; Nora Skoff ([[Annabella Sciorra]])\n: She is a hospital administrator who shares a romantic past with Dr. Gallagher. Nora has a distinctive and conservative style. She successfully battled cancer and is divorced with two daughters.\n\n; Dr. Carl Belle (Derek Webster)\n: Dr. Belle is a master politician who is dedicated to Jack's downfall, even secretly black-mailing Arturo to spy on Jack.\n\n; Dr. Veronica Hayden-Jones ([[Jacqueline McKenzie]])\n: Dr. Hayden-Jones is a dedicated psychiatrist who is upset that she wasn't given Jack's job. She is married to a musician, but was cheating on him with one of the doctors in the hospital.  This doctor has subsequently resigned.\n\n; Dr. Chlo\u00eb Artis ([[Marisa Ramirez]])\n: Dr. Artis is a gorgeous doctor who is passing the time in a residency she feels is beneath her until Jack opens her mind to the inspirational benefits of psychiatry. She is frequently pursued by Arturo before she reveals to him that she is a lesbian.\n\n; Dr. Arturo Suarez ([[Nicholas Gonzalez]])\n: Dr. Suarez is a first-year resident. He is young and cocky, constantly looking for love (or sex), and won't seem to give up on Chloe, even knowing her sexual orientation. Arturo falsified his transcripts so that he could become a doctor and that information is being held against him by Carl, who is blackmailing Arturo into spying on Jack.\n\n=== Recurring cast ===\n\n;Margo Stroud ([[Samantha Eggar]])\n:Jack and Becky's mother, whose first husband and the father of her children, died. She is now living in Florida and is married to James.\n\n;James Stroud (Madison Mason)\n:Jack and Becky's step-father and Margo's second husband. James is a retired Navy Vice Admiral - Jack even bitterly states that James raised them as though they were soldiers. Jack holds a grudge on James for sticking Becky in the first institution he could find, twenty years ago, when Becky was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He is American.\n\n;Becky Gallagher ([[Amanda Douge]])\n:Becky is Jack's twin sister, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia twenty years ago. She has been missing for four years, and showed up on Jack's doorstep near the end of the first season. Jack is very protective over her and they both share a strong loving bond. She is frequently haunted by hallucinations of a young man named Gabe.\n\n=== Special guests ===\n\nThe series features performances by actors from the United States or other countries who have traveled to [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Colombia]], to film the episode where they have their respective appearance in the next table special performances that stand out:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

He uses rather unorthodox methods to get inside the patient's head to help cure them; however, this usually gains him spite from his fellow doctors. He enjoys riding his bike and has a mentally unstable sister whom he is trying to find, and has been for four years. At the end of the episode entitled, Do Over, he finds Becky and she is put into the hospital with schizophrenia. Jack's mother and stepfather come and try to convince him to let them take Becky to Florida for treatment. Jack is skeptical, but Becky decides to leave with her parents. In the season finale, Jack is seen talking to an anonymous therapist (who turns out to be himself), and admits that he has an irrational fear of developing schizophrenia, which is why he is afraid of commitment. It is also revealed that he, most likely, is dealing with clinical depression at this point. In the final scene, he punches Carl, and is subsequently fired. Jack then leaves and the season, as well as the series, ends.  The last shot of the series shows us Dr. Gallagher now \"vagrant\" and without direction, in opposition to his recently vagrant sister, who has chosen to return home with her family.  The season ends in direct opposition to the season opening\u2014an extremely ironic ending.\n\n; Nora Skoff ([[Annabella Sciorra]])\n: She is a hospital administrator who shares a romantic past with Dr. Gallagher. Nora has a distinctive and conservative style. She successfully battled cancer and is divorced with two daughters.\n\n; Dr. Carl Belle (Derek Webster)\n: Dr. Belle is a master politician who is dedicated to Jack's downfall, even secretly black-mailing Arturo to spy on Jack.\n\n; Dr. Veronica Hayden-Jones ([[Jacqueline McKenzie]])\n: Dr. Hayden-Jones is a dedicated psychiatrist who is upset that she wasn't given Jack's job. She is married to a musician, but was cheating on him with one of the doctors in the hospital.  This doctor has subsequently resigned.\n\n; Dr. Chlo\u00eb Artis ([[Marisa Ramirez]])\n: Dr. Artis is a gorgeous doctor who is passing the time in a residency she feels is beneath her until Jack opens her mind to the inspirational benefits of psychiatry. She is frequently pursued by Arturo before she reveals to him that she is a lesbian.\n\n; Dr. Arturo Suarez ([[Nicholas Gonzalez]])\n: Dr. Suarez is a first-year resident. He is young and cocky, constantly looking for love (or sex), and won't seem to give up on Chloe, even knowing her sexual orientation. Arturo falsified his transcripts so that he could become a doctor and that information is being held against him by Carl, who is blackmailing Arturo into spying on Jack.\n\n=== Recurring cast ===\n\n;Margo Stroud ([[Samantha Eggar]])\n:Jack and Becky's mother, whose first husband and the father of her children, died. She is now living in Florida and is married to James.\n\n;James Stroud (Madison Mason)\n:Jack and Becky's step-father and Margo's second husband. James is a retired Navy Vice Admiral - Jack even bitterly states that James raised them as though they were soldiers. Jack holds a grudge on James for sticking Becky in the first institution he could find, twenty years ago, when Becky was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He is American.\n\n;Becky Gallagher ([[Amanda Douge]])\n:Becky is Jack's twin sister, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia twenty years ago. She has been missing for four years, and showed up on Jack's doorstep near the end of the first season. Jack is very protective over her and they both share a strong loving bond. She is frequently haunted by hallucinations of a young man named Gabe.\n\n=== Special guests ===\n\nThe series features performances by actors from the United States or other countries who have traveled to [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Colombia]], to film the episode where they have their respective appearance in the next table special performances that stand out:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

In the [[Judiciary of Belgium|Belgian criminal justice system]], an assize court is a non-permanent court that holds [[jury trial]]s on the most serious crimes. A few weeks before the actual start of the trial, a [[preliminary hearing]] took place on 20 December 2018, during which the list of [[witness]]es to be heard in the case was decided on. The [[defence attorney]]s of Nemmouche as well as Nemmouche himself opposed having his family members testify during the trial. According to Nemmouche's defence, this was because \"Mr Nemmouche did not want to argue on emotion, but on the facts\". His defence also requested to [[Adjournment|adjourn]] the case for two weeks, in order to give them the opportunity to study the case more in-depth. The adjournment of the case was rejected by the court, however. It was also decided that about 120 witnesses in total would be heard in the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|title=Geen uitstel voor proces Nemmouche over aanslag Joods museum, bijna 120 getuigen worden opgeroepen|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|date=20 December 2018|website=www.vrt.be|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=No delay for trial Nemmouche about attack on Jewish museum, almost 120 witnesses will be summoned|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221215344/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|archive-date=21 December 2018|url-status=|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 2019, three days before the start of the actual trial, the jurors on the assize jury were selected.

A significant number of them asked to be exempt from [[jury duty]] for various reasons.

In the reasoning the jury gave for its [[verdict]], required by Belgian law, the main evidence against Nemmouche was summed up. The evidence against Nemmouche included the fact he was carrying the weapons used in the attack with him when he was arrested in Marseille, together with the clothing the perpetrator worn as seen on the security footage from the Museum. Both the weapons and the clothing had his [[DNA]] on them, and [[gunshot residue]] was also found on the clothing in question. A [[footprint]] of the sneakers he had with him was found in front of the entrance of the Museum. When he was arrested, he was also carrying some [[electronic media]] with him, on which videos were discovered wherein Nemmouche claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]. An [[Jihadist flag|ISIS flag]] used in the videos was found along the weapons Nemmouche had with him upon his arrest. The electronic media also contained data, such as [[web browsing history]], which proved Nemmouche had been planning the attack. A direct witness identified Nemmouche as being the perpetrator. Lastly, on a computer belonging to [[Najim Laachraoui]], one of the suicide bombers of the [[2016 Brussels bombings]], conversations were discovered wherein Nemmouche was described as a \"brother\", and plans were discussed to liberate him from his incarceration.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|title=Brussels Jewish museum terror attack: French citizen convicted|date=7 March 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190311022456/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|archive-date=11 March 2019|website=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=Petitjean|first=Sophie|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|title=Proc\u00e8s du Mus\u00e9e juif de Bruxelles: Nemmouche reconnu coupable de quatre assassinats terroristes|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Le Monde]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401234616/https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|archive-date=1 April 2020|language=French|trans-title=Trial over Jewish Museum of Brussels: Nemmouche found guilty of four terrorist murders}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche schuldig aan viervoudige terroristische moord in het Joods Museum, Bendrer is mededader|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031012840/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|archive-date=31 October 2019|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche guilty of four counts of terrorist murder in Jewish Museum, Bendrer is co-author}}</ref>\n\nThe jury considered that the [[Real evidence|material evidence]] and [[eyewitness testimony]] proved Nemmouche was the perpetrator of the attack. Based on the weapons used, the security footage of the Museum, and the [[Expert witness|expert testimony]] of the [[Medical examiner|medical examiners]] who examined the bodies of the victims, the jury found Nemmouche had the [[Intention (criminal law)|intention]] to kill. The jury furthermore affirmed the premeditated nature of the killings based on the preparatory acts Nemmouche carried out, such as the procurement of the weapons he used. The terrorist intentions of Nemmouche were upheld based on his [[Jihadism|jihadist]] stay in [[Syria]] in 2012, the videos he made in which he claimed responsibility for the attacks in the name of ISIS, and the conversations about Nemmouche retained from Najim Laachraoui's computer. The verdict also rejected the claim that Nemmouche was set up by intelligence officials. The jury lamented the lack of any element brought forward by the defence which would support those allegations. The existence of a setup was therefor deemed to lack \"sufficient plausibility and credibility\".<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAside from Nemmouche, the jury also found Nacer Bendrer guilty of being the co-author, and not just the [[accomplice]], of the terrorist attack by supplying the weapons Nemmouche used.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Sentence ===\nBoth men were sentenced on 12 March 2019: Nemmouche was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], while Bendrer received a 15-year prison sentence. In addition, Nemmouche was sentenced to a 15-year period of judicial surveillance. This provision means that if he would ever be released on [[parole]], he would be monitored by a sentence enforcement court, which could potentially order his incarceration for an additional 15 years.

The court considered Nemmouche's troubled upbringing to be no [[Mitigating factor|mitigating circumstance]] for such a grave act, and it also took into account the violent nature of the murders, Nemmouche's rejection of the [[Rechtsstaat|''rechtsstaat'']], and his complete lack of empathy and respect for his victims, amongst other factors. According to the court, he presented a high risk of [[recidivism]]. Regarding Bendrer on the other hand, the court described him as having played a decisive role in the attack by supplying the weapons used to Nemmouche. The court considered he knew what they would be used for, and was indifferent to the consequences to others. However, the court also upheld some mitigating circumstances, such as Bendrer having steered clear of any [[Islamic extremism]] since his arrest, and him having shown empathy and regret for the victims. Bendrer was deemed to present a low risk of recidivism.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cassation and damages ===\n\nBendrer later lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction with the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]]. This meant the civil part of the proceedings before the court of assizes (without the jury) with regards to [[damages]] had to be postponed. On 18 September 2019, the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal, which established the criminal sentence as final.<ref>{{cite

A few weeks before the actual start of the trial, a [[preliminary hearing]] took place on 20 December 2018, during which the list of [[witness]]es to be heard in the case was decided on. The [[defence attorney]]s of Nemmouche as well as Nemmouche himself opposed having his family members testify during the trial. According to Nemmouche's defence, this was because \"Mr Nemmouche did not want to argue on emotion, but on the facts\". His defence also requested to [[Adjournment|adjourn]] the case for two weeks, in order to give them the opportunity to study the case more in-depth. The adjournment of the case was rejected by the court, however. It was also decided that about 120 witnesses in total would be heard in the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|title=Geen uitstel voor proces Nemmouche over aanslag Joods museum, bijna 120 getuigen worden opgeroepen|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|date=20 December 2018|website=www.vrt.be|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=No delay for trial Nemmouche about attack on Jewish museum, almost 120 witnesses will be summoned|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221215344/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|archive-date=21 December 2018|url-status=|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 2019, three days before the start of the actual trial, the jurors on the assize jury were selected.

In the reasoning the jury gave for its [[verdict]], required by Belgian law, the main evidence against Nemmouche was summed up. The evidence against Nemmouche included the fact he was carrying the weapons used in the attack with him when he was arrested in Marseille, together with the clothing the perpetrator worn as seen on the security footage from the Museum. Both the weapons and the clothing had his [[DNA]] on them, and [[gunshot residue]] was also found on the clothing in question. A [[footprint]] of the sneakers he had with him was found in front of the entrance of the Museum. When he was arrested, he was also carrying some [[electronic media]] with him, on which videos were discovered wherein Nemmouche claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]. An [[Jihadist flag|ISIS flag]] used in the videos was found along the weapons Nemmouche had with him upon his arrest. The electronic media also contained data, such as [[web browsing history]], which proved Nemmouche had been planning the attack. A direct witness identified Nemmouche as being the perpetrator. Lastly, on a computer belonging to [[Najim Laachraoui]], one of the suicide bombers of the [[2016 Brussels bombings]], conversations were discovered wherein Nemmouche was described as a \"brother\", and plans were discussed to liberate him from his incarceration.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|title=Brussels Jewish museum terror attack: French citizen convicted|date=7 March 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190311022456/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|archive-date=11 March 2019|website=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=Petitjean|first=Sophie|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|title=Proc\u00e8s du Mus\u00e9e juif de Bruxelles: Nemmouche reconnu coupable de quatre assassinats terroristes|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Le Monde]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401234616/https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|archive-date=1 April 2020|language=French|trans-title=Trial over Jewish Museum of Brussels: Nemmouche found guilty of four terrorist murders}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche schuldig aan viervoudige terroristische moord in het Joods Museum, Bendrer is mededader|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031012840/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|archive-date=31 October 2019|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche guilty of four counts of terrorist murder in Jewish Museum, Bendrer is co-author}}</ref>\n\nThe jury considered that the [[Real evidence|material evidence]] proved Nemmouche was the perpetrator of the attack. Based on the weapons used, the security footage of the Museum, and the [[Expert witness|expert testimony]] of the [[Medical examiner|medical examiners]] who examined the bodies of the victims, the jury found Nemmouche had the [[Intention (criminal law)|intention]] to kill. The jury furthermore affirmed the premeditated nature of the killings based on the preparatory acts Nemmouche carried out, such as the procurement of the weapons he used. The terrorist intentions of Nemmouche were upheld based on his [[Jihadism|jihadist]] stay in [[Syria]] in 2012, the videos he made in which he claimed responsibility for the attacks in the name of ISIS, and the conversations about Nemmouche retained from Najim Laachraoui's computer. The verdict also rejected the claim that Nemmouche was set up by intelligence officials. The jury lamented the lack of any element brought forward by the defence which would support those allegations. The existence of a setup was therefor deemed to lack \"sufficient plausibility and credibility\".<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAside from Nemmouche, the jury also found Nacer Bendrer guilty of being the co-author, and not just the [[accomplice]], of the terrorist attack by supplying the weapons Nemmouche used.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Sentence ===\nBoth men were sentenced on 12 March 2019: Nemmouche was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], while Bendrer received a 15-year prison sentence. In addition, Nemmouche was sentenced to a 15-year period of judicial surveillance. This provision means that if he would ever be released on [[parole]], he would be monitored by a sentence enforcement court, which could potentially order his incarceration for an additional 15 years. Bendrer was also sentenced to a 5-year period of such judicial surveillance.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47533533|title=Brussels Jewish Museum murders: Mehdi Nemmouche jailed for life|date=12 March 2019|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=15 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/11/nemmouche-en-bendrer-veroordeeld/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche krijgt levenslang voor aanslag op Joods Museum, mededader Nacer Bendrer 15 jaar|date=12 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche gets life sentence for attack on Jewish Museum, accomplice Nacer Bendrer 15 years}}</ref>\n\nIn its judgment, the court stated that the terrorist attack on the Jewish Museum constituted an attack on the fundamental values of Belgian society, in particular the [[Freedom of religion in Belgium|freedom of religion]] of the Jewish community of Belgium. The court considered Nemmouche's troubled upbringing to be no [[Mitigating factor|mitigating circumstance]] for such a grave act, and it also took into account the violent nature of the murders, Nemmouche's rejection of the [[Rechtsstaat|''rechtsstaat'']], and his complete lack of empathy and respect for his victims, amongst other factors. According to the court, he presented a high risk of [[recidivism]]. Regarding Bendrer on the other hand, the court described him as having played a decisive role in the attack by supplying the weapons used to Nemmouche. The court considered he knew what they would be used for, and was indifferent to the consequences to others. However, the court also upheld some mitigating circumstances, such as Bendrer having steered clear of any [[Islamic extremism]] since his arrest, and him having shown empathy and regret for the victims. Bendrer was deemed to present a low risk of recidivism.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cassation and damages ===\n\nBendrer later lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction with the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]]. This meant the civil part of the proceedings before the court of assizes (without the jury) with regards to [[damages]] had to be postponed. On 18 September 2019, the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal, which established the criminal sentence as final.<ref>{{cite

As a result, [[Christine Lakin]] joined the cast, replacing Snelson as romance novelist Kate.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* Grace Valentine (portrayed by [[Jaime Murray]]): \n: Family matriarch and the goddess [[Aphrodite]]. Grace oversees the Valentines' Earthly operations and is the one to bring Kate on board after she discovers that their lack of success has made them start to become mortal. She was recently involved in a relationship with her former husband Ray Howard, the god Hephaestus. She left him for Ari thousands of years ago, and has regretted the decision ever since: suffering psychological abuse, and unable to get a divorce. She tells Kate that Ray is the only man she has every truly loved, and she considers Ari nothing more than a fling. She is attacked by the Egyptian Goddess [[Bastet]], who wields the Adamantium Blade, after Bastet fatally stabs Ari. She is last seen weeping over Ari's body.\n* Danny Valentine (portrayed by [[Kristoffer Polaha]]): \n: The god of erotic love, [[Eros]] and son of Grace. Danny is the loose cannon amongst the Valentines and spends his nights seducing the ladies. His classic bow and arrow has now been replaced by a gun, which shoots magic to help create feelings of love in his targets. However, his gun was destroyed by Grace who has gotten fed up with his behavior. He was initially resistant to the idea of Kate joining their operation, but has begun to warm up to her, even to the point of having a slight crush (whether he knows it or not). He eventually marries Kate in order to bring two former lovers together, as one is a wedding planner and the other is a rabbi. However, he kisses her with passion, indicating that he has developed feelings for her.\n* Kate Providence (portrayed by [[Christine Lakin]]): \n: A mortal romance novelist. Kate is brought into the Valentines' world after meeting Grace at a book reading. At first resistant to the idea of the Greek gods being on Earth, a display of magic from Grace soon convinces her the gods are real, and she chooses to help them reunite soul mates. However, Phoebe begins receiving signs from the Oracle that Kate has more sinister intentions, and it has been suggested that she kills Grace at some point in the near future. However, it is revealed that the woman Phoebe saw was in fact the Egyptian Goddess [[Bastet]], who had been hiding in the Valentine house in her cat form. Kate eventually marries Danny in order to bring two former lovers together, as one is a wedding planner and the other is a rabbi. However, she kisses him with passion, indicating that she has feelings for him.\n* Phoebe Valentine (portrayed by [[Autumn Reeser]]): \n: The [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]]. Phoebe serves as the [[Pythia|Goddess of the Oracle at Delphi]]. Phoebe is much older than the other gods, but being a Titan means her soul has been reborn many times, hence her childlike nature. It is she who communicates with [[Moirai|The Fates]] to match soul mates and also sees what will happen if they don't find one another. She is immediately suspicious of Kate's motivations, but her concerns aren't taken seriously after she openly shows jealousy towards her. She seems to harbor a crush on Leo and was happy when he told her he would marry her if she was still single by the time she was 80.\n* Leo Francisci (portrayed by [[Robert Baker (actor)|Robert Baker]]): \n: A bartender and the hero [[Hercules]]. Leo is the moral compass for Danny and an all around good person. He assists the Valentines on their mission to bring love to the world, acting as the muscle of the group, and he destroys Danny's love gun after Grace orders him to. Phoebe convinces him to help her discover Kate's true intentions, but comes to regret it after they accidentally start a fire in Kate's apartment. He seems to have a crush on Phoebe and is very protective of her. He is injured by the Adamantium Blade when he is protecting Grace from the Goddess [[Bastet]].\n* Ray Howard (portrayed by [[Patrick Fabian]]): \n: A handyman who is also known as the god [[Hephaestus]]. Ray is Grace's ex-husband from an arranged marriage. Grace cheated on him frequently and married one of her lovers, Ari. Ray and Grace recently had an affair, but he broke up with Grace when he realized she couldn't choose between Ari and himself. After Danny discovers the affair, he convinces Ray to repair his love gun so her can use it to drive Grace into leaving Ari, not knowing that Ari threatened to hurt him if Grace ever tried to get a divorce. He makes a chink in Ari's armor and eventually finds the Adamantium Blade, and hides its discovery from Ari. After the Goddess [[Bastet]] ambushed him and stole the blade, he told Ari and warned him about the chink in his armor.\n* Ari Valentine (portrayed by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]): \n: A very high-powered man who is also known as the god [[Ares]]. Ari is Grace's second and current husband (formerly her lover). Grace cheated on her first husband Ray frequently with Ari and eventually married him. He knows that Ray and Grace have recently had an affair, but he also cheats on her as well. When Grace threatens to leave Ari, he threatened to hurt Ray if Grace ever tried to get a divorce. He warned Danny about evil coming after the gods and tells him that the one blade that can hurt the gods, the Adamantine Blade. He convinced him to get his love gun fixed in order to protect the gods. He found out that Circe held the Blade and attacked her when she tried to summon the titans. After the Goddess [[Bastet]] ambushed Ray and stole the blade, he told Ari, who decides to go after her. He is warned about the chink in his armor but doesn't listen. He eventually finds Bastet and the blade, and they eventually begin to fight. Grace calls out his name in fear, which distracts him, letting Bastet fatally wound him.\n* Jezebel (portrayed by [[Noa Tishby]]): \n: Jezebel is Kate's seemingly ordinary housecat. In the first few episodes, she exhibits strange behavior, such as intently watching Ari and Kate make out and leaping into the air to knock over a candle, setting Kate's apartment on fire. It was eventually revealed that Jezebel is actually the Egyptian goddess [[Bastet]], who has been planning on murdering Grace and other gods using the Adamantine Blade. After Phoebe becomes suspicious of Kate, she steals some hair off of Kate's sweater that was actually Jezebel's and the Oracle sends her a vision of Grace lying dead on a table. Afterwards, Bastet returned and poured something into the Oracle. In human form, she knocks out Danny and steals his love gun, and uses it to overpower Ray and steal the blade. After arriving at the Valentine Estate, she is confronted by Ari and fatally stabs him.\n* Aunt Circe (portrayed by [[Ann Magnuson]]): \n: Danny's Aunt who is also known as the god [[Circe]]. She is a goddess and an oracle as well. She is well known for turning men into pigs. She currently makes her income by selling weed. She seems to have had a sexual relationship with Danny. She seems to have her own agenda, as she held the Adamantine Blade and didn't tell the gods about it. Ari eventually found out and attacked her as she tried to summon the titans.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n |background=#D47D85\n |overall=\n |title=\n |director=19\n |writer=22\n |airdate=17\n |viewers=11\n |country=US\n |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|Title=Valentine\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|10|5}}\n|WrittenBy=[[Kevin Murphy (screenwriter)|Kevin Murphy]]\n|DirectedBy=[[Kevin Dowling (director)|Kevin Dowling]]\n|Viewers=1.146<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210082352/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2008/10/07/top-cw-primetime-shows-september-29-october-5/5919| title=Top CW Primetime Shows, September 29 - October 5| last=Gorman| first=Bill| work=TV by the Numbers| date=October 7, 2008| accessdate=2013-02-23}}</ref>\n|ShortSummary=The Greek gods have set up base in Los Angeles, disguised as the Valentine family.

As a result, [[Christine Lakin]] joined the cast, replacing Snelson as romance novelist Kate.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* Grace Valentine (portrayed by [[Jaime Murray]]): \n: Family matriarch and the goddess [[Aphrodite]]. Grace oversees the Valentines' Earthly operations and is the one to bring Kate on board after she discovers that their lack of success has made them start to become mortal. She was recently involved in a relationship with her former husband Ray Howard, the god Hephaestus. She left him for Ari thousands of years ago, and has regretted the decision ever since: suffering psychological abuse, and unable to get a divorce. She tells Kate that Ray is the only man she has every truly loved, and she considers Ari nothing more than a fling. She is attacked by the Egyptian Goddess [[Bastet]], who wields the Adamantium Blade, after Bastet fatally stabs Ari. She is last seen weeping over Ari's body.\n* Danny Valentine (portrayed by [[Kristoffer Polaha]]): \n: The god of erotic love, [[Eros]] and son of Grace. Danny is the loose cannon amongst the Valentines and spends his nights seducing the ladies. His classic bow and arrow has now been replaced by a gun, which shoots magic to help create feelings of love in his targets. However, his gun was destroyed by Grace who has gotten fed up with his behavior. He was initially resistant to the idea of Kate joining their operation, but has begun to warm up to her, even to the point of having a slight crush (whether he knows it or not). He eventually marries Kate in order to bring two former lovers together, as one is a wedding planner and the other is a rabbi. However, he kisses her with passion, indicating that he has developed feelings for her.\n* Kate Providence (portrayed by [[Christine Lakin]]): \n: A mortal romance novelist. Kate is brought into the Valentines' world after meeting Grace at a book reading. At first resistant to the idea of the Greek gods being on Earth, a display of magic from Grace soon convinces her the gods are real, and she chooses to help them reunite soul mates. However, Phoebe begins receiving signs from the Oracle that Kate has more sinister intentions, and it has been suggested that she kills Grace at some point in the near future. However, it is revealed that the woman Phoebe saw was in fact the Egyptian Goddess [[Bastet]], who had been hiding in the Valentine house in her cat form. Kate eventually marries Danny in order to bring two former lovers together, as one is a wedding planner and the other is a rabbi. However, she kisses him with passion, indicating that she has feelings for him.\n* Phoebe Valentine (portrayed by [[Autumn Reeser]]): \n: The [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]]. Phoebe serves as the [[Pythia|Goddess of the Oracle at Delphi]]. Phoebe is much older than the other gods, but being a Titan means her soul has been reborn many times, hence her childlike nature. It is she who communicates with [[Moirai|The Fates]] to match soul mates and also sees what will happen if they don't find one another. She is immediately suspicious of Kate's motivations, but her concerns aren't taken seriously after she openly shows jealousy towards her. She seems to harbor a crush on Leo and was happy when he told her he would marry her if she was still single by the time she was 80.\n* Leo Francisci (portrayed by [[Robert Baker (actor)|Robert Baker]]): \n: A bartender and the hero [[Hercules]]. Leo is the moral compass for Danny and an all around good person. He assists the Valentines on their mission to bring love to the world, acting as the muscle of the group, and he destroys Danny's love gun after Grace orders him to. Phoebe convinces him to help her discover Kate's true intentions, but comes to regret it after they accidentally start a fire in Kate's apartment. He seems to have a crush on Phoebe and is very protective of her. He is injured by the Adamantium Blade when he is protecting Grace from the Goddess [[Bastet]].\n* Ray Howard (portrayed by [[Patrick Fabian]]): \n: A handyman who is also known as the god [[Hephaestus]]. Ray is Grace's ex-husband from an arranged marriage. Grace cheated on him frequently and married one of her lovers, Ari. Ray and Grace recently had an affair, but he broke up with Grace when he realized she couldn't choose between Ari and himself. After Danny discovers the affair, he convinces Ray to repair his love gun so her can use it to drive Grace into leaving Ari, not knowing that Ari threatened to hurt him if Grace ever tried to get a divorce. He makes a chink in Ari's armor and eventually finds the Adamantium Blade, and hides its discovery from Ari. After the Goddess [[Bastet]] ambushed him and stole the blade, he told Ari and warned him about the chink in his armor.\n* Ari Valentine (portrayed by [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]): \n: A very high-powered man who is also known as the god [[Ares]]. Ari is Grace's second and current husband (formerly her lover). Grace cheated on her first husband Ray frequently with Ari and eventually married him. He knows that Ray and Grace have recently had an affair, but he also cheats on her as well. When Grace threatens to leave Ari, he threatened to hurt Ray if Grace ever tried to get a divorce. He warned Danny about evil coming after the gods and tells him that the one blade that can hurt the gods, the Adamantine Blade. He convinced him to get his love gun fixed in order to protect the gods. He found out that Circe held the Blade and attacked her when she tried to summon the titans. After the Goddess [[Bastet]] ambushed Ray and stole the blade, he told Ari, who decides to go after her. He is warned about the chink in his armor but doesn't listen. He eventually finds Bastet and the blade, and they eventually begin to fight. Grace calls out his name in fear, which distracts him, letting Bastet fatally wound him.\n* Jezebel (portrayed by [[Noa Tishby]]): \n: Jezebel is Kate's seemingly ordinary housecat. In the first few episodes, she exhibits strange behavior, such as intently watching Ari and Kate make out and leaping into the air to knock over a candle, setting Kate's apartment on fire. It was eventually revealed that Jezebel is actually the Egyptian goddess [[Bastet]], who has been planning on murdering Grace and other gods using the Adamantine Blade. After Phoebe becomes suspicious of Kate, she steals some hair off of Kate's sweater that was actually Jezebel's and the Oracle sends her a vision of Grace lying dead on a table. Afterwards, Bastet returned and poured something into the Oracle. In human form, she knocks out Danny and steals his love gun, and uses it to overpower Ray and steal the blade. After arriving at the Valentine Estate, she is confronted by Ari and fatally stabs him.\n* Aunt Circe (portrayed by [[Ann Magnuson]]): \n: Danny's Aunt who is also known as the god [[Circe]]. She is a goddess and an oracle as well. She is well known for turning men into pigs. She currently makes her income by selling weed. She seems to have had a sexual relationship with Danny. She seems to have her own agenda, as she held the Adamantine Blade and didn't tell the gods about it. Ari eventually found out and attacked her as she tried to summon the titans.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n |background=#D47D85\n |overall=\n |title=\n |director=19\n |writer=22\n |airdate=17\n |viewers=11\n |country=US\n |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|Title=Valentine\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2008|10|5}}\n|WrittenBy=[[Kevin Murphy (screenwriter)|Kevin Murphy]]\n|DirectedBy=[[Kevin Dowling (director)|Kevin Dowling]]\n|Viewers=1.146<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210082352/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2008/10/07/top-cw-primetime-shows-september-29-october-5/5919| title=Top CW Primetime Shows, September 29 - October 5| last=Gorman| first=Bill| work=TV by the Numbers| date=October 7, 2008| accessdate=2013-02-23}}</ref>\n|ShortSummary=The Greek gods have set up base in Los Angeles, disguised as the Valentine family.

Will and Frankie retrieve the core, but are forced to change their extraction plan. Standish is anxious when Tina asks him out on a date, so the team bolsters his confidence with intel. Will and Frankie hole up in a house, where Emma unexpectedly arrives. Standish, following Ray\u2019s bad advice, tries too hard to impress Tina on their date, and she leaves. After Jimmy finds the house, the team lures him to a train station. Sampson admits to Ray that in helping Standish, she was trying to work through her own failed marriage; Ray assures her that people in their line of work can still find romance. Using depleted uranium rounds, Will is able to bait Jimmy and his men into a police trap, and punches him for good measure.

A prisoner with knowledge of the Trust is scheduled for transfer; the team is shocked to learn that it's the supposedly-deceased Ollerman. The convoy is ambushed, forcing them to take Ollerman back to their operations hub, the Hive.

Ray assaults Ollerman when he learns about the transfer, and Jai is told to watch him. Standish learns that there are Trust operatives within the Hive, who take Sampson hostage. Will realizes that the transfer was staged to allow Ollerman to steal a valuable piece of evidence to finance the Trust. While Jai and Standish track Sampson, Frankie pretends to defect and shoots Will. Ray stages a rescue with Jai's help using his improvisation skills. Ollerman manages to escape, but Will admits that he replaced the stolen evidence with a fake. Tina brings Standish a gift to prove she still loves him.

Will tries to explain to her that the key is having a warm personality, but she dismisses him as a coddler. Standish goes undercover as a client to capture organ broker Michael Kenner, but the deal goes south and Will is tasered and left behind. The team tries to catch up with the car moving him, but fail, and Michael tortures Will with electric paddles. Frankie assumes command, but quickly gets overwhelmed with responsibility and yells at the team. Through a bug planted by Jai, Will emotionally bonds with him and asks him to contact his parents if he dies. Frankie arranges for Standish to purchase Will's heart so they can find his location. Will uses [[adrenaline]] to reverse Kenner's paralytic just as Frankie and Standish locate him, while Sampson frees the broker's captives. Kenner tries to escape, but Standish sabotages his helicopter and Will knocks him out. Back at the bar, Frankie recognizes the importance of supporting her team and accepts that she has the capability to lead.

Tina tells Standish that he needs to be there for Jai, while Sampson and Ray wind up sleeping with each other. The team tracks down Griffin, but when Will acts cold and ruthless, Frankie refuses to rein him in until Sampson points out that Will might soon do something he can't come back from. Frankie catches him torturing a witness, but chooses to let him walk instead of trying to bring him in. Ollerman lures Will into a trap by giving him Griffin's location. A wounded Griffin admits that he didn't kill Emma, but before Will shoots him, Frankie talks him down by reminding him that his sunny optimism is what makes their partnership work. Griffin tries to pull a hidden gun before he is shot dead. Sampson breaks things off with Ray for good.
