Its popularity has spawned numerous compilations, a live-action television series, and merchandise such as T-shirts and [[figurine]]s.\n\nThe strip not only showcases domestic life; occasionally, it features adventure, drama, and pure spoof sequences. More often, the strip mirrors the general sentiment of the Filipino people on relevant topics such as corruption in the government as well as Filipino pop culture. In this respect, the strip has been likened to [[Garry Trudeau]]'s ''[[Doonesbury]]''.<ref>Quiambao, Cecilia (1993).

An English approximation of his dialog would be: \"''[[Ragnarok Online|Ragnarok]]'' has replaced ''patintero'' (a traditional game), video conferencing has replaced lunch meetings, and Google and Wikipedia have replaced the library!\"]]\nMedina conceived the strip while working under contract in Iraq in 1986.<ref name = \"pb8\">''pugad baboy eight''</ref> On May 18, 1988, he pitched his strips to the ''Philippine Daily Inquirer''. His strip, named after a friend's [[piggery]] in [[Bulacan]], was accepted on the spot.<ref name = \"pb10\">''Pugad Baboy X''</ref>\n\nMedina originally spelled \"Pugad Baboy\" with a hyphen in the strip itself, though not in the title.\n\nFor many years, the strip was exclusively a black-and-white [[Comic strip#Daily strips|daily]]. A full-color [[Sunday strip]] in the same paper debuted on October 3, 2004. The full-colored strips ended their run sometime in 2009. Before the tabloid ''Inquirer Libre'' debuted, the strip appeared exclusively in the ''Inquirer'' broadsheet.\n\nIn a strip published in September 2006, Medina commented on online life substituting for physical contact. He mentioned Wikipedia as one of the alternatives to library visits, the other being [[Google]].\n\nThe Inquirer decided to discontinue carrying ''Pugad Baboy'' in its comics section beginning June 5, 2013, after a strip for the June 4 edition reportedly lambasted hypocrisy among Christians against homosexuals when certain sectarian schools condone such students among their ranks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cerda |first=Jovan |url=http://www.philstar.com/campus/2013/06/06/950822/pdi-cancels-comic-strip-implying-pretty-students-girls-school-are-lesbians |title=PDI cancels comic strip implying pretty students from girls' school are lesbians &#124; Campus, Special Reports, Home |publisher=philstar.com |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}</ref> The newspaper later clarified that the cartoonist was not actually fired and the strip would just be suspended from publication until an internal investigation had been carried out.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/philippine-comic-strip-suspended-over-lesbian-joke-075132743.html | title=Philippine daily sorry for lesbian comic strip joke | publisher=AFP News (through Yahoo!

Thank you.-->\nThe Sungcal family reflects aspects of traditional and stereotypical families, with a housewife and an overseas contract worker as members, with a domestic helper to supplement. \"Sungkal\" is a Tagalog word for the term \"digging a hole with a (pig's) snout\".\n\n*'''Dagul''' (Adagulfo Sungcal Jr.), often referred to with the title ''Mang'' (Mister)  \u2013 i.e. '''Mang Dagul''' \u2013 The patriarch of the family. He works as a chef in a five-star hotel where he specializes in unorthodox dishes. He is often shown at home, usually voicing out on the state of affairs in the Philippines. He is also highly xenophobic. Over the years, he studies different martial arts like [[karate]], [[arnis]] and [[aikido]] (like Medina), and he also dabbles in tennis and golf. He calls his wife \"Honeycured.\" \"Dagul\" is Filipino slang for someone or something big. At the end of The Returnee story arc, the Tangeres lend Dagul money so he can quit his job and start his own small restaurant in his house's front yard.\n*'''Debbie''' (Debra Anne Sungcal) \u2013 The matriarch of the family, a loving traditional housewife and mother. Her recurring traits include a love for bargain shopping, indecision regarding actual purchases (sometimes on purpose), and complaining about decisions she lets Dagul make (much to Dagul's annoyance and regret). Also, she extremely highly dislikes any honest opinion Dagul gives her about her figure and/or clothes she wears or tries on \u2013 to the point of throwing him out of the house, despite her demanding honest opinions in the first place. She is also the constant victim of disgusting table conversations between her husband, Polgas and sometimes with Utoy. She calls her husband \"Sweet Ham.\"\n*'''Kules''' (Hercules Sungcal) \u2013 The eldest son, a building engineer in [[Saudi Arabia]]. When not working, he reads letters from pen pals, goes on blind dates (usually with funny consequences), hangs out with his friend 'Adre (short for ''compadre''; see below), or thinks about the events back in the Philippines. Much like Kules, Medina was formerly a contract worker in Saudi Arabia. The origin of his name is often mistaken to be that of the [[Hercules|legendary Greek hero of the same name]], when in fact, he is named after the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] aircraft. After marrying Mandana, Kules resigned from his overseas job and returned to Pugad Baboy for good, sporting longer hair.\n*'''Tiny''' (Cristina Sungcal) \u2013 The teenage daughter. Her name is not only an obvious misnomer, but also a testament to her vanity and denial regarding her size. She asserts herself as sexy and repeatedly insists that her waistline is 28&nbsp;inches (the last time this was true was when she was 9 or 10 years old). She does commit herself to [[dieting|diet]]s that often end in failure. Her cooking leaves much to be desired by her family, and is sometimes inedible (in one strip she naively uses [[papaya]] soap in place of the fruit). She studies in the [[University of Santo Tomas]], where Medina graduated in 1983 with a degree in architecture. There, she takes up [[mass communication]], a course the university does not actually offer. She is currently being courted by Brando, whose name is always mistaken by Bab and Dagul, and Tiny correcting them all the time. But in the beginning she allowed herself to be courted by Bab, and this happened only for a short period of time. She also is a [[cosplaying]] enthusiast.\n*'''Utoy''' (Adagulfo Sungcal III) \u2013 The youngest son. Intelligent and musically talented (playing the saxophone), he behaves much like other children his age. Medina initially depicted him as a clueless [[infant]], but he later aged him to about eight years old probably to give a child's insight on current events (eight is also the age of most of the child characters in this strip). Despite his youth, he claims Jolen as his girlfriend. In a \"[[Baboy Scouts|Boy Scout]]\" story arc, Medina gives him an absurdly versatile [[Swiss Army Knife]] (apart from the usual tools, his knife comes equipped with such things as a refrigerator, a [[Nintendo]] video game console ''complete with television'', and an all-terrain vehicle).<ref name = \"pb3\">''Pugad Baboy 3''</ref> The tool returns in Pugad Baboy 25 with a mini-sniper rifle that fires foam pellets.\n*'''Mandana''' (Mandana Ahmadi-Sungcal) \u2013 Kules' wife, and a spy of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin. Known as the \"most hated by the Muslims who give Islam a bad name,\" Mandana amassed a huge amount of fortune from collecting bounties of famous terrorists. Among her modus operandi is to convince wives of terrorists to betray them and become her informant. How and when she fell in love with Kules is unknown, but she ordered her partner Amir to offer Kules dowries to marry her. When a group of Islamists kidnapped Kules and ordered Mandana to bomb the US Embassy in exchange for her fiance's life, she did not hesitate and obliged. She was assumed killed in action - Kules shot her to save the Embassy, though the boat she was piloting still destroyed it. However, it was later revealed that she faked her death in order to deceive the Muslim extremists on her trail, and that what Kules shot was a dummy. It was heavily implied that non-terrorist casualties in the Embassy destruction were faked also in order to throw off the Muslim extremists. She re-emerged and reunited with Kules after five years, marrying in a civil ceremony in Tagaytay. She can finally speak [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] fluently, as seen in the March 21, 2016 strip [http://www.rappler.com/pugad-baboy/126558-no-religion here] and as of January 25, 2018 [https://www.rappler.com/pugad-baboy/194423-barbari-in-the-oven here], she's pregnant with her and Kules' first child. She gave birth to a girl, while Kules was away.\n*'''Zara''' (Lazara Armaiti Sungcal) \u2013 Kules and Mandana's infant daughter. She took a lot from her Iranian heritage and her mother's temperament. She never once cried since her birth, something that Mandana claimed she got from her while admitting that her first time crying was when she shot her father who forcefully arranged her to marry an old man.\n\n====Polgas====\n'''Polgas''' (derived from the Spanish and Tagalog ''pulgas'' for \"flea\") is the Sungcals' [[anthropomorphic]] family dog. Notable for his human characteristics such as speech, optional bipedalism, use of clothing and general behavior, he is called ''ang asong hindi'' (the dog who isn't) in material outside the strip proper because of his human characteristics. He acts as an extra member of the Sungcals and is his master Dagul's drinking buddy. However, he still behaves like a typical dog when he chooses to, though usually when he takes a bite out of people or leaks on them, most often Dagul.\n\nPolgas was initially a normal dog which walked on all fours, albeit one who wore shirts and undershirts like Dagul.<ref name = \"pb1\">''Pugad Baboy One'' (''The Very Best of Pugad Baboy'')</ref> Medina eventually gave him the ability to talk, followed by other human characteristics like a more humanlike physique. Originally, Brosia, a former [[ventriloquism|ventriloquist]], supplied Polgas's voice, but Medina was so dissatisfied with the idea that he abandoned it completely.<ref name = \"pb10\" /> Medina later explained in a 1995 spin-off graphic novel entitled ''[[Pirata (Pugad Baboy graphic novel)|Pirata]]'' that Polgas developed human characteristics due to his master's exotic version of ''bibingka'' (rice cake) and exposure to radiation emitted by television sets. Apparently, the combination had a [[teratogenic]] effect on him, somewhat similar to the mutation of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]].<ref name = \"Pirata\">''Pirata''</ref>\n\nMedina eventually developed the character into a \"man (dog) of action\", humorously saving the human characters from danger during story arcs,<ref name = \"pb3\" /><ref name = \"pb2\">''The Best of Pugad Baboy</ref> and later a full-fledged action hero involved with more serious activities.<ref name = \"pb3\" /> Polgas became a [[spy|''deep penetration'' agent]] of a fictional military division called the Organized Canine Bureau (OCB). This organization spoofs the TV series ''[[Wiseguy]]'', which features a fictional branch of the [[FBI]] called the Organized Crime Bureau, responsible for the protagonist [[Wiseguy#Vincent Terranova (Ken Wahl)|Vinnie Terranova]]'s activities.\n\nMedina's OCB was originally formed to combat the pilfering of stray dogs being sold in [[Metro Manila]] for their meat. Wisedog's second mission took place in [[Baguio City]], where the selling and eating of dog meat is an illegal industry. (See [[The Baguio Connection]]).<ref name = \"pb3\" /> Polgas's original [[call sign]] in the OCB was ''Wisedog'' (a homage to ''[[Wiseguy]]'').<ref name = \"pb3\" /> Later, he changed his call sign to ''Dobermaxx'' after he and some other residents of Pugad Baboy were accidentally sent to and returned from the year [[2078 (Pugad Baboy story arc)|2078]]. Subsequently, he is sometimes referred to as \"Agent Delta\" or simply \"Delta\".<ref name = \"pb15\">''Kinse!''</ref>\n\nAs an agent, Polgas was issued with a prototype ''garapata'' (tick) ''gun'', which shoots droplets of tick sweat that causes itching that lasts for six months.<ref name = \"pb3\" /> Later, he was issued a tiny surveillance robot flea named \"Gary\"<ref name = \"pb4\">''Pugad Baboy 4''</ref> and ballistic ''[[arnis]]'' sticks.<ref name = \"pb10\" /> After his first mission, he was issued a customized [[Porsche 959]], the ''Thunderdog''.<ref name = \"pb3\" /> As a result, from his adventure in 2078, he acquired a technologically advanced ''garapata gun''.<ref name = \"pb5\">''Pugad Baboy 5''</ref> Later he also acquired the ''Thunderpuppy'', a [[Harley Davidson#VRSC|Harley Davidson V-Rod]] motorcycle.\n\nAs Wisedog/Dobermaxx, Polgas has fought many foes over the years, ranging from the mundane (drug pushers<ref name = \"pb3\" />) to the fantastic (a lord of supernatural creatures<ref name = \"pb4\" />). His most prominent foe is Atong Damuho (Renate Domingo), erstwhile drug pusher,<ref name = \"pb3\" /> dognapper,<ref name = \"pb3\" /> illegal logger<ref name = \"pb11\">''Pugad Baboy XI''</ref> and most recently, [[Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushroom]] courier.<ref name = \"pb15\" />\n\nHe appears in many other guises such as Dr. Sigmund Floyd (a spoof of [[Sigmund Freud]]), Pol Torero ([[World Wrestling Entertainment]] or WWE's [[The Undertaker]]), Amorsolo (a non-existent [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|Ninja Turtle]]), Aquapol ([[Aquaman]]), Growlsbuster (spoofing [[Ghostbusters|The Ghostbusters]]), Darth Paul (spoofing [[Darth Maul]]), Polverine (a spoof of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], an [[X-Men]] character) and many others.\n\n===The Tangaras===\n<!--To whoever edits this article, please don't overflow this article too much. You don't have to tell all. Thank you.-->\nThe Tangaras are two siblings from Gingoog City that both share a close relationship with the Sungcals, they are one of Pugad Baboy's few thin, slim residents. Their surname is a play on ''tanga'', a Tagalog word for \"stupid\".\n\n*'''Brosia''' (Ambrosia Tangara) \u2013 The Sungcal family's housemaid. She is brainless, as characterized by her nonsensical remarks and her mesmerization by reading materials in English. Medina eventually elaborated on this trait and said she couldn't afford to advance her studies. She does possess excellent math skills regarding financial issues such as bank accounts, deposits, salary computations, currencies, etc. As said by Dagul in Pugad Baboy 17, ''\"'Pag sa pera nga pala 'di ka tanga no?''\" (\"So, you're not dumb when it comes to money, huh?\") She makes up for her general lack of intelligence (or formal schooling) with witty jokes, insults and pranks on the community's various residents. Her most frequent victim is Dagul, whose semi-baldness becomes the butt of her jokes, much to his chagrin. As revealed in ''The Bourney Ambrosity'', there was an attempt by Polgas to recruit Brosia in the OCB, under the codename of \"Amrita\", but she was unable to absorb any of the physical, linguistic, and technical training, or so they thought; the amnesia inflicted on her in the storyline brings out this myriad of abilities, including dealing with English, but appear to be inaccessible if her original Brosia persona is active.\n*'''<nowiki>'Adre</nowiki>''' (Cesar \"Butch\" Tangara) \u2013 Brosia's older brother and Kules's best friend and fellow worker in Saudi Arabia. He shares the same interests and sentiments with Kules, sometimes with photos of their penpals. His relation to Brosia was revealed when he went home to the Philippines for a vacation (Kules was also home at the time).  Adre is now also resigned from a job in Saudi Arabia following his best friend's wedding and now currently resides back to the Philippines for good. ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>Adre'' is short for ''kumpadre'' or male best friend.\n\n===The Sabaybunots===\n<!--To whoever edits this article, please don't overflow this article too much. You don't have to tell all. Thank you.-->\nThe Sabaybunots reflect a very violent but tolerably quiet household. \"''Sabay, bunot!''\" is used by the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Philippine military]] as an oral [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] command during martial ceremonies when the drawing of weapons is called for, as in the drawing of officers' swords. It roughly means \"draw simultaneously\". This may be in homage to Tomas' military background.\n\n*'''Tomas''', also known as '''Sarge''' (M/Sgt. Tomas Sabaybunot) \u2013 Representing the Philippine's military branch, he is a [[master sergeant]] of the [[Philippine Air Force]]. While said to be fearless and often trigger-happy, his \"[[chauvinist|chauvinist pig]]\" lifestyle is ironically neutralized by his dominant wife. He is often reduced to doing inane chores, and any attempt to complain about said chores results in physical battery by his wife, hilariously, to the point of that he considers wartime more peaceful than his domestic life. His name could be a pun on ''toma'', Filipino slang for alcoholic drinks; Tomas does like to drink a lot, as does his cousin Igno. Tomas also likes to spend his \"extra time\" at disco bars, though this occasionally leads him to having [[gout]]. And though he has a large collection of guns, he suffers from a severe [[fear of needles]]. At the end of The Returnee story arc, Tomas retired from the military service following his new business, a new coffee plantation and a new military training facility in Cavite. The Tangeres' new farm is right beside his new place. He was stuck in Master Sergeant rank, joking that if he became a pimp to an officer who was unnamed, he will be promoted.\n*'''Barbie''' (Barbara Q. Sabaybunot) \u2013 Tomas's wife. She frequently orders Tomas around, probably due to his chauvinism, his womanizing, and her extremely [[feminism|feministic]] views. This difference of opinion often turns into a physical altercation, such as Barbie giving a tiptoeing Tomas her trademarked [[uppercut]] whenever he arrives home in the wee hours of the morning [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] and/or smeared with the scent of women's perfume. Her maiden name (Barbie Q.) is a pun on [[barbecue]]. In ''Pugad Baboy 18'', her first name was rendered \"Barbara-Queen\" (possibly after a local barbecue franchise called ''Grill Queen''). She often spends her free time doing physical workouts (lifting weights, etc.). She is also hinted as a [[born-again Christian]], as she holds or attends prayer meetings, and describes Tomas as \"born-against,\" because of his sinful ways. Even in the realm of weapons, Barbie outguns her husband. Tomas is usually portrayed with his service pistol while Barbie often has an [[Uzi submachine gun|Uzi]]. Recently, Barbie was pregnant and born twin boys, which Tomas wanted to reach out for his friends for names, rejecting Noli's name Carl and Marcus, names made from [[Karl Marx]]. \n*'''Paltik''' (Paul Thomas Sabaybunot), the couple's eldest son. While his friend Utoy can be described as the \"brains\", he can be described as the \"[[jester]]\". Quite mischievous in many ways, he often sleeps in class and is clearly much more interested in other areas, such as teasing his buck-toothed teacher, Miss Nobatos, typically comparing her face to that of a horse. He is also fond of bribing and blackmailing his own father, usually in exchange for some pocket money or other favors. His nickname is a Filipino term that means \"homemade gun.\" The Philippine military also uses the term ''[[paltik]]'' to specifically refer to a [[handgun]]. The name is probably used by the cartoonist in reference to Paltik being a smaller version of his father, Tomas, who always likes to carry big guns.\n*'''Darius and Draven''' (Darius Gerardo and Draven Bertino Sabaybunot), the couple's infant twin sons. Their first names were derived after the characters from [[League of Legends]] courtesy of Paltik while their second names are a nod after Barbie's twin uncles.\n\n====Igno====\n'''Igno''' (Benigno Ramos; not to be confused with the [[Benigno Ramos|Sakdalista movement founder of the same name]]) \u2013 Introduced to the series in 1998 as a bodyguard for Mao's son Jong, Igno is Tomas' cousin and an ex-convict from the actual National Bilibid Prison in [[Muntinlupa]]. He claims he was incarcerated because of a [[Breach of Contract]] with his former boss, who employed him as a bodyguard. Possibly due to his being an ex-convict, he is actually more competent in survival skills than his cousin. He specializes in \"improvised weapons employment\", and even took a part-time job as a [[bounty hunter]] at one time in order to earn some cash. He drinks very often, but is afraid of ghosts and the supernatural. In fact, his frequent drinking caused his breath, blood and urine to become highly flammable, especially while drunk. Igno is also extremely tough and invulnerable, able to shrug off most things that, at worst, would have destroyed a normal person's body. His name is a play on ''[[wikt:ignoramus|ignoramus]]''. At the end of the Returnee, Igno starts his own high-tech greenhouse beside his kubo. During the epilogue chapters of the \"Dugo ng Shinobi\" Arc, 33 years later, an aged Igno is still seen to be in good health despite his history of maintaining a very dangerous and unhealthy lifestyle.\n\n===The Lamouns===\n<!--To whoever edits this article, please don't overflow this article too much. You don't have to tell all. Thank you.-->\n''Lamon'' is a Tagalog verb meaning \"to eat [food] in great quantities\", or more loosely, \"pig out\", and is commonly used as a label pertaining to one's gluttony. The surname ''was'' spelled \"Lamon\" at first.<ref name  = \"pb1\" />\n\n*'''Bab''' (Roberto Lamoun) \u2013 the resident true-blue [[hippie]] who is lazy and unemployed, although he sometimes moonlights as a folk singer and part-time [[physical education|PE]] teacher at Utoy, Paltik, and Joma's school. He is also unlucky in love, especially with Tiny, who was once his girlfriend for only two seconds. He has applied for and held many jobs over the years, but these never get off the ground. His job undertakings are described as \"first-day, last-day\" as he is often fired on his first day at work. Bab is usually referred by the rest of the community as a bad example and an occasional drug addict. When a story focuses on his addiction, he is said to be \"using\" marijuana (though one never actually sees him \"using\" the drug) and is sometimes seen with several marijuana leaves in his possession. Bab has also gotten himself infected with [[gonorrhea]] (shown in a minor arc in Pugad Baboy 19) and other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s on occasion. At the end of The Returnee story arc, the Tangeres lend Bab money so he can start his own artisanal bakery.\n*'''Jolen''' (Joanne Elena Lamoun) \u2013 Bab's much younger sister. She is more intelligent than Bab (or at least more diligent), and is often reminded by their mother never to follow in her brother's footsteps, despite the many realities her brother himself imparts to her. She is also Utoy's girlfriend and often goes out with him, though they are both only eight to nine years old. She has a speech impediment as she pronounces her k's and s's as t's. However, this only manifests itself while she is singing. ''Jolen'' or ''holen'' is the Filipino term for [[marbles]].\n*'''Tita Cel''' (Cecilia Lamoun) \u2013 Bab and Jolen's mother. She disapproves of her son and dotes on her daughter. She despises Bab's smoking vice, as this led to the death of her husband (Rodrigo Lamoun, as mentioned in ''Pugad Baboy XI''). She has no qualms in hiding her disappointment of her near-useless son and states it outright, as seen in ''Pugad Baboy X''.\n*'''Daddy''' (Rodrigo Lamoun) \u2013 Bab and Jolen's late father, and Tita Cel's husband. In one strip, it is mentioned that he died of lung cancer while working as a rabbit farmer in Tagaytay. Hence how he is used as a scare tactic by Tita Cel whenever she catches her son smoking, to no avail. It is also mentioned in one arc by Polgas (posing as Dr. Sigmund Floyd)that Bab's only fear is his father.\n\n===The Tangeres===\n<!--To whoever edits this article, please don't overflow this article too much. You don't have to tell all. Thank you.-->\n*'''Ka Noli''' (Nolasco M. Tangere) \u2013 the resident communist who is a proud member of the [[New People's Army]]. While he believes in the merits of communism and calls most of the other residents capitalists, not only does he manage to have drinking sessions with them, but he is also very good friends with them. Tomas, a natural enemy, is his best friend. Ironically, Medina says he and his son enjoy playing [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]. As time went on, his espousing of his beliefs occurred less and less frequently to the point of readers being reminded that he is of the NPA only in the most subtle of situations. As such, jokes about his Ilocano heritage and the mountain-based lifestyle that comes of being in the NPA are often cracked at his expense instead. Because of him, Tomas is able to find allies in the NPA whenever the need arises, such as in ''Retraining'', though not always. His name is derived from the title of ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'', the first novel of the Philippine national hero, [[Jose Rizal]]. Recent strips have shown that Ka Noli and his wife Ka Beza had officially defected from the [[New People's Army]], as of Pugad Baboy: The Returnee 122, updated November 29, 2016 at Rappler.com. They started their own farm beside Tomas' new training facility, specializing in exotic animals. Because they still hold socialist beliefs, they also lend money to other Pugad Baboy residents such as Dagul and Bab, so that their business benefits their neighbors and friends as well.\n*'''Joma''' (Jose Maria Tangere) \u2013 Ka Noli and Ka Beza's eldest son. While he is aware of his father's beliefs, he hangs out with Utoy and Paltik often and attends the same school they do. He is named after [[Jose Maria Sison|Jose Maria \"Joma\" Sison]], founder of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]].\n*'''Ka Beza''' (Bezalie Tangere), Ka Noli's wife, who appears to have an \"allergic reaction to soldiers,\" resulting in Tomas being her target practice whenever she's around. Just like her husband Nolasco, she had also defected from the [[New People's Army]] (as of Pugad Baboy: The Returnee 122, updated November 29, 2016 at Rappler.com.) Her name \"''Ka Beza''\", is a reference to the word ''[[Cabeza de Barangay|Cabeza]]'', which means, \"The head of a small town/county or [[barangay]]\".\n*'''Melo''' (Marx Engels Tangere), Ka Noli and Ka Beza's infant son. His name is a reference to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, co-authors of the [[Communist Manifesto]].\n\n===The Tangs===\n<!--To whoever edits this article, please don't overflow this article too much. You don't have to tell all. Thank you.-->\n*'''Mao''' (Mauricio Tang) \u2013 the resident Chinese-Filipino who hails from [[Fujian Province]] and owns a [[sari-sari store]] (a small retail store) in Pugad Baboy. He often believes in business sense, earning money and he sometimes brandishes a [[dao (sword)|sword]] on whoever earns his ire, especially those who do not pay their dues. His name is play on ''ma-utang'', which in Tagalog, translates roughly to \"one who likes to borrow money.\"\n*'''Pao''' (Paulino Tang) \u2013 the resident homosexual and Mao's son. A friend of Tiny, his tastes and attitude are typically gay. This even caused him trouble once when he was mistaken for a pregnant woman by a horde of monsters and he did not want to admit his real gender. His father once expressed disappointment over him as he remarked that Pao has a resemblance to basketball player \"[[Jerry Codi\u00f1era|Gelli Codi\u00f1ela]].\" He also owns a beauty parlor and works his way through college at the same time. His name is a play on ''pa-utang'', which, in Tagalog, translates roughly to \"Can I borrow some money?\". It is mentioned in one arc that he has a brother named \"Jong\" (Ji Ong) who works in Taiwan.\n*'''Coleen''' (Anne Coleen Tang) - Introduced to the strip in January 2013, Coleen is Pao's sister that stayed and studied in China. She is the opposite of Pao in some aspects, being a lesbian and possessing a very athletic body due to her [[vegetarianism]]. As evidenced in her exchanges with Father Marty, she's also an [[atheist]]. Her full name is a play of the Tagalog Phrase ''Ang Kulintang'', \"The ''[[Kulintang]]''\" (an indigenous musical instrument in [[Maguindanao]], Philippines).\n*'''Jong''' (Jong Tang) - Mao's other son and Pao and Coleen's brother. He resides in [[Taiwan]] and was introduced during Pugad Baboy 11 when he pays his family in the Philippines a visit. Like his father, he's a clever and cunning businessman.\n\n===The Cabalfins===\n*'''Senator Cabalfin''' (Sen. Usurpo Cabalfin) \u2013 the resident member of the [[Philippine Senate]]. He is seen more playing children's games and spending people's taxes on his own indulgences rather than doing his job as a legislator. He is created by Medina as a reflection of corrupt government officials. His personal name Usurpo is derived from the word ''usurp''. Cabalfin once served as the prime antagonist in the Conspigracy arc.\n*'''Madame Cabalfin''' (Diana Elizabeth Cabalfin), Senator Cabalfin's equally corrupt wife (based on Imelda Marcos).\n*'''Bong''' (Enrique Noel Cabalfin), Senator and Madame Cabalfin's son and Sen. Cabalfin's only legitimate child, who is not really part of the inner circle of the other four kids.\n\n===Other characters===\n*'''Joboy''' (Joey Boy Llabe) \u2013 the resident mechanic who has a knack for cars and often likes to drive fast (in fact, he is a speed maniac). His last name is the Filipino word for wrench, from the Spanish ''llave''.  Formerly the fattest resident of Pugad Baboy but due to acquiring [[Diabetes]], his diet had reduced his weight significantly.\n*'''Father Marty''' (Fr. Mario Martinez), the town Priest and Bab's priest-friend, he studied canon law at the Vatican before moving back to Pugad Baboy. \n*'''Tata Mads''' (Amado Pascala) \u2013 the resident musician who once taught Tiny voice lessons and sometimes comes to Dagul to comment on his awful singing. His name is a play on ''tamad'' (\"lazy\") due to the seemingly easy-going lifestyle of musicians and other people in the field of creative arts; though his appearances in the strip have decreased over the years, he does not appear to be truly lazy.\n*'''Doc Sebo''' (Miguel Sebo, MD) \u2013 the resident physician who specializes in [[circumcision]], but is generally shown to be weak and incompetent in anything else in his profession. In early strips, he prescribes only one kind of medicine  \u2013 aspirin. ''Sebo'' is Tagalog for congealed fat or solidified lard.\n*'''Miss Nobatos''' (Eusebia Nobatos) \u2013 Utoy, Paltik, Joma, and Jolen's teacher. She often rages at Paltik for his jokes and actions, particularly when he refers to her as a horse, and takes too many doses of aspirin because of him and any other shenanigans her other students cause. Her name is a play on the Spanish term ''novatos'', meaning \"new race horse.\"\n*'''Patrolman Durugas''' (PFC Romeo Durugas) \u2013 a police officer who often apprehends drivers mostly for no apparent reason and receives bribes from them. Dagul happens to be one of those disgruntled motorists. He is created by Medina based on the Filipinos' general view on policemen as corrupt. In Tagalog, ''mandurugas'' means \"one who cheats\".\n\n===Recurring minor characters===\nThere are also recurring characters in the strip, including: \n*'''Barbie's mother''' (unnamed), the stereotypical mother-in-law for Tomas from Para\u00f1aque who rues about death and her home city's water problem;\n*'''Dagul's mother''' (Brenda), an ironically thin yet overly concerned woman;\n*'''Boy Bura and Boy Tibar''' (real names never mentioned), bodyguards of the Cabalfin family;\n*'''Lucio''' (last name never mentioned), Sen. Cabalfin's accountant;\n*'''Attorney Adriano''' (first name never mentioned), the fiscal;\n*'''Doctor Rosa''', a dentist who scares her patient with a pair of dental pliers whenever she gets agitated or teased by the characters;\n*'''\"Principal Schwarzenegger\"''' (Arnold Palacio), the ugly school principal who is as exasperated as Miss Nobatos when it comes to seeing Paltik in his office;\n*'''Nadir Hamid Mohammad''', Kules's employer and is the subject of many smelly jokes as part of the Filipino stereotypical view that Arabs are foul-smelling;\n*'''Jacques Vousvoulez''', Dagul's French employer and the head chef of the hotel where Dagul works. His name is a French stylization of \"bubuli\", the Filipino word for skink. It was revealed by Debbie that his wife's name is Fifi;\n*'''Rosanna''' (last name not mentioned), a buxom local [[mestiza]], who as part of a running gag, is a frequent victim of [[coconut]] thieves (often Bab, Tomas and Igno) but not before being viewed naked by these thieves through her window. Her character and name are based on the sexy Filipina actress, [[Rosanna Roces]];\n*'''Frostee''' (a play on the word ''prostitute'', of which she is), the sexy Japayuki (a female Filipino worker in Japan);\n*'''Mang Igme''' (full name never mentioned), a [[fishball]] vendor who believes that the fishball industry is the solution to the poverty in the Philippines;\n*'''Brando''', Tiny's current boyfriend, being a chef from Malate has unfortunately earned him the ire of the very much paranoid Mang Dagul, who feels the former will replace him as the family's chef. However, Dagul seems to have grown a little more comfortable with him as he no longer seems to hold anything against him sometimes;\n*The '''Los Kosas Muntinlupas''', a trio of fellow ex-inmates and Igno's supposed friends. '''Wakali''' who is bald and has a mole on his nose, '''Lino''' who is the skinny one, and '''Don''' who has a shaved head and moustache. Though they have appeared on previous book covers and have a cameo appearance in ''[[Benigno Ramos: Bounty Hunter]]'', they are introduced properly in Pugad Baboy XX;\n*'''Dado''' (Dado Galang, M.D.), a practicing veterinarian, Dado's most notable trait is an unusual brand of lycanthropy -a result of his mother's maternal craving for dog meat- which he can control and benefit from outside his werewolf form in terms of his sensory abilities. Originating from Pampanga, he has since moved to Manila and occasionally returns to aid Polgas in other battles, such as in ''The Bourne Ambrosity''; and others.\n*'''Amir Saeed''' \u2013 Mandana's partner and subordinate. It was revealed by Polgas that he is [[British-Pakistani]]. His surname, however, was not revealed. \n*'''Ms. Winnie Catala''' &ndash; Pugad Baboy Academy Librarian. Only seen in some few strips in various book compilations. Her name was revealed in Pugad Baboy 24, page 2. She despises loud noises and unruly behavior inside the Pugad Baboy Library.\n*'''Penny''' - the newest character of Pugad Baboy and she was introduced to the strip in December 2016, dubbed as a small female person, she was a cashier in Bab's Bakeshop, she's previously worked with Pao in a Beauty Hair Salon, and she's also Bab's secretary, accountant and saleswoman in the bakeshop.\n*'''Osep''' \u2013 the delivery and errand boy of Bab's Bakeshop. An impatient and short-tempered PWD with [[Poliomyelitis]].\n*'''Ken''' \u2013 a [[deaf]] PWD who works as a waiter for the restaurant of the Sungcals.\n*'''Alice''' \u2013 Doc. Sebo's [[Nurse]]. An outstanding Nurse despite having [[Down syndrome]].\n*'''Annie''' \u2013 the Head of Charcuterie at the Tangere Family's Farm. Despite being blind, she had a very keen sense of smell and revealed herself to be a psychic.\n*'''Mr. Severo Morales''' \u2013 the resident bitter old man. He is judgmental and cares a lot of being politically correct. His favorite pastime is visiting popular websites looking for comments that can offend him in order to have an excuse to enter an argument.\n*'''Nash''' \u2013 Coleen's [[Dwarf (mythology)|Dwarf]] friend. Initially, he was dismissed as a figment of Coleen's imagination until Annie, revealed to have a [[Third eye|Third Eye]] confirmed his existence.\n*'''Pablo''' \u2013 the local [[Shinobi]] and later [[Samurai]] vigilante that protects the Pugad Baboy's indigenous settlement, 'Manggahan' from evil elements.\n\nOther minor characters in the strips serve as antagonists to the residents. ''See: [[Villains of Pugad Baboy]]''. On the other hand, the Pugad Baboy gang are often aided by friends and acquaintances they meet during these escapades. See each article of the story arcs for info on these allies.\n\nProminent personalities, both local and foreign, have also made [[cameo appearance]]s in ''Pugad Baboy''. Among them are presidents [[Fidel Ramos|Ramos]], [[Joseph Estrada|Estrada]], and [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Arroyo]], [[Modern Arnis|martial artist]] [[Ernesto Presas]], politicians [[Robert Jaworski]], [[Rene Saguisag]] and [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]], singer [[Freddie Aguilar]], comedian [[Leo Martinez]], boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Mel Gibson]], and [[Michael Jackson]].\n\nMedina drew many of the above minor characters for the covers of some compilations, but these did not appear in the selected strips. Some of these appeared either earlier in the comic strip's run (such as Father Marty) while others were just mere extras (such as the Los Kosas Muntinlupas, Igno's former fellow inmates in Bilibid Prison). Many of these were only given official names in \"character guide\" supplements in compilations (such as the inmates and the school principal, mostly hitherto unnamed). These names are then carried over to future strips.\n\n==Stylistic elements==\n[[British English]] words are prevalent in the strip (like ''-ise'' words) and Medina uses these kinds of words in his own write-ups.\n\n===Age===\nThe characters are typically ageless, and their actual ages are usually vague. The few characters whose present ages are stated are Dagul (48), and the kids (8 or 9). Utoy and 'Adre are the only characters to have visibly aged in the strip through the years, barring flashbacks (Utoy first appeared as a baby; 'Adre has lately lost some of his hair). A \"holdover hippie\" from the 1960s, Bab nevertheless seems to be only in his twenties or thirties, which would be impossible in real life. In the early-1990s story arc ''Ang Hiwaga ng Due\u00f1as'' (published in ''Pugad Baboy 4'') the [[faith healing|faith healer]] Mang Danilo, an old acquaintance, mentions that Bab was teenaged at the time of [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] (Bab immediately covers the faith healer's mouth as the word \"Woodstock\" is mentioned). A series of strips published in ''Pugad Baboy X'' (1998) implies that Bab is at least over 28 years old. In the same compilation, Tita Cel mentions that Jolen is 27 years younger than Bab and since the stock age of the Pugad Baboy children is 8\u20139, Bab is possibly 35\u201336.<ref name = \"pb10\" /> The first volume of the Polgas Comics collections has a story called \"Class Reunion\" illustrated by Jerald Dorado which has Bab attending an elementary class reunion for the 'Batch of 1969' which further enforces this view of his age.\n\n===Recurring jokes===\nOne of the strip's [[running gag]]s is the depiction (or at least the description) of Arabs having very foul [[body odor]]. Examples of this running gag are Kules' Saudi friend, which the former calls ''Lancaster'' (because the friend smells like the ''langka'' or [[jack fruit]]), and the stinky concentrated chemical agent PSSI (''pawis ng singit ng sundalong Iraqi'' or Iraqi soldier's jock sweat) mentioned in the story arc ''The Baguio Connection''. This running gag is likely based on the author's personal experience. It is also reasonable, considering that the desert atmosphere in most Arab countries prevents their people from taking daily baths.\nOther such gags include the monotonous diet of chicken in Saudi Arabia (also likely based on personal experience), Paltik's blatant aversion to the \"[[coming of age]]\" ritual of circumcision, and Polgas and Dagul de-appetizing Debbie on the breakfast table. And steriotyped Iraqis are seen in earlier works.\n\n===Authorial presence===\nMedina usually voices out his takes on events, people and the like through Polgas and Mang Dagul. (Polgas is also recurringly shown as a comic strip artist, like his creator.) According to Medina, the characters he most identifies with are Polgas, Mang Dagul, and Utoy; like him, they wear earrings on their left ears.<ref name = \"pb9\">''Pugad Baboy 9''</ref> Medina himself has even appeared once in the strip proper, holding a cartooning workshop in [[Palawan]], though he avoids breaking the [[fourth wall]] by not referring to himself as the strip's creator.<ref name = \"pb12\">''Pugad Baboy XII''</ref>\n\n==Major story arcs==\nAs mentioned earlier in this article, the strip does not showcase domestic life alone as Medina has created story arcs which involve the various characters in adventurous, dramatic or other plotted situations.\n\nThere is no standard as how long a story arc may last, since it can run from several weeks to a few months. The story arc is only titled when it is included in a compilation.\n\nThis list below contains named story arcs that last at least 15 strips long and which compilation each appears.\n\n*''[[Bakasyon]]'' (15 strips, ''The Best of Pugad Baboy'') - The gang's vacation in La Union is rudely interrupted by Taokoy (mermen).\n*''[[Baboy Scouts]]'' (24 strips, ''Pugad Baboy 3'') - The kids go on a camping trip with their Scoutmaster, and are captured by a band of Amazons who want the Scoutmaster to impregnate their queen!\n*''[[Wisedog]]'' (17 strips, ''Pugad Baboy 3'') - Polgas, alias Wisedog, investigates a series of pet dog disappearances.\n*''[[The Baguio Connection]]'' (51 strips, ''Pugad Baboy 3'') - Kules, Tomas, Noli, Bab, Joboy and Pao, plus Wisedog, investigate ube jam spiked with cannabias sativa in Baguio.\n*''[[Retraining (Pugad Baboy story arc)|Retraining]]'' (45 strips, ''Pugad Baboy 4'') - Tomas is sent for retraining, and soon becomes involved in stopping a ring that sells children to gay pedophiles\n*''[[The Malunggay Conflict]]'' (30 strips, ''Pugad Baboy 4'') - in Ilocos, the gang must help Ka Kwate fight off the attempted annexation of his land by Ka Damuseyn (parody of the First Gulf War).\n*''[[Ang Hiwaga ng Due\u00f1as]]'' (52 strips, ''Pugad Baboy 4'') - the gang's vacation in Due\u00f1as turns into a rescue mission when Pao is mistaken for a pregnant woman, and kidnapped by supernatural beings to use as a human sacrifice.\n*''[[Feminist (Pugad Baboy story arc)|Feminist]]'' (34 strips, ''PB5'') - Barbie and Debbie take on Tomas and Dagul in a battle to prove who is the weaker sex.\n*''[[Olympig Games]]'' (19 strips, ''PB5'') - the Pugad Baby residents compete in a series of hilarious Olympic-style games featuring traditional Filipino events such as patintero, gagamba (spider) fighting, Tex and holen (marbles).\n*''[[2078 (Pugad Baboy story arc)|2078]]'' (45 strips, ''PB5'') - the gang get transported to 2078, learning about the future of the Philippines.

This story arc (which appeared in ''Disi-Sais!'') is relatively short at only nine strips long. Since that arc, it took Medina three years before he came up with ''Benigno Ramos: Bounty Hunter'', and then another three with ''Bodyguard''.\n\n==Books and merchandise==\nThe first compilation of ''Pugad Baboy'' comic strips was originally part of a thesis by Frank Aldana, a student of [[De La Salle University-Manila|De La Salle University]]. This compilation became so popular that Medina himself made more. Typically, a new compilation is released near the start of each year.

It was intended to be the first of a graphic novel series called ''Polgas \u2013 Ang Asong Hindi'', but was made a stand-alone graphic novel because of the time and effort given to its creation, as well as the seriousness and darkness of its story compared to the hilarity of ''Pugad Baboy'' itself.\n* Two ''Polgas \u2013 Ang Asong Hindi'' books actually appeared, sporting a smaller, regular-sized format than ''Pirata''. Printed in black and white, unlike ''Pirata'', they were produced as a joint effort between Medina and the Alamat Comics Group, an independent comics company. These books were ''Baboyani'' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''baboy'' and ''bayani'', Filipino for \"hero\") an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] adventure which recasts the characters as rebels in the late-19th century [[Philippine Revolution]] against Spanish rule; and ''Conspigracy'', a story that takes place during an excursion in [[Laguna province|Laguna]]. Nolan Clemente (who is credited as Medina's inspiration for the character Ka Noli) wrote the scripts for both books. In actuality, Medina only contributed the art for the covers and title pages; the rest of the art was done by other artists. The afterword for the second book teased the production of a third story which would supposedly see the Pugad Baboy characters go into space, but this was never produced.<br/>[[Image:Polgaspigurine.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Christmas-themed '''Polgas P-gurine''' c. 1995]]\n*''Pugad Baboy Adbyenturs'' featuring an original story called Gayuma, set sometime after Pugad Baboy 3. The story had Bab finally succeed in convincing Tiny to fall in love with him, while also coming up against a familiar foe. The comic was illustrated in full color by artists from Alamat, where Medina was only somewhat involved. The story was written by Eric Santos, who also co-wrote Conspigracy. \n*''Polgas'' comics \u2013 a \"magazine\" of original strips by Medina and other artists which also contained a spoof \"[[horoscope]]\" and some exotic recipes, saw at least two issues.\n\nThe popularity of ''Pugad Baboy'' also spawned some merchandise such as DogStyle Apparel and Polgas P-gurines (a set of figurines depicting Polgas and some Polgas characters). They are currently distributed by Medina's company, Pol Medina Jr. Novelties.\n\nOn September 25, 1993, ''Pugad Baboy'' was made into a live-action TV show called ''Rated PB (Pang-Bayan) \u2013 Pugad Baboy Sa TV''. Directed by [[Leo Martinez]], the show featured [[Edgar Mortiz]] (Bab), [[Giselle Sanchez]] (Brosia) and [[Rudy Meyer]] (Mang Dagul) among the cast. Though the show was live-action, the opening logo featured limited animation. Some of the episodes were based upon earlier plots in the strip, while others followed a skit show format. It was aired on [[GMA Network|GMA 7]] and lasted only two seasons, 15 episodes in all.\n\nIn the ninth book, Medina states that he dreams of making a ''Pugad Baboy'' [[cartoon]].\n\nBesides ''Pugad Baboy'' books, Medina has also published compilations of his [[editorial cartoon]]s for the ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'', called the ''Ink and Politics'' series. The cartoons sometimes feature ''Pugad Baboy'' characters. Polgas always appears on covers of these books. Three books have been published as the newspaper stopped hiring him as substitute political cartoonist in around 2006.\n\nMedina includes photos and caricatures of himself in some of the strip's compilations.\n\nSome ''Pugad Baboy'' characters can be seen on the ads of [[Dencio's]], a notable restaurant chain in the Philippines. They are also featured as endorsers of Quake Overload Cakes, a line of pastries made by snack company [[Universal Robina|Jack 'N Jill]]. Animation has been done by another great Pinoy artist, [[Arnold Arre]]\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spot.ph/gallery/996/top-10-new-pinoy-komiks-characters/article/47846#pid=14293 |title=Top 10 New Pinoy Komiks Characters &#124; GALLERY &#124; SPOT.ph: Your One-Stop Urban Lifestyle Guide to the Best of Manila |publisher=Spot.ph |date=1988-05-18 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Prone to spam|date=September 2013}}\n{{Z148}}<!--     {{No more links}}\n\n       Please be cautious adding more external links.\n\nWikipedia is not a collection of links and should not be used for advertising.\n\n     Excessive or inappropriate links will be removed.\n\n See [[Wikipedia:External links]] and [[Wikipedia:Spam]] for details.\n\nIf there are already suitable links, propose additions or replacements on\nthe article's talk page, or submit your link to the relevant category at \nthe Open Directory Project (dmoz.org) and link there using {{Dmoz}}.\n\n-->\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/19981212031939/http://www.pmjunior.com.ph/ Pol Medina's official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313204203/http://www.pugadbaboy.pardinas.net/ Unofficial Website of Pugad Baboy]\n{{Pugad Baboy}}\n\n[[Category:Pugad Baboy]]\n[[Category:1988 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Philippine culture]]\n[[Category:Philippine comic strips]]\n[[Category:Philippine Daily Inquirer]]\n[[Category:Fictional families]]\n[[Category:Fictional Filipino people]]\n[[Category:Satirical comics]]\n[[Category:Political comic strips]]\n[[Category:Slice of life comics]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comic strip\n| title = Pugad Baboy\n| image = [[Image:PBCover.jpg|250px]]\n| caption = Cover of ''Katorse'' (2002), the 14th compilation of Pugad Baboy, which features all major characters of the comic strip series.\n| author = [[Pol Medina, Jr.]]\n| url = {{URL|rappler.com/pugad-baboy}}\n| rss=\n| atom =\n| status = Monday\u2013Saturday\n| first = {{start date|1988|05|15}} ([[Philippine Daily Inquirer|PDI]])<br>{{start date|2013|06|17}} ([[Rappler]])<br>{{end date|2018|03|05}} ([[Philippine Star]])\n| last = {{end date|2013|06|04}} ([[Philippine Daily Inquirer|PDI]])<br>{{end date|2018|03|01}} ([[Rappler]])<br>{{end date|2019|03|09}} ([[Philippine Star]])\n| syndicate =\n| publisher = [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] (formerly), [[The Philippine Star]] (formerly)\n| genre = Humor, political satire\n| rating =\n| preceded by =\n| followed by =\n}}\n\n'''''Pugad Baboy''''' (literally, \"swine's nest\" in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) is a [[comic strip]] created by [[Filipino people|Filipino]] cartoonist [[Pol Medina, Jr.|Apolonio \"Pol\" Medina, Jr.]] The strip is about a [[Manila]] community of mostly obese people \u2013 \"fat as pigs\", so to speak (''baboy'' is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for pig).\n\nIt started appearing in the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' on May 18, 1988, and was published exclusively in the Inquirer line of newspapers (Broadsheet ''Inquirer'' and its free concise sister tabloid called ''[[Inquirer Libre]]'' and tabloids ''Bandera'' and ''Tumbok''.) Its popularity has spawned numerous compilations, a live-action television series, and merchandise such as T-shirts and [[figurine]]s.\n\nThe strip not only showcases domestic life; occasionally, it features adventure, drama, and pure spoof sequences. More often, the strip mirrors the general sentiment of the Filipino people on relevant topics such as corruption in the government as well as Filipino pop culture. In this respect, the strip has been likened to [[Garry Trudeau]]'s ''[[Doonesbury]]''.<ref>Quiambao, Cecilia (1993).

A full-color [[Sunday strip]] in the same paper debuted on October 3, 2004. The full-colored strips ended their run sometime in 2009. Before the tabloid ''Inquirer Libre'' debuted, the strip appeared exclusively in the ''Inquirer'' broadsheet.\n\nIn a strip published in September 2006, Medina commented on online life substituting for physical contact. He mentioned Wikipedia as one of the alternatives to library visits, the other being [[Google]].\n\nThe Inquirer decided to discontinue carrying ''Pugad Baboy'' in its comics section beginning June 5, 2013, after a strip for the June 4 edition reportedly lambasted hypocrisy among Christians against homosexuals when certain sectarian schools condone such students among their ranks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cerda |first=Jovan |url=http://www.philstar.com/campus/2013/06/06/950822/pdi-cancels-comic-strip-implying-pretty-students-girls-school-are-lesbians |title=PDI cancels comic strip implying pretty students from girls' school are lesbians &#124; Campus, Special Reports, Home |publisher=philstar.com |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}</ref> The newspaper later clarified that the cartoonist was not actually fired and the strip would just be suspended from publication until an internal investigation had been carried out.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/philippine-comic-strip-suspended-over-lesbian-joke-075132743.html | title=Philippine daily sorry for lesbian comic strip joke | publisher=AFP News (through Yahoo!

Thank you.-->\nThe Sungcal family reflects aspects of traditional and stereotypical families, with a housewife and an overseas contract worker as members, with a domestic helper to supplement. \"Sungkal\" is a Tagalog word for the term \"digging a hole with a (pig's) snout\".\n\n*'''Dagul''' (Adagulfo Sungcal Jr.), often referred to with the title ''Mang'' (Mister)  \u2013 i.e. '''Mang Dagul''' \u2013 The patriarch of the family. He works as a chef in a five-star hotel where he specializes in unorthodox dishes. He is often shown at home, usually voicing out on the state of affairs in the Philippines. He is also highly xenophobic. Over the years, he studies different martial arts like [[karate]], [[arnis]] and [[aikido]] (like Medina), and he also dabbles in tennis and golf. He calls his wife \"Honeycured.\" \"Dagul\" is Filipino slang for someone or something big. At the end of The Returnee story arc, the Tangeres lend Dagul money so he can quit his job and start his own small restaurant in his house's front yard.\n*'''Debbie''' (Debra Anne Sungcal) \u2013 The matriarch of the family, a loving traditional housewife and mother. Her recurring traits include a love for bargain shopping, indecision regarding actual purchases (sometimes on purpose), and complaining about decisions she lets Dagul make (much to Dagul's annoyance and regret). Also, she extremely highly dislikes any honest opinion Dagul gives her about her figure and/or clothes she wears or tries on \u2013 to the point of throwing him out of the house, despite her demanding honest opinions in the first place. She is also the constant victim of disgusting table conversations between her husband, Polgas and sometimes with Utoy. She calls her husband \"Sweet Ham.\"\n*'''Kules''' (Hercules Sungcal) \u2013 The eldest son, a building engineer in [[Saudi Arabia]]. When not working, he reads letters from pen pals, goes on blind dates (usually with funny consequences), hangs out with his friend 'Adre (short for ''compadre''; see below), or thinks about the events back in the Philippines. Much like Kules, Medina was formerly a contract worker in Saudi Arabia. The origin of his name is often mistaken to be that of the [[Hercules|legendary Greek hero of the same name]], when in fact, he is named after the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] aircraft. After getting married to Mandana, Kules resigned from his overseas job and returned to Pugad Baboy for good, sporting longer hair.\n*'''Tiny''' (Cristina Sungcal) \u2013 The teenage daughter. Her name is not only an obvious misnomer, but also a testament to her vanity and denial regarding her size. She asserts herself as sexy and repeatedly insists that her waistline is 28&nbsp;inches (the last time this was true was when she was 9 or 10 years old). She does commit herself to [[dieting|diet]]s that often end in failure. Her cooking leaves much to be desired by her family, and is sometimes inedible (in one strip she naively uses [[papaya]] soap in place of the fruit). She studies in the [[University of Santo Tomas]], where Medina graduated in 1983 with a degree in architecture. There, she takes up [[mass communication]], a course the university does not actually offer. She is currently being courted by Brando, whose name is always mistaken by Bab and Dagul, and Tiny correcting them all the time. But in the beginning she allowed herself to be courted by Bab, and this happened only for a short period of time. She also is a [[cosplaying]] enthusiast.\n*'''Utoy''' (Adagulfo Sungcal III) \u2013 The youngest son. Intelligent and musically talented (playing the saxophone), he behaves much like other children his age. Medina initially depicted him as a clueless [[infant]], but he later aged him to about eight years old probably to give a child's insight on current events (eight is also the age of most of the child characters in this strip). Despite his youth, he claims Jolen as his girlfriend. In a \"[[Baboy Scouts|Boy Scout]]\" story arc, Medina gives him an absurdly versatile [[Swiss Army Knife]] (apart from the usual tools, his knife comes equipped with such things as a refrigerator, a [[Nintendo]] video game console ''complete with television'', and an all-terrain vehicle).<ref name = \"pb3\">''Pugad Baboy 3''</ref> The tool returns in Pugad Baboy 25 with a mini-sniper rifle that fires foam pellets.\n*'''Mandana''' (Mandana Ahmadi-Sungcal) \u2013 Kules' wife, and a spy of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin. Known as the \"most hated by the Muslims who give Islam a bad name,\" Mandana amassed a huge amount of fortune from collecting bounties of famous terrorists. Among her modus operandi is to convince wives of terrorists to betray them and become her informant. How and when she fell in love with Kules is unknown, but she ordered her partner Amir to offer Kules dowries to marry her. When a group of Islamists kidnapped Kules and ordered Mandana to bomb the US Embassy in exchange for her fiance's life, she did not hesitate and obliged. She was assumed killed in action - Kules shot her to save the Embassy, though the boat she was piloting still destroyed it. However, it was later revealed that she faked her death in order to deceive the Muslim extremists on her trail, and that what Kules shot was a dummy. It was heavily implied that non-terrorist casualties in the Embassy destruction were faked also in order to throw off the Muslim extremists. She re-emerged and reunited with Kules after five years, marrying in a civil ceremony in Tagaytay. She can finally speak [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] fluently, as seen in the March 21, 2016 strip [http://www.rappler.com/pugad-baboy/126558-no-religion here] and as of January 25, 2018 [https://www.rappler.com/pugad-baboy/194423-barbari-in-the-oven here], she's pregnant with her and Kules' first child. She gave birth to a girl, while Kules was away.\n*'''Zara''' (Lazara Armaiti Sungcal) \u2013 Kules and Mandana's infant daughter. She took a lot from her Iranian heritage and her mother's temperament. She never once cried since her birth, something that Mandana claimed she got from her while admitting that her first time crying was when she shot her father who forcefully arranged her to marry an old man.\n\n====Polgas====\n'''Polgas''' (derived from the Spanish and Tagalog ''pulgas'' for \"flea\") is the Sungcals' [[anthropomorphic]] family dog. Notable for his human characteristics such as speech, optional bipedalism, use of clothing and general behavior, he is called ''ang asong hindi'' (the dog who isn't) in material outside the strip proper because of his human characteristics. He acts as an extra member of the Sungcals and is his master Dagul's drinking buddy. However, he still behaves like a typical dog when he chooses to, though usually when he takes a bite out of people or leaks on them, most often Dagul.\n\nPolgas was initially a normal dog which walked on all fours, albeit one who wore shirts and undershirts like Dagul.<ref name = \"pb1\">''Pugad Baboy One'' (''The Very Best of Pugad Baboy'')</ref> Medina eventually gave him the ability to talk, followed by other human characteristics like a more humanlike physique. Originally, Brosia, a former [[ventriloquism|ventriloquist]], supplied Polgas's voice, but Medina was so dissatisfied with the idea that he abandoned it completely.<ref name = \"pb10\" /> Medina later explained in a 1995 spin-off graphic novel entitled ''[[Pirata (Pugad Baboy graphic novel)|Pirata]]'' that Polgas developed human characteristics due to his master's exotic version of ''bibingka'' (rice cake) and exposure to radiation emitted by television sets. Apparently, the combination had a [[teratogenic]] effect on him, somewhat similar to the mutation of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]].<ref name = \"Pirata\">''Pirata''</ref>\n\nMedina eventually developed the character into a \"man (dog) of action\", humorously saving the human characters from danger during story arcs,<ref name = \"pb3\" /><ref name = \"pb2\">''The Best of Pugad Baboy</ref> and later a full-fledged action hero involved with more serious activities.<ref name = \"pb3\" /> Polgas became a [[spy|''deep penetration'' agent]] of a fictional military division called the Organized Canine Bureau (OCB). This organization spoofs the TV series ''[[Wiseguy]]'', which features a fictional branch of the [[FBI]] called the Organized Crime Bureau, responsible for the protagonist [[Wiseguy#Vincent Terranova (Ken Wahl)|Vinnie Terranova]]'s activities.\n\nMedina's OCB was originally formed to combat the pilfering of stray dogs being sold in [[Metro Manila]] for their meat. Wisedog's second mission took place in [[Baguio City]], where the selling and eating of dog meat is an illegal industry. (See [[The Baguio Connection]]).<ref name = \"pb3\" /> Polgas's original [[call sign]] in the OCB was ''Wisedog'' (a homage to ''[[Wiseguy]]'').<ref name = \"pb3\" /> Later, he changed his call sign to ''Dobermaxx'' after he and some other residents of Pugad Baboy were accidentally sent to and returned from the year [[2078 (Pugad Baboy story arc)|2078]]. Subsequently, he is sometimes referred to as \"Agent Delta\" or simply \"Delta\".<ref name = \"pb15\">''Kinse!''</ref>\n\nAs an agent, Polgas was issued with a prototype ''garapata'' (tick) ''gun'', which shoots droplets of tick sweat that causes itching that lasts for six months.<ref name = \"pb3\" /> Later, he was issued a tiny surveillance robot flea named \"Gary\"<ref name = \"pb4\">''Pugad Baboy 4''</ref> and ballistic ''[[arnis]]'' sticks.<ref name = \"pb10\" /> After his first mission, he was issued a customized [[Porsche 959]], the ''Thunderdog''.<ref name = \"pb3\" /> As a result, from his adventure in 2078, he acquired a technologically advanced ''garapata gun''.<ref name = \"pb5\">''Pugad Baboy 5''</ref> Later he also acquired the ''Thunderpuppy'', a [[Harley Davidson#VRSC|Harley Davidson V-Rod]] motorcycle.\n\nAs Wisedog/Dobermaxx, Polgas has fought many foes over the years, ranging from the mundane (drug pushers<ref name = \"pb3\" />) to the fantastic (a lord of supernatural creatures<ref name = \"pb4\" />). His most prominent foe is Atong Damuho (Renate Domingo), erstwhile drug pusher,<ref name = \"pb3\" /> dognapper,<ref name = \"pb3\" /> illegal logger<ref name = \"pb11\">''Pugad Baboy XI''</ref> and most recently, [[Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushroom]] courier.<ref name = \"pb15\" />\n\nHe appears in many other guises such as Dr. Sigmund Floyd (a spoof of [[Sigmund Freud]]), Pol Torero ([[World Wrestling Entertainment]] or WWE's [[The Undertaker]]), Amorsolo (a non-existent [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|Ninja Turtle]]), Aquapol ([[Aquaman]]), Growlsbuster (spoofing [[Ghostbusters|The Ghostbusters]]), Darth Paul (spoofing [[Darth Maul]]), Polverine (a spoof of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], an [[X-Men]] character) and many others.\n\n===The Tangaras===\n<!--To whoever edits this article, please don't overflow this article too much. You don't have to tell all. Thank you.-->\nThe Tangaras are two siblings from Gingoog City that both share a close relationship with the Sungcals, they are one of Pugad Baboy's few thin, slim residents. Their surname is a play on ''tanga'', a Tagalog word for \"stupid\".\n\n*'''Brosia''' (Ambrosia Tangara) \u2013 The Sungcal family's housemaid. She is brainless, as characterized by her nonsensical remarks and her mesmerization by reading materials in English. Medina eventually elaborated on this trait and said she couldn't afford to advance her studies. She does possess excellent math skills regarding financial issues such as bank accounts, deposits, salary computations, currencies, etc. As said by Dagul in Pugad Baboy 17, ''\"'Pag sa pera nga pala 'di ka tanga no?''\" (\"So, you're not dumb when it comes to money, huh?\") She makes up for her general lack of intelligence (or formal schooling) with witty jokes, insults and pranks on the community's various residents. Her most frequent victim is Dagul, whose semi-baldness becomes the butt of her jokes, much to his chagrin. As revealed in ''The Bourney Ambrosity'', there was an attempt by Polgas to recruit Brosia in the OCB, under the codename of \"Amrita\", but she was unable to absorb any of the physical, linguistic, and technical training, or so they thought; the amnesia inflicted on her in the storyline brings out this myriad of abilities, including dealing with English, but appear to be inaccessible if her original Brosia persona is active.\n*'''<nowiki>'Adre</nowiki>''' (Cesar \"Butch\" Tangara) \u2013 Brosia's older brother and Kules's best friend and fellow worker in Saudi Arabia. He shares the same interests and sentiments with Kules, sometimes with photos of their penpals. His relation to Brosia was revealed when he went home to the Philippines for a vacation (Kules was also home at the time).  Adre is now also resigned from a job in Saudi Arabia following his best friend's wedding and now currently resides back to the Philippines for good. ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>Adre'' is short for ''kumpadre'' or male best friend.\n\n===The Sabaybunots===\n<!--To whoever edits this article, please don't overflow this article too much. You don't have to tell all. Thank you.-->\nThe Sabaybunots reflect a very violent but tolerably quiet household. \"''Sabay, bunot!''\" is used by the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Philippine military]] as an oral [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] command during martial ceremonies when the drawing of weapons is called for, as in the drawing of officers' swords. It roughly means \"draw simultaneously\". This may be in homage to Tomas' military background.\n\n*'''Tomas''', also known as '''Sarge''' (M/Sgt. Tomas Sabaybunot) \u2013 Representing the Philippine's military branch, he is a [[master sergeant]] of the [[Philippine Air Force]]. While said to be fearless and often trigger-happy, his \"[[chauvinist|chauvinist pig]]\" lifestyle is ironically neutralized by his dominant wife. He is often reduced to doing inane chores, and any attempt to complain about said chores results in physical battery by his wife, hilariously, to the point of that he considers wartime more peaceful than his domestic life. His name could be a pun on ''toma'', Filipino slang for alcoholic drinks; Tomas does like to drink a lot, as does his cousin Igno. Tomas also likes to spend his \"extra time\" at disco bars, though this occasionally leads him to having [[gout]]. And though he has a large collection of guns, he suffers from a severe [[fear of needles]]. At the end of The Returnee story arc, Tomas retired from the military service following his new business, a new coffee plantation and a new military training facility in Cavite. The Tangeres' new farm is right beside his new place. He was stuck in Master Sergeant rank, joking that if he became a pimp to an officer who was unnamed, he will be promoted.\n*'''Barbie''' (Barbara Q. Sabaybunot) \u2013 Tomas's wife. She frequently orders Tomas around, probably due to his chauvinism, his womanizing, and her extremely [[feminism|feministic]] views. This difference of opinion often turns into a physical altercation, such as Barbie giving a tiptoeing Tomas her trademarked [[uppercut]] whenever he arrives home in the wee hours of the morning [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] and/or smeared with the scent of women's perfume. Her maiden name (Barbie Q.) is a pun on [[barbecue]]. In ''Pugad Baboy 18'', her first name was rendered \"Barbara-Queen\" (possibly after a local barbecue franchise called ''Grill Queen''). She often spends her free time doing physical workouts (lifting weights, etc.). She is also hinted as a [[born-again Christian]], as she holds or attends prayer meetings, and describes Tomas as \"born-against,\" because of his sinful ways. Even in the realm of weapons, Barbie outguns her husband. Tomas is usually portrayed with his service pistol while Barbie often has an [[Uzi submachine gun|Uzi]]. Recently, Barbie was pregnant and born twin boys, which Tomas wanted to reach out for his friends for names, rejecting Noli's name Carl and Marcus, names made from [[Karl Marx]]. \n*'''Paltik''' (Paul Thomas Sabaybunot), the couple's eldest son. While his friend Utoy can be described as the \"brains\", he can be described as the \"[[jester]]\". Quite mischievous in many ways, he often sleeps in class and is clearly much more interested in other areas, such as teasing his buck-toothed teacher, Miss Nobatos, typically comparing her face to that of a horse. He is also fond of bribing and blackmailing his own father, usually in exchange for some pocket money or other favors. His nickname is a Filipino term that means \"homemade gun.\" The Philippine military also uses the term ''[[paltik]]'' to specifically refer to a [[handgun]]. The name is probably used by the cartoonist in reference to Paltik being a smaller version of his father, Tomas, who always likes to carry big guns.\n*'''Darius and Draven''' (Darius Gerardo and Draven Bertino Sabaybunot), the couple's infant twin sons. Their first names were derived after the characters from [[League of Legends]] courtesy of Paltik while their second names are a nod after Barbie's twin uncles.\n\n====Igno====\n'''Igno''' (Benigno Ramos; not to be confused with the [[Benigno Ramos|Sakdalista movement founder of the same name]]) \u2013 Introduced to the series in 1998 as a bodyguard for Mao's son Jong, Igno is Tomas' cousin and an ex-convict from the actual National Bilibid Prison in [[Muntinlupa]]. He claims he was incarcerated because of a [[Breach of Contract]] with his former boss, who employed him as a bodyguard. Possibly due to his being an ex-convict, he is actually more competent in survival skills than his cousin. He specializes in \"improvised weapons employment\", and even took a part-time job as a [[bounty hunter]] at one time in order to earn some cash. He drinks very often, but is afraid of ghosts and the supernatural. In fact, his frequent drinking caused his breath, blood and urine to become highly flammable, especially while drunk. Igno is also extremely tough and invulnerable, able to shrug off most things that, at worst, would have destroyed a normal person's body. His name is a play on ''[[wikt:ignoramus|ignoramus]]''. At the end of the Returnee, Igno starts his own high-tech greenhouse beside his kubo. During the epilogue chapters of the \"Dugo ng Shinobi\" Arc, 33 years later, an aged Igno is still seen to be in good health despite his history of maintaining a very dangerous and unhealthy lifestyle.\n\n===The Lamouns===\n<!--To whoever edits this article, please don't overflow this article too much. You don't have to tell all. Thank you.-->\n''Lamon'' is a Tagalog verb meaning \"to eat [food] in great quantities\", or more loosely, \"pig out\", and is commonly used as a label pertaining to one's gluttony. The surname ''was'' spelled \"Lamon\" at first.<ref name  = \"pb1\" />\n\n*'''Bab''' (Roberto Lamoun) \u2013 the resident true-blue [[hippie]] who is lazy and unemployed, although he sometimes moonlights as a folk singer and part-time [[physical education|PE]] teacher at Utoy, Paltik, and Joma's school. He is also unlucky in love, especially with Tiny, who was once his girlfriend for only two seconds. He has applied for and held many jobs over the years, but these never get off the ground. His job undertakings are described as \"first-day, last-day\" as he is often fired on his first day at work. Bab is usually referred by the rest of the community as a bad example and an occasional drug addict. When a story focuses on his addiction, he is said to be \"using\" marijuana (though one never actually sees him \"using\" the drug) and is sometimes seen with several marijuana leaves in his possession. Bab has also gotten himself infected with [[gonorrhea]] (shown in a minor arc in Pugad Baboy 19) and other [[sexually transmitted disease]]s on occasion. At the end of The Returnee story arc, the Tangeres lend Bab money so he can start his own artisanal bakery.\n*'''Jolen''' (Joanne Elena Lamoun) \u2013 Bab's much younger sister. She is more intelligent than Bab (or at least more diligent), and is often reminded by their mother never to follow in her brother's footsteps, despite the many realities her brother himself imparts to her. She is also Utoy's girlfriend and often goes out with him, though they are both only eight to nine years old. She has a speech impediment as she pronounces her k's and s's as t's. However, this only manifests itself while she is singing. ''Jolen'' or ''holen'' is the Filipino term for [[marbles]].\n*'''Tita Cel''' (Cecilia Lamoun) \u2013 Bab and Jolen's mother. She disapproves of her son and dotes on her daughter. She despises Bab's smoking vice, as this led to the death of her husband (Rodrigo Lamoun, as mentioned in ''Pugad Baboy XI''). She has no qualms in hiding her disappointment of her near-useless son and states it outright, as seen in ''Pugad Baboy X''.\n*'''Daddy''' (Rodrigo Lamoun) \u2013 Bab and Jolen's late father, and Tita Cel's husband. In one strip, it is mentioned that he died of lung cancer while working as a rabbit farmer in Tagaytay. Hence how he is used as a scare tactic by Tita Cel whenever she catches her son smoking, to no avail. It is also mentioned in one arc by Polgas (posing as Dr. Sigmund Floyd)that Bab's only fear is his father.\n\n===The Tangeres===\n<!--To whoever edits this article, please don't overflow this article too much. You don't have to tell all. Thank you.-->\n*'''Ka Noli''' (Nolasco M. Tangere) \u2013 the resident communist who is a proud member of the [[New People's Army]]. While he believes in the merits of communism and calls most of the other residents capitalists, not only does he manage to have drinking sessions with them, but he is also very good friends with them. Tomas, a natural enemy, is his best friend. Ironically, Medina says he and his son enjoy playing [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]. As time went on, his espousing of his beliefs occurred less and less frequently to the point of readers being reminded that he is of the NPA only in the most subtle of situations. As such, jokes about his Ilocano heritage and the mountain-based lifestyle that comes of being in the NPA are often cracked at his expense instead. Because of him, Tomas is able to find allies in the NPA whenever the need arises, such as in ''Retraining'', though not always. His name is derived from the title of ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'', the first novel of the Philippine national hero, [[Jose Rizal]]. Recent strips have shown that Ka Noli and his wife Ka Beza had officially defected from the [[New People's Army]], as of Pugad Baboy: The Returnee 122, updated November 29, 2016 at Rappler.com. They started their own farm beside Tomas' new training facility, specializing in exotic animals. Because they still hold socialist beliefs, they also lend money to other Pugad Baboy residents such as Dagul and Bab, so that their business benefits their neighbors and friends as well.\n*'''Joma''' (Jose Maria Tangere) \u2013 Ka Noli and Ka Beza's eldest son. While he is aware of his father's beliefs, he hangs out with Utoy and Paltik often and attends the same school they do. He is named after [[Jose Maria Sison|Jose Maria \"Joma\" Sison]], founder of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]].\n*'''Ka Beza''' (Bezalie Tangere), Ka Noli's wife, who appears to have an \"allergic reaction to soldiers,\" resulting in Tomas being her target practice whenever she's around. Just like her husband Nolasco, she had also defected from the [[New People's Army]] (as of Pugad Baboy: The Returnee 122, updated November 29, 2016 at Rappler.com.) Her name \"''Ka Beza''\", is a reference to the word ''[[Cabeza de Barangay|Cabeza]]'', which means, \"The head of a small town/county or [[barangay]]\".\n*'''Melo''' (Marx Engels Tangere), Ka Noli and Ka Beza's infant son. His name is a reference to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, co-authors of the [[Communist Manifesto]].\n\n===The Tangs===\n<!--To whoever edits this article, please don't overflow this article too much. You don't have to tell all. Thank you.-->\n*'''Mao''' (Mauricio Tang) \u2013 the resident Chinese-Filipino who hails from [[Fujian Province]] and owns a [[sari-sari store]] (a small retail store) in Pugad Baboy. He often believes in business sense, earning money and he sometimes brandishes a [[dao (sword)|sword]] on whoever earns his ire, especially those who do not pay their dues. His name is play on ''ma-utang'', which in Tagalog, translates roughly to \"one who likes to borrow money.\"\n*'''Pao''' (Paulino Tang) \u2013 the resident homosexual and Mao's son. A friend of Tiny, his tastes and attitude are typically gay. This even caused him trouble once when he was mistaken for a pregnant woman by a horde of monsters and he did not want to admit his real gender. His father once expressed disappointment over him as he remarked that Pao has a resemblance to basketball player \"[[Jerry Codi\u00f1era|Gelli Codi\u00f1ela]].\" He also owns a beauty parlor and works his way through college at the same time. His name is a play on ''pa-utang'', which, in Tagalog, translates roughly to \"Can I borrow some money?\". It is mentioned in one arc that he has a brother named \"Jong\" (Ji Ong) who works in Taiwan.\n*'''Coleen''' (Anne Coleen Tang) - Introduced to the strip in January 2013, Coleen is Pao's sister that stayed and studied in China. She is the opposite of Pao in some aspects, being a lesbian and possessing a very athletic body due to her [[vegetarianism]]. As evidenced in her exchanges with Father Marty, she's also an [[atheist]]. Her full name is a play of the Tagalog Phrase ''Ang Kulintang'', \"The ''[[Kulintang]]''\" (an indigenous musical instrument in [[Maguindanao]], Philippines).\n*'''Jong''' (Jong Tang) - Mao's other son and Pao and Coleen's brother. He resides in [[Taiwan]] and was introduced during Pugad Baboy 11 when he pays his family in the Philippines a visit. Like his father, he's a clever and cunning businessman.\n\n===The Cabalfins===\n*'''Senator Cabalfin''' (Sen. Usurpo Cabalfin) \u2013 the resident member of the [[Philippine Senate]]. He is seen more playing children's games and spending people's taxes on his own indulgences rather than doing his job as a legislator. He is created by Medina as a reflection of corrupt government officials. His personal name Usurpo is derived from the word ''usurp''. Cabalfin once served as the prime antagonist in the Conspigracy arc.\n*'''Madame Cabalfin''' (Diana Elizabeth Cabalfin), Senator Cabalfin's equally corrupt wife (based on Imelda Marcos).\n*'''Bong''' (Enrique Noel Cabalfin), Senator and Madame Cabalfin's son and Sen. Cabalfin's only legitimate child, who is not really part of the inner circle of the other four kids.\n\n===Other characters===\n*'''Joboy''' (Joey Boy Llabe) \u2013 the resident mechanic who has a knack for cars and often likes to drive fast (in fact, he is a speed maniac). His last name is the Filipino word for wrench, from the Spanish ''llave''.  Formerly the fattest resident of Pugad Baboy but due to acquiring [[Diabetes]], his diet had reduced his weight significantly.\n*'''Father Marty''' (Fr. Mario Martinez), the town Priest and Bab's priest-friend, he studied canon law at the Vatican before moving back to Pugad Baboy. \n*'''Tata Mads''' (Amado Pascala) \u2013 the resident musician who once taught Tiny voice lessons and sometimes comes to Dagul to comment on his awful singing. His name is a play on ''tamad'' (\"lazy\") due to the seemingly easy-going lifestyle of musicians and other people in the field of creative arts; though his appearances in the strip have decreased over the years, he does not appear to be truly lazy.\n*'''Doc Sebo''' (Miguel Sebo, MD) \u2013 the resident physician who specializes in [[circumcision]], but is generally shown to be weak and incompetent in anything else in his profession. In early strips, he prescribes only one kind of medicine  \u2013 aspirin. ''Sebo'' is Tagalog for congealed fat or solidified lard.\n*'''Miss Nobatos''' (Eusebia Nobatos) \u2013 Utoy, Paltik, Joma, and Jolen's teacher. She often rages at Paltik for his jokes and actions, particularly when he refers to her as a horse, and takes too many doses of aspirin because of him and any other shenanigans her other students cause. Her name is a play on the Spanish term ''novatos'', meaning \"new race horse.\"\n*'''Patrolman Durugas''' (PFC Romeo Durugas) \u2013 a police officer who often apprehends drivers mostly for no apparent reason and receives bribes from them. Dagul happens to be one of those disgruntled motorists. He is created by Medina based on the Filipinos' general view on policemen as corrupt. In Tagalog, ''mandurugas'' means \"one who cheats\".\n\n===Recurring minor characters===\nThere are also recurring characters in the strip, including: \n*'''Barbie's mother''' (unnamed), the stereotypical mother-in-law for Tomas from Para\u00f1aque who rues about death and her home city's water problem;\n*'''Dagul's mother''' (Brenda), an ironically thin yet overly concerned woman;\n*'''Boy Bura and Boy Tibar''' (real names never mentioned), bodyguards of the Cabalfin family;\n*'''Lucio''' (last name never mentioned), Sen. Cabalfin's accountant;\n*'''Attorney Adriano''' (first name never mentioned), the fiscal;\n*'''Doctor Rosa''', a dentist who scares her patient with a pair of dental pliers whenever she gets agitated or teased by the characters;\n*'''\"Principal Schwarzenegger\"''' (Arnold Palacio), the ugly school principal who is as exasperated as Miss Nobatos when it comes to seeing Paltik in his office;\n*'''Nadir Hamid Mohammad''', Kules's employer and is the subject of many smelly jokes as part of the Filipino stereotypical view that Arabs are foul-smelling;\n*'''Jacques Vousvoulez''', Dagul's French employer and the head chef of the hotel where Dagul works. His name is a French stylization of \"bubuli\", the Filipino word for skink. It was revealed by Debbie that his wife's name is Fifi;\n*'''Rosanna''' (last name not mentioned), a buxom local [[mestiza]], who as part of a running gag, is a frequent victim of [[coconut]] thieves (often Bab, Tomas and Igno) but not before being viewed naked by these thieves through her window. Her character and name are based on the sexy Filipina actress, [[Rosanna Roces]];\n*'''Frostee''' (a play on the word ''prostitute'', of which she is), the sexy Japayuki (a female Filipino worker in Japan);\n*'''Mang Igme''' (full name never mentioned), a [[fishball]] vendor who believes that the fishball industry is the solution to the poverty in the Philippines;\n*'''Brando''', Tiny's current boyfriend, being a chef from Malate has unfortunately earned him the ire of the very much paranoid Mang Dagul, who feels the former will replace him as the family's chef. However, Dagul seems to have grown a little more comfortable with him as he no longer seems to hold anything against him sometimes;\n*The '''Los Kosas Muntinlupas''', a trio of fellow ex-inmates and Igno's supposed friends. '''Wakali''' who is bald and has a mole on his nose, '''Lino''' who is the skinny one, and '''Don''' who has a shaved head and moustache. Though they have appeared on previous book covers and have a cameo appearance in ''[[Benigno Ramos: Bounty Hunter]]'', they are introduced properly in Pugad Baboy XX;\n*'''Dado''' (Dado Galang, M.D.), a practicing veterinarian, Dado's most notable trait is an unusual brand of lycanthropy -a result of his mother's maternal craving for dog meat- which he can control and benefit from outside his werewolf form in terms of his sensory abilities. Originating from Pampanga, he has since moved to Manila and occasionally returns to aid Polgas in other battles, such as in ''The Bourne Ambrosity''; and others.\n*'''Amir Saeed''' \u2013 Mandana's partner and subordinate. It was revealed by Polgas that he is [[British-Pakistani]]. His surname, however, was not revealed. \n*'''Ms. Winnie Catala''' &ndash; Pugad Baboy Academy Librarian. Only seen in some few strips in various book compilations. Her name was revealed in Pugad Baboy 24, page 2. She despises loud noises and unruly behavior inside the Pugad Baboy Library.\n*'''Penny''' - the newest character of Pugad Baboy and she was introduced to the strip in December 2016, dubbed as a small female person, she was a cashier in Bab's Bakeshop, she's previously worked with Pao in a Beauty Hair Salon, and she's also Bab's secretary, accountant and saleswoman in the bakeshop.\n*'''Osep''' \u2013 the delivery and errand boy of Bab's Bakeshop. An impatient and short-tempered PWD with [[Poliomyelitis]].\n*'''Ken''' \u2013 a [[deaf]] PWD who works as a waiter for the restaurant of the Sungcals.\n*'''Alice''' \u2013 Doc. Sebo's [[Nurse]]. An outstanding Nurse despite having [[Down syndrome]].\n*'''Annie''' \u2013 the Head of Charcuterie at the Tangere Family's Farm. Despite being blind, she had a very keen sense of smell and revealed herself to be a psychic.\n*'''Mr. Severo Morales''' \u2013 the resident bitter old man. He is judgmental and cares a lot of being politically correct. His favorite pastime is visiting popular websites looking for comments that can offend him in order to have an excuse to enter an argument.\n*'''Nash''' \u2013 Coleen's [[Dwarf (mythology)|Dwarf]] friend. Initially, he was dismissed as a figment of Coleen's imagination until Annie, revealed to have a [[Third eye|Third Eye]] confirmed his existence.\n*'''Pablo''' \u2013 the local [[Shinobi]] and later [[Samurai]] vigilante that protects the Pugad Baboy's indigenous settlement, 'Manggahan' from evil elements.\n\nOther minor characters in the strips serve as antagonists to the residents. ''See: [[Villains of Pugad Baboy]]''. On the other hand, the Pugad Baboy gang are often aided by friends and acquaintances they meet during these escapades. See each article of the story arcs for info on these allies.\n\nProminent personalities, both local and foreign, have also made [[cameo appearance]]s in ''Pugad Baboy''. Among them are presidents [[Fidel Ramos|Ramos]], [[Joseph Estrada|Estrada]], and [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Arroyo]], [[Modern Arnis|martial artist]] [[Ernesto Presas]], politicians [[Robert Jaworski]], [[Rene Saguisag]] and [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]], singer [[Freddie Aguilar]], comedian [[Leo Martinez]], boxer [[Manny Pacquiao]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Mel Gibson]], and [[Michael Jackson]].\n\nMedina drew many of the above minor characters for the covers of some compilations, but these did not appear in the selected strips. Some of these appeared either earlier in the comic strip's run (such as Father Marty) while others were just mere extras (such as the Los Kosas Muntinlupas, Igno's former fellow inmates in Bilibid Prison). Many of these were only given official names in \"character guide\" supplements in compilations (such as the inmates and the school principal, mostly hitherto unnamed). These names are then carried over to future strips.\n\n==Stylistic elements==\n[[British English]] words are prevalent in the strip (like ''-ise'' words) and Medina uses these kinds of words in his own write-ups.\n\n===Age===\nThe characters are typically ageless, and their actual ages are usually vague. The few characters whose present ages are stated are Dagul (48), and the kids (8 or 9). Utoy and 'Adre are the only characters to have visibly aged in the strip through the years, barring flashbacks (Utoy first appeared as a baby; 'Adre has lately lost some of his hair). A \"holdover hippie\" from the 1960s, Bab nevertheless seems to be only in his twenties or thirties, which would be impossible in real life. In the early-1990s story arc ''Ang Hiwaga ng Due\u00f1as'' (published in ''Pugad Baboy 4'') the [[faith healing|faith healer]] Mang Danilo, an old acquaintance, mentions that Bab was teenaged at the time of [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] (Bab immediately covers the faith healer's mouth as the word \"Woodstock\" is mentioned). A series of strips published in ''Pugad Baboy X'' (1998) implies that Bab is at least over 28 years old. In the same compilation, Tita Cel mentions that Jolen is 27 years younger than Bab and since the stock age of the Pugad Baboy children is 8\u20139, Bab is possibly 35\u201336.<ref name = \"pb10\" /> The first volume of the Polgas Comics collections has a story called \"Class Reunion\" illustrated by Jerald Dorado which has Bab attending an elementary class reunion for the 'Batch of 1969' which further enforces this view of his age.\n\n===Recurring jokes===\nOne of the strip's [[running gag]]s is the depiction (or at least the description) of Arabs having very foul [[body odor]]. Examples of this running gag are Kules' Saudi friend, which the former calls ''Lancaster'' (because the friend smells like the ''langka'' or [[jack fruit]]), and the stinky concentrated chemical agent PSSI (''pawis ng singit ng sundalong Iraqi'' or Iraqi soldier's jock sweat) mentioned in the story arc ''The Baguio Connection''. This running gag is likely based on the author's personal experience. It is also reasonable, considering that the desert atmosphere in most Arab countries prevents their people from taking daily baths.\nOther such gags include the monotonous diet of chicken in Saudi Arabia (also likely based on personal experience), Paltik's blatant aversion to the \"[[coming of age]]\" ritual of circumcision, and Polgas and Dagul de-appetizing Debbie on the breakfast table. And steriotyped Iraqis are seen in earlier works.\n\n===Authorial presence===\nMedina usually voices out his takes on events, people and the like through Polgas and Mang Dagul. (Polgas is also recurringly shown as a comic strip artist, like his creator.) According to Medina, the characters he most identifies with are Polgas, Mang Dagul, and Utoy; like him, they wear earrings on their left ears.<ref name = \"pb9\">''Pugad Baboy 9''</ref> Medina himself has even appeared once in the strip proper, holding a cartooning workshop in [[Palawan]], though he avoids breaking the [[fourth wall]] by not referring to himself as the strip's creator.<ref name = \"pb12\">''Pugad Baboy XII''</ref>\n\n==Major story arcs==\nAs mentioned earlier in this article, the strip does not showcase domestic life alone as Medina has created story arcs which involve the various characters in adventurous, dramatic or other plotted situations.\n\nThere is no standard as how long a story arc may last, since it can run from several weeks to a few months. The story arc is only titled when it is included in a compilation.\n\nThis list below contains named story arcs that last at least 15 strips long and which compilation each appears.\n\n*''[[Bakasyon]]'' (15 strips, ''The Best of Pugad Baboy'') - The gang's vacation in La Union is rudely interrupted by Taokoy (mermen).\n*''[[Baboy Scouts]]'' (24 strips, ''Pugad Baboy 3'') - The kids go on a camping trip with their Scoutmaster, and are captured by a band of Amazons who want the Scoutmaster to impregnate their queen!\n*''[[Wisedog]]'' (17 strips, ''Pugad Baboy 3'') - Polgas, alias Wisedog, investigates a series of pet dog disappearances.\n*''[[The Baguio Connection]]'' (51 strips, ''Pugad Baboy 3'') - Kules, Tomas, Noli, Bab, Joboy and Pao, plus Wisedog, investigate ube jam spiked with cannabias sativa in Baguio.\n*''[[Retraining (Pugad Baboy story arc)|Retraining]]'' (45 strips, ''Pugad Baboy 4'') - Tomas is sent for retraining, and soon becomes involved in stopping a ring that sells children to gay pedophiles\n*''[[The Malunggay Conflict]]'' (30 strips, ''Pugad Baboy 4'') - in Ilocos, the gang must help Ka Kwate fight off the attempted annexation of his land by Ka Damuseyn (parody of the First Gulf War).\n*''[[Ang Hiwaga ng Due\u00f1as]]'' (52 strips, ''Pugad Baboy 4'') - the gang's vacation in Due\u00f1as turns into a rescue mission when Pao is mistaken for a pregnant woman, and kidnapped by supernatural beings to use as a human sacrifice.\n*''[[Feminist (Pugad Baboy story arc)|Feminist]]'' (34 strips, ''PB5'') - Barbie and Debbie take on Tomas and Dagul in a battle to prove who is the weaker sex.\n*''[[Olympig Games]]'' (19 strips, ''PB5'') - the Pugad Baby residents compete in a series of hilarious Olympic-style games featuring traditional Filipino events such as patintero, gagamba (spider) fighting, Tex and holen (marbles).\n*''[[2078 (Pugad Baboy story arc)|2078]]'' (45 strips, ''PB5'') - the gang get transported to 2078, learning about the future of the Philippines.

This story arc (which appeared in ''Disi-Sais!'') is relatively short at only nine strips long. Since that arc, it took Medina three years before he came up with ''Benigno Ramos: Bounty Hunter'', and then another three with ''Bodyguard''.\n\n==Books and merchandise==\nThe first compilation of ''Pugad Baboy'' comic strips was originally part of a thesis by Frank Aldana, a student of [[De La Salle University-Manila|De La Salle University]]. This compilation became so popular that Medina himself made more. Typically, a new compilation is released near the start of each year. Including Aldana's compilation, there are currently 34 ''Pugad Baboy'' compilation books:\n\n*''Pugad Baboy One'' (originally, ''The Very Best of Pugad Baboy'')\n*''The Best of Pugad Baboy'' (officially, this is the second compilation)\n*''Pugad Baboy 3''\n*''Pugad Baboy 4''\n*''PB5'' (Pugad Baboy 5)\n*''Pugad Baboy 6''\n*''Pugad Baboy 7''\n*''pugad baboy eight''\n*''Pugad baboy 9''\n*''Pugad Baboy X'' (commemorating the tenth anniversary of the comic strip)\n*''Pugad Baboy XI''\n*''Pugad Baboy XII''\n*''PB the 13th'' (Pugad Baboy 13)\n*''Katorse'' (Pugad Baboy 14)\n*''Kinse!'' (Pugad Baboy 15)\n*''Disi-Sais!'' (Pugad Baboy 16)\n*''17'' (Pugad Baboy 17)\n*''18 eighteen'' (Pugad Baboy 18)\n*''Pugad Baboy Sunday Comics'' (first one in full color)\n*''Pugad Baboy nineteen''\n*''Pugad Baboy XX'' (commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the comic strip)\n*''Pugad Baboy 21''\n*''Pugad Baboy 22''\n*''Pugad Baboy Sunday Comics 2'' (second one in full color)\n*''Pugad Baboy 23''\n*''Pugad Baboy 24''\n* ''25'' (Pugad Baboy 25)\n*''Pugad Baboy Sunday Comics 3'' (half colored, half not colored. This is the last of the Sunday Comics Series)\n*''26'' (Pugad Baboy 26)\n*''27'' (Pugad Baboy 27)\n*''28'' (Pugad Baboy 28)\n*''29'' (Pugad Baboy 29)\n*''XXX'' (Pugad Baboy 30th Anniversary Special)\n*''Pugad Baboy 31''\n\nMedina also made other ''Pugad Baboy'' original works:\n*''Pugad Baboy: Endangered Species'' - a coloring book by Pol Medina. \n*''Pugad Baboy: Philippine Games'' - another coloring book by Medina. \n*''[[Pirata (Pugad Baboy graphic novel)|Pirata]]'' \u2013 an original [[graphic novel]] about Polgas befriending a reformed [[Muslim]] [[piracy|pirate]] named Khalid and their quest for the pirate group to surrender. It was intended to be the first of a graphic novel series called ''Polgas \u2013 Ang Asong Hindi'', but was made a stand-alone graphic novel because of the time and effort given to its creation, as well as the seriousness and darkness of its story compared to the hilarity of ''Pugad Baboy'' itself.\n* Two ''Polgas \u2013 Ang Asong Hindi'' books actually appeared, sporting a smaller, regular-sized format than ''Pirata''. Printed in black and white, unlike ''Pirata'', they were produced as a joint effort between Medina and the Alamat Comics Group, an independent comics company. These books were ''Baboyani'' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''baboy'' and ''bayani'', Filipino for \"hero\") an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] adventure which recasts the characters as rebels in the late-19th century [[Philippine Revolution]] against Spanish rule; and ''Conspigracy'', a story that takes place during an excursion in [[Laguna province|Laguna]]. Nolan Clemente (who is credited as Medina's inspiration for the character Ka Noli) wrote the scripts for both books. In actuality, Medina only contributed the art for the covers and title pages; the rest of the art was done by other artists. The afterword for the second book teased the production of a third story which would supposedly see the Pugad Baboy characters go into space, but this was never produced.<br/>[[Image:Polgaspigurine.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Christmas-themed '''Polgas P-gurine''' c. 1995]]\n*''Pugad Baboy Adbyenturs'' featuring an original story called Gayuma, set sometime after Pugad Baboy 3. The story had Bab finally succeed in convincing Tiny to fall in love with him, while also coming up against a familiar foe. The comic was illustrated in full color by artists from Alamat, where Medina was only somewhat involved. The story was written by Eric Santos, who also co-wrote Conspigracy. \n*''Polgas'' comics \u2013 a \"magazine\" of original strips by Medina and other artists which also contained a spoof \"[[horoscope]]\" and some exotic recipes, saw at least two issues.\n\nThe popularity of ''Pugad Baboy'' also spawned some merchandise such as DogStyle Apparel and Polgas P-gurines (a set of figurines depicting Polgas and some Polgas characters). They are currently distributed by Medina's company, Pol Medina Jr. Novelties.\n\nOn September 25, 1993, ''Pugad Baboy'' was made into a live-action TV show called ''Rated PB (Pang-Bayan) \u2013 Pugad Baboy Sa TV''. Directed by [[Leo Martinez]], the show featured [[Edgar Mortiz]] (Bab), [[Giselle Sanchez]] (Brosia) and [[Rudy Meyer]] (Mang Dagul) among the cast. Though the show was live-action, the opening logo featured limited animation. Some of the episodes were based upon earlier plots in the strip, while others followed a skit show format. It was aired on [[GMA Network|GMA 7]] and lasted only two seasons, 15 episodes in all.\n\nIn the ninth book, Medina states that he dreams of making a ''Pugad Baboy'' [[cartoon]].\n\nBesides ''Pugad Baboy'' books, Medina has also published compilations of his [[editorial cartoon]]s for the ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'', called the ''Ink and Politics'' series. The cartoons sometimes feature ''Pugad Baboy'' characters. Polgas always appears on covers of these books. Three books have been published as the newspaper stopped hiring him as substitute political cartoonist in around 2006.\n\nMedina includes photos and caricatures of himself in some of the strip's compilations.\n\nSome ''Pugad Baboy'' characters can be seen on the ads of [[Dencio's]], a notable restaurant chain in the Philippines. They are also featured as endorsers of Quake Overload Cakes, a line of pastries made by snack company [[Universal Robina|Jack 'N Jill]]. Animation has been done by another great Pinoy artist, [[Arnold Arre]]\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spot.ph/gallery/996/top-10-new-pinoy-komiks-characters/article/47846#pid=14293 |title=Top 10 New Pinoy Komiks Characters &#124; GALLERY &#124; SPOT.ph: Your One-Stop Urban Lifestyle Guide to the Best of Manila |publisher=Spot.ph |date=1988-05-18 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Prone to spam|date=September 2013}}\n{{Z148}}<!--     {{No more links}}\n\n       Please be cautious adding more external links.\n\nWikipedia is not a collection of links and should not be used for advertising.\n\n     Excessive or inappropriate links will be removed.\n\n See [[Wikipedia:External links]] and [[Wikipedia:Spam]] for details.\n\nIf there are already suitable links, propose additions or replacements on\nthe article's talk page, or submit your link to the relevant category at \nthe Open Directory Project (dmoz.org) and link there using {{Dmoz}}.\n\n-->\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/19981212031939/http://www.pmjunior.com.ph/ Pol Medina's official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313204203/http://www.pugadbaboy.pardinas.net/ Unofficial Website of Pugad Baboy]\n{{Pugad Baboy}}\n\n[[Category:Pugad Baboy]]\n[[Category:1988 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Philippine culture]]\n[[Category:Philippine comic strips]]\n[[Category:Philippine Daily Inquirer]]\n[[Category:Fictional families]]\n[[Category:Fictional Filipino people]]\n[[Category:Satirical comics]]\n[[Category:Political comic strips]]\n[[Category:Slice of life comics]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugad_Baboy"}

They are constituted under the [[Local Government Act 1992]], which amended the [[Local Government Act 1972]] to allow the existence of counties that do not have multiple districts. They typically allow large towns to have separate local authorities from the less urbanised parts of their counties and provide a single authority for small counties where division into districts would be impractical. Unitary authorities do not cover all of England. Most were [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|established during the 1990s]] and a further tranche were [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|created in 2009]]. Unitary authorities have the powers and functions that are elsewhere separately administered by councils of [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]] and the [[non-metropolitan district]]s within them.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nThe term \"[[unitary authority]]\" was first used in the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] in 1969 in its current sense of a local government authority which combines the functions of a county council and a district council.<ref>[[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] I. vi 73, cited in [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Online, draft addendum February 2003, s.v. ''unitary''.  An earlier citation, in 1936, uses the term for the [[London County Council]] in the sense of an elected council for the whole of London.</ref> Strictly speaking, the term does not necessarily mean a single level of local government within an area, because in some cases there are also [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]] in the same area.\n\nAlthough the term was not applied to them, [[county borough]]s between 1889 and 1974 were effectively unitary authorities, that is, single-tier administrative units.  Before 1889, local government authorities had different powers and functions, but from medieval times some cities and towns had a high degree of autonomy as [[county corporate|counties corporate]].  Some smaller settlements also enjoyed some degree of autonomy from regular administration as [[borough]]s or [[Liberty (division)|liberties]].\n\nThe [[Local Government Act 1972]] created areas for local government where large towns and their rural hinterlands were administered together. The concept of unitary units was abandoned with a two-tier arrangement of county and district councils in all areas of England, except the [[Isles of Scilly]] where the small size and distance from the mainland made it impractical. In 1986 a broadly unitary system of local government was introduced in the six [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] and [[Greater London]], where the upper-tier authorities were abolished and their functions were split between central government, the borough councils and joint boards.<ref name=atkinson>{{ cite book |author1=Atkinson, H.  |author2=Wilks-Heeg, S.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Local Government from Thatcher to Blair | year=2000 | publisher=Polity}}</ref>\n\n===1990s reform===\n{{main|Local Government Commission for England (1992)}}\nA review in the 1990s was initiated to select non-metropolitan areas where new unitary authorities could be created.<ref name=politics_uk>{{ cite book | title=Politics UK | year=2004 | publisher=Pearson | edition=5th | author= Jones, Kavanagh, Moran & Norton}}</ref> The resulting structural changes were implemented between 1995 and 1998. Bristol, Herefordshire, the Isle of Wight and Rutland were established as counties of a single district; the district councils of Berkshire became unitary; the counties of Avon, Humberside and Cleveland were broken up to create several unitary authorities; and a number of districts were split off from their associated counties.<ref name=atkinson/> The changes caused the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] to be defined separately, as they had been before 1974. The review caused 46 unitary authorities to be created.<ref name=atkinson/>\n\n===2009 changes===\n{{main|2009 structural changes to local government in England}}\nA further review was initiated in 2007 and was enacted in 2009. The review established Cornwall and Northumberland as counties of a single district; established unitary authorities in County Durham, Shropshire and Wiltshire covering the part of the county that was not already split off in the 1990s review; and divided the remainder of Bedfordshire and Cheshire into two unitary authorities. The review caused nine unitary authorities to be created.\n\n===Further reform===\n{{Seealso|2019/2020 structural changes to local government in England}}\n\nIn 2016, Oxfordshire County Council put forward a 'One Oxfordshire' proposal which would see Oxford City Council and the four other district councils in Oxfordshire abolished and replaced with a single unitary county council for Oxfordshire. In 2017, Oxford City Council voiced their opposition to the proposal. A decision on whether the proposal will go ahead was to have been announced in March 2017.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn 2017, it was proposed that two unitary authorities be formed to cover the ceremonial county of [[Dorset]]. One of the authorities would consist of the existing unitary authorities of [[Borough of Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], [[Borough of Poole|Poole]] and the non-metropolitan district of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], the other would be composed of the remainder of the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/|title=Future Dorset - Two new authorities for Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref> In November 2017, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, [[Sajid Javid]] stated that he was \"minded to approve the proposals\" and a final decision to implement the two unitary authority model was confirmed in February 2018. Statutory instruments for the creation of two unitary authorities, to be named [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council]] and [[Dorset Council (UK)|Dorset Council]], have been made and shadow authorities for the new council areas were formed ahead of their [[2019_structural_changes_to_local_government_in_England|creation on 1 April 2019]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2018/9780111168134/contents|title=The Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole (Structural Changes) Order 2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dorsetareacouncils.wordpress.com/|title=Shadow Dorset Council|website=Shadow Dorset Council|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Buckinghamshire County Council]] and the non-metropolitan districts of [[Aylesbury Vale]], [[Chiltern District|Chiltern]], [[South Bucks]], and [[Wycombe District|Wycombe]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] were replaced by a single unitary authority known as [[Buckinghamshire Council]] on 1 April 2020. The existing unitary authority of [[Borough of Milton Keynes|Milton Keynes]] was not affected; from  1 April 2020, therefore, the ceremonial county of [[Buckinghamshire]] has been composed of two unitary authorities.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-46078569 Buckinghamshire unitary council plan gets go-ahead] from [[BBC News]]</ref><ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/957/contents/made The Buckinghamshire (Structural Changes) Order 2019]</ref>\n\nIn March 2018, an independent report commissioned by the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, proposed structural changes to local government in [[Northamptonshire]]. These changes would see the existing county council and district councils abolished and two new unitary authorities created in their place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-40610349|title=Troubled council 'should be scrapped'|date=15 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> One authority would consist of the existing districts of [[Daventry District|Daventry]], [[Northampton]] and [[South Northamptonshire]] and the other authority would consist of [[Corby (borough)|Corby]], [[East Northamptonshire]], [[Borough of Kettering|Kettering]] and [[Borough of Wellingborough|Wellingborough]] districts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2018-03-15/northamptonshire-county-council-should-be-split-up-finds-damning-report/|title=Northamptonshire County Council 'should be split up', finds damning report|website=itv.com|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Functions==\nUnitary authorities combine the powers and functions that are normally delivered separately by the councils of non-metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan districts. These functions are housing, waste management, waste collection, council tax collection, education, libraries, social services, transport, planning, consumer protection, licensing, cemeteries and crematoria. The breakdown of these services is as follows:<ref>Frequently Asked Questions on the structural reviews of Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk, Boundary Commission for England</ref>\n\n{{Non-metropolitan local authority functions}}\n\n==Electoral arrangements==\nMost unitary authorities are divided into a number of multiple member [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] from which councillors are elected in the same way as in two-tier district council elections. The exceptions, which are divided into electoral divisions as in county council elections, are Cornwall, County Durham, the Isle of Wight, Northumberland, Shropshire and Wiltshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/help.html|title=Help using the election maps apps|website=openspace.ordnancesurvey.co.uk|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Current list==\nMost unitary authorities are legally defined as being coterminous non-metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan districts run by a single council. While it makes no difference, they can either be run by a county council that additionally has district powers and functions, or a district council that additionally has county powers and functions. If there's a county council, the district has no council, and vice versa. Districts can additionally have the status of [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] or [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], although this has no effect on their powers or functions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

They are constituted under the [[Local Government Act 1992]], which amended the [[Local Government Act 1972]] to allow the existence of counties that do not have multiple districts. They typically allow large towns to have separate local authorities from the less urbanised parts of their counties and provide a single authority for small counties where division into districts would be impractical. Unitary authorities do not cover all of England. Most were [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|established during the 1990s]] and a further tranche were [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|created in 2009]]. Unitary authorities have the powers and functions that are elsewhere separately administered by councils of [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]] and the [[non-metropolitan district]]s within them.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nThe term \"[[unitary authority]]\" was first used in the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] in 1969 in its current sense of a local government authority which combines the functions of a county council and a district council.<ref>[[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] I. vi 73, cited in [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Online, draft addendum February 2003, s.v. ''unitary''.  An earlier citation, in 1936, uses the term for the [[London County Council]] in the sense of an elected council for the whole of London.</ref> Strictly speaking, the term does not necessarily mean a single level of local government within an area, because in some cases there are also [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]] in the same area.\n\nAlthough the term was not applied to them, [[county borough]]s between 1889 and 1974 were effectively unitary authorities, that is, single-tier administrative units.  Before 1889, local government authorities had different powers and functions, but from medieval times some cities and towns had a high degree of autonomy as [[county corporate|counties corporate]].  Some smaller settlements also enjoyed some degree of autonomy from regular administration as [[borough]]s or [[Liberty (division)|liberties]].\n\nThe [[Local Government Act 1972]] created areas for local government where large towns and their rural hinterlands were administered together. The concept of unitary units was abandoned with a two-tier arrangement of county and district councils in all areas of England, except the [[Isles of Scilly]] where the small size and distance from the mainland made it impractical. In 1986 a broadly unitary system of local government was introduced in the six [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] and [[Greater London]], where the upper-tier authorities were abolished and their functions were split between central government, the borough councils and joint boards.<ref name=atkinson>{{ cite book |author1=Atkinson, H.  |author2=Wilks-Heeg, S.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Local Government from Thatcher to Blair | year=2000 | publisher=Polity}}</ref>\n\n===1990s reform===\n{{main|Local Government Commission for England (1992)}}\nA review in the 1990s was initiated to select non-metropolitan areas where new unitary authorities could be created.<ref name=politics_uk>{{ cite book | title=Politics UK | year=2004 | publisher=Pearson | edition=5th | author= Jones, Kavanagh, Moran & Norton}}</ref> The resulting structural changes were implemented between 1995 and 1998. Bristol, Herefordshire, the Isle of Wight and Rutland were established as counties of a single district; the district councils of Berkshire became unitary; the counties of Avon, Humberside and Cleveland were broken up to create several unitary authorities; and a number of districts were split off from their associated counties.<ref name=atkinson/> The changes caused the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] to be defined separately, as they had been before 1974. The review caused 46 unitary authorities to be created.<ref name=atkinson/>\n\n===2009 changes===\n{{main|2009 structural changes to local government in England}}\nA further review was initiated in 2007 and was enacted in 2009. The review established Cornwall and Northumberland as counties of a single district; established unitary authorities in County Durham, Shropshire and Wiltshire covering the part of the county that was not already split off in the 1990s review; and divided the remainder of Bedfordshire and Cheshire into two unitary authorities. The review caused nine unitary authorities to be created.\n\n===Further reform===\n{{Seealso|2019/2020 structural changes to local government in England}}\n\nIn 2016, Oxfordshire County Council put forward a 'One Oxfordshire' proposal which would see Oxford City Council and the four other district councils in Oxfordshire abolished and replaced with a single unitary county council for Oxfordshire. In 2017, Oxford City Council voiced their opposition to the proposal. A decision on whether the proposal will go ahead was to have been announced in March 2017.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn 2017, it was proposed that two unitary authorities be formed to cover the ceremonial county of [[Dorset]]. One of the authorities would consist of the existing unitary authorities of [[Borough of Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], [[Borough of Poole|Poole]] and the non-metropolitan district of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], the other would be composed of the remainder of the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/|title=Future Dorset - Two new authorities for Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref> In November 2017, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, [[Sajid Javid]] stated that he was \"minded to approve the proposals\" and a final decision to implement the two unitary authority model was confirmed in February 2018. Statutory instruments for the creation of two unitary authorities, to be named [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council]] and [[Dorset Council (UK)|Dorset Council]], have been made and shadow authorities for the new council areas were formed ahead of their [[2019_structural_changes_to_local_government_in_England|creation on 1 April 2019]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2018/9780111168134/contents|title=The Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole (Structural Changes) Order 2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dorsetareacouncils.wordpress.com/|title=Shadow Dorset Council|website=Shadow Dorset Council|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Buckinghamshire County Council]] and the non-metropolitan districts of [[Aylesbury Vale]], [[Chiltern District|Chiltern]], [[South Bucks]], and [[Wycombe District|Wycombe]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] were replaced by a single unitary authority known as [[Buckinghamshire Council]] on 1 April 2020.

These functions are housing, waste management, waste collection, council tax collection, education, libraries, social services, transport, planning, consumer protection, licensing, cemeteries and crematoria. The breakdown of these services is as follows:<ref>Frequently Asked Questions on the structural reviews of Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk, Boundary Commission for England</ref>\n\n{{Non-metropolitan local authority functions}}\n\n==Electoral arrangements==\nMost unitary authorities are divided into a number of multiple member [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] from which councillors are elected in the same way as in two-tier district council elections. The exceptions, which are divided into electoral divisions as in county council elections, are Cornwall, County Durham, the Isle of Wight, Northumberland, Shropshire and Wiltshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/help.html|title=Help using the election maps apps|website=openspace.ordnancesurvey.co.uk|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Current list==\nMost unitary authorities are legally defined as being coterminous non-metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan districts run by a single council. While it makes no difference, they can either be run by a county council that additionally has district powers and functions, or a district council that additionally has county powers and functions. If there's a county council, the district has no council, and vice versa. Districts can additionally have the status of [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] or [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], although this has no effect on their powers or functions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Arthur later deeply regretted his choice because he found his merchant training tedious.

By that time Johanna's famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and dignitaries, most celebrated of them being [[Goethe]].  Arthur attended her parties, usually when he knew that Goethe would be there\u2014though the famous writer and statesman didn't even seem to notice the young and unknown student.  It is possible that Goethe kept distance because Johanna warned him about her son's depressive and combative nature, or because Goethe was then on bad terms with Arthur's language instructor and roommate, [[Franz Passow]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 134</ref>  Schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful [[Karoline Jagemann]], mistress of [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], and he wrote to her his only known love poem.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 135</ref>  Despite his later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality, Schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairs, usually with women of lower social status, such as servants, actresses, and sometimes even paid prostitutes.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 21</ref>  In a letter to his friend Anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out-of-wedlock daughters (born in 1819 and 1836), both of whom died in infancy.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 25</ref>  In their youthful correspondence Arthur and Anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploits\u2014but Schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually didn't find him very charming or physically attractive, and his desires often remained unfulfilled.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 22</ref>\n\nHe left Weimar to become a student at the [[Georg August University of G\u00f6ttingen|University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1809.  There are no written reasons about why Schopenhauer chose that university instead of then more famous [[University of Jena]] but G\u00f6ttingen was known as a more modern, scientifically oriented, with less attention given to theology.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 140</ref>  Law or medicine were usual choices for young men of Schopenhauer's status who also needed career and income; he choose [[medicine]] due to his [[Natural science|scientific interests]].

At the same time his mother just started her literary career; she published her first book in 1810, a biography of her friend [[Karl Ludwig Fernow]], which was a critical success.

He spent his time in solitude, [[hiking]] in the mountains and the [[Thuringian forest]] and writing his dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''.  He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]].  He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar.  She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 230</ref>  But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 231</ref>  His mother just published her second book, ''Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805'', a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit.  She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy.

The details of the August 1821 incident are unknown. He claimed that he just pushed her from his entrance after she rudely refused to leave, and she purposely fell on the ground so she could sue him.  She claimed that he attacked her so violently that she had become paralyzed on her right side and unable to work.  She immediately sued him, and the process lasted until May 1827, when a court found Schopenhauer guilty and forced him to pay her an annual pension until her death in 1842.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 408\u2013411</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer enjoyed Italy, where he studied art and socialized with Italian and English nobles.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 411\u2013414</ref>  It was his last visit to the country.

He was quite critical of the available studies and claimed that they were mostly ignorant or fraudulent, but he did believe that there are authentic cases of such phenomena and tried to explain them through his metaphysics as manifestations of the will.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 437\u2013452</ref>\n\nUpon his arrival in Frankfurt he experienced a period of depression and declining health.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 454</ref> He renewed his correspondence with his mother, and she seemed concerned that he might commit suicide like his father.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 454\u2013457</ref> By now Johanna and Adele were living very modestly.

In 1836, he published ''[[On the Will in Nature]]''. In 1836 he sent his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'' to the contest of the ''Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences'' and won the prize next year.  He sent another essay, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'', to the ''Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies'' but didn't win the prize despite being the only contestant.  The Society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner, claimed that the essay missed the point and that the arguments were not adequate.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 483</ref> Schopenhauer, who was very self-confident that he would win, was enraged by this rejection. He published both essays as ''The Two Basic Problems of Ethics'' and in the preface to the second edition of this book, in 1860, he was still pouring insults on Royal Danish Society.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 484</ref> First edition, published in 1841, again failed to draw attention to his philosophy. Two years later, after some negotiations, he managed to convince his publisher, Brockhaus, to print the second, updated edition of ''The World as Will and Representation''.  The book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative. \n \nHowever, Schopenhauer did start to attract some followers, mostly outside academia, among practical professionals (several of them were lawyers) who pursued private philosophical studies. He jokingly referred to them as ''evangelists'' and ''apostles''.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 504</ref> One of the most active early followers was [[Julius Frauenst\u00e4dt]] who wrote numerous articles promoting Schopenhauer's philosophy. He was also instrumental in finding another publisher after Brockhaus refused to publish ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' believing that it would be another failure.<ref name=\"auto5\">Cartwright (2010). p. 506</ref> Though Schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him, claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas, Frauenst\u00e4dt continued to promote Schopenhauer's work.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 507\u2013508</ref> They renewed their communication in 1859 and Schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 508</ref> He also became the editor of the first collected works of Schopenhauer.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nIn 1848 Schopenhauer witnessed [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|violent upheaval]] in Frankfurt after General [[Hans Adolf Erdmann von Auerswald]] and Prince [[Felix Lichnowsky]] were murdered. He became worried for his own safety and property.<ref name=\"auto6\">Cartwright (2010). p. 514</ref> Even earlier in life he had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 465</ref> He gave a friendly welcome to Austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> The rebellion passed without any loss to Schopenhauer and he later praised [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]] for restoring order.<ref name=\"auto7\">Cartwright (2010). p. 515</ref>  He even modified his will, leaving a large part of his property to a Prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 517</ref> As [[Young Hegelians]] were advocating change and progress Schopenhauer claimed that misery is natural for humans\u2014and that even if some utopian society were established, people would still fight each other out of boredom, or would starve due to overpopulation.<ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\n[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|1855 painting of Schopenhauer by Jules Luntesch\u00fctz]]\nIn 1851 Schopenhauer published ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', which, as the title says, contains essays that are supplementary to his main work, and are mostly comprehensible to readers unfamiliar with his earlier philosophy. It was his first successful, widely read book, partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 524</ref> The essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually didn't contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system.<ref name=\"auto8\">Cartwright (2010). p. 539</ref>  Many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but didn't take his philosophy seriously.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> His early critics liked to point out similarities of his ideas to those Fichte and Schelling,<ref name=\"auto9\">Cartwright (2010). pp. 381\u2013386</ref> or claim that there are numerous contradictions in his philosophy.<ref name=\"auto9\"/><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 537</ref> Both criticisms enraged Schopenhauer. However, he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights, but encouraged his disciples to do so.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 525</ref> His private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions, inconsistencies, and vagueness in his philosophy, but claimed that he wasn't concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 394</ref> and that some of his ideas shouldn't be taken literally but instead as metaphors.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 510</ref>\n\nAcademic philosophers were also starting to notice his work. In 1856 University of Leipzig sponsored an essay contest about Schopenhauer's philosophy, which was won by [[Rudolf Seydel]]\u2019s very critical essay.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 536</ref> Schopenhauer's friend [[Jules Luntesch\u00fctz]] made a first of his four portraits of him\u2014which Schopenhauer didn't particularly like\u2014that was soon sold to a wealthy landowner Carl Ferdinand Wiesike who built a house to display it.  Schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this, and would claim that it was his first chapel.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 540</ref> As his fame increased copies of his paintings and photographs were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he lived and wrote his works.  People visited Frankfurt's ''Englischer Hof'' to observe him dining. Admirers gave him gifts and asked for autographs.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 541</ref>  He complained, however, that he still felt isolated due to his not very social nature and the fact that many of his good friends already died from old age.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 542</ref>\n\n[[File:Schopenhauer-ffm001.jpg|thumb|right|Grave at Frankfurt ''Hauptfriedhof'']]\nHe remained healthy in his old age, which he attributed to regular walks no matter the weather, and always getting enough sleep.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 544\u2013545</ref> He had a great appetite and could read without glasses but his [[Hearing loss|hearing]] was declining since his youth and he developed problems with [[rheumatism]].<ref name=\"auto10\">Cartwright (2010). p. 545</ref> He remained active and lucid, continued his reading, writing and correspondences until his death.<ref name=\"auto10\"/> The numerous notes that he made during these years, amongst others on aging, were published [[Posthumous publication|posthumously]] under the title ''Senilia''.

Allen & Unwin.</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\n=== The world as representation ===\nSchopenhauer saw his philosophy as a continuation of that of Kant, and used the results of his epistemological investigations, that is, [[transcendental idealism]], as starting point for his own. As he writes in the preface to the second edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n{{Quotation|I have already explained in the preface to the first edition, that my philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. I repeat this here. For Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] nor [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can any one become susceptible to the more positive expositions which I have to give. On the other hand, he who has not mastered the Kantian philosophy, whatever else he may have studied, is, as it were, in a state of innocence; that is to say, he remains in the grasp of that natural and childish realism in which we are all born, and which fits us for everything possible, with the single exception of philosophy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World as Will and Representation|last=Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, Preface of the Second Edition|location=|pages=|translator-first=}}</ref>}}\nKant had argued the [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|nopp=|at=\u00a7 52c|translator-last=Paul Carus}}</ref> Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work: \"The world is my representation.\" We do not draw empirical laws from nature, but prescribe them to it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Last sentence of \u00a7 36}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer praises Kant for his distinction between appearance and the [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] that appear, whereas the general consensus in [[German Idealism]] was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Introduction to On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|author1=David E.

The inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by Schopenhauer.

They thus belong to the class of true conclusions from false premises.}}</ref>\n\n=== Theory of perception ===\nIn November 1813 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] invited Schopenhauer for research on his [[Theory of Colours]]. Although Schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter,<ref>Letter to Goethe on 23 Jan 1816. Ich wei\u00df, da\u00df durch mich die Wahrheit geredet hat, \u2013 in dieser kleinen Sache, wie dereinst in gr\u00f6\u00dfern.</ref> he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality.\n\nKant openly admitted that it was [[David Hume|Hume]]'s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations of ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it, he gives an elaborate proof to show that causality is given a priori. After [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze|G. E. Schulze]] had made it plausible that Kant had not disproven Hume's skepticism, it was up to those loyal to the project of Kant to prove this important matter.\n\nThe difference between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is \"given\" to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol 1. Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy|location=|pages=|quote=But the whole teaching of Kant contains really nothing more about this than the oft-repeated meaningless expression: 'The empirical element in perception is given from without.' ... always through the same meaningless metaphorical expression: 'The empirical perception is given us.'}}</ref> He, on the other hand, was occupied with: how do we get this empirical content of perception; how is it possible to comprehend subjective sensations ''limited to my skin'' as the objective perception of things that lie ''outside'' of me?<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 21|quote=For sensation is and remains a process within the organism and is limited, as such, to the region within the skin; it cannot therefore contain any thing which lies beyond that region, or, in other words, anything that is outside us. ... It is only when the Understanding begins to apply its sole form, the causal law, that a powerful transformation takes place, by which subjective sensation becomes objective perception.}}</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|The sensations in the hand of a man born blind, on feeling an object of cubic shape, are quite uniform and the same on all sides and in every direction: the edges, it is true, press upon a smaller portion of his hand, still nothing at all like a cube is contained in these sensations. His Understanding, however, draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt, that this resistance must have a cause, which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object, while the hand's sensation remains unaltered, he constructs the cubic shape in Space. If the representation of a cause and of Space, together with their laws, had not already existed within him, the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 21}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nCausality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions, but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality.

For the independence of the knowledge of causality of all experience,\u2014that is, its a priori character\u2014can only be deduced from the dependence of all experience upon it; and this deduction can only be accomplished by proving, in the manner here indicated, and explained in the passages referred to above, that the knowledge of causality is included in perception in general, to which all experience belongs, and therefore in respect of experience is completely a priori, does not presuppose it, but is presupposed by it as a condition.}}</ref>\n\nBy this intellectual operation, comprehending every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause, the external world arises. With vision, finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines. We are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object; that turns the upside down impression, and that adds depth to make from the planimetrical data stereometrical perception with distance between objects.\n\nSchopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception; the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation. He set out his theory of perception for the first time in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'',<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the subsequent editions of Fourfold Root an extensive exposition is given in \u00a7 21.\n\n=== The world as will ===\n{{main|The World as Will and Representation}}\nSchopenhauer developed a system called [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|metaphysical voluntarism]].\n\n{{Quotation|The kernel and chief point of my doctrine, its Metaphysic proper, is this, that what Kant opposed as ''[[thing-in-itself]]'' to mere appearance (called more decidedly by me \"representation\") and what he held to be absolutely unknowable, that this ''thing-in-itself'', I say, this substratum of all appearances, and therefore of the whole of Nature, is nothing but what we know directly and intimately and find within ourselves as ''will''; that accordingly, this ''will'', far from being inseparable from, and even a mere result of, knowledge, differs radically and entirely from, and is quite independent of, knowledge, which is secondary and of later origin; and can consequently subsist and manifest itself without knowledge: that this will, being the one and only thing-in-itself, the sole truly real, primary, metaphysical thing in a world in which everything else is only appearance, i.e., mere representation, gives all things, whatever they may be, the power to exist and to act; ... is absolutely identical with the will we find within us and know as intimately as we can know any thing; that, on the other hand, knowledge with its substratum, the intellect, is a merely secondary phenomenon, differing completely from the will, only accompanying its higher degrees of objectification and not essential to it; ... that we are never able therefore to infer absence of will from absence of knowledge.| ''[[s:On the Will in Nature|On the Will in Nature]]''| Introduction}}\n\nFor Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. Einstein paraphrased his views as follows: \"a man can do as he will, but not will as he will.\"<ref>Einstein, Albert (1935). ''The World as I See It'', p. 14. Snowball Publishing. {{ISBN|1494877066}}.</ref> In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: \"The world is ''for'' a subject.\" This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena\u2014an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: [[asceticism]] and chastity.<ref name=\"inveigles\"/> He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: \"The world is my representation.\" [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.\n\n=== Art and aesthetics ===\n{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}\n[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|In his main work, Schopenhauer praised the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age artists]], who \"directed such purely objective perception to the most insignificant objects, and set up a lasting monument of their objectivity and spiritual peace in paintings of ''[[still life]].'' The aesthetic beholder does not contemplate this without emotion.\"<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 1, chapter 38</ref>]]\nFor Schopenhauer, human desiring, \"willing\", and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s \"''Sublimation''\"). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: ''\"one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception\"'' (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a ''\"subject of cognition\"'' to a perception that is ''\"Pure, will-less, timeless\"'' (section 34) where the essence, \"ideas\", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to [[Daniel Albright]], \"Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself\".<ref>Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, p. 39, footnote 34</ref> He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.<ref name=Music >{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=10|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162}}</ref>\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nSchopenhauer's [[Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporaneous attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the [[axiom]]\u2014and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space\u2014Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held was directly evident from [[intuition|intuitive perception]].\n\n{{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom (also known as the fifth postulate). The axiom asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of \"less than two right angles\"), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, chap. 13</ref>}}\n\nThroughout his writings,<ref>\"I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy&nbsp;...\" ''Ibid.'', chap. 7.</ref> Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.\n\n{{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem&nbsp;...}}\n\nAlthough Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.<ref>This comment by Schopenhauer was called \"an acute observation\" by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I, \"Note on Common Notion 4\", Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark \"was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory\". Helmholtz had \"maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space\" and is therefore \"dependent on mechanics\".</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,<ref>What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4.</ref> \"Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another\", is not rather attacked. For ''\"coinciding with one another\"'' is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\nThis follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning.<ref>\"Motion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry. For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience.\" (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\n{{Main|On the Basis of Morality}}\nThe task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions. Philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 53.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Kant's teaching of transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility due to which phenomena appear in multiplicity. Reality [[thing-in-itself|in itself]] is free from all multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the ''possibility'' of multiplicity. From this follows that two individuals, though they appear as distinct, are in-themselves not distinct.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 23.}}</ref>\n\nThe appearances are entirely subordinated to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The egoistic individual who focuses his aims completely on his own interests has therefore to deal with empirical laws as well as he can.\n\nWhat is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take for example a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty, and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support ''their'' needs instead of his ''own'' pleasures, then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes ''less distinction between himself'' and others than is usually made.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 66.}}</ref>\n\nRegarding how the things ''appear'' to us, the egoist is right to assert the gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself.\n\nWhat motivates the altruist is compassion. The suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent, but he feels connected to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Basis of Morality|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 19}}</ref>\n\n==== Eternal justice ====\nSchopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the ''[[principium individuationis]]''. When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others\u2014the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Parerga and Paralipomena|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 2, \u00a7 173}}</ref>\n\nUnlike temporal, or human justice, which requires time to repay an evil deed and, \"has its seat in the state, as requiting and punishing.\"<ref>World as Will and Idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice, \"rules not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure.\" <ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\">World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires time. There are no delays or reprieves. Instead, punishment is tied the offence, \"to the point where the two become one.\"... \"Tormenter and tormented are one. The [Tormenter] errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering; the [tormented], in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt.\"<ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\"/>\n\nSuffering is the moral retribution of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of [[original sin]] and in Eastern religions with the [[Reincarnation|dogma of rebirth.]]\n\n==== Quietism ====\nHe who sees through the ''principium individuationis'' and comprehends suffering ''in general'' as his own, will see suffering everywhere, and instead of using all his force to fight for the happiness of his individual manifestation, he will abhor life itself, of which he knows how inseparably it is connected with suffering. A happy individual life midst a world of suffering is for him like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.<ref name=\"Ascetic\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 68.}}</ref>\n\nThose who have experienced this intuitive knowledge can no longer affirm life, but will exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting. They welcome poverty, do not seek nor flee death.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>\n\nHuman life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction, and instead of renewing this contract, the ascetic breaks it. It matters little whether these ascetics adhered to the dogmata of Christianity or [[Dharmic faith|Dharmic religions]], since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge.\n\n{{Quotation|The [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] and the teacher of the [[Vedanta philosophy]] agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to perfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic dullness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the mind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely because of its excellence.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>}}\n\nSchopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live.\n\n=== Psychology ===\nPhilosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:\n\n{{quote|...&nbsp;one ought rather to be surprised that a thing [sex] which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.<ref>Schopenhauer, Arthur.

Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.\n\nIn occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should \"leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]],\" and so long as government was thus limited, he would \"prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats\"\u2014i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47</ref> He declared monarchy as \"that which is natural to man\" for \"intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity\" and disparaged republicanism as \"unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences.\"<ref>[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)|Government]]</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid \"to political affairs of [his] day\".  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of \"minding not the times but the eternities\".  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, \"For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect.\"<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern \"white races\" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus, whom he saw as equal):\n\n<blockquote>The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of \"[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches\" as \"belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record\".<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', \"On Ethics,\" Sec. 5</ref>\n\nIn his Metaphysics of Sexual Love, Schopenhauer writes: \n<blockquote> Further, the consideration as to the complexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a white race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white. The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own. Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white colour of the skin has become a second nature, though not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is.<ref>http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Metaphysik_der_Geschlechtsliebe</ref></blockquote>\n\nSchopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual self-conquest. He saw this as opposed to what he held was the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly \"Jewish\" spirit:\n\n<blockquote>While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.<ref>\"Fragments for the history of philosophy\", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Punishment ====\nThe State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes. It does so by placing \"beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"twwr62\">Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, \u00a7 62.</ref> He claimed this doctrine was not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],<ref>\"...&nbsp;he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the sake of the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again.\" Plato, \"[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]\", 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should \"be an example to other men not to offend\". Plato, \"[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]\", Book IX, 863.</ref> [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Pufendorf]], and [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Anselm Feuerbach]].\n\n==== Views on women ====\nIn Schopenhauer's 1851 essay ''On Women'', he expressed his opposition to what he called \"Teutonico-Christian stupidity\" of reflexive unexamined reverence (''abgeschmackten Weiberveneration'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboq.org/schopenhauer/parerga2/weiber.htm|title=\u00dcber die Weiber, \u00a7369}}</ref> for the female. Schopenhauer wrote that \"Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted.\" He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to [[monogamy]]. Indeed, [[Nigel Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson|Thompson]] in ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' call Schopenhauer \"a misogynist without rival in ... Western philosophy\". He claimed that \"woman is by nature meant to obey\". The essay does give some compliments, however: that \"women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are\", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.\n\nSchopenhauer's writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].<ref>''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''\nPA Cain \u2013 Ga. L. Rev., 1989</ref> Schopenhauer's [[biology|biological]] analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]].<ref name=\"Young2005\">{{cite book|author=Julian Young|title=Schopenhauer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfDyeGY0RFMC&pg=PA242|date=23 June 2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33346-7|page=242}}</ref>\n\nWhen the elderly Schopenhauer sat for [[Arthur Schopenhauer (sculpture)|a sculpture portrait]] by the Prussian sculptor [[Elisabet Ney]] in 1859, he was much impressed by the young woman's wit and independence, as well as by her skill as a visual artist.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Arthur Schopenhauer and Elisabet Ney|first=Sandra Salser|last=Long|journal=[[Southwest Review]]|volume=69|number=2|date=Spring 1984|pages=130\u201347|jstor=43469632}}</ref> After his time with Ney, he told Richard Wagner's friend [[Malwida von Meysenbug]], \"I have not yet spoken my last word about women.

He quotes [[Horace]]'s saying, \"From the brave and good are the brave descended\" (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', \"Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base\" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.<ref>Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519</ref>\nMechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.<ref>On the Suffering of the World, (1970), p. 35. Penguin Books \u2013 Great Ideas</ref> This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love \u2013 placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the \"final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake.\" This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:\n\n<blockquote>With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E.

The word \"will\" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.<ref>\"Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as what is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection.

The effect of this artifice is quite revolting, especially in the case of primates, such as dogs, monkeys, and the like....\" ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', \u00a7 19.</ref> To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot<ref>\"I recall having read of an Englishman who, while hunting in India, had shot a monkey; he could not forget the look which the dying animal gave him, and since then had never again fired at monkeys.\" ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', \u00a7 19.</ref> and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.<ref>\"[Sir William Harris] describes how he shot his first elephant, a female.

Harris says he was then filled with real remorse for what he had done, and felt as if he had committed a murder.\" ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', \u00a7 19.</ref>\n\nHe was very attached to his succession of pet poodles. Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]<ref>\"His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights, ... in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable.\" ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Chapter 50.</ref> belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.<ref>Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Pt.

Also, ''ibid.'', Appendix, 26, \"whatsoever there be in nature beside man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its various capacities, and to adapt to our use as best we may.\"</ref><ref>\"Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop. xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason.

Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel. But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions.\" ''Ethics'', Part 4, Prop. 37, Note 1.</ref>\n\n==== Views on pederasty ====\nIn the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1859), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the ''Metaphysics of Sexual Love''. He wrote that pederasty did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that \"the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils\".<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}</ref>\nSchopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that \"by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour. I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=567}}</ref>\n\n===Intellectual interests and affinities===\n\n====[[Indology]]====\n[[File:Schopenhauer 1852.jpg|thumb|Photo of Schopenhauer, 1852]]\n\nSchopenhauer read the Latin translation of the ancient [[Hindu]] texts, the [[Upanishads]], which French writer [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil du Perron]] had translated from the Persian translation of Prince [[Dara Shukoh]] entitled ''Sirre-Akbar'' (\"The Great Secret\"). He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them \"the production of the highest human wisdom\", and believed they contained superhuman concepts. The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer. Writing about them, he said:\n\n<blockquote>It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John James|title=Oriental enlightenment|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=68|isbn=978-0-415-13376-0}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night. He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature \"the greatest gift of our century\" and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|title=Western Indologists: A Study in Motives|last=Dutt|first=Purohit Bhagavan|accessdate=9 May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802010348/http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|archivedate=2 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met during the winter of 1813\u20131814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Safranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3\u20134</ref>\n\nMost noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer's work, was the significance of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], whose [[Mah\u0101v\u0101kyas|Mah\u0101v\u0101kya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]], is mentioned throughout ''The World as Will and Representation''.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 54\u201356</ref>\n\n==== Buddhism ====\nSchopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].<ref>Abelson, Peter (April 1993).\n[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628204330/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm |date=28 June 2011 }}.

Retrieved on: 12 April 2008.</ref> Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire ([[ta\u1e47h\u0101]]), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation. Thus three of the four \"truths of the Buddha\" correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.<ref>[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', pp. 28&nbsp;ff.</ref> In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable \u2013 it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.<ref name=\"David Burton 2004, page 22\">David Burton, \"Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study.\" Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, p. 22.</ref>\n\nFor Schopenhauer, will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]. In other words, desire is prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puru\u1e63\u0101rtha]] or goals of life in [[Ved\u0101nta]] [[Hinduism]].\n\nIn Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:\n* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or\n* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.\n\nHowever, Buddhist [[nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the \"extinguishing\" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.<ref>John J. Holder, ''Early Buddhist Discourses.'' Hackett Publishing Company, 2006, p. xx.</ref> Occult historian [[Joscelyn Godwin]] (born 1945) stated, \"It was Buddhism that inspired the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, and, through him, attracted [[Richard Wagner]].\"<ref>Godwin, J: ''Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival'', p. 38.

That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will.\" (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''. Note also the discussion by Bryan Magee, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', pp. 14\u201315, 316\u2013321).

In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 17</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBuddhist philosopher [[Nishitani Keiji]], however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.<ref>''Artistic detachment in Japan and the West: psychic distance in comparative aesthetics'' by S. Odin \u2013 2001 \u2013 University of Hawaii Press.</ref> While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:\n\n<blockquote>\nPhilosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.<ref>''Parerga & Paralipomena'', vol.

I, p. 273, trans. E.F.J. Payne.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy more than any other [[Dharma|Dharmic]] faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the fact that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of ''The World as Will and Representation'' in 1818.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3</ref> Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism. Proof of early interest and influence, however, appears in Schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes (transcribed and translated by Urs App) about Buddhism. They are included in a recent case study that traces Schopenhauer's interest in Buddhism and documents its influence.<ref>\nApp, Urs [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp200_schopenhauer.pdf Arthur Schopenhauer and China.

He praised [[animal magnetism]] as evidence for the reality of magic in his ''On the Will in Nature'', and went so far as to accept the division of magic into [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|left-hand and right-hand magic]], although he doubted the existence of demons.<ref name=\"Myth of Disenchantment\">{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 187\u2013188 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer grounded magic in the Will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human Will, not on ritual.

He kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death, and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library.<ref name=\"Flute\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|170}}\n\nMany evenings were spent in the theatre, opera and ballet; the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were especially esteemed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wagner and the Art of the Theatre|last=Carnegy|first=Patrick|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=51}}</ref> Schopenhauer considered music the highest art, and played the flute during his whole life.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|30}}\n\nAs a polyglot, the philosopher knew [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], English, [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]], and he was an avid reader of poetry and literature. He particularly revered [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Petrarch]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].\n\n<blockquote>If Goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with Kant in order to counterbalance him, so to speak, in the spirit of the age, the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction. But now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the German spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|240}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn philosophy, his most important influences were, according to himself, Kant, [[Plato]] and the [[Upanishads]]. Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n<blockquote>If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Thoughts on other philosophers ==\n\n=== Giordano Bruno and Spinoza ===\nSchopenhauer saw [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as unique philosophers who were not bound to their age or nation. \"Both were fulfilled by the thought, that as manifold the appearances of the world may be, it is still ''one'' being, that appears in all of them. ... Consequently, there is no place for God as creator of the world in their philosophy, but God is the world itself.\"<ref name=\"Spinoza and Bruno\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.

It is the common preference of philosophers of abstraction over perception. Bruno on the other hand, who knew much about nature and ancient literature, presents his ideas with Italian vividness, and is amongst philosophers the only one who comes near Plato's poetic and dramatic power of exposition.<ref name=\"Spinoza and Bruno\" /><ref name=\"Presentation\" />\n\nSchopenhauer noted that their philosophies do not provide any ethics, and it is therefore very remarkable that Spinoza called his main work ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''. In fact, it could be considered complete from the standpoint of life-affirmation, if one completely ignores morality and self-denial.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Abschnitt: Handschriftlicher Nachla\u00df|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 588|quote=Es kann daher eine vollkommen wahre Philosophie geben, die ganz von der Verneinung des Lebens abstrahirt, diese ganz ignorirt.}}</ref> It is yet even more remarkable that Schopenhauer mentions Spinoza as an example of the denial of the will, if one uses the French biography by Jean Maximilien Lucas <ref>{{cite web|url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Vie_de_Spinoza|title=Vie de Spinoza - Wikisource|website=fr.wikisource.org}}</ref> as the key to ''[[Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 68|quote=We might to a certain extent regard the well-known French biography of Spinoza as a case in point, if we used as a key to it that noble introduction to his very insufficient essay, ''De Emendatione Intellects'', a passage which I can also recommend as the most effectual means I know of stilling the storm of the passions.}}</ref>\n\n===Immanuel Kant===\n{{See also|Critique of the Kantian philosophy|Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata}}\nThe importance of Kant for Schopenhauer, in philosophy as well as on a personal level, can hardly be overstated. The philosophy of Kant was the foundation of his own.

He argued that they were not philosophers at all, for they lacked \"the first requirement of a philosopher, namely a seriousness and honesty of inquiry.\"<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans.

Therefore whoever reads Kant, Locke, Hume, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Descartes feels elevated and agreeably impressed. This is produced through communion with a noble mind which has and awakens ideas and which thinks and sets one thinking. The reverse of all this takes place when we read the above-mentioned three German sophists. An unbiased reader, opening one of their books and then asking himself whether this is the tone of a thinker wanting to instruct or that of a charlatan wanting to impress, cannot be five minutes in any doubt; here everything breathes so much of ''dishonesty''.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans.

Assuredly no student has ever learned and discovered so much in one semester as I have during this summer. I do not know if I shall ever change my opinion, but at present I am convinced that Schopenhauer is the greatest genius among men. You say he is so-so, he has written a few things on philosophy? What is so-so? It is the whole world in an incomparably beautiful and clear reflection. I have started to translate him. Won't you help me? Indeed, I cannot understand how his name can be unknown. The only explanation for this can only be the one he so often repeats, that is, that there is scarcely anyone but idiots in the world.\"</ref> He said that what he has written in ''[[War and Peace]]'' is also said by Schopenhauer in ''The World as Will and Representation''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/316432|title=Quietism from the Side of Happiness: Tolstoy, Schopenhauer, War and Peace|last=Thompson|first=Caleb|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[Jorge Luis Borges]] remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view, despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular, was because Schopenhauer had already written it for him.{{sfn|Magee|1997|p=413}}\n\nOther figures in literature who were strongly influenced by Schopenhauer were [[Thomas Mann]], [[Afanasy Fet]], [[Joris-Karl Huysmans|J.-K.

Heinrich gave his son a choice\u2014he could stay at home and start preparations for university education, or he could travel with them and then continue his merchant education. Arthur later deeply regretted his choice because he found his merchant training tedious.

Arthur attended lectures by the prominent [[post-Kantian]] philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] but quickly found many points of disagreement with his ''Wissenschaftslehre'' and he also found his lectures tedious and hard to understand.<ref name=\"autogenerated159\">Cartwright (2010). p. 159</ref>  He later mentioned Fichte only in critical, negative terms<ref name=\"autogenerated159\"/>\u2014seeing his philosophy as a lower quality version of Kant's and considering it useful only because Fichte's poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of Kantianism.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 165\u2013169</ref>  He also attended the lectures of the famous theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] whom he also quickly came to dislike.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 174</ref>  His notes and comments on Schleiermacher's lectures show that Schopenhauer was becoming very critical of religion and moving towards [[atheism]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 175</ref>  He learned by self-directed reading; besides Plato, Kant and Fichte he also read the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[John Locke|Locke]], and much current scientific literature.<ref name=\"autogenerated170\"/>  He attended philological courses by [[August B\u00f6ckh]] and [[Friedrich August Wolf]] and continued his naturalistic interests with courses by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Paul Erman]], [[Johann Elert Bode]], [[Ernst Gottfried Fischer]], [[Johann Horkel]], [[Friedrich Christian Rosenthal]] and [[Hinrich Lichtenstein]] (Lichtenstein was also a friend whom he met at one of his mother's parties in Weimar).<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 171\u2013174</ref>\n\n=== Early work ===\nSchopenhauer left Berlin in a rush in 1813 fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as Prussia just joined the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war against France]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 179</ref>  He returned to Weimar but left after less than a month disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover, Georg Friedrich Konrad Ludwig M\u00fcller von Gerstenbergk (1778\u20131838),  a civil servant twelve years younger than she was; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his father's memory.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 188</ref>  He settled for a while in [[Rudolstadt]] hoping that no army would pass through the small town.  He spent his time in solitude, [[hiking]] in the mountains and the [[Thuringian forest]] and writing his dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''.  He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]].  He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar.  She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 230</ref>  But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 231</ref>  His mother just published her second book, ''Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805'', a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit.  She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur told her that people would read his work long after the \"rubbish\" she wrote was totally forgotten.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: A Pessimist in the Optimistic Month of May |publisher=Germanic American Institute |accessdate=12 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611051923/http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/schopenhauer.html |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of \"Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer\" |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref> In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the [[F.A.

They mostly discussed Goethe's newly published (and somewhat lukewarmly received) work on [[Theory of Colours|color theory]].  Schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject, ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'', which in many points differed from his teacher's.  Although they remained polite towards each other, their growing theoretical disagreements\u2014and especially Schopenhauer's tactless criticisms and extreme self-confidence\u2014soon made Goethe become distant again and after 1816 their correspondence became less frequent.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 247\u2013265</ref>  Schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection, but he continued to praise Goethe, and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 256</ref><ref name=\"auto\">Cartwright (2010). p. 265</ref><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 252</ref>\n\nAnother important experience during his stay in Weimar was his acquaintance with Friedrich Majer \u2013 a historian of religion, [[Orientalism|orientalist]] and disciple of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] \u2013 who introduced him to the [[Eastern philosophy]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 266</ref>  Schopenhauer was immediately impressed by the ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the [[Buddha]] and put them at par with Plato and Kant.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 268</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">Cartwright (2010). p. 272</ref>  He continued his studies by reading the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', an amateurish German journal ''Asiatisches Magazin'' and ''Asiatick Researches'' by [[The Asiatic Society]].<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 267</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/>  Although he loved [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts he was more interested in [[Buddhism]], which he came to regard as the best religion.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>  However, his early studies were constrained by the lack of adequate literature, and were mostly restricted to [[Early Buddhism]].

A late essay, ''On University Philosophy'', expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies.\n\n=== Later life ===\nAfter his academic failure he continued to travel extensively, visiting [[Leipzig]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Schaffhausen]], [[Vevey]], [[Milan]] and spending eight months in Florence.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 411</ref>  However, before he left for his three-year travel, he had an incident with his Berlin neighbor, forty-seven-year-old seamstress Caroline Louise Marquet.  The details of the August 1821 incident are unknown. He claimed that he just pushed her from his entrance after she rudely refused to leave, and she purposely fell on the ground so she could sue him.  She claimed that he attacked her so violently that she had become paralyzed on her right side and unable to work.  She immediately sued him, and the process lasted until May 1827, when a court found Schopenhauer guilty and forced him to pay her an annual pension until her death in 1842.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 408\u2013411</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer enjoyed Italy, where he studied art and socialized with Italian and English nobles.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 411\u2013414</ref>  It was his last visit to the country.  He left for [[Munich]] and stayed there for a year, mostly recuperating from various health issues, some of them possibly caused by venereal diseases (the treatment his doctor used suggests [[syphilis]]).<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 415</ref>  He contacted publishers offering to translate Hume into German and Kant into English but his proposals were declined.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 417</ref><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 422</ref>  Returning to Berlin he began to study Spanish so he could read some of his favorite authors in their original language.

Few attempts to revive his lectures\u2014again scheduled at the same time as Hegel's\u2014also failed, as did his inquiries about relocating to other universities.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 429\u2013432</ref>\n\nDuring his Berlin years Schopenhauer occasionally mentioned his desire to marry and have a family.<ref name=\"auto3\">Cartwright (2010). p. 404</ref><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 432</ref>  For a while he was unsuccessfully courting 17-year-old Flora Weiss, who was 22 years younger than he was.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 433</ref>  His unpublished writings from that time show that he was already very critical of [[monogamy]] but still not advocating [[polygyny]]\u2014instead musing about a [[Polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship he called ''tetragamy''.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 404\u2013408</ref>  He had an on and off relationship with a young dancer [[Caroline Medon|Caroline Richter]] (she also used surname Medon after one of her ex-lovers).<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 403</ref> They met when he was 33 and she was 19 and working at the Berlin Opera. She had already had numerous lovers and a son out-of-wedlock, and later gave birth to another son, this time to an unnamed foreign diplomat. (She soon had another pregnancy but the child was stillborn).<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 403\u2013404</ref> As Schopenhauer was preparing to escape Berlin in 1831, due to a [[cholera]] epidemic, he offered to take her with him on the condition that she left behind her young son.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> She refused and he went alone; in his will he left her a significant sum of money but insisted that it should not be in any way spent on her second son.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nSchopenhauer claimed that in his last year in Berlin, he had a [[Premonition|prophetic dream]] that urged him to escape the city.<ref name=\"auto4\">Cartwright (2010). p. 436</ref> As he arrived in his new home in [[Frankfurt]] he supposedly had another [[Supernatural|supernatural experience]], an apparition of his dead father and his mother, who was still alive.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> This experience led him to spend some time investigating [[paranormal]] phenomena and [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]]. He was quite critical of the available studies and claimed that they were mostly ignorant or fraudulent, but he did believe that there are authentic cases of such phenomena and tried to explain them through his metaphysics as manifestations of the will.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 437\u2013452</ref>\n\nUpon his arrival in Frankfurt he experienced a period of depression and declining health.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 454</ref> He renewed his correspondence with his mother, and she seemed concerned that he might commit suicide like his father.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 454\u2013457</ref> By now Johanna and Adele were living very modestly. Johanna's writing didn't bring her much income, and her popularity was waning.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 458</ref> Their correspondence remained reserved, and Arthur Schopenhauer seemed undisturbed by her death in 1838.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 460</ref> His relationship with his sister grew closer and he corresponded with her until she died in 1849.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 463</ref>\n\nIn July 1832 Schopenhauer left Frankfurt for [[Mannheim]] but returned in July 1833 to remain there for the rest of his life, except for a few short journeys.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 464</ref> He lived alone except for a succession of pet [[poodle]]s named [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and Butz. In 1836, he published ''[[On the Will in Nature]]''. In 1836 he sent his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'' to the contest of the ''Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences'' and won the prize next year.  He sent another essay, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'', to the ''Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies'' but didn't win the prize despite being the only contestant.  The Society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner, claimed that the essay missed the point and that the arguments were not adequate.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 483</ref> Schopenhauer, who was very self-confident that he would win, was enraged by this rejection. He published both essays as ''The Two Basic Problems of Ethics'' and in the preface to the second edition of this book, in 1860, he was still pouring insults on Royal Danish Society.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 484</ref> First edition, published in 1841, again failed to draw attention to his philosophy. Two years later, after some negotiations, he managed to convince his publisher, Brockhaus, to print the second, updated edition of ''The World as Will and Representation''.  The book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative. \n \nHowever, Schopenhauer did start to attract some followers, mostly outside academia, among practical professionals (several of them were lawyers) who pursued private philosophical studies. He jokingly referred to them as ''evangelists'' and ''apostles''.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 504</ref> One of the most active early followers was [[Julius Frauenst\u00e4dt]] who wrote numerous articles promoting Schopenhauer's philosophy. He was also instrumental in finding another publisher after Brockhaus refused to publish ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' believing that it would be another failure.<ref name=\"auto5\">Cartwright (2010). p. 506</ref> Though Schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him, claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas, Frauenst\u00e4dt continued to promote Schopenhauer's work.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 507\u2013508</ref> They renewed their communication in 1859 and Schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 508</ref> He also became the editor of the first collected works of Schopenhauer.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nIn 1848 Schopenhauer witnessed [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|violent upheaval]] in Frankfurt after General [[Hans Adolf Erdmann von Auerswald]] and Prince [[Felix Lichnowsky]] were murdered. He became worried for his own safety and property.<ref name=\"auto6\">Cartwright (2010). p. 514</ref> Even earlier in life he had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 465</ref> He gave a friendly welcome to Austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> The rebellion passed without any loss to Schopenhauer and he later praised [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]] for restoring order.<ref name=\"auto7\">Cartwright (2010). p. 515</ref>  He even modified his will, leaving a large part of his property to a Prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 517</ref> As [[Young Hegelians]] were advocating change and progress Schopenhauer claimed that misery is natural for humans\u2014and that even if some utopian society were established, people would still fight each other out of boredom, or would starve due to overpopulation.<ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\n[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|1855 painting of Schopenhauer by Jules Luntesch\u00fctz]]\nIn 1851 Schopenhauer published ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', which, as the title says, contains essays that are supplementary to his main work, and are mostly comprehensible to readers unfamiliar with his earlier philosophy. It was his first successful, widely read book, partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 524</ref> The essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually didn't contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system.<ref name=\"auto8\">Cartwright (2010). p. 539</ref>  Many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but didn't take his philosophy seriously.<ref name=\"auto8\"/> His early critics liked to point out similarities of his ideas to those Fichte and Schelling,<ref name=\"auto9\">Cartwright (2010). pp. 381\u2013386</ref> or claim that there are numerous contradictions in his philosophy.<ref name=\"auto9\"/><ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 537</ref> Both criticisms enraged Schopenhauer. However, he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights, but encouraged his disciples to do so.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 525</ref> His private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions, inconsistencies, and vagueness in his philosophy, but claimed that he wasn't concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 394</ref> and that some of his ideas shouldn't be taken literally but instead as metaphors.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 510</ref>\n\nAcademic philosophers were also starting to notice his work. In 1856 University of Leipzig sponsored an essay contest about Schopenhauer's philosophy, which was won by [[Rudolf Seydel]]\u2019s very critical essay.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 536</ref> Schopenhauer's friend [[Jules Luntesch\u00fctz]] made a first of his four portraits of him\u2014which Schopenhauer didn't particularly like\u2014that was soon sold to a wealthy landowner Carl Ferdinand Wiesike who built a house to display it.  Schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this, and would claim that it was his first chapel.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 540</ref> As his fame increased copies of his paintings and photographs were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he lived and wrote his works.  People visited Frankfurt's ''Englischer Hof'' to observe him dining. Admirers gave him gifts and asked for autographs.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 541</ref>  He complained, however, that he still felt isolated due to his not very social nature and the fact that many of his good friends already died from old age.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 542</ref>\n\n[[File:Schopenhauer-ffm001.jpg|thumb|right|Grave at Frankfurt ''Hauptfriedhof'']]\nHe remained healthy in his old age, which he attributed to regular walks no matter the weather, and always getting enough sleep.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 544\u2013545</ref> He had a great appetite and could read without glasses but his [[Hearing loss|hearing]] was declining since his youth and he developed problems with [[rheumatism]].<ref name=\"auto10\">Cartwright (2010). p. 545</ref> He remained active and lucid, continued his reading, writing and correspondences until his death.<ref name=\"auto10\"/> The numerous notes that he made during these years, amongst others on aging, were published [[Posthumous publication|posthumously]] under the title ''Senilia''. In the spring of 1860 his health started to decline, he experienced shortness of breath and heart palpitations; in September he suffered inflammation of the lungs and although he was starting to recover he remained very weak.<ref>Cartwright (2010). p. 546</ref> His last friend to visit him was Wilhelm Gwinner and, according to him, Schopenhauer was concerned that he wouldn't be able to finish his planned additions to ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' but was at peace with dying.<ref>Cartwright (2010). pp. 546\u2013547</ref> He died of [[Respiratory failure|pulmonary-respiratory failure]],<ref>Dale Jacquette, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', Routledge, 2015: \"Biographical sketch\".</ref> on 21 September 1860 while sitting at home on his couch. He was 72.<ref>''Schopenhauer: his life and philosophy'' by H. Zimmern \u2013 1932 \u2013 G. Allen & Unwin.</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\n=== The world as representation ===\nSchopenhauer saw his philosophy as a continuation of that of Kant, and used the results of his epistemological investigations, that is, [[transcendental idealism]], as starting point for his own. As he writes in the preface to the second edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n{{Quotation|I have already explained in the preface to the first edition, that my philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. I repeat this here. For Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] nor [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can any one become susceptible to the more positive expositions which I have to give. On the other hand, he who has not mastered the Kantian philosophy, whatever else he may have studied, is, as it were, in a state of innocence; that is to say, he remains in the grasp of that natural and childish realism in which we are all born, and which fits us for everything possible, with the single exception of philosophy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World as Will and Representation|last=Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1, Preface of the Second Edition|location=|pages=|translator-first=}}</ref>}}\nKant had argued the [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|nopp=|at=\u00a7 52c|translator-last=Paul Carus}}</ref> Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work: \"The world is my representation.\" We do not draw empirical laws from nature, but prescribe them to it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Last sentence of \u00a7 36}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer praises Kant for his distinction between appearance and the [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] that appear, whereas the general consensus in [[German Idealism]] was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Introduction to On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|author1=David E.

Although Schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter,<ref>Letter to Goethe on 23 Jan 1816. Ich wei\u00df, da\u00df durch mich die Wahrheit geredet hat, \u2013 in dieser kleinen Sache, wie dereinst in gr\u00f6\u00dfern.</ref> he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality.\n\nKant openly admitted that it was [[David Hume|Hume]]'s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations of ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. In it, he gives an elaborate proof to show that causality is given a priori. After [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze|G. E. Schulze]] had made it plausible that Kant had not disproven Hume's skepticism, it was up to those loyal to the project of Kant to prove this important matter.\n\nThe difference between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is \"given\" to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=Vol 1.

His Understanding, however, draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt, that this resistance must have a cause, which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object, while the hand's sensation remains unaltered, he constructs the cubic shape in Space. If the representation of a cause and of Space, together with their laws, had not already existed within him, the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 21}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nCausality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions, but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality.

With vision, finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines. We are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object; that turns the upside down impression, and that adds depth to make from the planimetrical data stereometrical perception with distance between objects.\n\nSchopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception; the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation. He set out his theory of perception for the first time in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'',<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the subsequent editions of Fourfold Root an extensive exposition is given in \u00a7 21.\n\n=== The world as will ===\n{{main|The World as Will and Representation}}\nSchopenhauer developed a system called [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|metaphysical voluntarism]].\n\n{{Quotation|The kernel and chief point of my doctrine, its Metaphysic proper, is this, that what Kant opposed as ''[[thing-in-itself]]'' to mere appearance (called more decidedly by me \"representation\") and what he held to be absolutely unknowable, that this ''thing-in-itself'', I say, this substratum of all appearances, and therefore of the whole of Nature, is nothing but what we know directly and intimately and find within ourselves as ''will''; that accordingly, this ''will'', far from being inseparable from, and even a mere result of, knowledge, differs radically and entirely from, and is quite independent of, knowledge, which is secondary and of later origin; and can consequently subsist and manifest itself without knowledge: that this will, being the one and only thing-in-itself, the sole truly real, primary, metaphysical thing in a world in which everything else is only appearance, i.e., mere representation, gives all things, whatever they may be, the power to exist and to act; ... is absolutely identical with the will we find within us and know as intimately as we can know any thing; that, on the other hand, knowledge with its substratum, the intellect, is a merely secondary phenomenon, differing completely from the will, only accompanying its higher degrees of objectification and not essential to it; ... that we are never able therefore to infer absence of will from absence of knowledge.| ''[[s:On the Will in Nature|On the Will in Nature]]''| Introduction}}\n\nFor Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. Einstein paraphrased his views as follows: \"a man can do as he will, but not will as he will.\"<ref>Einstein, Albert (1935). ''The World as I See It'', p. 14. Snowball Publishing. {{ISBN|1494877066}}.</ref> In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: \"The world is ''for'' a subject.\" This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena\u2014an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: [[asceticism]] and chastity.<ref name=\"inveigles\"/> He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: \"The world is my representation.\" [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.\n\n=== Art and aesthetics ===\n{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}\n[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|In his main work, Schopenhauer praised the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age artists]], who \"directed such purely objective perception to the most insignificant objects, and set up a lasting monument of their objectivity and spiritual peace in paintings of ''[[still life]].'' The aesthetic beholder does not contemplate this without emotion.\"<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 1, chapter 38</ref>]]\nFor Schopenhauer, human desiring, \"willing\", and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s \"''Sublimation''\"). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: ''\"one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception\"'' (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a ''\"subject of cognition\"'' to a perception that is ''\"Pure, will-less, timeless\"'' (section 34) where the essence, \"ideas\", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to [[Daniel Albright]], \"Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself\".<ref>Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, p. 39, footnote 34</ref> He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.<ref name=Music >{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=10|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162}}</ref>\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nSchopenhauer's [[Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporaneous attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the [[axiom]]\u2014and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space\u2014Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held was directly evident from [[intuition|intuitive perception]].\n\n{{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom (also known as the fifth postulate). The axiom asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of \"less than two right angles\"), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, chap. 13</ref>}}\n\nThroughout his writings,<ref>\"I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy&nbsp;...\" ''Ibid.'', chap. 7.</ref> Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.\n\n{{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem&nbsp;...}}\n\nAlthough Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.<ref>This comment by Schopenhauer was called \"an acute observation\" by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I, \"Note on Common Notion 4\", Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark \"was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory\". Helmholtz had \"maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space\" and is therefore \"dependent on mechanics\".</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,<ref>What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4.</ref> \"Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another\", is not rather attacked. For ''\"coinciding with one another\"'' is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\nThis follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning.<ref>\"Motion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry. For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience.\" (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\n{{Main|On the Basis of Morality}}\nThe task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions. Philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 53.}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Kant's teaching of transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility due to which phenomena appear in multiplicity. Reality [[thing-in-itself|in itself]] is free from all multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the ''possibility'' of multiplicity. From this follows that two individuals, though they appear as distinct, are in-themselves not distinct.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 23.}}</ref>\n\nThe appearances are entirely subordinated to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The egoistic individual who focuses his aims completely on his own interests has therefore to deal with empirical laws as well as he can.\n\nWhat is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take for example a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty, and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support ''their'' needs instead of his ''own'' pleasures, then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes ''less distinction between himself'' and others than is usually made.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 66.}}</ref>\n\nRegarding how the things ''appear'' to us, the egoist is right to assert the gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself.\n\nWhat motivates the altruist is compassion. The suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent, but he feels connected to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Basis of Morality|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 19}}</ref>\n\n==== Eternal justice ====\nSchopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the ''[[principium individuationis]]''. When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others\u2014the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Parerga and Paralipomena|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 2, \u00a7 173}}</ref>\n\nUnlike temporal, or human justice, which requires time to repay an evil deed and, \"has its seat in the state, as requiting and punishing.\"<ref>World as Will and Idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice, \"rules not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure.\" <ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\">World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63</ref> Eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires time. There are no delays or reprieves. Instead, punishment is tied the offence, \"to the point where the two become one.\"... \"Tormenter and tormented are one. The [Tormenter] errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering; the [tormented], in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt.\"<ref name=\"World as will and idea Vol. 1 \u00a7 63\"/>\n\nSuffering is the moral retribution of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of [[original sin]] and in Eastern religions with the [[Reincarnation|dogma of rebirth.]]\n\n==== Quietism ====\nHe who sees through the ''principium individuationis'' and comprehends suffering ''in general'' as his own, will see suffering everywhere, and instead of using all his force to fight for the happiness of his individual manifestation, he will abhor life itself, of which he knows how inseparably it is connected with suffering. A happy individual life midst a world of suffering is for him like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.<ref name=\"Ascetic\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, \u00a7 68.}}</ref>\n\nThose who have experienced this intuitive knowledge can no longer affirm life, but will exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting. They welcome poverty, do not seek nor flee death.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>\n\nHuman life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction, and instead of renewing this contract, the ascetic breaks it. It matters little whether these ascetics adhered to the dogmata of Christianity or [[Dharmic faith|Dharmic religions]], since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge.\n\n{{Quotation|The Christian mystic and the teacher of the Vedanta philosophy agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to perfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic dullness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the mind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely because of its excellence.<ref name=\"Ascetic\"/>}}\n\nSchopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live.\n\n=== Psychology ===\nPhilosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:\n\n{{quote|...&nbsp;one ought rather to be surprised that a thing [sex] which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.<ref>Schopenhauer, Arthur.

Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.\n\nIn occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should \"leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]],\" and so long as government was thus limited, he would \"prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats\"\u2014i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47</ref> He declared monarchy as \"that which is natural to man\" for \"intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity\" and disparaged republicanism as \"unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences.\"<ref>[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)|Government]]</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid \"to political affairs of [his] day\".  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of \"minding not the times but the eternities\".  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, \"For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect.\"<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern \"white races\" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus, whom he saw as equal):\n\n<blockquote>The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of \"[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches\" as \"belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record\".<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', \"On Ethics,\" Sec. 5</ref>\n\nIn his Metaphysics of Sexual Love, Schopenhauer writes: \n<blockquote> Further, the consideration as to the complexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a white race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white. The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own. Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white colour of the skin has become a second nature, though not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is.<ref>http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Metaphysik_der_Geschlechtsliebe</ref></blockquote>\n\nSchopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual self-conquest. He saw this as opposed to what he held was the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly \"Jewish\" spirit:\n\n<blockquote>While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.<ref>\"Fragments for the history of philosophy\", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Punishment ====\nThe State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes.

Schopenhauer wrote that \"Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted.\" He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to [[monogamy]]. Indeed, [[Nigel Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson|Thompson]] in ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' call Schopenhauer \"a misogynist without rival in ... Western philosophy\". He claimed that \"woman is by nature meant to obey\". The essay does give some compliments, however: that \"women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are\", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.\n\nSchopenhauer's writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].<ref>''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''\nPA Cain \u2013 Ga.

He quotes [[Horace]]'s saying, \"From the brave and good are the brave descended\" (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', \"Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base\" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.<ref>Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519</ref>\nMechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.<ref>On the Suffering of the World, (1970), p. 35. Penguin Books \u2013 Great Ideas</ref> This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love \u2013 placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the \"final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake.\" This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:\n\n<blockquote>With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E.

The word \"will\" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.<ref>\"Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as what is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection.

Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun \"it\" in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things.<ref>\"... in English all animals are of the neuter gender and so are represented by the pronoun 'it,' just as if they were inanimate things.

Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]<ref>\"His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights, ... in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable.\" ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Chapter 50.</ref> belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.<ref>Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Pt.

Also, ''ibid.'', Appendix, 26, \"whatsoever there be in nature beside man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its various capacities, and to adapt to our use as best we may.\"</ref><ref>\"Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop. xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason.

Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel. But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions.\" ''Ethics'', Part 4, Prop. 37, Note 1.</ref>\n\n==== Views on pederasty ====\nIn the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1859), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the ''Metaphysics of Sexual Love''. He wrote that pederasty did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that \"the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils\".<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}</ref>\nSchopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that \"by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour. I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=567}}</ref>\n\n===Intellectual interests and affinities===\n\n====[[Indology]]====\n[[File:Schopenhauer 1852.jpg|thumb|Photo of Schopenhauer, 1852]]\n\nSchopenhauer read the Latin translation of the ancient [[Hindu]] texts, the [[Upanishads]], which French writer [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil du Perron]] had translated from the Persian translation of Prince [[Dara Shukoh]] entitled ''Sirre-Akbar'' (\"The Great Secret\"). He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them \"the production of the highest human wisdom\", and believed they contained superhuman concepts. The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer. Writing about them, he said:\n\n<blockquote>It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John James|title=Oriental enlightenment|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=68|isbn=978-0-415-13376-0}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night. He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature \"the greatest gift of our century\" and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|title=Western Indologists: A Study in Motives|last=Dutt|first=Purohit Bhagavan|accessdate=9 May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802010348/http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|archivedate=2 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met during the winter of 1813\u20131814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Safranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3\u20134</ref>\n\nMost noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer's work, was the significance of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], whose [[Mah\u0101v\u0101kyas|Mah\u0101v\u0101kya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]], is mentioned throughout ''The World as Will and Representation''.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 54\u201356</ref>\n\n==== Buddhism ====\nSchopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].<ref>Abelson, Peter (April 1993).\n[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628204330/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm |date=28 June 2011 }}.

Retrieved on: 12 April 2008.</ref> Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire ([[ta\u1e47h\u0101]]), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation. Thus three of the four \"truths of the Buddha\" correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.<ref>[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', pp. 28&nbsp;ff.</ref> In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable \u2013 it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.<ref name=\"David Burton 2004, page 22\">David Burton, \"Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study.\" Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, p. 22.</ref>\n\nFor Schopenhauer, will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]. In other words, desire is prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puru\u1e63\u0101rtha]] or goals of life in [[Ved\u0101nta]] [[Hinduism]].\n\nIn Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:\n* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or\n* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.\n\nHowever, Buddhist [[nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the \"extinguishing\" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.<ref>John J. Holder, ''Early Buddhist Discourses.'' Hackett Publishing Company, 2006, p. xx.</ref> Occult historian [[Joscelyn Godwin]] (born 1945) stated, \"It was Buddhism that inspired the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, and, through him, attracted [[Richard Wagner]].\"<ref>Godwin, J: ''Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival'', p. 38.

That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will.\" (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''. Note also the discussion by Bryan Magee, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', pp. 14\u201315, 316\u2013321). Janaway, Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', p. 28&nbsp;f.\n</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nIf I wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others. In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 17</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBuddhist philosopher [[Nishitani Keiji]], however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.<ref>''Artistic detachment in Japan and the West: psychic distance in comparative aesthetics'' by S. Odin \u2013 2001 \u2013 University of Hawaii Press.</ref> While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:\n\n<blockquote>\nPhilosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.<ref>''Parerga & Paralipomena'', vol.

I, p. 273, trans. E.F.J. Payne.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy more than any other [[Dharma|Dharmic]] faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the fact that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of ''The World as Will and Representation'' in 1818.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3</ref> Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism. Proof of early interest and influence, however, appears in Schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes (transcribed and translated by Urs App) about Buddhism.

He praised [[animal magnetism]] as evidence for the reality of magic in his ''On the Will in Nature'', and went so far as to accept the division of magic into [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|left-hand and right-hand magic]], although he doubted the existence of demons.<ref name=\"Myth of Disenchantment\">{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 187\u2013188 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer grounded magic in the Will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human Will, not on ritual.

He kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death, and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library.<ref name=\"Flute\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6|location=|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|170}}\n\nMany evenings were spent in the theatre, opera and ballet; the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were especially esteemed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wagner and the Art of the Theatre|last=Carnegy|first=Patrick|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=51}}</ref> Schopenhauer considered music the highest art, and played the flute during his whole life.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|30}}\n\nAs a polyglot, the philosopher knew [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], English, [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]], and he was an avid reader of poetry and literature. He particularly revered [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Petrarch]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].\n\n<blockquote>If Goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with Kant in order to counterbalance him, so to speak, in the spirit of the age, the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction. But now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the German spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity.<ref name=\"Flute\" />{{rp|240}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn philosophy, his most important influences were, according to himself, Kant, [[Plato]] and the [[Upanishads]]. Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':\n<blockquote>If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Thoughts on other philosophers ==\n\n=== Giordano Bruno and Spinoza ===\nSchopenhauer saw [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as unique philosophers who were not bound to their age or nation. \"Both were fulfilled by the thought, that as manifold the appearances of the world may be, it is still ''one'' being, that appears in all of them. ... Consequently, there is no place for God as creator of the world in their philosophy, but God is the world itself.\"<ref name=\"Spinoza and Bruno\">{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=Vol. 1, Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.

It is the common preference of philosophers of abstraction over perception. Bruno on the other hand, who knew much about nature and ancient literature, presents his ideas with Italian vividness, and is amongst philosophers the only one who comes near Plato's poetic and dramatic power of exposition.<ref name=\"Spinoza and Bruno\" /><ref name=\"Presentation\" />\n\nSchopenhauer noted that their philosophies do not provide any ethics, and it is therefore very remarkable that Spinoza called his main work ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''. In fact, it could be considered complete from the standpoint of life-affirmation, if one completely ignores morality and self-denial.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Abschnitt: Handschriftlicher Nachla\u00df|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 588|quote=Es kann daher eine vollkommen wahre Philosophie geben, die ganz von der Verneinung des Lebens abstrahirt, diese ganz ignorirt.}}</ref> It is yet even more remarkable that Schopenhauer mentions Spinoza as an example of the denial of the will, if one uses the French biography by Jean Maximilien Lucas <ref>{{cite web|url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Vie_de_Spinoza|title=Vie de Spinoza - Wikisource|website=fr.wikisource.org}}</ref> as the key to ''[[Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|at=\u00a7 68|quote=We might to a certain extent regard the well-known French biography of Spinoza as a case in point, if we used as a key to it that noble introduction to his very insufficient essay, ''De Emendatione Intellects'', a passage which I can also recommend as the most effectual means I know of stilling the storm of the passions.}}</ref>\n\n===Immanuel Kant===\n{{See also|Critique of the Kantian philosophy|Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata}}\nThe importance of Kant for Schopenhauer, in philosophy as well as on a personal level, can hardly be overstated. The philosophy of Kant was the foundation of his own. Schopenhauer maintained that Kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as Berkeley and [[Plato]], as Copernicus to [[Hicetas]], [[Philolaus]], and [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]]: Kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted.\n\nIn his study room one bust was of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the other was of Kant.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Schopenhauer. Pessimist and Pagan.|last=Jerauld McGill|first=Vivian|publisher=|year=1931|isbn=|location=|page=320}}</ref> The bond which Schopenhauer felt with the philosopher of K\u00f6nigsberg may be esteemed in a poem he dedicated to Kant:\n\n{{quotation|With my eyes I followed thee into the blue sky,\n\nAnd there thy flight dissolved from view.\n\nAlone I stayed in the crowd below,\n\nThy word and thy book my only solace. \u2014|sign=|source=}}\n\nSchopenhauer dedicated one fifth of his main work, ''The World as Will and Representation'', to a criticism of the Kantian philosophy.\n\n===Post-Kantian school===\nThe leading figures of [[German idealism|post-Kantian philosophy]], Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, were not respected by Schopenhauer. He argued that they were not philosophers at all, for they lacked \"the first requirement of a philosopher, namely a seriousness and honesty of inquiry.\"<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans. E. J. Payne (Oxford, 1974), p. 21.</ref> Rather, they were merely sophists who, excelling in the art of beguiling the public, pursued their own interests and professional advancement. \n\n{{Quotation|All this explains the painful impression with which we are seized when, after studying genuine thinkers, we come to the writings of Fichte and Schelling, or even to the presumptuously scribbled nonsense of Hegel, produced as it was with a boundless, though justified, confidence in German stupidity. With those genuine thinkers one always found an ''honest'' investigation of truth and just as ''honest'' an attempt to communicate their ideas to others. Therefore whoever reads Kant, Locke, Hume, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Descartes feels elevated and agreeably impressed. This is produced through communion with a noble mind which has and awakens ideas and which thinks and sets one thinking. The reverse of all this takes place when we read the above-mentioned three German sophists. An unbiased reader, opening one of their books and then asking himself whether this is the tone of a thinker wanting to instruct or that of a charlatan wanting to impress, cannot be five minutes in any doubt; here everything breathes so much of ''dishonesty''.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real,\" trans. E. J. Payne (Oxford, 1974), p. 23.</ref>}}\n\n[[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] was deemed the most talented of the three, and Schopenhauer wrote that he would recommend his \"elucidatory paraphrase of the highly important doctrine of Kant\" concerning the intelligible character, if he had been honest enough to admit he was showing off with the thoughts of Kant, instead of hiding this relation in a cunning manner.<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the Freedom of the Will|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=82}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer reserved his most unqualified damning condemnation for [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.
