them of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and addressing Orthodox Russia as the heir of the Soviet Communists, stating they were \"supporting the [[Nusayri]] regime\" and invading \"Muslim Syria\", stating the leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church were declaring a \"Crusade\" and telling them they will meet the fate of the Soviet Union and suffer \"a shameful defeat in the [[Levant]]\". The statement also addressed \"Our people in the Levant\", telling the able-bodied and those who are able to contribute to join the \"Jihad\" instead of emigrating. The statement also called for all factions against the government in Syria to unite. Further, addressing \"Arab and Muslim countries\", telling them that there is a \"real war against Sunnis and their countries and identity\" at the hands of the \"Western-Russian and [[Safavid]] and Nusayri alliance\", calling for the termination of all relations with Iran and Russia with Muslim countries and to \"protect the land and people of the Levant from the influence of the Persians and Russians\", especially calling upon Qatar, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia to support the Levant.<ref>{{cite

them of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and addressing Orthodox Russia as the heir of the Soviet Communists, stating they were \"supporting the [[Nusayri]] regime\" and invading \"Muslim Syria\", stating the leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church were declaring a \"Crusade\" and telling them they will meet the fate of the Soviet Union and suffer \"a shameful defeat in the [[Levant]]\". The statement also addressed \"Our people in the Levant\", telling the able-bodied and those who are able to contribute to join the \"Jihad\" instead of emigrating. The statement also called for all factions against the government in Syria to unite. Further, addressing \"Arab and Muslim countries\", telling them that there is a \"real war against Sunnis and their countries and identity\" at the hands of the \"Western-Russian and [[Safavid]] and Nusayri alliance\", calling for the termination of all relations with Iran and Russia with Muslim countries and to \"protect the land and people of the Levant from the influence of the Persians and Russians\", especially calling upon Qatar, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia to support the Levant.<ref>{{cite

Joining him is Kwon Ji-hyuk ([[Sung Joon]]), chic Lee Hyun-soo ([[L (South Korean singer)|L]]), playboy Kim Ha-jin ([[Yoo Min-kyu]]), silent Jang Do-il ([[Lee Hyun-jae (actor)|Lee Hyun-jae]]) and baby-faced Seo Kyung-jong ([[Kim Min-seok (actor)|Kim Min-seok]]). When their delinquent-ridden school is forced to close down, they debate whether it's even worth returning to high school at all. However, due to an outside confrontation with their new school's current ruling band, Strawberry Fields, Eye Candy decides to attend Jungsang High out of spite so they can rule the school once again. Joo Byung-Hee finds his muse in Jungsang High School and dreams of performing in a music festival. They overcome their various economic  difficulties to earn themselves the Jungsang High School uniform and finally are able to enter. By taking inspiration from his blossoming relationship, Byung-hee finally finishes his composition for the festival. Tensions flare between Eye Candy and Strawberry Fields, leading to violent encounters.\n\nWhen Byung-Hee receives an apology from the members of Strawberry Fields and an offer to replace the drum kit that they had previously wrecked, he goes alone to collect the kit. The members of Strawberry Fields instead take the opportunity to attack Byung-hee and beat him with a metal rod, including giving him a serious head wound. Ji-hyuk, Hyun-soo, Ha-jin, Do-il and Kyung-jong discover the situation and reach Byung-hee, only to witness his death as he is struck by a truck as he staggers across a road to reach them.\n\nThe story of Eye Candy is forced to continue without their impulsive leader as they struggle to realise their and Byung-hee's dreams.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Sung Joon]] as Kwon Ji-hyuk<ref>{{cite web|last=Hwang|first=Hyo-jin|title=INTERVIEW: Actor Sung-jun \u2013 Pt. 1|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2012032809112968738|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=10Asia|date=28 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hwang|first=Hyo-jin|title=INTERVIEW: Actor Sung-jun \u2013 Pt. 2|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2012032809105060590|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=10Asia|date=28 March 2012}}</ref>\n:Position: Leader, Vocals, Guitarist\n:The automatic leader of Eye Candy after Joo Byung-hee's death.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Dong-hyun|title=Sung Joon Shines Through ''Shut Up: Flower Boy Band''|url=http://enewsworld.interest.me/enews/contents.asp?idx=3243|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130703030800/http://enewsworld.interest.me/enews/contents.asp?idx=3243|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 July 2013|work=enewsWorld|publisher=CJ E&M|accessdate=2013-05-30|date=6 February 2012}}</ref> He fell in love with Im Soo-ah but keeps their relationship hidden from his bandmates as he feels that he is betraying Byung-hee.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Kyung-nam|title=Sung Joon and Jo Bo Ah Fall in Love on ''Flower Boy Band''|url=http://enewsworld.interest.me/enews/contents.asp?idx=3497|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130703025835/http://enewsworld.interest.me/enews/contents.asp?idx=3497|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 July 2013|work=enewsWorld|publisher=CJ E&M|accessdate=2013-05-30|date=14 February 2012}}</ref> He was raised by his grandparents after his mother abandoned him as child.\n* [[Jo Bo-ah]] as Im Soo-ah<ref>{{cite web|last=Hwang|first=Hyo-jin|title=My Name Is: Jo Bo-ah|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2012022913435362168|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=10Asia|date=29 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cho Bo-ah: My character Sua may seem too naive to the viewers|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2012022914054730589|accessdate=2014-03-28|work=10Asia|date=29 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cho Bo-ah: Sung-jun is someone that is very considerate|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2012022913445067571|accessdate=2014-03-28|work=10Asia|date=29 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cho Bo-ah: A person would be happy to have just one friend like Du-mi |url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2012022914282537069|accessdate=2014-03-28|work=10Asia|date=29 February 2012}}</ref> \n:She is the soft-spoken daughter of a wealthy businessman who's gone bankrupt.

Joining him is Kwon Ji-hyuk ([[Sung Joon]]), chic Lee Hyun-soo ([[L (South Korean singer)|L]]), playboy Kim Ha-jin ([[Yoo Min-kyu]]), silent Jang Do-il ([[Lee Hyun-jae (actor)|Lee Hyun-jae]]) and baby-faced Seo Kyung-jong ([[Kim Min-seok (actor)|Kim Min-seok]]). When their delinquent-ridden school is forced to close down, they debate whether it's even worth returning to high school at all. However, due to an outside confrontation with their new school's current ruling band, Strawberry Fields, Eye Candy decides to attend Jungsang High out of spite so they can rule the school once again. \nJoo Byung-Hee finds his muse in Jungsang High School and dreams of performing in a music festival.

Retrieved March 15, 2011</ref>\n\n==Content==\n\nThe book discusses the role of the [[monetary policy]] in the U.S. economy from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Reconstruction Era]] to the middle of the 20th century. It presents what was then a contrarian view of the role of monetary policy in the [[Great Depression]]. The prevalent view in the early 1960s was that monetary forces played a passive role in the economic contraction of the 1930s. The ''Monetary History'' argues that the bank failures and the massive withdrawals of currency from the financial system that followed significantly shrank the money supply (the total amount of currency and outstanding bank deposits), which greatly exacerbated the economic contraction. The book criticizes the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] for not keeping the supply of money steady and not acting as [[lender of last resort]], instead allowing [[commercial banks]] to fail and allowing the economic depression to deepen.<ref name=\"Bernanke2004\"/>\n\n==Themes==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nThe book's main theme is the ''money supply''.  It tracks this through three numbers:\n* the ratio of cash that people hold in their checking deposits (when people trust banks, they deposit more of their money)\n* the ratio of bank deposits to bank reserves (when banks feel safer, they loan out more of their money)\n* high-powered money (that is, anything that serves as cash or reserves)\n\nThe money supply (cash + deposits) can be computed from these three numbers.  The supply shrinks when people withdraw money from the bank, banks hold more reserves, or high-powered money leaves the country (e.g., gold is exported).  During a crisis, all three can happen.\n\nAnother theme is ''gold''.  For the time period, it was the unit used for international trade with Europe.  So even when the US is not on the gold standard, it plays a significant role.  The authors are precise about the [[gold standard]].  The authors say the US was on the gold standard from 1879 to 1923.  That is, paper money could be exchanged for bullion and international trade was settled immediately with gold.  From 1923 to 1933, the authors say that international trade was \"sterilized\" by the Fed inflating the money rather than immediately being settled by gold.  Lastly, they term the period from 1934 to 1960 (when the book was published) as a \"managed standard\".  Paper money cannot be exchanged for bullion.  The authors compare gold to a subsidized commodity, like grain.\n\nAnother theme is ''silver''.  China and Mexico used it for their currency and the US used it for smaller coins.  From 1879 to 1897, there was a populist push to switch the gold-backed dollar to silver.  The US Treasury bought silver, but that didn't help when the country was on gold.  Later, during the Great Depression, the US bought gold at inflated prices to help silver miners.  The result was tragic for the money supplies of China and Mexico.\n\nThe authors measure the [[velocity of money]]. The authors talk about it a lot, but do not make any conclusions about it.\n\nLastly, a theme is ''decision making at the Federal Reserve''.  The authors try to find out the people making the decisions and what information they had.  Probably just as important is the decision making process.  The NY Fed Bank initially lead the decision making process, but eventually it migrated to the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, DC.  To a lesser extent, the Secretary of the Treasury's decisions are included.\n\n==Thesis==\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\nThe thesis of ''Monetary History'' is that the money supply affects the economy.  In the final chapter, they specify 3 occasions where the [[Federal Reserve]] acted strongly during relatively calm times and present these as an experiment for the reader to judge their thesis.\n\nThe three actions by the Fed were the raising the discount rate in 1920, the raise of it in 1931, and the raise of the reserve requirement in 1937.  Each of these actions caused a large contraction of the money supply over the next 12 months (9%, 14%, 3%).  In fact, these were the three sharpest declines they saw in their data.  In those 12 months, industrial production fell dramatically (30%, 24%, 34%).  Other metrics fell at similar rates.  These were 3 of the 6 worst 12-month periods for industrial production.  The others were 1929-1931 (the Great Depression) and 1945, when the economy switched from wartime to peacetime production.\n\nHaving demonstrated their thesis, they can now use it.  They claim that the Great Depression was due to the Fed letting the money supply shrink from 1929 to 1933.\n\n==Great Depression==\n\nFriedman and Schwartz identified four main policy mistakes made by the [[Federal Reserve]] that led to a sharp and undesirable decline in the [[money supply]]:<ref name=\"Bernanke2004\"/>\n\n* In the spring of 1928, the [[Federal Reserve]] began to tighten its monetary policy (resulting in rising interest rates) and continued that same policy until the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of October 1929]]. This tight monetary policy caused the economy to enter a [[recession]] in mid-1929 and triggered the stock market crash a few months later.\n* In the fall of 1931, it raised interest rates to defend the dollar in response to [[speculative attack]]s, ignoring the difficulties this caused to domestic [[commercial banks]].\n* After lowering interest rates early in 1932 with positive results, it raised interest rates again in late 1932, causing a further collapse in the U.S. economy.\n* The [[Federal Reserve]] was also to be blamed for a pattern of ongoing neglect of problems in the U.S. banking sector throughout the early 1930s.

Retrieved March 15, 2011</ref>\n\n==Content==\n\nThe book discusses the role of the [[monetary policy]] in the U.S. economy from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Reconstruction Era]] to the middle of the 20th century. It presents what was then a contrarian view of the role of monetary policy in the [[Great Depression]]. The prevalent view in the early 1960s was that monetary forces played a passive role in the economic contraction of the 1930s. The ''Monetary History'' argues that the bank failures and the massive withdrawals of currency from the financial system that followed significantly shrank the money supply (the total amount of currency and outstanding bank deposits), which greatly exacerbated the economic contraction. The book criticizes the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] for not keeping the supply of money steady and not acting as [[lender of last resort]], instead allowing [[commercial banks]] to fail and allowing the economic depression to deepen.<ref name=\"Bernanke2004\"/>\n\n==Themes==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nThe book's main theme is the ''money supply''.  It tracks this through three numbers:\n* the ratio of cash that people hold in their checking deposits (when people trust banks, they deposit more of their money)\n* the ratio of bank deposits to bank reserves (when banks feel safer, they loan out more of their money)\n* high-powered money (that is, anything that serves as cash or reserves)\n\nThe money supply (cash + deposits) can be computed from these three numbers.  The supply shrinks when people withdraw money from the bank, banks hold more reserves, or high-powered money leaves the country (e.g., gold is exported).  During a crisis, all three can happen.\n\nAnother theme is ''gold''.  For the time period, it was the unit used for international trade with Europe.  So even when the US is not on the gold standard, it plays a significant role.  The authors are precise about the [[gold standard]].  The authors say the US was on the gold standard from 1879 to 1923.  That is, paper money could be exchanged for bullion and international trade was settled immediately with gold.  From 1923 to 1933, the authors say that international trade was \"sterilized\" by the Fed inflating the money rather than immediately being settled by gold.  Lastly, they term the period from 1934 to 1960 (when the book was published) as a \"managed standard\".  Paper money cannot be exchanged for bullion.  The authors compare gold to a subsidized commodity, like grain.\n\nAnother theme is ''silver''.  China and Mexico used it for their currency and the US used it for smaller coins.  From 1879 to 1897, there was a populist push to switch the gold-backed dollar to silver.  The US Treasury bought silver, but that didn't help when the country was on gold.  Later, during the Great Depression, the US bought gold at inflated prices to help silver miners.  The result was tragic for the money supplies of China and Mexico.\n\nThe authors measure the [[velocity of money]]. The authors talk about it a lot, but do not make any conclusions about it.\n\nLastly, a theme is ''decision making at the Federal Reserve''.  The authors try to find out the people making the decisions and what information they had.  Probably just as important is the decision making process.  The NY Fed Bank initially lead the decision making process, but eventually it migrated to the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, DC.  To a lesser extent, the Secretary of the Treasury's decisions are included.\n\n==Thesis==\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\nThe thesis of ''Monetary History'' is that the money supply affects the economy.  In the final chapter, they specify 3 occasions where the [[Federal Reserve]] acted strongly during relatively calm times and present these as an experiment for the reader to judge their thesis.\n\nThe three actions by the Fed were the raising the discount rate in 1920, the raise of it in 1931, and the raise of the reserve requirement in 1937.  Each of these actions caused a large contraction of the money supply over the next 12 months (9%, 14%, 3%).  In fact, these were the three sharpest declines they saw in their data.  In those 12 months, industrial production fell dramatically (30%, 24%, 34%).  Other metrics fell at similar rates.  These were 3 of the 6 worst 12-month periods for industrial production.  The others were 1929-1931 (the Great Depression) and 1945, when the economy switched from wartime to peacetime production.\n\nHaving demonstrated their thesis, they can now use it.  They claim that the Great Depression was due to the Fed letting the money supply shrink from 1929 to 1933.\n\n==The Great Depression==\n\nFriedman and Schwartz identified four main policy mistakes made by the [[Federal Reserve]] that led to a sharp and undesirable decline in the [[money supply]]:<ref name=\"Bernanke2004\"/>\n\n* In the spring of 1928, the [[Federal Reserve]] began to tighten its monetary policy (resulting in rising interest rates) and continued that same policy until the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of October 1929]]. This tight monetary policy caused the economy to enter a [[recession]] in mid-1929 and triggered the stock market crash a few months later.\n* In the fall of 1931, it raised interest rates to defend the dollar in response to [[speculative attack]]s, ignoring the difficulties this caused to domestic [[commercial banks]].\n* After lowering interest rates early in 1932 with positive results, it raised interest rates again in late 1932, causing a further collapse in the U.S. economy.\n* The [[Federal Reserve]] was also to be blamed for a pattern of ongoing neglect of problems in the U.S. banking sector throughout the early 1930s. It failed to create a stable domestic banking environment by supporting the domestic banks and acting as [[lender of last resort]] to domestic banks during banking panics.\n\n==Influence==\n\nThe book was the first to present the then novel argument that excessively tight [[monetary policy]] by the [[Federal Reserve]] following the boom of the 1920s turned an otherwise normal recession into the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.
