He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. But despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael, no longer a rowdy, takes up football coaching for children, with one of his wards being the son of Daniel, who has made peace with Michael.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in dual roles as Michael (Bigil), and as his father, Rayappan\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Angel Aasirvatham, Michael's collaborator\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as J.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. But despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael, no longer a rowdy, takes up football coaching for children, with one of his wards being the son of Daniel, who has made peace with Michael.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in dual roles as Michael (Bigil), and as his father, Rayappan\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Angel Aasirvatham, Michael's collaborator\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as J.
