They surround the house and unleash a wave of bullets and grenades on it with the intention of killing the family inside it. After heavy firing on the house, they retreat from the crime scene in a vehicle, convinced they have killed everyone within. The leader of the gang then calls J.P. Singh on his cell phone and reports that the family has been successfully executed but he is double crossed by JP Singh as a fire fight erupts between them and a police check post blocking their escape route. The scene cuts abruptly for a prologue by the narrator, Nasir.\nThe whole scene is then revealed in the sequel.\n\n===Introduction of Wasseypur and Dhanbad===\nNasir's narration describes the history and nature of Wasseypur. During the [[British Raj]], Wasseypur and [[Dhanbad]] were located in the [[Bengal]] region. After India gained its independence in 1947, they were carved out of Bengal and redistricted into the state of [[Bihar]] in 1956. In 2000, Wasseypur and Dhanbad were redistricted for a second time into the newly formed state of [[Jharkhand]] where they remain. The village has been historically dominated by the [[Qureshi]] Muslims, a sub-caste of animal butchers who are feared by the non-Qureshi Muslims living there and Dhanbad by extension.\n\nDuring British colonial rule, the British had seized the farm lands of Dhanbad for coal which began the business of coal mining in Dhanbad. The region was a hotbed of the local faceless dacoit Sultana Qureshi who robbed British trains in the night and thus held some patriotic value for the locals.\n\n===1940s===\nShahid Khan ([[Jaideep Ahlawat]]), a [[Pathans in Bihar|Pathan]], takes advantage of the mysteriousness of the faceless dacoit Sultana, a [[Qureshi]], by impersonating his identity to rob British ferry trains. The Qureshi clans eventually find out and order the banishment of Shahid Khan and his family from Wasseypur. They settle down in Dhanbad where Shahid begins work as a labourer in a coal mine. He is unable to be at his wife's side during childbirth, and she dies. The enraged Shahid kills the coal mine's muscleman who had denied him leave on that day. In 1947, independent India begins to assert its authority over itself. The British coal mines are sold to Indian industrialists and Ramadhir Singh ([[Tigmanshu Dhulia]]) receives a few coal mines in the Dhanbad region. He hires Shahid Khan as the new muscleman of one of the coal mines. Shahid terrorises the local population to seize their lands and extract compliance.\n\nOn a rainy day, Ramadhir Singh overhears Shahid's ambitions of taking over the coal mines from him. Singh tricks Shahid into traveling to [[Varanasi]] for business but instead has him murdered by an assassin named Yadav Ji ([[Harish Khanna (actor)|Harish Khanna]]). Nasir ([[Piyush Mishra]]), Shahid's cousin, finds Ramadhir's umbrella with his initials near the door and concludes that Ramadhir eavesdropped on their conversation. He flees from the house with Shahid's son Sardar in the nick of time as Ehsaan Qureshi ([[Vipin Sharma]]), another associate of Ramadhir Singh and a member of the Wasseypur Qureshi clan, shows up to kill them but is too late. An unsuccessful Ehsaan lies to Singh that Shahid's family has been murdered, burnt, and buried. Under the care of Nasir, Sardar grows up along with Nasir's nephew Asgar ([[Jameel Khan]]). Sardar learns the truth about his father's death, upon which he shaves his head and vows not to grow his hair until he has avenged his father's murder.\n\n===Early and Mid 1970s===\nThe coal mines are nationalised. A mature Sardar Khan ([[Manoj Bajpai]]) and his kin start hijacking Ramadhir's coal trucks mid-transit. Ramadhir Singh suspects S.P. Sinha, a [[Coal India]] official, to be behind the hijackings and has him murdered. After Sinha's murder, Ramadhir's reputation for ruthlessness grows, and he becomes feared in Dhanbad.\n\nSardar marries Nagma Khatoon ([[Richa Chadda]]). The pregnant Khatoon confronts Sardar Khan and a prostitute inside a brothel and chases him away. Later, Nagma gives birth to Danish Khan but gets pregnant immediately afterwards. Unable to have sex with a pregnant Nagma, Sardar confesses his sexual frustrations with his kin. At dinner, Nagma gives her consent to Sardar to sleep with other women but with the condition that he won't bring them home or dishonour the family name.\n\nSardar, Asgar and Nasir start working for J.P. Singh (Satya Anand), Ramadhir Singh's son. They misuse their employment by secretly selling the company petrol in the black market. Later, they rob a petrol pump and a train bogey belonging to the Singh family. They usurp Singh's land, which forces the two families to confront each other for talks. The meeting ends in a scuffle, but Ramadhir Singh realizes that Sardar Khan is in fact the son of Shahid Khan who he had murdered in the late 1940s. Sardar and Asgar are jailed for assaulting J.P. Singh during the meeting.\n\n===Early 1980s===\nSardar and Asgar escape from jail. While hiding in Wasseypur, Sardar marries a [[Bengali Hindus|Bengali Hindu]] woman named Durga ([[Reema Sen]]). Asgar informs Nagma that Sardar has taken a second wife, leaving Nagma helpless. Meanwhile, Wasseypur has merged with Dhanbad and the Qureshi clan continues to terrorise the non-Qureshi Muslims. The locals then approach Sardar Khan for help as he was well known for standing up to Ramadhir Singh. During [[Muharram]], both [[Shias]] and [[Sunnis]] are out mourning, including the Qureshi clan. Sardar uses the opportunity to launch a major bomb attack on many Qureshi shops and houses. When word spreads about Sardar's raids, his reputation grows and he commands more fear than the Qureshi clan.\n\nEventually, Sardar returns home to Nagma and she gets pregnant again. Sardar tries to initiate sex with a pregnant Nagma but she refuses, which prompts an angry Sardar to leave. He goes to stay with his second wife, Durga, and she gives birth to his son, Definite. Ramadhir Singh, noticing that Sardar has abandoned his first family, tries to reach out to Nagma through Danish by giving him money. An enraged Nagma beats Danish for taking the money while she breaks down in front of Nasir. A thirsty Faizal wakes up in the middle of the night to find Nagma and Nasir about to have sex. Angry, he storms out of the house and becomes a stoner, permanently seen with his chillum. Nasir reveals that the desires were never consummated, but Faizal and Nasir never see eye to eye again.\n\n===Mid and Late 1980s===\nSensing Sardar's increasing clout, Ramadhir calls his old associate Ehsaan Qureshi who brokers a meeting between Sultan Qureshi([[Pankaj Tripathi]]), his nephew and Ramadhir Singh where the two decide to become allies against their common enemy, Sardar. Sultan asks Ramadhir for modern automatic weapons which the latter promises to give.\n\n===1990s===\nSardar becomes the most feared man in Wasseypur and shifts his business to stealing iron ore. Danish Khan ([[Vineet Kumar Singh]]) joins the family business. A failed attack from Sultan Qureshi leaves Danish with a minor injury and causes reconciliation between  Sardar and Nagma. Sardar finds Ramadhir and warns him of terrible consequences if anything ever happens to his family.\n\nA mature Faizal ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]) is seriously affected by Bollywood movies as he starts behaving, talking and dressing like Bollywood characters. Sardar sends Faizal to Varanasi to buy guns, but Faizal is caught by the police and jailed. Upon release, he kills the gun seller Yadav, who unbeknownst to Faizal was the nameless assassin who had killed Shahid Khan (Faizal's grandfather) and who had implicated Faizal to police earlier. Meanwhile, Sardar seizes a lake belonging to a local temple and charges commission on fish sellers who make a catch in that lake. An uneasy peace is maintained between the Qureshi and Khan families when Danish Khan marries Shama Parveen, the sister of Sultan Qureshi. At the same time, Faizal begins romancing Mohsina Hamid ([[Huma Qureshi (actress)|Huma Qureshi]]), another kin of Sultan.\n\n===Epilogue===\nFaizal reveals to his friend, Faizlu that his father Sardar would be travelling without security the next day. Unbeknownst to Faizal, Faizlu is actually an ally of Sultan.  Late that night, while Faizal is still asleep, Faizlu calls up the Qureshis and tells them that Sardar's bodyguards wouldn't be with him the next day. The next morning, Sardar leaves home alone and reaches Durga's house where he gives her her expense allowance. Once Sardar leaves, Durga also calls up the Qureshis and tells them that he has just left her house. The Qureshi men follow Sardar's car, and when the latter stops at a petrol pump to refuel they start shooting as Sardar ducks in the car for cover. The Qureshi men put several close rounds through the car window ensuring a precise and unmistakable hit, after which they escape. A shocked Sardar opens the car door and stands up to reveal multiple bullet wounds, with one bullet embedded in his head. He steps out with his gun drawn to stop a cycle ferry on which he eventually collapses to his death.\n\n==Sequel==\n{{Main|Gangs of Wasseypur \u2013 Part 2}}\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:GOW Khan Family.png|250px|thumb|Family tree of the Khan family.

In 2008 he met [[Zeishan Quadri]] (the writer of Gangs of Wasseypur) who told him about Wasseypur's story. He found it unreal to believe that mafia activity and gang war existed at such high level. Zeishan narrated enough stories but what really attracted him was not gang war but the entire story of emergence of mafia. According to him to tell the story through a few families is what interested him but that also meant a longer reel. \"We all know mafia exists but what they do, how they operate, why they do we don't know and that is something which forms the basis of the film\".\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to Bajpayee, the role of Sardar Khan is the most negative role he has done till date.

Anurag Kashyap never has to resort to extraneous elements like stylised entries, editing patterns or camera motions to add to the effect because the story has an intrinsic impact of its own. However the film doesn't fall short of any technical finesse. There's unabashed blood, gore and abuse wherever the scene demands.\nLines like \"Tum sahi ho, woh marad hai,\" (\"You are right, he is male\") said in resigned agreement to a wronged wife stand out for their cruel truths of rural life.<ref name=\"rediff1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/review/review-the-boring-gangs-of-wasseypur/20120622.htm |title=Review: The boring Gangs Of Wasseypur&nbsp;- Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Rediff.com |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> Kashyap's use of occasional bursts of music and comedy to punctuate the slowly augmenting tension at different junctures is highly reminiscent of [[Spaghetti Westerns]].

This first of a two-part film, is ambitious indeed; showing promise of brilliance in parts, but not bullet-proof to flaws. With a runtime this long, meandering side tracks and random sub-plots, countless characters, documentary-style narrative backed with black and white montages from actual history, it loses blood in the second half because of the Director's over-(self)indulgence.

And, of course, it is like all mythologies are supposed to be. You enjoy them for the parts rather than caring merely for the hero's final goal.

There are several differences in the film which contradict actual documented events most notably the character of Faizal Khan (based on [[Faheem Khan]]) who dies in the climax. [[Faheem Khan]] is currently in jail in Hazaribagh and has been sentenced to life imprisonment.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\">http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/pangs-of-wasseypur/article3967902.ece Pangs of Wasseypur (''link error'': 11/12/2018))</ref> In the film, Sardar Khan marries the Bengali girl but in real life, the woman was maintained as a keep. Most of the gang wars were between the gangs of Wasseypur, not with the Singhs, who had been instrumental in instigating these wars, but never participated in them.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\"/> There was no character akin to Shahid Khan.\n\nAnother scene in the movie, where a Muslim girl is kidnapped by Singh's men, has been portrayed conversely. In real life, the victim was a local [[Hindu]] girl and the kidnappers were a few goons from Wasseypur. The members of the Singh family ultimately had to threaten the entire Wasseypur community to return the girl in 24 hours. The girl was eventually returned as the Singhs were regarded in the village with might and fear.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\"/>\n\nThe character of Ramadhir Singh is based on Surajdeo Singh. In the film's climax, Singh is brutally killed by Faizal but in real life, Singh died of natural causes in June 1991.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nFazloo's character is based on Sabir Alam.

It is considered a modern [[cult film]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|film|date=December 2018}}\n===Prologue===\nA gang of heavily armed men scour and finally narrow down on a house in [[Wasseypur]]. They surround the house and unleash a wave of bullets and grenades on it with the intention of killing the family inside it. After heavy firing on the house, they retreat from the crime scene in a vehicle, convinced they have killed everyone within. The leader of the gang then calls J.P. Singh on his cell phone and reports that the family has been successfully executed but he is double crossed by JP Singh as a fire fight erupts between them and a police check post blocking their escape route. The scene cuts abruptly for a prologue by the narrator, Nasir.\nThe whole scene is then revealed in the sequel.\n\n===Introduction of Wasseypur and Dhanbad===\nNasir's narration describes the history and nature of Wasseypur. During the [[British Raj]], Wasseypur and [[Dhanbad]] were located in the [[Bengal]] region. After India gained its independence in 1947, they were carved out of Bengal and redistricted into the state of [[Bihar]] in 1956. In 2000, Wasseypur and Dhanbad were redistricted for a second time into the newly formed state of [[Jharkhand]] where they remain. The village has been historically dominated by the [[Qureshi]] Muslims, a sub-caste of animal butchers who are feared by the non-Qureshi Muslims living there and Dhanbad by extension.\n\nDuring British colonial rule, the British had seized the farm lands of Dhanbad for coal which began the business of coal mining in Dhanbad. The region was a hotbed of the local faceless dacoit Sultana Qureshi who robbed British trains in the night and thus held some patriotic value for the locals.\n\n===1940s===\nShahid Khan ([[Jaideep Ahlawat]]), a [[Pathans in Bihar|Pathan]], takes advantage of the mysteriousness of the faceless dacoit Sultana, a [[Qureshi]], by impersonating his identity to rob British ferry trains. The Qureshi clans eventually find out and order the banishment of Shahid Khan and his family from Wasseypur. They settle down in Dhanbad where Shahid begins work as a labourer in a coal mine. He is unable to be at his wife's side during childbirth, and she dies. The enraged Shahid kills the coal mine's muscleman who had denied him leave on that day. In 1947, independent India begins to assert its authority over itself. The British coal mines are sold to Indian industrialists and Ramadhir Singh ([[Tigmanshu Dhulia]]) receives a few coal mines in the Dhanbad region. He hires Shahid Khan as the new muscleman of one of the coal mines. Shahid terrorises the local population to seize their lands and extract compliance.\n\nOn a rainy day, Ramadhir Singh overhears Shahid's ambitions of taking over the coal mines from him. Singh tricks Shahid into traveling to [[Varanasi]] for business but instead has him murdered by an assassin named Yadav Ji ([[Harish Khanna (actor)|Harish Khanna]]). Nasir ([[Piyush Mishra]]), Shahid's cousin, finds Ramadhir's umbrella with his initials near the door and concludes that Ramadhir eavesdropped on their conversation. He flees from the house with Shahid's son Sardar in the nick of time as Ehsaan Qureshi ([[Vipin Sharma]]), another associate of Ramadhir Singh and a member of the Wasseypur Qureshi clan, shows up to kill them but is too late. An unsuccessful Ehsaan lies to Singh that Shahid's family has been murdered, burnt, and buried. Under the care of Nasir, Sardar grows up along with Nasir's nephew Asgar ([[Jameel Khan]]). Sardar learns the truth about his father's death, upon which he shaves his head and vows not to grow his hair until he has avenged his father's murder.\n\n===Early and Mid 1970s===\nThe coal mines are nationalised. A mature Sardar Khan ([[Manoj Bajpai]]) and his kin start hijacking Ramadhir's coal trucks mid-transit. Ramadhir Singh suspects S.P. Sinha, a [[Coal India]] official, to be behind the hijackings and has him murdered. After Sinha's murder, Ramadhir's reputation for ruthlessness grows, and he becomes feared in Dhanbad.\n\nSardar marries Nagma Khatoon ([[Richa Chadda]]). The pregnant Khatoon confronts Sardar Khan and a prostitute inside a brothel and chases him away. Later, Nagma gives birth to Danish Khan but gets pregnant immediately afterwards. Unable to have sex with a pregnant Nagma, Sardar confesses his sexual frustrations with his kin. At dinner, Nagma gives her consent to Sardar to sleep with other women but with the condition that he won't bring them home or dishonour the family name.\n\nSardar, Asgar and Nasir start working for J.P. Singh (Satya Anand), Ramadhir Singh's son. They misuse their employment by secretly selling the company petrol in the black market. Later, they rob a petrol pump and a train bogey belonging to the Singh family. They usurp Singh's land, which forces the two families to confront each other for talks. The meeting ends in a scuffle, but Ramadhir Singh realizes that Sardar Khan is in fact the son of Shahid Khan who he had murdered in the late 1940s. Sardar and Asgar are jailed for assaulting J.P. Singh during the meeting.\n\n===Early 1980s===\nSardar and Asgar escape from jail. While hiding in Wasseypur, Sardar marries a [[Bengali Hindus|Bengali Hindu]] woman named Durga ([[Reema Sen]]). Asgar informs Nagma that Sardar has taken a second wife, leaving Nagma helpless. Meanwhile, Wasseypur has merged with Dhanbad and the Qureshi clan continues to terrorise the non-Qureshi Muslims. The locals then approach Sardar Khan for help as he was well known for standing up to Ramadhir Singh. During [[Muharram]], both [[Shias]] and [[Sunnis]] are out mourning, including the Qureshi clan. Sardar uses the opportunity to launch a major bomb attack on many Qureshi shops and houses. When word spreads about Sardar's raids, his reputation grows and he commands more fear than the Qureshi clan.\n\nEventually, Sardar returns home to Nagma and she gets pregnant again. Sardar tries to initiate sex with a pregnant Nagma but she refuses, which prompts an angry Sardar to leave. He goes to stay with his second wife, Durga, and she gives birth to his son, Definite. Ramadhir Singh, noticing that Sardar has abandoned his first family, tries to reach out to Nagma through Danish by giving him money. An enraged Nagma beats Danish for taking the money while she breaks down in front of Nasir. A thirsty Faizal wakes up in the middle of the night to find Nagma and Nasir about to have sex. Angry, he storms out of the house and becomes a stoner, permanently seen with his chillum. Nasir reveals that the desires were never consummated, but Faizal and Nasir never see eye to eye again.\n\n===Mid and Late 1980s===\nSensing Sardar's increasing clout, Ramadhir calls his old associate Ehsaan Qureshi who brokers a meeting between Sultan Qureshi([[Pankaj Tripathi]]), his nephew and Ramadhir Singh where the two decide to become allies against their common enemy, Sardar. Sultan asks Ramadhir for modern automatic weapons which the latter promises to give.\n\n===1990s===\nSardar becomes the most feared man in Wasseypur and shifts his business to stealing iron ore. Danish Khan ([[Vineet Kumar Singh]]) joins the family business. A failed attack from Sultan Qureshi leaves Danish with a minor injury and causes reconciliation between  Sardar and Nagma. Sardar finds Ramadhir and warns him of terrible consequences if anything ever happens to his family.\n\nA mature Faizal ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]) is seriously affected by Bollywood movies as he starts behaving, talking and dressing like Bollywood characters. Sardar sends Faizal to Varanasi to buy guns, but Faizal is caught by the police and jailed. Upon release, he kills the gun seller Yadav, who unbeknownst to Faizal was the nameless assassin who had killed Shahid Khan (Faizal's grandfather) and who had implicated Faizal to police earlier. Meanwhile, Sardar seizes a lake belonging to a local temple and charges commission on fish sellers who make a catch in that lake. An uneasy peace is maintained between the Qureshi and Khan families when Danish Khan marries Shama Parveen, the sister of Sultan Qureshi. At the same time, Faizal begins romancing Mohsina Hamid ([[Huma Qureshi (actress)|Huma Qureshi]]), another kin of Sultan.\n\n===Epilogue===\nFaizal reveals to his friend, Faizlu that his father Sardar would be travelling without security the next day. Unbeknownst to Faizal, Faizlu is actually an ally of Sultan.  Late that night, while Faizal is still asleep, Faizlu calls up the Qureshis and tells them that Sardar's bodyguards wouldn't be with him the next day. The next morning, Sardar leaves home alone and reaches Durga's house where he gives her her expense allowance. Once Sardar leaves, Durga also calls up the Qureshis and tells them that he has just left her house. The Qureshi men follow Sardar's car, and when the latter stops at a petrol pump to refuel they start shooting as Sardar ducks in the car for cover. The Qureshi men put several close rounds through the car window ensuring a precise and unmistakable hit, after which they escape. A shocked Sardar opens the car door and stands up to reveal multiple bullet wounds, with one bullet embedded in his head. He steps out with his gun drawn to stop a cycle ferry on which he eventually collapses to his death.\n\n==Sequel==\n{{Main|Gangs of Wasseypur \u2013 Part 2}}\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:GOW Khan Family.png|250px|thumb|Family tree of the Khan family.

In 2008 he met [[Zeishan Quadri]] (the writer of Gangs of Wasseypur) who told him about Wasseypur's story. He found it unreal to believe that mafia activity and gang war existed at such high level. Zeishan narrated enough stories but what really attracted him was not gang war but the entire story of emergence of mafia. According to him to tell the story through a few families is what interested him but that also meant a longer reel. \"We all know mafia exists but what they do, how they operate, why they do we don't know and that is something which forms the basis of the film\".\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to Bajpayee, the role of Sardar Khan is the most negative role he has done till date.

The genre it comes closest to then is an epic, spelt with a capital E, along the lines of say Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather trilogy, or this film's immediate inspiration Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002). And, of course, it is like all mythologies are supposed to be. You enjoy them for the parts rather than caring merely for the hero's final goal. If it wasn\u2019t a film, this would\u2019ve been a stylised graphic novel. But you would\u2019ve missed a memorable background score and striking sound design.\"\n\n;International\nThe film met positive international reviews.

There are several differences in the film which contradict actual documented events most notably the character of Faizal Khan (based on [[Faheem Khan]]) who dies in the climax. [[Faheem Khan]] is currently in jail in Hazaribagh and has been sentenced to life imprisonment.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\">http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/pangs-of-wasseypur/article3967902.ece Pangs of Wasseypur (''link error'': 11/12/2018))</ref> In the film, Sardar Khan marries the Bengali girl but in real life, the woman was maintained as a keep. Most of the gang wars were between the gangs of Wasseypur, not with the Singhs, who had been instrumental in instigating these wars, but never participated in them.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\"/> There was no character akin to Shahid Khan.\n\nAnother scene in the movie, where a Muslim girl is kidnapped by Singh's men, has been portrayed conversely. In real life, the victim was a local [[Hindu]] girl and the kidnappers were a few goons from Wasseypur. The members of the Singh family ultimately had to threaten the entire Wasseypur community to return the girl in 24 hours. The girl was eventually returned as the Singhs were regarded in the village with might and fear.<ref name=\"thehindu.com\"/>\n\nThe character of Ramadhir Singh is based on Surajdeo Singh. In the film's climax, Singh is brutally killed by Faizal but in real life, Singh died of natural causes in June 1991.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nFazloo's character is based on Sabir Alam. In the film, Fazloo is killed and dismembered by Faizal Khan. In real life, Sabir Alam and Faheem Khan were childhood friends turned enemies. Sabir was awarded life sentence in 2007 for the murder of Faheem Khan's mother and aunt, is out on bail in Wasseypur.<ref>[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120622/jsp/jharkhand/story_15642956.jsp Wassup Wasseypur?

The Stuyvesant, named for an area of [[New York]] settled by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in the dawn of what would become [[United States|America]], offered a purse of $100,000 added.\n\nThe Stuyvesant was run at [[Jamaica Race Course]] for three-year-olds from 1916 to 1924, and from 1937 to 1939. In 1916, 1917, and 1918, and again from 1937 to 1939 it was a six [[furlong]] sprint.  It went off at a [[mile]] from 1919 to 1924 and from 1964 to 1972. It was not run from 1925 to 1936, nor from 1940 to 1962. It took place at [[Belmont Park]] in 1990, 1995, and 2001.

It also has less coverage and protection in large [[List of national parks of Madagascar|national parks]] than the red ruffed lemur.

Smaller percentages of leaves, nectar, seeds, and even fungi make up the remainder. Their diet is also influenced by the seasons, with certain plant parts and fruits only ripening or becoming available during certain times of the year. Water consumption also varies throughout the year and can be influenced by diet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Britt|first1=Adam|title=Diet and Feeding Behaviour of the Black-and-White Ruffed Lemur (Varecia variegata variegata) in the Betampona Reserve, Eastern Madagascar|journal=Folia Primatologica|date=2000|volume=71|issue=3|pages=133\u2013141|doi=10.1159/000021741|pmid=10828690}}</ref> The number of tree species utilized by for food by the lemurs can range from 19-40 species depending on location.

The rest of which is spent mostly on nectar and various other forage.  In general most male black and white ruffed lemurs will eat less than a female will during the hot dry seasons of [[Madagascar]]. Another difference between the diet of male and female ruffed lemurs is that when a female is pregnant and also lactating she will eat significantly more flowers and leaves than the male in order to supply her offspring and the high energy cost of reproduction. Studies recording ruffed lemurs in captivity and in the wild over the course of a year show that ruffed lemurs on an average spend around 28% of their time feeding, 53% resting, and the last 19% socializing and moving about.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Behavior==\n\n===Female dominance===\n\nBlack-and-white ruffed lemurs demonstrate the rare behavior of female social dominance both within and outside the context of feedings. This is also found in other ruffed lemurs as well as in ring-tailed lemurs and red ruffled lemurs. Aggressive interactions between males and females are usually won by the female even when they do not show aggressive behavior towards the male. Unlike other species of lemurs, black-and-white ruffed lemur females occasionally show submission and more aggression needs to be maintained in order for the female to win the interaction instead of having an undecided interaction. Male aggression does not vary among seasons.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/fwhite/Rapps%20and%20White.pdf|author1=Raps, Stefan|author2=White, Frances J.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Female Social Dominance in Semi-Free-Ranging Ruffed Lemurs (''Varecia Variegata'')|pmid=8792616|year=1995|volume=65|issue=3|pages=163\u20138|journal=Folia Primatologica|doi=10.1159/000156883|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915052023/http://pages.uoregon.edu/fwhite/Rapps%20and%20White.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOne of the main reasons that black-and-white ruffed lemurs exhibit dominance is for feeding purpose; that is they are able to establish priority over males in feeding. Reproductive females need more access to food because of the costs of carrying and caring for offspring which is why they establish this feeding priority. Energy demands in this species are particularly high. Female dominance in feeding is maintained through demonstrating some aggressive behavior and leading the group to food in order to have first access to the food. Dominance is not thought to be established in younger females so groups lacking a mature female may not have a dominant female. When a dominant female is present, she leads the group to the food source and eats more than the rest of the group.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.txstate.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/erhart/contentParagraph/0/content_files/file5/Overdorff_et_al_2005.pdf |author=Overdorff, Deborah J. |author2=Erhart, Elizabeth M. |author3=Mutschler, Thomas |last-author-amp=yes |title=Does Female Dominance Facilitate Feeding Priority in Black-and-white Ruffed Lemurs (''Varecia variegata'') in Southeastern Madagascar?|pmid=15898069|year=2005|volume=66|issue=1|pages=7\u201322|doi=10.1002/ajp.20125|journal=American Journal of Primatology}}</ref>\n\n===Communication===\n\nThe black-and-white ruffed lemur demonstrates several different call types each of which last several seconds. Most lemurs of a group participate in any one chorus. These lemurs are particularly known for their loud roar/shriek choruses which have several purposes including group movement, spacing among different groups, and alarming other members of the group of predators. Unlike the calls of other species, the calls of the black-and-white ruffed lemur are not likely to be for the establishment of territory for a group. The calling behavior is participated in throughout the course of a day, not concentrated at any one point of the day; however calls are usually not heard at night.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://gibbons.de/main/non-gibbon/pdf_files/2006indri_varecia.pdf |author1=Geissmann, Thomas  |author2=Mutschler, Thomas  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Diurnal Distribution of Loud Calls in Sympatric Wild Indris (''Indri indri'') and Ruffed Lemurs (''Varecia variegata''): Implications for Call Functions|pmid=16736264|year=2006|volume=47|issue=4|pages=393\u20136|doi=10.1007/s10329-006-0189-5|journal=Primates; Journal of Primatology}}</ref>\n\n===Interspecific interactions===\n\nBlack-and-white ruffed lemurs are known to form a natural hybrid zone with the red-ruffed lemur.

Groups have been shown to exhibit a range of [[Fission\u2013fusion society|fission fusion]] dynamics, meaning that group size can fluctuate based on resource availability. When resources (e.g. food) are plentiful, the environment can support a larger group of lemurs, but when resources are scarce, the group may split into smaller sub-groups to survive. The sub-groups can rejoin and split as needed with environmental and social cues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baden|first=Andrea L.|last2=Webster|first2=Timothy H.|last3=Kamilar|first3=Jason M.|year=2016|title=Resource Seasonality and Reproduction Predict Fission\u2013Fusion Dynamics in Black-and-White Ruffed Lemurs (Varecia variegata)|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=78|issue=2|pages=256\u2013279|via=|doi=10.1002/ajp.22507|pmid=26606154}}</ref> Parenting in this species of lemurs is unique in that no single infant is invested in but instead, females bear litters of multiple offspring. Males also play a role in the parenting of the offspring especially in smaller groups where the certainty of paternity is high. In larger groups, the chance of a female mating with more than one male increases as does uncertainty in paternity. This tends to decrease the level of male care of offspring. Instead of clinging to the mother, offspring are placed into a nest which is guarded by both parents, described in detail below.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last = Kappeler | editor1-first = P.

Males exhibit testicular enlargement as they mature, which gradually increases over the months leading to their breeding window. After successfully breeding with a female, the male's testicles gradually reduce back to normal. When females become sexually mature and enter [[Estrous cycle#Estrus|estrus]] during the breeding season, their vagina begins to open slightly, starting with a small pink dot and line, which is easily visible because the skin around the vulva is black. The pink area gradually opens over the course of several days. Once fully opened, vaginal estrus lasts 2\u20133 days. During this time, there is an even smaller window of time (6\u201312 hours) when the female is in behavioral estrus, and breeding is only possible during this period. After breeding, the female's vulva gradually closes and remains black and closed for the remainder of the year. Gestation lasts an average of 102.5 days and typically results in a litter of 2-6 offspring that are unable to cling to their mother, as in other primates. The female builds a nest where infants remain until they can leave it on their own. For the first 2 weeks after birth, the female stays with the infants nearly 24 hours a day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foerg|first=R.|year=1982|title=Reproductive behavior in Varecia variegata.|journal=Folia Primatologica|volume=38|issue=1\u20132|pages=108\u2013121|via=|doi=10.1159/000156047|pmid=7201444}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pereira|first=ME|last2=Seeligson|first2=ML|last3=Macedonia|first3=JM|year=1988|title=The behavioral repertoire of the black-and-white ruffed lemur, Varecia variegata variegata (Primates: Lemuridae).|journal=Folia Primatologica|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1\u201332|via=|doi=10.1159/000156353|pmid=3251818}}</ref> Both males and females will guard the nest.

Smaller percentages of leaves, nectar, seeds, and even fungi make up the remainder. Their diet is also influenced by the seasons, with certain plant parts and fruits only ripening or becoming available during certain times of the year. Water consumption also varies throughout the year and can be influenced by diet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Britt|first1=Adam|title=Diet and Feeding Behaviour of the Black-and-White Ruffed Lemur (Varecia variegata variegata) in the Betampona Reserve, Eastern Madagascar|journal=Folia Primatologica|date=2000|volume=71|issue=3|pages=133\u2013141|doi=10.1159/000021741|pmid=10828690}}</ref> The number of tree species utilized by for food by the lemurs can range from 19-40 species depending on location.

The rest of which is spent mostly on nectar and various other forage.  In general most male black and white ruffed lemurs will eat less than a female will during the hot dry seasons of [[Madagascar]]. Another difference between the diet of male and female ruffed lemurs is that when a female is pregnant and also lactating she will eat significantly more flowers and leaves than the male in order to supply her offspring and the high energy cost of reproduction. Studies recording ruffed lemurs in captivity and in the wild over the course of a year show that ruffed lemurs on an average spend around 28% of their time feeding, 53% resting, and the last 19% socializing and moving about.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Behavior==\n\n===Female dominance===\n\nBlack-and-white ruffed lemurs demonstrate the rare behavior of female social dominance both within and outside the context of feedings. This is also found in other ruffed lemurs as well as in ring-tailed lemurs and red ruffled lemurs. Aggressive interactions between males and females are usually won by the female even when they do not show aggressive behavior towards the male. Unlike other species of lemurs, black-and-white ruffed lemur females occasionally show submission and more aggression needs to be maintained in order for the female to win the interaction instead of having an undecided interaction. Male aggression does not vary among seasons.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/fwhite/Rapps%20and%20White.pdf|author1=Raps, Stefan|author2=White, Frances J.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Female Social Dominance in Semi-Free-Ranging Ruffed Lemurs (''Varecia Variegata'')|pmid=8792616|year=1995|volume=65|issue=3|pages=163\u20138|journal=Folia Primatologica|doi=10.1159/000156883|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915052023/http://pages.uoregon.edu/fwhite/Rapps%20and%20White.pdf|archivedate=15 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOne of the main reasons that black-and-white ruffed lemurs exhibit dominance is for feeding purpose; that is they are able to establish priority over males in feeding. Reproductive females need more access to food because of the costs of carrying and caring for offspring which is why they establish this feeding priority. Energy demands in this species are particularly high. Female dominance in feeding is maintained through demonstrating some aggressive behavior and leading the group to food in order to have first access to the food. Dominance is not thought to be established in younger females so groups lacking a mature female may not have a dominant female. When a dominant female is present, she leads the group to the food source and eats more than the rest of the group.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.txstate.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/erhart/contentParagraph/0/content_files/file5/Overdorff_et_al_2005.pdf |author=Overdorff, Deborah J. |author2=Erhart, Elizabeth M. |author3=Mutschler, Thomas |last-author-amp=yes |title=Does Female Dominance Facilitate Feeding Priority in Black-and-white Ruffed Lemurs (''Varecia variegata'') in Southeastern Madagascar?|pmid=15898069|year=2005|volume=66|issue=1|pages=7\u201322|doi=10.1002/ajp.20125|journal=American Journal of Primatology}}</ref>\n\n===Communication===\n\nThe black-and-white ruffed lemur demonstrates several different call types each of which last several seconds. Most lemurs of a group participate in any one chorus. These lemurs are particularly known for their loud roar/shriek choruses which have several purposes including group movement, spacing among different groups, and alarming other members of the group of predators. Unlike the calls of other species, the calls of the black-and-white ruffed lemur are not likely to be for the establishment of territory for a group. The calling behavior is participated in throughout the course of a day, not concentrated at any one point of the day; however calls are usually not heard at night.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://gibbons.de/main/non-gibbon/pdf_files/2006indri_varecia.pdf |author1=Geissmann, Thomas  |author2=Mutschler, Thomas  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Diurnal Distribution of Loud Calls in Sympatric Wild Indris (''Indri indri'') and Ruffed Lemurs (''Varecia variegata''): Implications for Call Functions|pmid=16736264|year=2006|volume=47|issue=4|pages=393\u20136|doi=10.1007/s10329-006-0189-5|journal=Primates; Journal of Primatology}}</ref>\n\n===Interspecific interactions===\n\nBlack-and-white ruffed lemurs are known to form a natural hybrid zone with the red-ruffed lemur.

Groups have been shown to exhibit a range of [[Fission\u2013fusion society|fission fusion]] dynamics, meaning that group size can fluctuate based on resource availability. When resources (e.g. food) are plentiful, the environment can support a larger group of lemurs, but when resources are scarce, the group may split into smaller sub-groups to survive. The sub-groups can rejoin and split as needed with environmental and social cues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baden|first=Andrea L.|last2=Webster|first2=Timothy H.|last3=Kamilar|first3=Jason M.|year=2016|title=Resource Seasonality and Reproduction Predict Fission\u2013Fusion Dynamics in Black-and-White Ruffed Lemurs (Varecia variegata)|journal=American Journal of Primatology|volume=78|issue=2|pages=256\u2013279|via=|doi=10.1002/ajp.22507|pmid=26606154}}</ref> Parenting in this species of lemurs is unique in that no single infant is invested in but instead, females bear litters of multiple offspring. Males also play a role in the parenting of the offspring especially in smaller groups where the certainty of paternity is high. In larger groups, the chance of a female mating with more than one male increases as does uncertainty in paternity. This tends to decrease the level of male care of offspring. Instead of clinging to the mother, offspring are placed into a nest which is guarded by both parents, described in detail below.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last = Kappeler | editor1-first = P.

Males exhibit testicular enlargement as they mature, which gradually increases over the months leading to their breeding window. After successfully breeding with a female, the male's testicles gradually reduce back to normal. When females become sexually mature and enter [[Estrous cycle#Estrus|estrus]] during the breeding season, their vagina begins to open slightly, starting with a small pink dot and line, which is easily visible because the skin around the vulva is black. The pink area gradually opens over the course of several days. Once fully opened, vaginal estrus lasts 2\u20133 days. During this time, there is an even smaller window of time (6\u201312 hours) when the female is in behavioral estrus, and breeding is only possible during this period. After breeding, the female's vulva gradually closes and remains black and closed for the remainder of the year. Gestation lasts an average of 102.5 days and typically results in a litter of 2-6 offspring that are unable to cling to their mother, as in other primates. The female builds a nest where infants remain until they can leave it on their own. For the first 2 weeks after birth, the female stays with the infants nearly 24 hours a day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Foerg|first=R.|year=1982|title=Reproductive behavior in Varecia variegata.|journal=Folia Primatologica|volume=38|issue=1\u20132|pages=108\u2013121|via=|doi=10.1159/000156047|pmid=7201444}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pereira|first=ME|last2=Seeligson|first2=ML|last3=Macedonia|first3=JM|year=1988|title=The behavioral repertoire of the black-and-white ruffed lemur, Varecia variegata variegata (Primates: Lemuridae).|journal=Folia Primatologica|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1\u201332|via=|doi=10.1159/000156353|pmid=3251818}}</ref> Both males and females will guard the nest.

The primary structure is reinforced concrete. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called [[Downtown Dubai]]. It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale, [[mixed-use development]]. The decision to construct the building is based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building was originally named ''Burj Dubai'' but was renamed in honour of the ruler of [[Abu Dhabi]] and president of the United Arab Emirates, [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]];<ref name=\"USAtoday\">{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/01/dubai-opens-world-tallest-building/1|title=Dubai opens world's tallest building|date=2 January 2010|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=4 January 2010|location=[[Dubai]]|first=Douglas|last=Stanglin}}</ref> Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the [[List of tallest buildings|tallest building]] in the world.\n\nBurj Khalifa was designed by [[Adrian Smith (architect)|Adrian Smith]], of [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]], whose firm designed the [[Willis Tower]] and [[One World Trade Center]]. [[Hyder Consulting]] was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the [[Islamic architecture]] of the region, such as in the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]]. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A [[buttressed core|buttressed central core and wings]] are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from [[Samsung Tower Palace 3 \u2013 Tower G|Tower Palace III]], the Burj Khalifa's central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of the wings.<ref name=\"academic.csuohio.edu\">{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=William|last2=Pawlikowski|first2=James|title=Higher and Higher: The Evolution of the Buttressed Core|url=http://academic.csuohio.edu/duffy_s/CVE_601_Struct_1.pdf|website=academic.csuohio.edu|accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref> The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.\n\nAt a certain point in the architectural and engineering process, the original Emaar developers ran into financial issues, and required more money and economic funding. [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|Sheikh Khalifa]], the ruler of the United Arab Emirates, granted monetary aid and funding, hence resulting in the changing of the name to \"Burj Khalifa\". The concept of profitability derived from building high density developments and malls around the landmark have proven successful. Its surrounding malls, hotels and condominiums in Downtown Dubai have generated the most revenue from the project as a whole, while the Burj Khalifa itself made little or no profit.<ref name=\"constructionweekaugust13kingdombeckons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-13535-the-kingdom-beckons/|title=The Kingdom beckons|author=Hope, Gerhard|date=13 August 2011|publisher=ConstructionWeekOnline|accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"bdonlineaugust16\">{{cite web|url=http://bdonline.co.uk/5022966.article?|title=Should the Kingdom Tower be built?|date=16 August 2011|publisher=bdonline.com|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nCritical reception to Burj Khalifa has been generally positive, and the building has received many awards.

It was difficult to create a concrete that could withstand both the thousands of tonnes bearing down on it and [[Persian Gulf]] temperatures that can reach {{convert|50|C|F|0|abbr=on}}. To combat this problem, the concrete was not poured during the day. Instead, during the summer months, ice was added to the mixture and it was poured at night when the air was cooler and the humidity was higher.

[[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan|Sheikh Khalifa]], the ruler of the United Arab Emirates, granted monetary aid and funding, hence resulting in the changing of the name to \"Burj Khalifa\". The concept of profitability derived from building high density developments and malls around the landmark have proven successful.

It was difficult to create a concrete that could withstand both the thousands of tonnes bearing down on it and [[Persian Gulf]] temperatures that can reach {{convert|50|C|F|0|abbr=on}}. To combat this problem, the concrete was not poured during the day. Instead, during the summer months, ice was added to the mixture and it was poured at night when the air was cooler and the humidity was higher. Cooler concrete cures more evenly and is therefore less likely to set too quickly and crack. Any significant cracks could have put the entire project in jeopardy.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n=== Milestones ===\n[[File:Burj Dubai 001.jpg|thumb|450px|Burj Khalifa and skyline of Dubai, 2010]]\n[[File:View of Burj Khalifa from Hotel Oberoi.jpg|thumb|right|View of Burj Khalifa from Hotel Oberoi]]\n* January 2004: Excavation commences.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.burjdubai.com/the-tower/construction.aspx |title=Burj Dubai Construction Timeline |publisher=BurjDubai.com |accessdate=31 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215060325/http://www.burjdubai.com/the-tower/construction.aspx |archivedate=15 December 2009 }}</ref>\n* February 2004: Piling starts.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n* 21 September 2004: Emaar contractors begin construction.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6910536.stm|title=Dubai skyscraper world's tallest|date=22 July 2007|work=BBC News |accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>\n* March 2005: Structure of Burj Khalifa starts rising.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n* June 2006: Level 50 is reached.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n* February 2007: Surpasses the [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]] as the [[List of buildings with 100 floors or more|building with the most floors]].\n* 13 May 2007: Sets record for vertical [[concrete pump]]ing on any building at {{convert|452|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, surpassing the {{convert|449.2|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to which concrete was pumped during the construction of [[Taipei 101]], while Burj Khalifa reached the 130th floor.<ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://dubaionline.mconet.biz/index.php?action=fullnews&id=319778&category=990&category_name=dubai_property_news|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123091251/http://dubaionline.mconet.biz/index.php?action=fullnews&id=319778&category=990&category_name=dubai_property_news|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 November 2007|title=Burj Dubai: Unimix sets record for concrete pumping|publisher=Dubai News Online|date=25 May 2007|accessdate=11 April 2009}}</ref>\n* 21 July 2007: Surpasses Taipei 101, whose height of {{convert|509.2|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} made it the world's tallest building, and level 141 reached.<ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"official site\">{{cite web|title=Burj Dubai Official Website|url=http://www.burjdubai.com|publisher=[[Emaar Properties]]|accessdate=8 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203024106/http://www.burjdubai.com/|archive-date=3 February 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* 12 August 2007: Surpasses the Sears Tower antenna, which stands {{convert|527|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.\n* 12 September 2007: At {{convert|555.3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, becomes the world's tallest freestanding structure, surpassing the [[CN Tower]] in [[Toronto]], and level 150 reached.<ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"CBC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/09/12/cntower-surpassed.html|title=CN Tower dethroned by Dubai building|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=12 September 2007|accessdate=13 September 2007}}</ref>\n* 7 April 2008: At {{convert|629|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, surpasses the [[KVLY-TV mast|KVLY-TV Mast]] to become the tallest man-made structure, level 160 reached.<ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=Emaar20080407>{{cite news|url=http://www.emaar.com/index.aspx?page=press-release-details&id=213|title=Burj Dubai surpasses KVLY-TV mast to become the world's tallest man-made structure|publisher=[[Emaar Properties]]|date=7 April 2008|accessdate=7 April 2008}}</ref>\n* 17 June 2008: Emaar announces that Burj Khalifa's height is over {{convert|636|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and that its final height will not be given until it is completed in September 2009.<ref name=\"Emaar20080617\">{{cite news|url=http://www.emaar.com/index.aspx?page=press-release-details&id=137|title=Emaar increases height of Burj Dubai;

{"title_page": "1923 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1923 season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 15th. The First Grade competition featured 7 teams with the Fire Brigade club who featured in it in 1922 not entering a team. Fire Brigade had originally been named [[Grafton Athletic]] and had formed in 1914.\n\n[[City Rovers]] won their 6th championship title and the 3rd in succession after defeating Athletic 8\u20137 in the final. With a round to play City was only 2 competition points ahead of Athletic so it was decided to play a final to decide the champions. The match was played on [[Carlaw Park]] in front of an enormous crowd of 11,500 with \u00a3325 received in gate takings.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championship Final/City Defeat Athletic/Great Contest For Honours\n| page =4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LX| issue=18488\n| date = 1923-08-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19230827.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref> City were the second team to win three consecutive titles after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] had won the competition in 1917, 1918, and 1919. It was to be 61 years until it happened again with [[Mt Albert Lions|Mt Albert]] winning the title from 1984\u201386 before [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] won 4 titles from 1991\u201394, [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 3 titles from 1997\u201399, and [[Pt Chevalier Pirates|Pt Chevalier]] won 3 titles from 2013\u201315.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the second straight year and their third time in the competitions history after defeating [[City Rovers]] 14\u20133 in the final.\n\nThe Auckland representative team played 5 matches for 4 wins and a 20\u201320 draw. The draw was arguably the most significant result as it was in a match for the Northern Union Challenge Cup against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]]. Auckland had lost the cup to the same opposition the previous season and as the match was drawn South Auckland retained it. The two teams met again at the end of the season at Carlaw Park which Auckland won convincingly however the cup was not being played for as it was only defended at the holders home ground.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1922 Auckland Rugby League season|1922]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=15th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1923}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n    {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Manukau Rugby League Team===\nNear the end of the season the Manukau and Mangere clubs sent a letter to the Auckland Rugby League which was read at the management committee meeting on August 29. It stated that the two clubs had decided to amalgamate and would enter a team in the senior grade the following year provided permission was granted, which it was. The Manukau club is the [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau]] club of today, though the Mangere club is not related to the modern day [[Mangere East Hawks|Mangere East]] who were not founded until 1963. They were located predominantly in the Onehunga area before moving much later to their current location at Moyle Park.\n\n== Monteith Shield (First Grade Championship) ==\nThe 1923 First Grade Championship was arguably the most keenly fought in the competitions history to this point with three teams in the hunt for the title up until the last two weeks. [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] who were in a good position to win the title lost in the 12th and 13th rounds and bowed out of contention, leaving [[City Rovers]] and Athletics to contend. It was ultimately won by [[City Rovers]] who finished the season with a 10 win and 2 loss record, as did Athletic, with a final being required to determine the winner. City won by the narrowest of margins 8\u20137 to go back to back.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|13||12||0||1||231||69||'''24'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Athletic\n|13||10||0||3||180||87||'''20'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]\n|12||9||0||2||170||111||'''18'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Rugby Football Club|Devonport United]]\n|12||5||0||7||131||144||'''10'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]\n|12||4||0||8||118||179||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|12||2||0||10||88||182||'''4'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]]\n|12||1||0||11||93||239||'''2'''\n|-\n|}\n\nA final was played between [[City Rovers]] and Athletic after the round robin to decide the title with City winning 8 points to 7 in front of 11,500 spectators at Carlaw Park.\n\n=== First Grade Fixtures ===\nThe First Grade season was particularly close right until the end. In the final round the step was made to play both games on [[Carlaw Park]] number 1 field for the first time (usually one match was always played on the number 2 field at the same time). If Athletics had defeated [[City Rovers]] in the main match they would have won the championship for the first time however they lost to [[City Rovers|City]] which forced a final to be played the following week between the same two teams and [[City Rovers|City]] were again victorious to claim their 3rd straight championship.\n\n===Round 1===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 5 May\n| time =

Unfortunately the weather was particularly bad in the morning which had an effect on the attendance with only 1,000 spectators.

They started the season with a match against Wellington in which they ran up a huge score, winning by 71 points to 12. Their second match was played mid week against Hamilton, before two games against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] and finishing the season with a game against an Auckland provincial team.\n\nAuckland challenged [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] for the Northern Union Cup which it had lost to the same opponents in 2022. The match was drawn and so [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]] retained the cup. Auckland later played an Auckland provincial team and won comfortably in front of 7,000 spectators on [[Carlaw Park]]. A curtain-raiser was played between the Referees Association and the Junior Advisory Board, and was won by the former by 10 points to 6.

The First Grade competition featured 7 teams with the Fire Brigade club who featured in it in 1922 not entering a team. Fire Brigade had originally been named [[Grafton Athletic]] and had formed in 1914.\n\n[[City Rovers]] won their 6th championship title and the 3rd in succession after defeating Athletic 8\u20137 in the final. With a round to play City was only 2 competition points ahead of Athletic so it was decided to play a final to decide the champions. The match was played on [[Carlaw Park]] in front of an enormous crowd of 11,500 with \u00a3325 received in gate takings.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championship Final/City Defeat Athletic/Great Contest For Honours\n| page =4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LX| issue=18488\n| date = 1923-08-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19230827.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-03}}</ref> City were the second team to win three consecutive titles after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] had won the competition in 1917, 1918, and 1919. It was to be 61 years until it happened again with [[Mt Albert Lions|Mt Albert]] winning the title from 1984\u201386 before [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] won 4 titles from 1991\u201394, [[Glenora Bears|Glenora]] 3 titles from 1997\u201399, and [[Pt Chevalier Pirates|Pt Chevalier]] won 3 titles from 2013\u201315.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the second straight year and their third time in the competitions history after defeating [[City Rovers]] 14\u20133 in the final.\n\nThe Auckland representative team played 5 matches for 4 wins and a 20\u201320 draw. The draw was arguably the most significant result as it was in a match for the Northern Union Challenge Cup against [[Waikato rugby league team|South Auckland]]. Auckland had lost the cup to the same opposition the previous season and as the match was drawn South Auckland retained it. The two teams met again at the end of the season at Carlaw Park which Auckland won convincingly however the cup was not being played for as it was only defended at the holders home ground.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1922 Auckland Rugby League season|1922]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=15th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1923}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1924 Auckland Rugby League season|1924]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n===Manukau Rugby League Team===\nNear the end of the season the Manukau and Mangere clubs sent a letter to the Auckland Rugby League which was read at the management committee meeting on August 29. It stated that the two clubs had decided to amalgamate and would enter a team in the senior grade the following year provided permission was granted, which it was. The Manukau club is the [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau]] club of today, though the Mangere club is not related to the modern day [[Mangere East Hawks|Mangere East]] who were not founded until 1963. They were located predominantly in the Onehunga area before moving much later to their current location at Moyle Park.\n\n== Monteith Shield (First Grade Championship) ==\nThe 1923 First Grade Championship was arguably the most keenly fought in the competitions history to this point with three teams in the hunt for the title up until the last two weeks. [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] who were in a good position to win the title lost in the 12th and 13th rounds and bowed out of contention, leaving [[City Rovers]] and Athletics to contend. It was ultimately won by [[City Rovers]] who finished the season with a 10 win and 2 loss record, as did Athletic, with a final being required to determine the winner. City won by the narrowest of margins 8\u20137 to go back to back.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|13||12||0||1||231||69||'''24'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Athletic\n|13||10||0||3||180||87||'''20'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]\n|12||9||0||2||170||111||'''18'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Rugby Football Club|Devonport United]]\n|12||5||0||7||131||144||'''10'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]\n|12||4||0||8||118||179||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|12||2||0||10||88||182||'''4'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]]\n|12||1||0||11||93||239||'''2'''\n|-\n|}\n\nA final was played between [[City Rovers]] and Athletic after the round robin to decide the title with City winning 8 points to 7 in front of 11,500 spectators at Carlaw Park.\n\n=== First Grade Fixtures ===\nThe First Grade season was particularly close right until the end. In the final round the step was made to play both games on [[Carlaw Park]] number 1 field for the first time (usually one match was always played on the number 2 field at the same time). If Athletics had defeated [[City Rovers]] in the main match they would have won the championship for the first time however they lost to [[City Rovers|City]] which forced a final to be played the following week between the same two teams and [[City Rovers|City]] were again victorious to claim their 3rd straight championship.\n\n===Round 1===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 5 May\n| time =
