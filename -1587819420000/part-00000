It took Police two years to track Patrick Geary and charge him with Brookhouse's murder. A friend of Geary told the court that Geary had killed Brookhouse with an axe to stop him from informing Murray of Geary's sheep stealing activities.<ref>http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=WI18711208.2.13</ref> Geary was hanged in [[Old Melbourne Gaol|Melbourne]] in 1871.\n\n===Role in World War I===\nA plaque on the southern side of the Memorial Square commemorates two historic speeches given on consecutive nights in Colac, beginning on 31 July 1914 with the then Federal opposition leader, [[Andrew Fisher]], and followed the next night by the Prime Minister [[Joseph Cook]].

In 1837 he moved to London (which was then the capital of world finance) where he became the most noted American banker and helped to establish the young country's international credit. Having no son of his own to whom he could pass on his business, Peabody took on [[Junius Spencer Morgan]] as a partner in 1854 and their joint business would go on to become [[J.P.

He founded the [[Peabody Trust]] in Britain and the [[Peabody Institute]] and [[George Peabody Library]] in [[Baltimore]], and was responsible for many other charitable initiatives. For his generosity, he was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] and made a [[Freedom of the City|Freeman]] of the [[City of London]], among many other honors.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:George Peabody House.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Peabody's birthplace, now the [[George Peabody House Museum]], in Peabody, Massachusetts.]]\nPeabody was born in 1795 in what was then South Danvers (now [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]]), Massachusetts. His family had [[Puritan]] ancestors in the state. As one of seven children in a poor family, George suffered some deprivations during his childhood, and was able to attend school for only a few years. When he was a teenager, his father died, and he worked in his brother\u2019s shop to support his widowed mother and six siblings. He later expressed \"I have never forgotten and never can forget the great privations of my early years\".<ref name=\"Chernow 4\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXwPW8np0oEC|title=The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance|last=Chernow|first=Ron|date=2010-01-19|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|isbn=9780802198136|page=4|language=en}}</ref> These factors influenced his later devotion to both thrift and [[philanthropy]].\n\nIn 1816, he moved to Baltimore, where he made his career and would live for the next 20 years. He established his residence and office in the old [[Henry Fite House]], and became a businessman and financier.\n\nAt that time London, Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt were at the center of international banking and finance. As all international transactions were settled in gold or gold certificates, a developing nation like the United States had to rely upon agents and [[merchant bank]]s to raise capital through relationships with merchant banking houses in Europe. Only they held the quantity of reserves of capital necessary to extend long-term credit to a developing economy like that of the US.\n\nPeabody first visited England in 1827, seeking to use his firm and his agency to sell American states' [[Bond (finance)|bond]] issues, to raise capital for those states' various programs of \"internal improvements\" (principally the transportation infrastructure, such as roads, railroads, docks and canals). Over the next decade Peabody made four more trans-Atlantic trips, starting in 1835<ref name=\"Chernow 4\" /> and establishing a branch office in Liverpool. Later he established the banking firm of \"[[George Peabody & Co.|George Peabody & Company]]\" (later stylised as [[J.S. Morgan & Co.]]<ref name=\"Chernow 4\" />) in London. In 1837, he took up permanent residence in London, where he lived for the rest of his life.\n\nIn the 1840s, the state of Maryland defaulted on its debt and Peabody, having marketed about half of Maryland's securities to individual investors in Europe, became [[persona non grata]] around London. ''[[The Times]]'' of London noted that while Peabody was an \"American gentleman of the most unblemished character\", the [[Reform Club]] had blackballed him for being a citizen of a country that reneged on its debts. At first, Peabody sent letters to scold Baltimore friends about the need for the state to resume interest payment and rewarded reporters with small gratuities for favourable articles about the state.<ref name=\"Chernow 4\" />\n\nAt last, in 1845 he conspired with [[Barings Bank|Barings]] to push Maryland into resuming payment by setting up a political slush fund to spread propaganda for debt resumption and elect legislators who would placate their investors. By means of a secret account, the two firms transferred a thousand sterling to Baltimore and even bribed Daniel Webster, the orator and statesman, to make speeches for debt repayment. Their attempts were successful: pro-resumption [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] were elected and London bankers started to receive payments. Barings duplicated the same tactics in Pennsylvania. Florida and Mississippi were the most persistent debtors and as such were excluded from Peabody's later philanthropies.<ref name=\"Chernow 4\" />\n\nAlthough Peabody was briefly engaged in 1838 (and later allegedly had a mistress in [[Brighton]], [[England]], who bore him a daughter), he never married.<ref>Parker 1995, pp. 29\u201333.</ref> [[Ron Chernow]] describes him as \"homely\", with \"a rumpled face ... knobby chin, bulbous nose, side whiskers, and heavy-lidded eyes.\"<ref name=\"Chernow 4\"/> However, there are numerous photographs and portraits of Peabody that would suggest that Chernow's negative opinion is overly subjective.<ref>See early photos of Peabody, and portraits of him as a younger man in the collections of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)]], Maryland State Art Collection, and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].</ref>\n\nPeabody frequently entertained and provided letters of introduction for American businessmen visiting London, and became known for the Anglo-American dinners he hosted in honor of American diplomats and other worthies, and in celebration of the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]. In 1851, when the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] refused to support the American section at the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], Peabody advanced [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]3000 (then worth [[United States dollar|$]]15,000; worth about $300,0000 in 2015 dollars) to improve the exhibit and uphold the reputation of the United States. In 1854, he offended many of his American guests at a Fourth of July dinner when he chose to toast [[Queen Victoria]] before US President [[Franklin Pierce]]; Pierce's future successor, [[James Buchanan]], then Ambassador to London, left in a huff.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXwPW8np0oEC|title=The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance|last=Chernow|first=Ron|date=2010-01-19|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|isbn=9780802198136|page=7|language=en}}</ref> At around this time, Peabody began to suffer from [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[gout]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXwPW8np0oEC|title=The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance|last=Chernow|first=Ron|date=2010-01-19|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|isbn=9780802198136|page=8|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1867, on one of several return visits to the United States, and at the height of his financial success, Peabody was suggested by [[Francis Preston Blair]], an old crony of President [[Andrew Jackson]] and an active power in the smoldering [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] as a possible [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] in the cabinet of President [[Andrew Johnson]]. At about the same time, Peabody was also mentioned in newspapers as a future presidential candidate. Peabody described the presidential suggestion as a \"kind and complimentary reference\", but considered that at age 72, he was too old for either office.<ref>Parker 1995, pp. 164\u20135, 203, 214.</ref>\n[[File:Coat of Arms of George Peabody.svg|thumb|right|upright|Coat of arms of George Peabody]]\n\n==Business==\nWhile serving as a volunteer in the [[War of 1812]], Peabody met [[Elisha Riggs]], who, in 1814, provided financial backing for what became the wholesale [[dry goods]] firm of Riggs, Peabody & Co., specializing in importing dry goods from Britain. Branches were opened in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Philadelphia]] in 1822. Riggs retired in 1829, and the firm became Peabody, Riggs & Co., with the names reversed as Peabody became the senior partner.\n\nPeabody first visited England in 1827 to purchase wares, and to negotiate the sale of American cotton in [[Lancashire, England|Lancashire]]. He subsequently opened a branch office in [[Liverpool]], and British business began to play an increasingly important role in his affairs. He appears to have had some help in establishing himself from [[Sir William Brown, 1st Baronet, of Richmond Hill]] and James Brown, sons of another highly-successful Baltimore businessman, the Irishman Alexander Brown (founder of the venerable investment and banking firm of \"[[Alex. Brown & Sons]]\" in 1801), who managed their father's Liverpool office, opened in 1810.\n\nIn 1837, Peabody took up residence in London, and the following year, he started a [[banking]] business trading on his own account.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXwPW8np0oEC|title=The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance|last=Chernow|first=Ron|date=2010-01-19|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|isbn=9780802198136|page=5|language=en}}</ref> The banking firm of \"[[George Peabody and Company]]\" was not, however, established until 1851.<ref>Burk (1989), p. 1</ref> It was founded to meet the increasing demand for [[securities]] issued by the [[Timeline of United States railway history|American railroads]], and \u2013 although Peabody continued to deal in dry goods and other commodities \u2013 he increasingly focused his attentions on [[merchant bank]]ing, specializing in financing governments and large companies.<ref name=\":0\" /> The bank rose to become the premier American house in London.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn Peabody's early years in London, American state governments were notorious for defaulting on their debts to British lenders, and as a prominent American financier in London, Peabody often faced scorn for America's poor credit. (On one occasion, he was even blackballed from membership in a [[gentlemen's club]].) Peabody joined forces with [[Barings Bank]] to lobby American states for debt repayment, particularly his home state of Maryland. The campaign included printing propaganda and bribing clergy and politicians, most notably Senator [[Daniel Webster]]. Peabody made a significant profit when Maryland, Pennsylvania, and other states resumed payments, having previously bought up state bonds at a low cost.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXwPW8np0oEC|title=The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance|last=Chernow|first=Ron|date=2010-01-19|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|isbn=9780802198136|pages=5\u20137|language=en}}</ref> ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' cites him as having \"helped establish U.S. credit abroad.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Peabody|title=George Peabody {{!}} American merchant, financier, and philanthropist|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2016-05-18}}</ref>\n\nPeabody took [[Junius Spencer Morgan]] (father of [[J.

Peabody, Morgan & Co. then took the name [[J.S. Morgan & Co.]].

He therefore followed a Segregation policy whereby Blacks received an education consistent with their needs and abilities, but not geared to advance some to equality with whites.

Peabody made his money quietly in groceries in real estate. As a disciple of Benjamin Franklin, Peabody joined hard work with frugality, punctuality, and a strong public spirit. Peabody was a pioneer, whose success in philanthropy set the standard for American millionaires in a way that was unique in the world. By contrast, philanthropy in Europe typically came from Old established aristocratic families with vast inherited landed wealth built palaces and museums that were eventually opened to the public. The American way was for the self-made millionaires to become self-made philanthropists, a model that was perfected in the next generation by [[Andrew Carnegie]] (1835-1919) and [[John D Rockefeller]] (1839-1937).  They agreed with Peabody that riches produced a duty to give most of it back to the community through specialized permanent foundations. Peabody was especially imaginative, \u2013 and relied on his own memories of poverty and self learning to figure new ways to Educate and culturally enrich the next generation of poor youth, and thereby promote more equality in American society. [[Jacksonian Democracy]] promoted equality in politics; he promoted equality and culture through libraries, schools, museums and colleges.  He rejected doling out bundles of cash to the poor as a waste of money in comparison to building permanent institutions that produced a steady stream of benefits. His last great benefaction was the Peabody Education Fund, which had a dramatic impact in improving southern public schools. It was the first major Philanthropy that gave large sums to very poor Blacks on the same terms as whites, albeit within the strict limits imposed by Southern culture regarding racial segregation and white supremacy. Even more important was the institutional framework that Peabody devised, of a permanent professional foundation, run by experts in philanthropy, who were guided by and indeed invented the best practices of the day. <ref> Roderick Nash, \"Peabody, George, \" in  John A.

He is widely regarded as the father of modern [[philanthropy]].\n\nBorn into a poor family in [[Massachusetts]], Peabody went into business in [[dry goods]] and later into banking. In 1837 he moved to London (which was then the capital of world finance) where he became the most noted American banker and helped to establish the young country's international credit. Having no son of his own to whom he could pass on his business, Peabody took on [[Junius Spencer Morgan]] as a partner in 1854 and their joint business would go on to become [[J.P. Morgan & Co.]] after Peabody's 1864 retirement.\n\nIn his old age, Peabody won worldwide acclaim for his philanthropy. He founded the [[Peabody Trust]] in Britain and the [[Peabody Institute]] and [[George Peabody Library]] in [[Baltimore]], and was responsible for many other charitable initiatives. For his generosity, he was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] and made a [[Freedom of the City|Freeman]] of the [[City of London]], among many other honors.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:George Peabody House.JPG|thumb|left|Peabody's birthplace, now the [[George Peabody House Museum]], in Peabody, Massachusetts.]]\nPeabody was born in 1795 in what was then South Danvers (now [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]]), Massachusetts. His family had [[Puritan]] ancestors in the state. As one of seven children in a poor family, George suffered some deprivations during his childhood, and was able to attend school for only a few years. When he was a teenager, his father died, and he worked in his brother\u2019s shop to support his widowed mother and six siblings. He later expressed \"I have never forgotten and never can forget the great privations of my early years\".<ref name=\"Chernow 4\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXwPW8np0oEC|title=The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance|last=Chernow|first=Ron|date=2010-01-19|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|isbn=9780802198136|page=4|language=en}}</ref> These factors influenced his later devotion to both thrift and [[philanthropy]].\n\nIn 1816, he moved to Baltimore, where he made his career and would live for the next 20 years. He established his residence and office in the old [[Henry Fite House]], and became a businessman and financier.\n\nAt that time London, Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt were at the center of international banking and finance. As all international transactions were settled in gold or gold certificates, a developing nation like the United States had to rely upon agents and [[merchant bank]]s to raise capital through relationships with merchant banking houses in Europe. Only they held the quantity of reserves of capital necessary to extend long-term credit to a developing economy like that of the US.\n\nPeabody first visited England in 1827, seeking to use his firm and his agency to sell American states' [[Bond (finance)|bond]] issues, to raise capital for those states' various programs of \"internal improvements\" (principally the transportation infrastructure, such as roads, railroads, docks and canals). Over the next decade Peabody made four more trans-Atlantic trips, starting in 1835<ref name=\"Chernow 4\" /> and establishing a branch office in Liverpool. Later he established the banking firm of \"[[George Peabody & Co.|George Peabody & Company]]\" (later stylised as [[J.S. Morgan & Co.]]<ref name=\"Chernow 4\" />) in London. In 1837, he took up permanent residence in London, where he lived for the rest of his life.\n\nIn the 1840s, the state of Maryland defaulted on its debt and Peabody, having marketed about half of Maryland's securities to individual investors in Europe, became [[persona non grata]] around London. ''[[The Times]]'' of London noted that while Peabody was an \"American gentleman of the most unblemished character\", the [[Reform Club]] had blackballed him for being a citizen of a country that reneged on its debts. At first, Peabody sent letters to scold Baltimore friends about the need for the state to resume interest payment and rewarded reporters with small gratuities for favourable articles about the state.<ref name=\"Chernow 4\" />\n\nAt last, in 1845 he conspired with [[Barings Bank|Barings]] to push Maryland into resuming payment by setting up a political slush fund to spread propaganda for debt resumption and elect legislators who would placate their investors. By means of a secret account, the two firms transferred a thousand sterling to Baltimore and even bribed Daniel Webster, the orator and statesman, to make speeches for debt repayment. Their attempts were successful: pro-resumption [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] were elected and London bankers started to receive payments. Barings duplicated the same tactics in Pennsylvania. Florida and Mississippi were the most persistent debtors and as such were excluded from Peabody's later philanthropies.<ref name=\"Chernow 4\" />\n\nAlthough Peabody was briefly engaged in 1838 (and later allegedly had a mistress in [[Brighton]], [[England]], who bore him a daughter), he never married.<ref>Parker 1995, pp. 29\u201333.</ref> [[Ron Chernow]] describes him as \"homely\", with \"a rumpled face ... knobby chin, bulbous nose, side whiskers, and heavy-lidded eyes.\"<ref name=\"Chernow 4\"/> However, there are numerous photographs and portraits of Peabody that would suggest that Chernow's negative opinion is overly subjective.<ref>See early photos of Peabody, and portraits of him as a younger man in the collections of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)]], Maryland State Art Collection, and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].</ref>\n\nPeabody frequently entertained and provided letters of introduction for American businessmen visiting London, and became known for the Anglo-American dinners he hosted in honor of American diplomats and other worthies, and in celebration of the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]. In 1851, when the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] refused to support the American section at the [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], Peabody advanced [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]3000 (then worth [[United States dollar|$]]15,000; worth about $300,0000 in 2015 dollars) to improve the exhibit and uphold the reputation of the United States. In 1854, he offended many of his American guests at a Fourth of July dinner when he chose to toast [[Queen Victoria]] before US President [[Franklin Pierce]]; Pierce's future successor, [[James Buchanan]], then Ambassador to London, left in a huff.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXwPW8np0oEC|title=The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance|last=Chernow|first=Ron|date=2010-01-19|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|isbn=9780802198136|page=7|language=en}}</ref> At around this time, Peabody began to suffer from [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[gout]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXwPW8np0oEC|title=The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance|last=Chernow|first=Ron|date=2010-01-19|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|isbn=9780802198136|page=8|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1867, on one of several return visits to the United States, and at the height of his financial success, Peabody was suggested by [[Francis Preston Blair]], an old crony of President [[Andrew Jackson]] and an active power in the smoldering [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] as a possible [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] in the cabinet of President [[Andrew Johnson]]. At about the same time, Peabody was also mentioned in newspapers as a future presidential candidate. Peabody described the presidential suggestion as a \"kind and complimentary reference\", but considered that at age 72, he was too old for either office.<ref>Parker 1995, pp. 164\u20135, 203, 214.</ref>\n[[File:Coat of Arms of George Peabody.svg|thumb|right|upright|Coat of arms of George Peabody]]\n\n==Business==\nWhile serving as a volunteer in the [[War of 1812]], Peabody met [[Elisha Riggs]], who, in 1814, provided financial backing for what became the wholesale [[dry goods]] firm of Riggs, Peabody & Co., specializing in importing dry goods from Britain. Branches were opened in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Philadelphia]] in 1822. Riggs retired in 1829, and the firm became Peabody, Riggs & Co., with the names reversed as Peabody became the senior partner.\n\nPeabody first visited England in 1827 to purchase wares, and to negotiate the sale of American cotton in [[Lancashire, England|Lancashire]]. He subsequently opened a branch office in [[Liverpool]], and British business began to play an increasingly important role in his affairs. He appears to have had some help in establishing himself from [[Sir William Brown, 1st Baronet, of Richmond Hill]] and James Brown, sons of another highly-successful Baltimore businessman, the Irishman Alexander Brown (founder of the venerable investment and banking firm of \"[[Alex. Brown & Sons]]\" in 1801), who managed their father's Liverpool office, opened in 1810.\n\nIn 1837, Peabody took up residence in London, and the following year, he started a [[banking]] business trading on his own account.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXwPW8np0oEC|title=The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance|last=Chernow|first=Ron|date=2010-01-19|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|isbn=9780802198136|page=5|language=en}}</ref> The banking firm of \"[[George Peabody and Company]]\" was not, however, established until 1851.<ref>Burk (1989), p. 1</ref> It was founded to meet the increasing demand for [[securities]] issued by the [[Timeline of United States railway history|American railroads]], and \u2013 although Peabody continued to deal in dry goods and other commodities \u2013 he increasingly focused his attentions on [[merchant bank]]ing, specializing in financing governments and large companies.<ref name=\":0\" /> The bank rose to become the premier American house in London.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn Peabody's early years in London, American state governments were notorious for defaulting on their debts to British lenders, and as a prominent American financier in London, Peabody often faced scorn for America's poor credit. (On one occasion, he was even blackballed from membership in a [[gentlemen's club]].) Peabody joined forces with [[Barings Bank]] to lobby American states for debt repayment, particularly his home state of Maryland. The campaign included printing propaganda and bribing clergy and politicians, most notably Senator [[Daniel Webster]]. Peabody made a significant profit when Maryland, Pennsylvania, and other states resumed payments, having previously bought up state bonds at a low cost.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xXwPW8np0oEC|title=The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance|last=Chernow|first=Ron|date=2010-01-19|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|isbn=9780802198136|pages=5\u20137|language=en}}</ref> ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' cites him as having \"helped establish U.S. credit abroad.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Peabody|title=George Peabody {{!}} American merchant, financier, and philanthropist|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2016-05-18}}</ref>\n\nPeabody took [[Junius Spencer Morgan]] (father of [[J.

Peabody, Morgan & Co. then took the name [[J.S. Morgan & Co.]].

Vaughn, Dr. Barnas Sears was a highly efficient, dedicated official who dispersed the Peabody Fund moneys until his death in 1880. Sears accepted the white supremacy positions prevalent in the southern elite, fearing that integrated schools would be a disaster that would drive whites away and destroy the public school system.. He therefore followed a Segregation policy whereby Blacks received an education consistent with their needs and abilities, but not geared to advance some to equality with whites. Vaughn concludes that Sears helped postpone the end of segregated schooling.<ref>William P.

Peabody made his money quietly in groceries in real estate. As a disciple of Benjamin Franklin, Peabody joined hard work with frugality, punctuality, and a strong public spirit. Peabody was a pioneer, whose success in philanthropy set the standard for American millionaires in a way that was unique in the world. By contrast, philanthropy in Europe typically came from Old established aristocratic families with vast inherited landed wealth built palaces and museums that were eventually opened to the public. The American way was for the self-made millionaires to become self-made philanthropists, a model that was perfected in the next generation by [[Andrew Carnegie]] (1835-1919) and [[John D Rockefeller]] (1839-1937).  They agreed with Peabody that riches produced a duty to give most of it back to the community through specialized permanent foundations. Peabody was especially imaginative, \u2013 and relied on his own memories of poverty and self learning to figure new ways to Educate and culturally enrich the next generation of poor youth, and thereby promote more equality in American society. [[Jacksonian Democracy]] promoted equality in politics; he promoted equality and culture through libraries, schools, museums and colleges.  He rejected doling out bundles of cash to the poor as a waste of money in comparison to building permanent institutions that produced a steady stream of benefits. His last great benefaction was the Peabody Education Fund, which had a dramatic impact in improving southern public schools. It was the first major Philanthropy that gave large sums to very poor Blacks on the same terms as whites, albeit within the strict limits imposed by Southern culture regarding racial segregation and white supremacy. Even more important was the institutional framework that Peabody devised, of a permanent professional foundation, run by experts in philanthropy, who were guided by and indeed invented the best practices of the day. <ref> Roderick Nash, \"Peabody, George, \" in  John A.

This includes citizens being able to vote for different laws and leaders.\n|\n*{{Flagicon|India}} [[India]]\n*{{Flagicon|Indonesia}} [[Indonesia]]\n*{{Flagicon|Nigeria}} [[Nigeria]]\n*{{Flagicon|France}} [[France]]\n*{{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Germany|Germany (1990-present)]]\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[United States]]\n|-\n|[[Oligarchy]]\n|Oligarchy, meaning \"rule of the few\", is a form of [[power structure]] in which [[Power (social and political)|power]] rests with a small number of people. These people might be distinguished by [[nobility]], [[wealth]], [[family ties]], [[education]] or [[corporate]], [[religious]] or [[military]] control. Such states are often controlled by families who typically pass their influence from one [[generation]] to the next, but [[inheritance]] is not a necessary condition for the application of this term.\n|\n*{{Flagicon|South Africa|variant=1928}} [[Apartheid|South Africa (1948-1994)]]\n|}\n\n=== Types of democracy ===\n{{further|Outline of democracy}}\nIn [[Democracy|democracies]], large proportions of the population are provided the means either to make decisions themselves or to elect representatives to make those decisions instead. Usually, though not necessarily (see Demarchy), this means voting.  Significant in most vote-based democracies are political parties: groups of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties will have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems. \n \n''Note: These categories are not exclusive.''\n\nMany democracies are vulnerable to various forms of abuse, which may transform the government into an autocracy or oligarchy. Most autocracies or oligarchies still call themselves democracies.

These groups, sometimes termed \"policy juries\", \"citizens' juries\", or \"consensus conferences\", deliberately make decisions about public policies in much the same way that [[jury|juries]] decide criminal cases. Demarchy, in theory, could overcome some of the functional problems of conventional [[representative democracy]], which is widely subject to manipulation by [[special interests]] and a division between professional policymakers (politicians and lobbyists) vs. a largely passive, uninvolved and often uninformed electorate. According to Australian philosopher [[John Burnheim]], random selection of policymakers would make it easier for everyday citizens to meaningfully participate, and harder for special interests to corrupt the process.\n\nMore generally, random selection of decision makers from a larger group is known as [[sortition]] (from the Latin base for lottery). The [[Athenian democracy]] made much use of sortition, with nearly all government offices filled by lottery (of full citizens) rather than by election. Candidates were almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of wealth and status.\n|\n* Ancient Athens<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Athenian democracy in the age of Demosthenes : structure, principles, and ideology|last=Hansen, Mogens Herman, 1940-|date=1999|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|isbn=1853995851|edition=[2nd ed.]|location=[Bristol]|oclc=45392658}}</ref>\n* Northern Italy and Venice (12th\u201318th century)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The political potential of sortition a study of the random selection of citizens for public office / Oliver Dowlen.|last=Dowlen, Oliver, 1953-|date=2008|publisher=Exeter, UK ; Charlottesville, VA|isbn=9781845401795|oclc=213307148}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Direct democracy]] || Variant of democracy; government in which the people represent themselves and vote directly for new laws and public policy.\n|{{Flagicon image|Flag of Switzerland.svg}} [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of {{Flagicon image|Flag of Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden.svg}} [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and {{Flagicon image|Flag of Canton of Glarus.svg}} [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]]\n|-\n|[[Electocracy]]|| Variant of democracy; a form of representative democracy where citizens are able to vote for their government but cannot participate directly in governmental decision making and where the government does not share any power almost as the government has absolute power\n|\n*{{Flagicon|Iraq}} [[Iraq]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/09/05/hypocrisy_in_sowing_democracy/|title=Hypocrisy in sowing democracy|last=Greenway|first=H.

It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive [[election]]s between [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|multiple distinct]] [[Political party|political parties]], a [[separation of powers]] into different [[branches of government]], the [[rule of law]] in everyday life as part of an [[open society]], and the protection of [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]] for all persons. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [[constitution]], either formally written or [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]], to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [[social contract]]. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [[republic]], such as [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], or the [[United States]]; or a [[constitutional monarchy]], such as [[Japan]] or [[Spain]]. It may have a [[presidential system]] ([[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], or the [[United States]]), a [[semi-presidential system]] ([[France]], or [[Portugal]]), or a [[parliamentary system]] ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[India]], [[Italy]], or [[New Zealand]]).\n|\n*{{Flagicon|India}} [[India]]\n*{{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Germany]]\n*{{Flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[United Kingdom]]\n*{{Flagicon|Indonesia}} [[Indonesia]]\n|-\n|[[Liquid democracy]]  ||\nVariant of democracy; government in which the people represent themselves or choose to temporarily delegate their vote to another voter to vote for new laws and public policy.\n|Experiments have mostly been conducted on a local-level or exclusively through online platforms\n|-\n| [[Representative democracy]] || Variant of democracy; wherein the people or citizens of a country elect representatives to create and implement public policy in place of active participation by the people.\n|Almost all democratic systems\n|-\n| [[Social democracy]] || Variant of democracy; social democracy rejects the \"either/or\" phobiocratic/polarization interpretation of capitalism versus socialism. Social democracy argues that all citizens should be legally entitled to certain social rights. These are made up of universal access to public services such as: education, health care, workers' compensation, public transportation, and other services including child care and care for the elderly. Social democracy is connected with the trade union labour movement and supports collective bargaining rights for workers. Contemporary social democracy advocates freedom from discrimination based on differences of: ability/disability, age, ethnicity, sex, gender, language, race, religion, sexual orientation, and social class.\n|\n*{{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Germany]]\n*{{Flagicon|Austria}} [[Austria]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbuch der \u00f6sterreichischen Wirtschaftspolitik|last=Abele|first=Hanns|publisher=Manz|others=|year=1982|isbn=3214070509|location=Wien|page=145|oclc=10694901}}</ref>\n*{{Flagicon|Sweden}} [[Sweden]]\n*{{Flagicon|Norway}} [[Norway]]\n*{{Flagicon|Denmark}} [[Denmark]]\n*{{Flagicon|Finland}} [[Finland]]\n*{{Flagicon|Iceland}} [[Iceland]]\n|-\n| [[Soviet democracy]] || Variant of democracy; The citizens are governing by directly elected councils.

These people may spread power and elect candidates equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or monarchic. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several rulers.\n\nSome historical examples of oligarchy are the [[Roman Republic]], in which only males of the nobility could run for office and only wealthy males could vote, and the [[Athenian democracy]], which used [[sortition]] to elect candidates, almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of land, wealth and status.

A portmanteau of Internet and aristocracy, netocracy refers to a perceived global upper-class that bases its power on a technological advantage and networking skills, in comparison to what is portrayed as a bourgeoisie of a gradually diminishing importance. The netocracy concept has been compared with [[Richard Florida]]'s concept of the [[creative class]]. Bard and S\u00f6derqvist have also defined an under-class in opposition to the [[netocracy]], which they refer to as the consumitariat.\n|-\n|[[Noocracy]]\n|Rule by the wise; a system of governance in which decision making is in the hands of philosophers. (advocated by [[Plato]])\n|-\n| [[Plutocracy]] || Rule by the wealthy; a system wherein governance is indebted to, dependent upon or heavily influenced by the desires of the rich. Plutocratic influence can alter any form of government. For instance, in a republic, if a significant number of elected representative positions are dependent upon financial support from wealthy sources, it is a plutocratic republic.\n|-\n|[[Particracy]]\n|Rule by a dominant [[political party]] (or parties).\n|-\n|[[Stratocracy]]\n|Rule by military service; a system of governance composed of military government in which the state and the military are traditionally or [[constitution]]ally the same entity. Citizens with mandatory or voluntary active military service or who have been honorably discharged have the right to govern. (Therefore, stratocracy is not to be confused with \"[[military junta]]\" or \"[[military dictatorship]]\".) The [[Sparta]]n [[city-state]] is a historical example; its social system and constitution were completely focused on military training and excellence. Stratocratic ideology often attaches to the honor-oriented [[timocracy]].\n|-\n| [[Technocracy]] || Rule by the educated or technical experts; a system of governance where people who are skilled or proficient govern in their respective areas of expertise in technology would be in control of all decision making. Doctors, engineers, scientists, professionals and technologists who have knowledge, expertise, or skills would compose the governing body instead of politicians, businessmen and economists.<ref>Ernst R.

[[Holy See|The Vatican]]'s (see [[Pope]]), [[Iran]]'s (see [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]), [[Caliphate]]s and other [[Islamic state]]s are historically considered ''theocracies''.\n|-\n| [[Timocracy]] || Rule by the [[honour]]able; a system of governance ruled by honorable citizens and property owners. [[Socrates]] defines a timocracy as a government ruled by people who love honour and are selected according to the degree of honour they hold in society. This form of timocracy is very similar to [[meritocracy]], in the sense that individuals of outstanding character or faculty are placed in the seat of power.\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Types of autocracy ===\n[[Autocracy|Autocracies]] are ruled by a single entity with absolute power, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for implicit threat). That entity may be an individual, as in a [[dictatorship]] or it may be a group, as in a [[one-party state]]. The word [[despotism]] means to \"rule in the fashion of despots\" and is often used to describe autocracy.\n\nHistorical examples of autocracy include the [[Roman Empire]], [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Union]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n| [[Dictatorship|Civilian Dictatorship]] || A dictatorship where power resides in the hands of one single person or [[polity]]. That person may be, for example, an [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]] or a [[dictatorship|dictator]], but can also be an elected [[President (government title)|president]]. The [[Roman Republic]] made dictators to lead during times of war; but the Roman dictators only held power for a small time. In modern times, an autocrat's rule is one that not stopped by any rules of law, [[constitution]]s, or other social and political institutions. After World War II, many governments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa were ruled by autocratic governments. Examples of dictators include: [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]].\n|-\n| [[Military dictatorship|Military Dictatorship]] ||A dictatorship primarily enforced by the military. Military dictators are different from [[Civilian dictatorship|civilian dictators]] for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule, and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justifies its position as \u201cneutral\u201d arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many juntas adopt titles, such as \u201cNational Redemption Council\", \u201cCommittee of National Restoration\", or \u201cNational Liberation Committee\". Military leaders often rule as a junta, selecting one of them as the head. \n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pejorative attributes ===\nRegardless of the form of government, the actual governance may be influenced by sectors with [[Power (social and political)|political power]] which are not part of the formal government.

A constitution is normally used so the people of that government has civil and ethical rights. \n|-\n|[[Monarchy]]\n|A monarchy is a [[form of government]] in which a group, generally a family representing a [[dynasty]], embodies the country's [[national identity]] and its head, the [[monarch]], exercises the role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic ([[crowned republic]]), to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]), to completely autocratic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally the monarch's post is [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited]] and lasts until death or abdication. In contrast, [[Elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] require the monarch to be elected. Both types have further variations as there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. For example, in some<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Avoid weasel words|which?]]'']</sup>elected monarchies only pedigrees are taken into account for eligibility of the next ruler, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, etc. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] is subject to effective election. There have been cases where the term of a monarch's [[reign]] is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance.\n|-\n|[[Republic]]\n|A republic ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''[[res publica]]'') is a [[form of government]] in which the country is considered a \"public matter\", not the [[Res privata|private concern or property]] of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are not inherited, but are attained through elections expressing the [[consent of the governed]]. Such leadership positions are therefore expected to fairly represent the citizen body. It is a form of government under which the head of state is not a [[monarch]]. In American English, the definition of a republic can also refer specifically to a government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body, also known as a [[representative democracy]] (a [[democratic republic]]) and exercise power according to the [[rule of law]] (a [[Constitutionalism|constitutional]] republic).\n|}\n\n==== Types of monarchy ====\nCountries with [[monarchy]] attributes are those where a family or group of families (rarely another type of group), called the [[wikt:Special:Search/royalty|royalty]], represents national identity, with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals, called the monarch, who mostly rule kingdoms. The actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical ([[crowned republic]]) to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]) to completely despotic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally and in most cases, the post of the monarch is [[inheritance|inherited]], but there are also [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] where the monarch is elected.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n| [[Absolute monarchy]] || A traditional and historical system where the monarch exercises ultimate governing authority as [[head of state]] and [[head of government]].

Under feudalism, all the land in a kingdom belonged to the king. However, the king would give some of the land to the lords or nobles who fought for him. These presents of land were called manors. Then the nobles gave some of their land to vassals. The vassals then had to do duties for the nobles. The lands of vassals were called fiefs.\nA similar system is the [[Iqta]], used by medieval [[Islamic]] societies of the middle east and north Africa. This functioned much like the feudal system but generally had titles that weren't granted to a family dynasty but to individuals at the behest of the sultan and generally only required a tax from the lower classes, instead of military service and/or manual labour like in the feudal system.\n|-\n|[[Minarchism]]\n|A variant of [[capitalism]] which advocates for the [[State (polity)|State]] to exist solely to provide a very small number of services. A popular model of the State proposed by minarchists is known as the [[night-watchman state]], in which the only governmental functions are to protect citizens from [[aggression]], [[theft]], [[breach of contract]], and [[fraud]] as defined by [[property law]]s, limiting it to three institutions: the [[military]], the [[police]], and [[courts]].\n|-\n|[[Monarchism]]\n|A system in which the government is headed by an agreed upon head of the [[nobility]] who is known as the [[monarch]], usually in the form of a [[king]] or [[emperor]] (but also less commonly a [[Queen regnant|queen]] or empress). In most monarchical systems the position of monarch is one [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited]] from a previous ruler by [[Heredity|bloodline]] or marriage, but in other cases it may be a position elected by the [[nobility]] themselves, as was the case in the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]] and the medieval [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n|-\n|[[Republicanism]]\n|A system in which the laws and governmental policies of the state are considered a \"public matter\" and decided by the citizens of the society, whoever they may be.

This is the same thing as a [[Federation|federal government]] which may have distinct powers at various levels authorized or delegated to it by its member states, though the adjective 'central' is sometimes used to describe it. The structure of central governments varies. Many countries have created autonomous regions by delegating powers from the central government to governments at a sub national level, such as a regional, state or local level. Based on a broad definition of a basic political system, there are two or more levels of government that exist within an established territory and govern through common institutions with overlapping or shared powers as prescribed by a [[constitution]] or other law.\n|-\n|[[City-state|City-State]]\n|A [[sovereign state]], also described as a type of small independent country, that usually consists of a single city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as [[Rome]], [[Athens]], [[Carthage]], and the [[Italian city-states]] during the [[Renaissance]]. Today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies currently to [[Singapore]], [[Monaco]], and [[Vatican City]]. City states are also sometimes called [[micro-state]]s which however also includes other configurations of very small countries.\n|-\n|[[Commune]]\n|From the [[Medieval Latin]] ''[[communia]].''

The [[social welfare]] function carried out by the state is instead carried out by corporations in the form of benefits to employees. Although corporate republics do not exist officially in the modern world, they are often used in works of fiction or [[political criticism|political commentary]] as a warning of the perceived dangers of unbridled [[capitalism]]. In such works, they usually arise when a single, vastly powerful corporation deposes a weak government, over time or in a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]].\n\nSome political scientists have also considered [[state socialist]] nations to be forms of corporate republics, with the state assuming full control of all economic and political life and establishing a monopoly on everything within national boundaries \u2013 effectively making the state itself amount to a giant corporation.\n|-\n|[[Cyberocracy]] || Theoretical [[form of government]] that rules by the effective use of information\n|-|-\n|Magocracy || Rule by a government with the highest and main authority being either a [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]], sage, sorcerer, wizard, witch, or some other magic user.

Usually, though not necessarily (see Demarchy), this means voting.  Significant in most vote-based democracies are political parties: groups of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties will have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems. \n \n''Note: These categories are not exclusive.''\n\nMany democracies are vulnerable to various forms of abuse, which may transform the government into an autocracy or oligarchy. Most autocracies or oligarchies still call themselves democracies.

These groups, sometimes termed \"policy juries\", \"citizens' juries\", or \"consensus conferences\", deliberately make decisions about public policies in much the same way that [[jury|juries]] decide criminal cases. Demarchy, in theory, could overcome some of the functional problems of conventional [[representative democracy]], which is widely subject to manipulation by [[special interests]] and a division between professional policymakers (politicians and lobbyists) vs. a largely passive, uninvolved and often uninformed electorate. According to Australian philosopher [[John Burnheim]], random selection of policymakers would make it easier for everyday citizens to meaningfully participate, and harder for special interests to corrupt the process.\n\nMore generally, random selection of decision makers from a larger group is known as [[sortition]] (from the Latin base for lottery). The [[Athenian democracy]] made much use of sortition, with nearly all government offices filled by lottery (of full citizens) rather than by election. Candidates were almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of wealth and status.\n|\n* Ancient Athens<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Athenian democracy in the age of Demosthenes : structure, principles, and ideology|last=Hansen, Mogens Herman, 1940-|date=1999|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|isbn=1853995851|edition=[2nd ed.]|location=[Bristol]|oclc=45392658}}</ref>\n* Northern Italy and Venice (12th\u201318th century)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The political potential of sortition a study of the random selection of citizens for public office / Oliver Dowlen.|last=Dowlen, Oliver, 1953-|date=2008|publisher=Exeter, UK ; Charlottesville, VA|isbn=9781845401795|oclc=213307148}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Direct democracy]] || Variant of democracy; government in which the people represent themselves and vote directly for new laws and public policy.\n|{{Flagicon image|Flag of Switzerland.svg}} [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] of {{Flagicon image|Flag of Canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden.svg}} [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] and {{Flagicon image|Flag of Canton of Glarus.svg}} [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]]\n|-\n|[[Electocracy]]|| Variant of democracy; a form of representative democracy where citizens are able to vote for their government but cannot participate directly in governmental decision making and where the government does not share any power almost as the government has absolute power\n|\n*{{Flagicon|Iraq}} [[Iraq]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/09/05/hypocrisy_in_sowing_democracy/|title=Hypocrisy in sowing democracy|last=Greenway|first=H.

It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive [[election]]s between [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|multiple distinct]] [[Political party|political parties]], a [[separation of powers]] into different [[branches of government]], the [[rule of law]] in everyday life as part of an [[open society]], and the protection of [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]] for all persons. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [[constitution]], either formally written or [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]], to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [[social contract]]. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [[republic]], such as [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], or the [[United States]]; or a [[constitutional monarchy]], such as [[Japan]] or [[Spain]]. It may have a [[presidential system]] ([[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], or the [[United States]]), a [[semi-presidential system]] ([[France]], or [[Portugal]]), or a [[parliamentary system]] ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[India]], [[Italy]], or [[New Zealand]]).\n|\n*{{Flagicon|India}} [[India]]\n*{{Flagicon|Germany}} [[Germany]]\n*{{Flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[United Kingdom]]\n*{{Flagicon|Indonesia}} [[Indonesia]]\n|-\n|[[Liquid democracy]]  ||\nVariant of democracy; government in which the people represent themselves or choose to temporarily delegate their vote to another voter to vote for new laws and public policy.\n|Experiments have mostly been conducted on a local-level or exclusively through online platforms\n|-\n| [[Representative democracy]] || Variant of democracy; wherein the people or citizens of a country elect representatives to create and implement public policy in place of active participation by the people.\n|Almost all democratic systems\n|-\n| [[Social democracy]] || Variant of democracy; social democracy rejects the \"either/or\" phobiocratic/polarization interpretation of capitalism versus socialism. Social democracy argues that all citizens should be legally entitled to certain social rights. These are made up of universal access to public services such as: education, health care, workers' compensation, public transportation, and other services including child care and care for the elderly. Social democracy is connected with the trade union labour movement and supports collective bargaining rights for workers.

These people may spread power and elect candidates equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or monarchic. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several rulers.\n\nSome historical examples of oligarchy are the [[Roman Republic]], in which only males of the nobility could run for office and only wealthy males could vote, and the [[Athenian democracy]], which used [[sortition]] to elect candidates, almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of land, wealth and status.

A portmanteau of Internet and aristocracy, netocracy refers to a perceived global upper-class that bases its power on a technological advantage and networking skills, in comparison to what is portrayed as a bourgeoisie of a gradually diminishing importance. The netocracy concept has been compared with [[Richard Florida]]'s concept of the [[creative class]]. Bard and S\u00f6derqvist have also defined an under-class in opposition to the [[netocracy]], which they refer to as the consumitariat.\n|-\n|[[Noocracy]]\n|Rule by the wise; a system of governance in which decision making is in the hands of philosophers. (advocated by [[Plato]])\n|-\n| [[Plutocracy]] || Rule by the wealthy; a system wherein governance is indebted to, dependent upon or heavily influenced by the desires of the rich. Plutocratic influence can alter any form of government. For instance, in a republic, if a significant number of elected representative positions are dependent upon financial support from wealthy sources, it is a plutocratic republic.\n|-\n|[[Particracy]]\n|Rule by a dominant [[political party]] (or parties).\n|-\n|[[Stratocracy]]\n|Rule by military service; a system of governance composed of military government in which the state and the military are traditionally or [[constitution]]ally the same entity. Citizens with mandatory or voluntary active military service or who have been honorably discharged have the right to govern. (Therefore, stratocracy is not to be confused with \"[[military junta]]\" or \"[[military dictatorship]]\".) The [[Sparta]]n [[city-state]] is a historical example; its social system and constitution were completely focused on military training and excellence. Stratocratic ideology often attaches to the honor-oriented [[timocracy]].\n|-\n| [[Technocracy]] || Rule by the educated or technical experts; a system of governance where people who are skilled or proficient govern in their respective areas of expertise in technology would be in control of all decision making. Doctors, engineers, scientists, professionals and technologists who have knowledge, expertise, or skills would compose the governing body instead of politicians, businessmen and economists.<ref>Ernst R.

[[Holy See|The Vatican]]'s (see [[Pope]]), [[Iran]]'s (see [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]), [[Caliphate]]s and other [[Islamic state]]s are historically considered ''theocracies''.\n|-\n| [[Timocracy]] || Rule by the [[honour]]able; a system of governance ruled by honorable citizens and property owners. [[Socrates]] defines a timocracy as a government ruled by people who love honour and are selected according to the degree of honour they hold in society. This form of timocracy is very similar to [[meritocracy]], in the sense that individuals of outstanding character or faculty are placed in the seat of power.\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Types of autocracy ===\n[[Autocracy|Autocracies]] are ruled by a single entity with absolute power, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for implicit threat). That entity may be an individual, as in a [[dictatorship]] or it may be a group, as in a [[one-party state]]. The word [[despotism]] means to \"rule in the fashion of despots\" and is often used to describe autocracy.\n\nHistorical examples of autocracy include the [[Roman Empire]], [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Union]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n| [[Dictatorship|Civilian Dictatorship]] || A dictatorship where power resides in the hands of one single person or [[polity]]. That person may be, for example, an [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]] or a [[dictatorship|dictator]], but can also be an elected [[President (government title)|president]]. The [[Roman Republic]] made dictators to lead during times of war; but the Roman dictators only held power for a small time. In modern times, an autocrat's rule is one that not stopped by any rules of law, [[constitution]]s, or other social and political institutions. After World War II, many governments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa were ruled by autocratic governments. Examples of dictators include: [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]], and [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]].\n|-\n| [[Military dictatorship|Military Dictatorship]] ||A dictatorship primarily enforced by the military. Military dictators are different from [[Civilian dictatorship|civilian dictators]] for a number of reasons: their motivations for seizing power, the institutions through which they organize their rule, and the ways in which they leave power. Often viewing itself as saving the nation from the corrupt or myopic civilian politicians, a military dictatorship justifies its position as \u201cneutral\u201d arbiters on the basis of their membership within the armed forces. For example, many juntas adopt titles, such as \u201cNational Redemption Council\", \u201cCommittee of National Restoration\", or \u201cNational Liberation Committee\". Military leaders often rule as a junta, selecting one of them as the head. \n|-\n|}\n\n=== Pejorative attributes ===\nRegardless of the form of government, the actual governance may be influenced by sectors with [[Power (social and political)|political power]] which are not part of the formal government.

A constitution is normally used so the people of that government has civil and ethical rights. \n|-\n|[[Monarchy]]\n|A monarchy is a [[form of government]] in which a group, generally a family representing a [[dynasty]], embodies the country's [[national identity]] and its head, the [[monarch]], exercises the role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic ([[crowned republic]]), to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]), to completely autocratic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally the monarch's post is [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited]] and lasts until death or abdication. In contrast, [[Elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] require the monarch to be elected. Both types have further variations as there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. For example, in some<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Avoid weasel words|which?]]'']</sup>elected monarchies only pedigrees are taken into account for eligibility of the next ruler, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, etc. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] is subject to effective election. There have been cases where the term of a monarch's [[reign]] is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance.\n|-\n|[[Republic]]\n|A republic ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''[[res publica]]'') is a [[form of government]] in which the country is considered a \"public matter\", not the [[Res privata|private concern or property]] of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are not inherited, but are attained through elections expressing the [[consent of the governed]]. Such leadership positions are therefore expected to fairly represent the citizen body. It is a form of government under which the head of state is not a [[monarch]]. In American English, the definition of a republic can also refer specifically to a government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body, also known as a [[representative democracy]] (a [[democratic republic]]) and exercise power according to the [[rule of law]] (a [[Constitutionalism|constitutional]] republic).\n|}\n\n==== Types of monarchy ====\nCountries with [[monarchy]] attributes are those where a family or group of families (rarely another type of group), called the [[wikt:Special:Search/royalty|royalty]], represents national identity, with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals, called the monarch, who mostly rule kingdoms. The actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical ([[crowned republic]]) to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]) to completely despotic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally and in most cases, the post of the monarch is [[inheritance|inherited]], but there are also [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] where the monarch is elected.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n| [[Absolute monarchy]] || A traditional and historical system where the monarch exercises ultimate governing authority as [[head of state]] and [[head of government]].

Typically, laws cannot be passed which violate said constitution, unless the constitution itself is altered by law. This theoretically serves to protect minority groups from being subjected to the [[tyranny of the majority]], or [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]]. Examples include the [[United States]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], etc.\n|-\n| [[Democratic republic]] || Republics where the laws are ultimately decided by popular vote, whether by a body of elected representatives or directly by the public, and there is no restriction on which laws are passed so long as they have majority support. Constitutional law is either non-existent or poses little obstacle to legislation.\n|-\n| [[Federal republic]] || Republics that are a federation of states or provinces, where there is a national (federal) law encompassing the nation as a whole but where each state or province is free to legislate and enforce its own laws and affairs so long as they don't conflict with federal law. Examples include [[United States]], [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Brazil]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], and [[Switzerland]].\n|-\n| [[Islamic republic]] || Republics governed in accordance with Islamic law.

Under feudalism, all the land in a kingdom belonged to the king. However, the king would give some of the land to the lords or nobles who fought for him. These presents of land were called manors. Then the nobles gave some of their land to vassals. The vassals then had to do duties for the nobles. The lands of vassals were called fiefs.\nA similar system is the [[Iqta]], used by medieval [[Islamic]] societies of the middle east and north Africa. This functioned much like the feudal system but generally had titles that weren't granted to a family dynasty but to individuals at the behest of the sultan and generally only required a tax from the lower classes, instead of military service and/or manual labour like in the feudal system.\n|-\n|[[Minarchism]]\n|A variant of [[capitalism]] which advocates for the [[State (polity)|State]] to exist solely to provide a very small number of services. A popular model of the State proposed by minarchists is known as the [[night-watchman state]], in which the only governmental functions are to protect citizens from [[aggression]], [[theft]], [[breach of contract]], and [[fraud]] as defined by [[property law]]s, limiting it to three institutions: the [[military]], the [[police]], and [[courts]].\n|-\n|[[Monarchism]]\n|A system in which the government is headed by an agreed upon head of the [[nobility]] who is known as the [[monarch]], usually in the form of a [[king]] or [[emperor]] (but also less commonly a [[Queen regnant|queen]] or empress). In most monarchical systems the position of monarch is one [[Hereditary monarchy|inherited]] from a previous ruler by [[Heredity|bloodline]] or marriage, but in other cases it may be a position elected by the [[nobility]] themselves, as was the case in the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]] and the medieval [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n|-\n|[[Republicanism]]\n|A system in which the laws and governmental policies of the state are considered a \"public matter\" and decided by the citizens of the society, whoever they may be. Most modern nation-states are examples of republics, but other examples include those of ancient [[Roman Republic|Rome]] and [[Athenian democracy|Athens]].\n|-\n| [[Socialism]] || A system in which [[worker's self management|workers, democratically]] and/or [[social ownership|socially own]] the [[means of production]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Upton Sinclair's: A Monthly Magazine: for Social Justice, by Peaceful Means If Possible|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=i0w9AQAAMAAJ|date = 1918-01-01|last = Sinclair|first = Upton|authorlink= Upton Sinclair|quote = Socialism, you see, is a bird with two wings.

This is the same thing as a [[Federation|federal government]] which may have distinct powers at various levels authorized or delegated to it by its member states, though the adjective 'central' is sometimes used to describe it. The structure of central governments varies. Many countries have created autonomous regions by delegating powers from the central government to governments at a sub national level, such as a regional, state or local level. Based on a broad definition of a basic political system, there are two or more levels of government that exist within an established territory and govern through common institutions with overlapping or shared powers as prescribed by a [[constitution]] or other law.\n|-\n|[[City-state|City-State]]\n|A [[sovereign state]], also described as a type of small independent country, that usually consists of a single city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as [[Rome]], [[Athens]], [[Carthage]], and the [[Italian city-states]] during the [[Renaissance]]. Today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies currently to [[Singapore]], [[Monaco]], and [[Vatican City]]. City states are also sometimes called [[micro-state]]s which however also includes other configurations of very small countries.\n|-\n|[[Commune]]\n|From the [[Medieval Latin]] ''[[communia]].''

Notable examples include the [[United Nations]] (UN), [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), [[Council of Europe]] (COE), [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) and [[Interpol|International Police Organization]] (INTERPOL). The UN has used the term \"intergovernmental organization\" instead of \"international organization\" for clarity.\n|-\n|[[World government|World Government]]\n|The notion of a common [[political]] authority for all of humanity, yielding a global [[government]] and a single [[State (polity)|state]] that exercises [[authority]] over the entire [[Earth]].

The [[social welfare]] function carried out by the state is instead carried out by corporations in the form of benefits to employees. Although corporate republics do not exist officially in the modern world, they are often used in works of fiction or [[political criticism|political commentary]] as a warning of the perceived dangers of unbridled [[capitalism]]. In such works, they usually arise when a single, vastly powerful corporation deposes a weak government, over time or in a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]].\n\nSome political scientists have also considered [[state socialist]] nations to be forms of corporate republics, with the state assuming full control of all economic and political life and establishing a monopoly on everything within national boundaries \u2013 effectively making the state itself amount to a giant corporation.\n|-\n|[[Cyberocracy]] || Theoretical [[form of government]] that rules by the effective use of information\n|-|-\n|Magocracy || Rule by a government with the highest and main authority being either a [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]], sage, sorcerer, wizard, witch, or some other magic user.

After the [[Third Partition of Poland]] in 1795, it became a Kingdom under Habsburg rule. In 1804 it became a crownland of the [[Austrian Empire]]. From 1867 it was a [[Poles|Polish]]-administered autonomous crownland under [[Cisleithania|Cisleithanian]] [[Austria-Hungary]], until its dissolution in 1918. The country was carved from the entire south-western part of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Among the many ceremonial titles of the princes of Hungary was \"ruler of Galicia and Lodomeria\". Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Austrian Empire ceded portions of Galicia to the [[Russian Empire]], [[West Galicia]] and Tarnopol District.\n\nThe name \"Galicia\" is the Latinized form of [[Principality of Halych|Halych]], a principality of the medieval [[Ruthenia]]. \"[[Lodomeria]]\", is also a [[Latinized name|Latinized form]] of [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]] that was founded in the 10th century by [[Vladimir the Great]] and until the [[partitions of Poland]] was known simply as Volodymyr ({{lang-pl|W\u0142odzimierz}}). King of Galicia and Lodomeria was a medieval title which the King of Hungary ([[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]]) adopted during his conquest of the region in the 12th century.\n\nThis historical region in [[Eastern Europe]] is divided today between [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]]. The nucleus of historic [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] consists of the modern [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]], [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]], and [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Ivano-Frankivsk]] regions of [[western Ukraine]].\n\n==Ceremonial name==\nThe name of the Kingdom in its ceremonial form, in {{lang-en|Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and the Grand Duchy of Krak\u00f3w with the Duchies of Auschwitz and Zator}}, existed in all languages spoken there including {{lang-de|K\u00f6nigreich Galizien und Lodomerien mit dem Gro\u00dfherzogtum Krakau und den Herzogt\u00fcmern Auschwitz und Zator}}; {{lang-pl|Kr\u00f3lestwo Galicji i Lodomerii wraz z Wielkim Ksi\u0119stwem Krakowskim i Ksi\u0119stwem O\u015bwi\u0119cimia i Zatoru}}; {{lang-uk|\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0442\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0456\u0457 \u0437 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u041a\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0456 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u0456\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u041e\u0441\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0456 \u0417\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443}}, transliterated: ''Korolivstvo Halychyny i Lodomeri\u00ef z velykym knyazivstvom Krakivskym i knyazivstvamy Osventsyma i Zatoru'', and {{lang-hu|Gal\u00edcia \u00e9s Lodom\u00e9ria kir\u00e1lys\u00e1ga Krakk\u00f3 nagyhercegs\u00e9g\u00e9vel \u00e9s Auschwitz \u00e9s Zator hercegs\u00e9ggel}}.\n\n===Other names===\n* Galician Ruthenia ({{lang-ru|\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c}}, Galitskaya Rus),<ref>Grot, K.

As such, the [[Austria]]n region of [[Poland]] and what was later to become [[Ukraine]] was known as the Kingdom of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Lodomeria]] to underline the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] claims to the country. However, after the [[Third Partition of Poland]], a large portion of the ethnically Polish lands to the west ([[West Galicia|New or West Galicia]]) was also added to the province, which changed the geographical reference of the term ''Galicia''. Lviv ([[Lemberg]]) served as capital of Austrian Galicia, which was dominated by the Polish aristocracy, despite the fact that the population of the eastern half of the province was mostly [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], or \"[[Ruthenia]]n\", as they were known at the time. In addition to the Polish aristocracy and gentry who inhabited almost all parts of Galicia, and the Ruthenians in the east, there existed a large Jewish population, also more heavily concentrated in the eastern parts of the province.\n\nDuring the first decades of Austrian rule, Galicia was firmly governed from [[Vienna]], and many significant reforms were carried out by a bureaucracy staffed largely by Germans and Czechs. The aristocracy was guaranteed its rights, but these rights were considerably circumscribed. The former serfs were no longer mere chattel, but became subjects of law and were granted certain personal freedoms, such as the right to marry without the lord's permission. Their labour obligations were defined and limited, and they could bypass the lords and appeal to the imperial courts for justice. The Eastern Rite \"Uniate\" Church, which primarily served the Ruthenians, was renamed the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic Church]] to bring it onto a par with the Roman Catholic Church; it was given seminaries, and eventually, a Metropolitan. Although unpopular with the aristocracy, among the common folk, Polish and Ukrainian/Ruthenian alike, these reforms created a reservoir of good will toward the emperor which lasted almost to the end of Austrian rule. At the same time, however, the Austrian Empire extracted from Galicia considerable wealth{{Citation needed|reason=Significant transfer payments(less taxes raised compared to expendature) in the Kingdom. -Page 160.

The large city of [[Krak\u00f3w]] and surrounding territory, formerly also part of New or West Galicia, became the semi-autonomous [[Free City of Krak\u00f3w]] unter supervision of the three powers sharing rule over Poland (i. e., Austria, Russia and Prussia).\n[[File:Map of the Kingdom of Galicia, 1914.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Physical map of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, 1849\u20131918]]\n\nThe 1820s and 1830s were a period of bureaucratic rule overseen from Vienna. Most administrative positions were filled by German-speakers, including German-speaking Czechs, although some of their children were already becoming Polonized. After the failure of the November insurrection in Russian Poland in 1830\u201331, in which a few thousand Galician volunteers participated, many Polish refugees arrived in Galicia. The latter 1830s were rife with Polish conspiratorial organizations whose work culminated in the [[Krak\u00f3w Uprising|unsuccessful Galician insurrection of 1846]], which was easily put down by the Austrians with the help of a Galician peasantry that remained loyal to the emperor. The insurrection occurred in the western, Polish-populated part of Galicia. Polish manorial gentry supported or were sympathetic to barely concealed plans for an [[Greater Poland Uprising (1846)|uprising to establish an independent Polish state]], but peasants on the manorial estates of western Galicia, reduced to misery by poor harvests, saw little advantage for themselves in a free Poland and seized the opportunity to rise against the institution of [[serfdom]], [[Galician slaughter|killing many of the estate owners]]. With the collapse of the uprising for a free Poland, the city of [[Krak\u00f3w]] lost its semi-autonomy and was integrated into the Austrian Empire under the title of a Grand Duchy, and for practical purposes was made part of Galicia by the Austrian authorities.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = H.M.

A circle of activists, primarily Greek Catholic seminarians, affected by the romantic movement in Europe and the example of fellow Slavs elsewhere, especially in eastern Ukraine under the Russians, began to turn their attention to the common folk and their language. In 1837, the so-called Ruthenian Triad led by [[Markiian Shashkevych]], published ''The Nymph of the Dniester'', a collection of folksongs and other materials in the common Ruthenian tongue. Alarmed by such democratism, the Austrian authorities and the Greek Catholic Metropolitan banned the book.\n\nIn 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutionary actions broke out in Vienna and other parts of the Austrian Empire]]. In Lemberg, a Polish National Council, and then later, a Ukrainian, or Ruthenian Supreme Council were formed. Even before Vienna had acted, the remnants of serfdom were abolished by the Governor, Franz Stadion, in an attempt to thwart the revolutionaries. Moreover, Polish demands for Galician automomy were countered by Ruthenian demands for national equality and for a partition of the province into an Eastern, Ruthenian part, and a Western, Polish part. Eventually, Lemberg was bombarded by imperial troops and the revolution put down completely.\n\nA decade of renewed absolutism followed, but to placate the Poles, Count [[Agenor Go\u0142uchowski (father)|Agenor Goluchowski]], a conservative representative of the eastern Galician aristocracy, the so-called Podolians, was appointed Viceroy. He began to Polonize the local administration and managed to have Ruthenian ideas of partitioning the province shelved. He was unsuccessful, however, in forcing the Greek Catholic Church to shift to the use of the western or Gregorian calendar, or among Ruthenians generally, to replace the Cyrillic alphabet with the Latin alphabet.\n\n===Constitutional experiments===\n{{See also|Diet of Galicia}}\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|250px|[[Galician slaughter]] (''Polish'' \"Rze\u017a galicyjska\") by [[Jan Lewicki]] (1795\u20131871)]]\n\nIn 1859, following Austro-Hungarian military defeat in Italy, the Empire entered a period of constitutional experiments. In 1860, the [[Vienna]] Government, influenced by [[Agenor Go\u0142uchowski (father)|Agenor Goluchowski]], issued its October Diploma, which envisioned a conservative federalization of the empire, but a negative reaction in the German-speaking lands led to changes in government and the issuing of the February Patent which watered down this de-centralization. Nevertheless, by 1861, Galicia was granted a Legislative Assembly or ''[[Galicia Diet]]''. Although at first pro-Habsburg Ukrainian and Polish peasant representation was considerable in this body (about half the assembly), and the pressing social and Ukrainian questions were discussed, administrative pressures limited the effectiveness of both peasant and Ukrainian representatives and the ''[[Diet of Galicia]]'' (Polish ''Sejm'') became dominated by the Polish aristocracy and gentry, who favoured further [[autonomous entity|autonomy]]. This same year, disturbances broke out in Russian Poland and to some extent spilled over into Galicia. The Sejm ceased to sit.\n\nBy 1863, open revolt broke out in Russian Poland and from 1864 to 1865 the Austro-Hungarian government declared a State of Siege in Galicia, temporarily suspending civil liberties.\n\nThe year 1865 brought a return to federal ideas along the lines suggested by [[Agenor Go\u0142uchowski (father)|Agenor Goluchowski]] and negotiations on autonomy between the Polish aristocracy and Vienna began once again.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Ruthenians]] felt more and more abandoned by Vienna and among the \"Old Ruthenians\" grouped around the Greek Catholic Cathedral of Saint George, there occurred a turn towards Russia. The more extreme supporters of this orientation came to be known as \"[[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophiles]]\". At the same time, influenced by the [[Ukrainian language]] poetry of the eastern Ukrainian writer, [[Taras Shevchenko]], a Ukrainophile movement arose which published literature in the Ukrainian/Ruthenian vernacular and eventually established a network of reading halls. Supporters of this orientation came to be known as \"Populists\", and later, simply as \"Ukrainians\". Almost all [[Ruthenians]], however, still hoped for national equality and for an administrative division of Galicia along ethnic lines.\n\n===Galician autonomy===\n[[File:Sejm Galicyjski.jpg|thumb|260px|The Galician Sejm (parliament) in Lemberg (modern Lviv)]]\n\nIn 1866, following the [[Battle of Sadova]] and the Austrian defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]], the Austro-Hungarian empire began to experience increased internal problems. In an effort to shore up support for the monarchy, Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] began negotiations for a compromise with the [[Magyars|Magyar]] nobility to ensure their support. Some members of the government, such as the Austro-Hungarian prime minister [[Richard von Belcredi|Count Belcredi]], advised the Emperor to make a more comprehensive constitutional deal with all of the nationalities that would have created a federal structure. Belcredi worried that an accommodation with the Magyar interests would alienate the other nationalities. However, Franz Joseph was unable to ignore the power of the Magyar nobility, and they would not accept anything less than dualism between themselves and the traditional Austrian \u00e9lites.\n\nFinally, after the so-called [[Ausgleich]] of February 1867, the Austrian Empire was reformed into a dualist [[Austria-Hungary]]. Although the Polish and Czech plans for their parts of the monarchy to be included in the federal structure failed, a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. Representatives of the Polish aristocracy and [[intelligentsia]] addressed the Emperor asking for greater autonomy for Galicia. Their demands were not accepted outright, but over the course of the next several years a number of significant concessions were made toward the establishment of Galician autonomy.\n\nFrom 1873, Galicia was ''de facto'' an autonomous province of [[Austria-Hungary]] with [[Polish language|Polish]] and, to a much lesser degree, Ukrainian or [[Ruthenia]]n, as official languages. The [[Germanisation]] had been halted and the [[censorship]] lifted as well. Galicia was subject to the [[Cisleithania|Austrian part]] of the Dual Monarchy, but the [[Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galician Sejm]] and provincial administration had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs.\n\nThese changes were supported by many Polish intellectuals. In 1869 a group of young conservative publicists in Krak\u00f3w, including [[J\u00f3zef Szujski]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Tarnowski]], [[Stanislaw Kozmian|Stanis\u0142aw Ko\u017amian]] and [[Ludwik Wodzicki]], published a series of satirical pamphlets entitled ''Teka Sta\u0144czyka'' (''[[Sta\u0144czyk|Sta\u0144czyk's]] Portfolio''). Only five years after the tragic end of the [[January Uprising]], the pamphlets ridiculed the idea of armed [[List of Polish uprisings|national uprisings]] and suggested compromise with Poland's enemies, especially the [[Austrian Empire]], concentration on economic growth, and acceptance of the [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] offered by Vienna. This political grouping came to be known as the Stanczyks or Krak\u00f3w Conservatives. Together with the eastern Galician conservative Polish landowners and aristocracy called the \"Podolians\", they gained a political ascendency in Galicia which lasted to 1914. This shift in power from [[Vienna]] to the Polish landowning class was not welcomed by the Ruthenians, who became more sharply divided into [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophiles]], who looked to Russia for salvation, and [[Ukrainians]] who stressed their connections to the common people.\n\nBoth [[Vienna]] and the Poles saw treason among the Russophiles and a series of political trials eventually discredited them. Meanwhile, by 1890, an agreement was worked out between the Poles and the \"Populist\" Ruthenians or [[Ukrainians]] which saw the partial Ukrainianization of the school system in eastern Galicia and other concessions to Ukrainian culture. Thereafter, the Ukrainian national movement spread rapidly among the Ruthenian peasantry and, despite repeated setbacks, by the early years of the twentieth century this movement had almost completely replaced other Ruthenian groups as the main rival for power with the Poles. Throughout this period, the Ukrainians never gave up the traditional Ruthenian demands for national equality and for partition of the province into a western, Polish half, and an eastern, Ukrainian half.\n\n{{Polish statehood}}\n{{Ukrainian statehood}}\n\n===The Great Economic Emigration===\nBeginning in the 1880s, a mass [[emigration]] of the Galician peasantry occurred. The emigration started as a seasonal one to Germany (newly unified and economically dynamic) and then later became a Trans-Atlantic one with large-scale emigration to the [[United States]], [[Brazil]], and [[Canada]].\n\nCaused by the [[Poverty in Austrian Galicia|backward economic condition of Galicia]] where rural poverty was widespread, the emigration began in the western, Polish populated part of Galicia and quickly shifted east to the Ukrainian inhabited parts. Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, and Germans all participated in this mass movement of countryfolk and villagers. Poles migrated principally to New England and the midwestern states of the United States, but also to Brazil and elsewhere; Ruthenians/Ukrainians migrated to Brazil, Canada, and the United States, with a very intense emigration from Western [[Podolia]] to Western [[Canada]]; and Jews emigrated both directly to the New World and also indirectly via other parts of Austria-Hungary.\n\nA total of several hundred thousand people were involved in this Great Economic Emigration which grew steadily more intense until the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914. The war put a temporary halt to the emigration which never again reached the same proportions.\n\nThe Great Economic Emigration, especially the emigration to Brazil, the \"Brazilian Fever\" as it was called at the time, was described in contemporary literary works by the Polish poet [[Maria Konopnicka]], the Ukrainian writer [[Ivan Franko]], and many others. Some states in [[South Region, Brazil|south of Brazil]] have a large percentage of their population formed by direct descendants of these Ruthenians/Ukrainians immigrants.\n\nWhen it comes to the social relations, most especially between peasants and landlords, the area was the most backwards in the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. When the lot of the peasants under the [[Prussian partition]] was made better by laws and in the [[Russian partition]] by the majority of the Polish landlords de facto abolishing serfdom in exchange for the peasants sending their children to free-of-charge (secret with respect to the Polish language) schools training them to be Poles and nobility adopted all free peasants to prevent the steady rising in power and influence, Russian-Jewish merchant households from forcing them into serfdom, the Galician peasantry was always living at the verge of starvation. This led the Polish peasants to call the area \"Krolestwo Goloty i Glodomerji\" i.e. \"The Kingdom of Bareness and Starvation\". Since country to the Russian Tsar Alexander II, whom had officially banned serfdom and liberated the serfs in the empire by the 1870s and enacted legislation to protect the serfs, the possibility remained and was the case within Galicia that the serfs and monied city denizens could be coerced or forced through predatory practices back into serfdom by the affluent merchant class and local nobility, which remained the case for many years until the start of World War I.\n\nAt the same time as these emigrations in the 1890s, many Polish and Ukrainian liberals saw Galicia as a Galician Piedmont, both a Polish Piedmont and a Ukrainian Piedmont. Because Italians had started their liberation from Austrian rule in the Italian Piedmont, these Ukrainian and Polish nationalists felt that the liberation of their two countries would begin in Galicia.\n\nDespite nearly 750,000 persons emigrating across the Atlantic from 1880 to 1914, Galicia's population increased by 45% between 1869 and 1910.<ref name=AustriaOil>{{cite web|last=Frank |first=Allison |title=Galician California, Galician Hell: The Peril and Promise of Oil Production in Austria-Hungary |url=http://ostaustria.org/bridges-magazine/volume-10-june-29-2006/item/1172-galician-california-galician-hell-the-peril-and-promise-of-oil-production-in-austria-hungary |publisher=Office of Science and Technology Austria (OSTA) |location=Washington, D.C. |date=June 29, 2006 |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509183618/http://ostaustria.org/bridges-magazine/volume-10-june-29-2006/item/1172-galician-california-galician-hell-the-peril-and-promise-of-oil-production-in-austria-hungary |archivedate=May 9, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===First World War and Polish-Ukrainian conflict===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]] Galicia saw heavy fighting between the forces of Russia and the [[Central Powers]]. The Russian forces overran most of the region in 1914 after defeating the Austro-Hungarian army in a chaotic frontier [[Eastern Front (WWI)|battle]] in the opening months of the war. They were in turn pushed out in the spring and summer of 1915 by a [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive|combined German and Austro-Hungarian offensive]].\n\n[[File:Szturm Twierdzy Przemysl A. Ritter von Meissl.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The [[Siege of Przemy\u015bl]] in 1915]]\n\nIn 1918, Western Galicia became a part of the restored [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]], which absorbed the [[Lemko Republic|Lemko-Rusyn Republic]]. The local Ukrainian population briefly declared the independence of Eastern Galicia as the \"[[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]\". During the [[Polish-Soviet War]] the Soviets tried to establish the [[puppet-state]] of the [[Galician SSR]] in East Galicia, the government of which after couple of months was liquidated.\n\nThe fate of Galicia was settled by the [[Peace of Riga]] on March 18, 1921, attributing Galicia to the [[Second Polish Republic]]. Although never accepted as legitimate by some Ukrainians, it was internationally recognized with significant French support on May 15, 1923.<ref>French: ''Les Alli\u00e9s reconnaissent \u00e0 la Pologne la possession de la Galicie'', Chronologie des civilisations, Jean Delorme, Paris, 1956.</ref> The French support for Polish rule of ethnically Ukrainian eastern Galicia and its oil resources in the Borys\u0142aw-Drohobycz basin were rewarded by Warsaw allowing significant French investment to pour into the Polish oil industry.<ref name=AustriaOil/> The Poles had convinced the French that since less than 25% of the ethnic Ukrainians were literate before the Great War and Ukrainians were novices in governing themselves, only the Poles, not the Ukrainians, would be able to administer eastern Galicia and its precious oil assets.<ref name=AustriaOil/>\n\nThe Ukrainians of the former eastern Galicia and the neighbouring province of [[Volhynia]] made up about 12% of the population of the [[Second Polish Republic]], and were its largest minority. As Polish government policies were unfriendly towards minorities, tensions between the Polish government and the Ukrainian population grew, eventually giving the rise to the militant underground [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{Main article|Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria}}\nSoon the newly acquired Polish territories (see [[First Partition of Poland]]) which were known as Kreise (Voivodeship in Poland) were restructured in November 1773 into 59 Kreisdistriktes (Land districts), while kreises were abolished. Some former voivodeships were incorporated completely, while most of them only partially. Among them were the former voivodeships of Belz, Red-Ruthenian, Cracow, Lublin, Sandomierz, and Podolie. Also during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u201374)|Russo-Turkish War]] in 1769, the northwestern territory of [[Moldavia]] (renamed [[Bukovina]]) was occupied by the [[Russian Empire]] which [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca|ceded]] it in 1774 to the [[Austrian Empire]] as a \"token of appreciation\".\n\n===Major cities and towns===\n====Administrative division====\nThe Kingdom was split into numerous counties (powiat) which in 1914 were about 75.<ref>[http://www.ukrstor.com/ukrstor/galicia540_30.jpg Map of the Kingdom with its county division (Lenius, Brian. \"Genealogical Gazetteer of Galicia\" 2nd ed.

A small number were full farmers, but by far the overwhelming number (84%) had only smallholdings or no possessions.\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0442\u044f 1.jpg|thumb|People of East Galicia]]\n[[File:Zarubezhnaia Rus.jpg|thumb|Map of a region where Ruthenians lived in the [[Austrian Empire]] \u2013 Galicia and Hungarian Rus' ([[Carpathian Ruthenia]]) \u2013 by [[Dmitry Vergun]]]]\n\nNo country of the Austrian monarchy had such a varied ethnic mix as Galicia: [[Poles]], [[Ruthenians]], [[Germans]] ([[Galician Germans]]), [[Armenia]]ns, [[Galician Jews|Jews]], [[Hungarians]], [[Romani people]], [[Lipovans|Lipowaner]], etc. The Poles were mainly in the west, with the Ruthenians (Ukrainians) predominant in the eastern region (\"Ruthenia\"). \n\nThe Jews of Galicia had immigrated in the Middle Ages from Germany and mostly spoke [[Yiddish]] as their first language. German-speaking people were more commonly referred to as \"Saxons\" or \"Swabians\", even though most of them did not come from [[Saxony]] or [[Swabia]] (cf. [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and [[Danube Swabians]]). There were also some [[Mennonite]]s who mostly came originally from [[Switzerland]], but spoke a dialect of [[Palatine German language|Palatine German]] which is close to [[Pennsylvania German]].\n\nWith inhabitants who had a clear difference in language such as with the Saxons or the Roma identification was less problematic, but widespread multilingualness blurred the borders again. \n\nIt is however possible to make a clear distinction in religious denominations: the majority of the Poles were [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin Catholics]], while the Ruthenians were mostly [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholics]]. The Jews, who represented the third largest religious group, were mostly traditional in their religious observance which later developed into [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\nThe average life expectancy was 27 years for men and 28.5 years for women, as compared to 33 and 37 in [[Bohemia]], 39 and 41 in [[France]] and 40 and 42 in [[England]]. Also the quality of life was much lower.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} The yearly consumption of meat did not exceed {{convert|10|kg|0|abbr=on}} per capita, as compared to {{convert|24|kg|0|abbr=on}} in Hungary and 33 in Germany.

Its level of development was comparable to or higher than that of Russia and the Balkans, but well behind Western Europe.\n\nThe first detailed description of the economic situation of the region was prepared by Stanislaw Szczepanowski (1846\u20131900), a Polish lawyer, economist and chemist who in 1873 published the first version of his report titled ''N\u0119dza galicyjska w cyfrach'' (''The Galician Poverty in Numbers''). Based on his own experience as a worker in the [[India Office]], as well as his work on development of the oil industry in the region of [[Borys\u0142aw, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship|Borys\u0142aw]] and the official census data published by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] government, he described Galicia as one of the poorest regions in Europe.\n\nStatistics indicate the Galicia and Lodomeria was poorer than areas west of it. The average income per capita did not exceed 53 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|Rhine guilders]] (RG), as compared to 91 RG in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], 100 in Hungary and more than 450 RG in England at that time. Also the taxes were relatively high and equalled to 9 Rhine guilders a year (c. 17% of yearly income), as compared to 5% in Prussia and 10% in England. Also the percentage of people with higher income was much lower than in other parts of the Monarchy and Europe: the luxury tax, paid by people whose yearly income exceeded 600 RG, was paid by 8 people in every 1,000 inhabitants, as compared to 28 in Bohemia and 99 in [[Lower Austria]]. Despite high taxation, the national debt of the Galician government exceeded 300 million RG at all times, that is approximately 60 RG per capita.\n\nAll in all, the region was used by the Austro-Hungarian government mostly as a reservoir of cheap workforce and recruits for the army,{{citation needed|date=August 2007}} as well as a buffer zone against Russia. It was not until early in the 20th century that heavy industry started to be developed, which would be comparable to much of Russia and the Balkans. Even then it was mostly connected to war production. The biggest state investments in the region were the railways and the fortresses in [[Przemy\u015bl, Poland|Przemy\u015bl]], Krak\u00f3w and other cities.

Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Austrian Empire ceded portions of Galicia to the [[Russian Empire]], [[West Galicia]] and Tarnopol District.\n\nThe name \"Galicia\" is the Latinized form of [[Principality of Halych|Halych]], a principality of the medieval [[Ruthenia]]. \"[[Lodomeria]]\", is also a [[Latinized name|Latinized form]] of [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]] that was founded in the 10th century by [[Vladimir the Great]] and until the [[partitions of Poland]] was known simply as Volodymyr ({{lang-pl|W\u0142odzimierz}}). King of Galicia and Lodomeria was a medieval title which the King of Hungary ([[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]]) adopted during his conquest of the region in the 12th century.\n\nThis historical region in [[Eastern Europe]] is divided today between [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]].

As such, the [[Austria]]n region of [[Poland]] and what was later to become [[Ukraine]] was known as the Kingdom of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Lodomeria]] to underline the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] claims to the country. However, after the [[Third Partition of Poland]], a large portion of the ethnically Polish lands to the west ([[West Galicia|New or West Galicia]]) was also added to the province, which changed the geographical reference of the term ''Galicia''. Lviv ([[Lemberg]]) served as capital of Austrian Galicia, which was dominated by the Polish aristocracy, despite the fact that the population of the eastern half of the province was mostly [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], or \"[[Ruthenia]]n\", as they were known at the time. In addition to the Polish aristocracy and gentry who inhabited almost all parts of Galicia, and the Ruthenians in the east, there existed a large Jewish population, also more heavily concentrated in the eastern parts of the province.\n\nDuring the first decades of Austrian rule, Galicia was firmly governed from [[Vienna]], and many significant reforms were carried out by a bureaucracy staffed largely by Germans and Czechs. The aristocracy was guaranteed its rights, but these rights were considerably circumscribed. The former serfs were no longer mere chattel, but became subjects of law and were granted certain personal freedoms, such as the right to marry without the lord's permission. Their labour obligations were defined and limited, and they could bypass the lords and appeal to the imperial courts for justice. The Eastern Rite \"Uniate\" Church, which primarily served the Ruthenians, was renamed the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic Church]] to bring it onto a par with the Roman Catholic Church; it was given seminaries, and eventually, a Metropolitan. Although unpopular with the aristocracy, among the common folk, Polish and Ukrainian/Ruthenian alike, these reforms created a reservoir of good will toward the emperor which lasted almost to the end of Austrian rule. At the same time, however, the Austrian Empire extracted from Galicia considerable wealth{{Citation needed|reason=Significant transfer payments(less taxes raised compared to expendature) in the Kingdom. -Page 160.

The large city of [[Krak\u00f3w]] and surrounding territory, formerly also part of New or West Galicia, became the semi-autonomous [[Free City of Krak\u00f3w]] unter supervision of the three powers sharing rule over Poland (i. e., Austria, Russia and Prussia).\n[[File:Map of the Kingdom of Galicia, 1914.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Physical map of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, 1849\u20131918]]\n\nThe 1820s and 1830s were a period of bureaucratic rule overseen from Vienna. Most administrative positions were filled by German-speakers, including German-speaking Czechs, although some of their children were already becoming Polonized. After the failure of the November insurrection in Russian Poland in 1830\u201331, in which a few thousand Galician volunteers participated, many Polish refugees arrived in Galicia. The latter 1830s were rife with Polish conspiratorial organizations whose work culminated in the [[Krak\u00f3w Uprising|unsuccessful Galician insurrection of 1846]], which was easily put down by the Austrians with the help of a Galician peasantry that remained loyal to the emperor. The insurrection occurred in the western, Polish-populated part of Galicia. Polish manorial gentry supported or were sympathetic to barely concealed plans for an [[Greater Poland Uprising (1846)|uprising to establish an independent Polish state]], but peasants on the manorial estates of western Galicia, reduced to misery by poor harvests, saw little advantage for themselves in a free Poland and seized the opportunity to rise against the institution of [[serfdom]], [[Galician slaughter|killing many of the estate owners]]. With the collapse of the uprising for a free Poland, the city of [[Krak\u00f3w]] lost its semi-autonomy and was integrated into the Austrian Empire under the title of a Grand Duchy, and for practical purposes was made part of Galicia by the Austrian authorities.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = H.M.

A circle of activists, primarily Greek Catholic seminarians, affected by the romantic movement in Europe and the example of fellow Slavs elsewhere, especially in eastern Ukraine under the Russians, began to turn their attention to the common folk and their language. In 1837, the so-called Ruthenian Triad led by [[Markiian Shashkevych]], published ''The Nymph of the Dniester'', a collection of folksongs and other materials in the common Ruthenian tongue. Alarmed by such democratism, the Austrian authorities and the Greek Catholic Metropolitan banned the book.\n\nIn 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutionary actions broke out in Vienna and other parts of the Austrian Empire]]. In Lemberg, a Polish National Council, and then later, a Ukrainian, or Ruthenian Supreme Council were formed. Even before Vienna had acted, the remnants of serfdom were abolished by the Governor, Franz Stadion, in an attempt to thwart the revolutionaries. Moreover, Polish demands for Galician automomy were countered by Ruthenian demands for national equality and for a partition of the province into an Eastern, Ruthenian part, and a Western, Polish part. Eventually, Lemberg was bombarded by imperial troops and the revolution put down completely.\n\nA decade of renewed absolutism followed, but to placate the Poles, Count [[Agenor Go\u0142uchowski (father)|Agenor Goluchowski]], a conservative representative of the eastern Galician aristocracy, the so-called Podolians, was appointed Viceroy. He began to Polonize the local administration and managed to have Ruthenian ideas of partitioning the province shelved. He was unsuccessful, however, in forcing the Greek Catholic Church to shift to the use of the western or Gregorian calendar, or among Ruthenians generally, to replace the Cyrillic alphabet with the Latin alphabet.\n\n===Constitutional experiments===\n{{See also|Diet of Galicia}}\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|250px|[[Galician slaughter]] (''Polish'' \"Rze\u017a galicyjska\") by [[Jan Lewicki]] (1795\u20131871)]]\n\nIn 1859, following Austro-Hungarian military defeat in Italy, the Empire entered a period of constitutional experiments. In 1860, the [[Vienna]] Government, influenced by [[Agenor Go\u0142uchowski (father)|Agenor Goluchowski]], issued its October Diploma, which envisioned a conservative federalization of the empire, but a negative reaction in the German-speaking lands led to changes in government and the issuing of the February Patent which watered down this de-centralization. Nevertheless, by 1861, Galicia was granted a Legislative Assembly or ''[[Galicia Diet]]''. Although at first pro-Habsburg Ukrainian and Polish peasant representation was considerable in this body (about half the assembly), and the pressing social and Ukrainian questions were discussed, administrative pressures limited the effectiveness of both peasant and Ukrainian representatives and the ''[[Diet of Galicia]]'' (Polish ''Sejm'') became dominated by the Polish aristocracy and gentry, who favoured further [[autonomous entity|autonomy]]. This same year, disturbances broke out in Russian Poland and to some extent spilled over into Galicia. The Sejm ceased to sit.\n\nBy 1863, open revolt broke out in Russian Poland and from 1864 to 1865 the Austro-Hungarian government declared a State of Siege in Galicia, temporarily suspending civil liberties.\n\nThe year 1865 brought a return to federal ideas along the lines suggested by [[Agenor Go\u0142uchowski (father)|Agenor Goluchowski]] and negotiations on autonomy between the Polish aristocracy and Vienna began once again.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Ruthenians]] felt more and more abandoned by Vienna and among the \"Old Ruthenians\" grouped around the Greek Catholic Cathedral of Saint George, there occurred a turn towards Russia. The more extreme supporters of this orientation came to be known as \"[[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophiles]]\". At the same time, influenced by the [[Ukrainian language]] poetry of the eastern Ukrainian writer, [[Taras Shevchenko]], a Ukrainophile movement arose which published literature in the Ukrainian/Ruthenian vernacular and eventually established a network of reading halls. Supporters of this orientation came to be known as \"Populists\", and later, simply as \"Ukrainians\". Almost all [[Ruthenians]], however, still hoped for national equality and for an administrative division of Galicia along ethnic lines.\n\n===Galician autonomy===\n[[File:Sejm Galicyjski.jpg|thumb|260px|The Galician Sejm (parliament) in Lemberg (modern Lviv)]]\n\nIn 1866, following the [[Battle of Sadova]] and the Austrian defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]], the Austro-Hungarian empire began to experience increased internal problems. In an effort to shore up support for the monarchy, Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] began negotiations for a compromise with the [[Magyars|Magyar]] nobility to ensure their support. Some members of the government, such as the Austro-Hungarian prime minister [[Richard von Belcredi|Count Belcredi]], advised the Emperor to make a more comprehensive constitutional deal with all of the nationalities that would have created a federal structure. Belcredi worried that an accommodation with the Magyar interests would alienate the other nationalities. However, Franz Joseph was unable to ignore the power of the Magyar nobility, and they would not accept anything less than dualism between themselves and the traditional Austrian \u00e9lites.\n\nFinally, after the so-called [[Ausgleich]] of February 1867, the Austrian Empire was reformed into a dualist [[Austria-Hungary]]. Although the Polish and Czech plans for their parts of the monarchy to be included in the federal structure failed, a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. Representatives of the Polish aristocracy and [[intelligentsia]] addressed the Emperor asking for greater autonomy for Galicia. Their demands were not accepted outright, but over the course of the next several years a number of significant concessions were made toward the establishment of Galician autonomy.\n\nFrom 1873, Galicia was ''de facto'' an autonomous province of [[Austria-Hungary]] with [[Polish language|Polish]] and, to a much lesser degree, Ukrainian or [[Ruthenia]]n, as official languages. The [[Germanisation]] had been halted and the [[censorship]] lifted as well. Galicia was subject to the [[Cisleithania|Austrian part]] of the Dual Monarchy, but the [[Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galician Sejm]] and provincial administration had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs.\n\nThese changes were supported by many Polish intellectuals. In 1869 a group of young conservative publicists in Krak\u00f3w, including [[J\u00f3zef Szujski]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Tarnowski]], [[Stanislaw Kozmian|Stanis\u0142aw Ko\u017amian]] and [[Ludwik Wodzicki]], published a series of satirical pamphlets entitled ''Teka Sta\u0144czyka'' (''[[Sta\u0144czyk|Sta\u0144czyk's]] Portfolio''). Only five years after the tragic end of the [[January Uprising]], the pamphlets ridiculed the idea of armed [[List of Polish uprisings|national uprisings]] and suggested compromise with Poland's enemies, especially the [[Austrian Empire]], concentration on economic growth, and acceptance of the [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] offered by Vienna. This political grouping came to be known as the Stanczyks or Krak\u00f3w Conservatives. Together with the eastern Galician conservative Polish landowners and aristocracy called the \"Podolians\", they gained a political ascendency in Galicia which lasted to 1914. This shift in power from [[Vienna]] to the Polish landowning class was not welcomed by the Ruthenians, who became more sharply divided into [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophiles]], who looked to Russia for salvation, and [[Ukrainians]] who stressed their connections to the common people.\n\nBoth [[Vienna]] and the Poles saw treason among the Russophiles and a series of political trials eventually discredited them. Meanwhile, by 1890, an agreement was worked out between the Poles and the \"Populist\" Ruthenians or [[Ukrainians]] which saw the partial Ukrainianization of the school system in eastern Galicia and other concessions to Ukrainian culture. Thereafter, the Ukrainian national movement spread rapidly among the Ruthenian peasantry and, despite repeated setbacks, by the early years of the twentieth century this movement had almost completely replaced other Ruthenian groups as the main rival for power with the Poles. Throughout this period, the Ukrainians never gave up the traditional Ruthenian demands for national equality and for partition of the province into a western, Polish half, and an eastern, Ukrainian half.\n\n{{Polish statehood}}\n{{Ukrainian statehood}}\n\n===The Great Economic Emigration===\nBeginning in the 1880s, a mass [[emigration]] of the Galician peasantry occurred. The emigration started as a seasonal one to Germany (newly unified and economically dynamic) and then later became a Trans-Atlantic one with large-scale emigration to the [[United States]], [[Brazil]], and [[Canada]].\n\nCaused by the [[Poverty in Austrian Galicia|backward economic condition of Galicia]] where rural poverty was widespread, the emigration began in the western, Polish populated part of Galicia and quickly shifted east to the Ukrainian inhabited parts. Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, and Germans all participated in this mass movement of countryfolk and villagers. Poles migrated principally to New England and the midwestern states of the United States, but also to Brazil and elsewhere; Ruthenians/Ukrainians migrated to Brazil, Canada, and the United States, with a very intense emigration from Western [[Podolia]] to Western [[Canada]]; and Jews emigrated both directly to the New World and also indirectly via other parts of Austria-Hungary.\n\nA total of several hundred thousand people were involved in this Great Economic Emigration which grew steadily more intense until the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914. The war put a temporary halt to the emigration which never again reached the same proportions.\n\nThe Great Economic Emigration, especially the emigration to Brazil, the \"Brazilian Fever\" as it was called at the time, was described in contemporary literary works by the Polish poet [[Maria Konopnicka]], the Ukrainian writer [[Ivan Franko]], and many others. Some states in [[South Region, Brazil|south of Brazil]] have a large percentage of their population formed by direct descendants of these Ruthenians/Ukrainians immigrants.\n\nWhen it comes to the social relations, most especially between peasants and landlords, the area was the most backwards in the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. When the lot of the peasants under the [[Prussian partition]] was made better by laws and in the [[Russian partition]] by the majority of the Polish landlords de facto abolishing serfdom in exchange for the peasants sending their children to free-of-charge (secret with respect to the Polish language) schools training them to be Poles and nobility adopted all free peasants to prevent the steady rising in power and influence, Russian-Jewish merchant households from forcing them into serfdom, the Galician peasantry was always living at the verge of starvation. This led the Polish peasants to call the area \"Krolestwo Goloty i Glodomerji\" i.e. \"The Kingdom of Bareness and Starvation\". Since country to the Russian Tsar Alexander II, whom had officially banned serfdom and liberated the serfs in the empire by the 1870s and enacted legislation to protect the serfs, the possibility remained and was the case within Galicia that the serfs and monied city denizens could be coerced or forced through predatory practices back into serfdom by the affluent merchant class and local nobility, which remained the case for many years until the start of World War I.\n\nAt the same time as these emigrations in the 1890s, many Polish and Ukrainian liberals saw Galicia as a Galician Piedmont, both a Polish Piedmont and a Ukrainian Piedmont. Because Italians had started their liberation from Austrian rule in the Italian Piedmont, these Ukrainian and Polish nationalists felt that the liberation of their two countries would begin in Galicia.\n\nDespite nearly 750,000 persons emigrating across the Atlantic from 1880 to 1914, Galicia's population increased by 45% between 1869 and 1910.<ref name=AustriaOil>{{cite web|last=Frank |first=Allison |title=Galician California, Galician Hell: The Peril and Promise of Oil Production in Austria-Hungary |url=http://ostaustria.org/bridges-magazine/volume-10-june-29-2006/item/1172-galician-california-galician-hell-the-peril-and-promise-of-oil-production-in-austria-hungary |publisher=Office of Science and Technology Austria (OSTA) |location=Washington, D.C. |date=June 29, 2006 |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509183618/http://ostaustria.org/bridges-magazine/volume-10-june-29-2006/item/1172-galician-california-galician-hell-the-peril-and-promise-of-oil-production-in-austria-hungary |archivedate=May 9, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===First World War and Polish-Ukrainian conflict===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]] Galicia saw heavy fighting between the forces of Russia and the [[Central Powers]]. The Russian forces overran most of the region in 1914 after defeating the Austro-Hungarian army in a chaotic frontier [[Eastern Front (WWI)|battle]] in the opening months of the war. They were in turn pushed out in the spring and summer of 1915 by a [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive|combined German and Austro-Hungarian offensive]].\n\n[[File:Szturm Twierdzy Przemysl A.

The local Ukrainian population briefly declared the independence of Eastern Galicia as the \"[[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]\". During the [[Polish-Soviet War]] the Soviets tried to establish the [[puppet-state]] of the [[Galician SSR]] in East Galicia, the government of which after couple of months was liquidated.\n\nThe fate of Galicia was settled by the [[Peace of Riga]] on March 18, 1921, attributing Galicia to the [[Second Polish Republic]].

As Polish government policies were unfriendly towards minorities, tensions between the Polish government and the Ukrainian population grew, eventually giving the rise to the militant underground [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{Main article|Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria}}\nSoon the newly acquired Polish territories (see [[First Partition of Poland]]) which were known as Kreise (Voivodeship in Poland) were restructured in November 1773 into 59 Kreisdistriktes (Land districts), while kreises were abolished. Some former voivodeships were incorporated completely, while most of them only partially. Among them were the former voivodeships of Belz, Red-Ruthenian, Cracow, Lublin, Sandomierz, and Podolie. Also during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u201374)|Russo-Turkish War]] in 1769, the northwestern territory of [[Moldavia]] (renamed [[Bukovina]]) was occupied by the [[Russian Empire]] which [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca|ceded]] it in 1774 to the [[Austrian Empire]] as a \"token of appreciation\".\n\n===Major cities and towns===\n====Administrative division====\nThe Kingdom was split into numerous counties (powiat) which in 1914 were about 75.<ref>[http://www.ukrstor.com/ukrstor/galicia540_30.jpg Map of the Kingdom with its county division (Lenius, Brian. \"Genealogical Gazetteer of Galicia\" 2nd ed.

There were nearly 19,000 noble families with 95,000 members (about 3% of the population). The \"non-free\" accounted for 1.86 million, more than 70% of the population. A small number were full farmers, but by far the overwhelming number (84%) had only smallholdings or no possessions.\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0442\u044f 1.jpg|thumb|People of East Galicia]]\n[[File:Zarubezhnaia Rus.jpg|thumb|Map of a region where Russians lived in the [[Austrian Empire]] \u2013 Galicia and Hungarian Russia ([[Carpathian Ruthenia]]) \u2013 by [[Dmitry Vergun]]]]\n\nNo country of the Austrian monarchy had such a varied ethnic mix as Galicia: [[Poles]], [[Ruthenians]], [[Germans]] ([[Galician Germans]]), [[Armenia]]ns, [[Galician Jews|Jews]], [[Hungarians]], [[Romani people]], [[Lipovans|Lipowaner]], etc. The Poles were mainly in the west, with the Ruthenians (Ukrainians) predominant in the eastern region (\"Ruthenia\"). \n\nThe Jews of Galicia had immigrated in the Middle Ages from Germany and mostly spoke [[Yiddish]] as their first language. German-speaking people were more commonly referred to as \"Saxons\" or \"Swabians\", even though most of them did not come from [[Saxony]] or [[Swabia]] (cf. [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and [[Danube Swabians]]). There were also some [[Mennonite]]s who mostly came originally from [[Switzerland]], but spoke a dialect of [[Palatine German language|Palatine German]] which is close to [[Pennsylvania German]].\n\nWith inhabitants who had a clear difference in language such as with the Saxons or the Roma identification was less problematic, but widespread multilingualness blurred the borders again. \n\nIt is however possible to make a clear distinction in religious denominations: the majority of the Poles were [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin Catholics]], while the Ruthenians were mostly [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholics]]. The Jews, who represented the third largest religious group, were mostly traditional in their religious observance which later developed into [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\nThe average life expectancy was 27 years for men and 28.5 years for women, as compared to 33 and 37 in [[Bohemia]], 39 and 41 in [[France]] and 40 and 42 in [[England]]. Also the quality of life was much lower.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} The yearly consumption of meat did not exceed {{convert|10|kg|0|abbr=on}} per capita, as compared to {{convert|24|kg|0|abbr=on}} in Hungary and 33 in Germany.

Its level of development was comparable to or higher than that of Russia and the Balkans, but well behind Western Europe.\n\nThe first detailed description of the economic situation of the region was prepared by Stanislaw Szczepanowski (1846\u20131900), a Polish lawyer, economist and chemist who in 1873 published the first version of his report titled ''N\u0119dza galicyjska w cyfrach'' (''The Galician Poverty in Numbers''). Based on his own experience as a worker in the [[India Office]], as well as his work on development of the oil industry in the region of [[Borys\u0142aw, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship|Borys\u0142aw]] and the official census data published by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] government, he described Galicia as one of the poorest regions in Europe.\n\nStatistics indicate the Galicia and Lodomeria was poorer than areas west of it. The average income per capita did not exceed 53 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|Rhine guilders]] (RG), as compared to 91 RG in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], 100 in Hungary and more than 450 RG in England at that time. Also the taxes were relatively high and equalled to 9 Rhine guilders a year (c. 17% of yearly income), as compared to 5% in Prussia and 10% in England. Also the percentage of people with higher income was much lower than in other parts of the Monarchy and Europe: the luxury tax, paid by people whose yearly income exceeded 600 RG, was paid by 8 people in every 1,000 inhabitants, as compared to 28 in Bohemia and 99 in [[Lower Austria]]. Despite high taxation, the national debt of the Galician government exceeded 300 million RG at all times, that is approximately 60 RG per capita.\n\nAll in all, the region was used by the Austro-Hungarian government mostly as a reservoir of cheap workforce and recruits for the army,{{citation needed|date=August 2007}} as well as a buffer zone against Russia. It was not until early in the 20th century that heavy industry started to be developed, which would be comparable to much of Russia and the Balkans. Even then it was mostly connected to war production. The biggest state investments in the region were the railways and the fortresses in [[Przemy\u015bl, Poland|Przemy\u015bl]], Krak\u00f3w and other cities. Industrial development was mostly connected to the private oil industry started by [[Ignacy Lukasiewicz|Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] and to the [[Wieliczka salt mine]]s, operational since at least the [[Middle Ages]].\n\n===Industry===\nIn 1880, industry in Galicia was at a low level. In 1857 Galicia had 102,189 persons or 2.2% of the population worked in industry. By 1870 that number had risen to 179,626, or 3.3% of the population.\n\n===Oil and natural gas industry===\n{{See also|The Petroleum Trail}}\n[[File:Galicia 1897 1.jpg|thumb|330px|Rail lines of Galicia before 1897]]\nNear [[Drohobych]] and [[Boryslav]] in Galicia, significant oil reserves were [https://web.archive.org/web/20161006104622/http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/drohobycz/maps/Map_oilfields.asp discovered and developed] during the mid 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref name=DrohobychOil>{{cite web | last1 = Schatzker | first1 = Valerie | last2 = Erdheim | first2 = Claudia | last3 = Sharontitle | first3 = Alexander | title = Petroleum in Galicia | url = http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/drohobycz/history/petroleum.asp | publisher = Drohobycz Administrative District: History | accessdate = April 20, 2016 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160410201456/http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/drohobycz/history/petroleum.asp | archivedate = April 10, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=CarpathianOil>{{cite book | last1= Golonka | first1 = Jan | last2 = Picha | first2 = Frank J. | title = The Carpathians and Their Foreland: Geology and Hydrocarbon Resources | publisher = American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) | date = 2006 | isbn = 9780891813651}}</ref> The first European attempt to drill for oil was in [[B\u00f3brka, Krosno County|B\u00f3brka]] in western Galicia in 1854.<ref name=DrohobychOil/><ref name=CarpathianOil/> By 1867, a well at [[Kl\u0119czany, Nowy S\u0105cz County|Kleczany]], in Western Galicia, was drilled using steam to about 200 meters.<ref name=DrohobychOil/><ref name=CarpathianOil/> On December 31, 1872, a [[Galician Transversal Railway|railway line]] linking Borys\u0142aw (now Boryslav) with the nearby city of Drohobycz (now Drohobych) was opened.

Greatly simplified, the process of net energy determination is very much like that of cost-benefit analysis, in which some items can either be added to the cost (the denominator of the benefit-to-cost ratio) or subtracted from the benefits (its numerator), yielding different results with the same numbers. Such differences are substantial and complex in net energy analysis (also known as energy return on investment, or EROI)<ref>Lambert, J.G., Hall, C.A.S., Balogh, S., Gupta, A., and M. Arnold. (2014). ''Energy'' '''64''':153-167</ref>. They often result from differences in ways that energy costs and energy credits are allocated, philosophical differences over the boundaries to calculations, and differences in evaluating the quality (liquid versus solid, for example) of energy sources. In a joint paper with one of his disputants, agronomist Bruce Dale, and arbitrated by the reputable ecologist and energy scientist, Charles Hall, who was annoyed at the critiques of Pimentel\u2019s estimates, or more accurately why there should be such large differences (about a factor of two) between two different estimates of what should be a pretty straightforward analysis, it was finally agreed that most of the energy used for each of the inputs (as, for example, for tractor fuel, fertilizer) were reasonably similar, although Pimentel tended to be more inclusive, including the energy cost to produce that fuel, and also the seeds, pesticides, steel etc.  needed.<ref>Hall, C.A.S., Dale, B.E., and D. Pimentel. (2011). Seeking to Understand the Reasons for Different Energy Return on Investment (EROI) Estimates for Biofuels. ''Sustainability'' '''3''':2413-2432.</ref> Hence his energy costs tended to be about a third higher. Additionally Dale reduced his energy costs by about a quarter to give credit for \u201cco-products\u201d such as corn mash that could be fed to chickens. In that paper, Pimentel accepted that in some situations that would be appropriate.\n\nWhat was not said in that paper, or in the critiques more generally, was that the real issue was not whether the EROI for alcohol fuel was less than 0.8 to 1 versus the 1.7 to 1 estimated (with coproducts) by Dale. The issue was that what a society needed was not a marginal energy return on investment such as 1.7 to 1 but a substantially positive one, from 3 to 1 at a bare minimum to perhaps 12 to 1 for a society like we live in today.<ref>Hall, C. A. S., Balogh, S., and D. J. R. Murphy. (2009). What is the Minimum EROI that a Sustainable Society Must Have? ''Energies'' '''2''':25-47.</ref><ref>Lambert. et a.

When his suggestion that \u201cenergy was going to be important to agricultural research in the future\u201d  was rebuffed as an area of study by a 1968 National Academy of Science Panel on which he served, Pimentel set about to put together the needed data himself by creating a graduate research course to do so using his own students.<ref>Dritschilo, W.

Greatly simplified, the process of net energy determination is very much like that of cost-benefit analysis, in which some items can either be added to the cost (the denominator of the benefit-to-cost ratio) or subtracted from the benefits (its numerator), yielding different results with the same numbers. Such differences are substantial and complex in net energy analysis (also known as energy return on investment, or EROI)<ref>Lambert, J.G., Hall, C.A.S., Balogh, S., Gupta, A., and M. Arnold. (2014). ''Energy'' '''64''':153-167</ref>. They often result from differences in ways that energy costs and energy credits are allocated, philosophical differences over the boundaries to calculations, and differences in evaluating the quality (liquid versus solid, for example) of energy sources. In a joint paper with one of his disputants, agronomist Bruce Dale, and arbitrated by the reputable ecologist and energy scientist, Charles Hall, who was annoyed at the critiques of Pimentel\u2019s estimates, or more accurately why there should be such large differences (about a factor of two) between two different estimates of what should be a pretty straightforward analysis, it was finally agreed that most of the energy used for each of the inputs (as, for example, for tractor fuel, fertilizer) were reasonably similar, although Pimentel tended to be more inclusive, including the energy cost to produce that fuel, and also the seeds, pesticides, steel etc.  needed.<ref>Hall, C.A.S., Dale, B.E., and D. Pimentel. (2011). Seeking to Understand the Reasons for Different Energy Return on Investment (EROI) Estimates for Biofuels. ''Sustainability'' '''3''':2413-2432.</ref> Hence his energy costs tended to be about a third higher. Additionally Dale reduced his energy costs by about a quarter to give credit for \u201cco-products\u201d such as corn mash that could be fed to chickens. In that paper, Pimentel accepted that in some situations that would be appropriate.\n\nWhat was not said in that paper, or in the critiques more generally, was that the real issue was not whether the EROI for alcohol fuel was less than 0.8 to 1 versus the 1.7 to 1 estimated (with coproducts) by Dale. The issue was that what a society needed was not a marginal energy return on investment such as 1.7 to 1 but a substantially positive one, from 3 to 1 at a bare minimum to perhaps 12 to 1 for a society like we live in today.<ref>Hall, C.

{"title_page": "DNA virus", "text_new": "{{short description|Virus that has DNA as its genetic material}}\nA '''DNA virus''' is a [[virus]] that has [[DNA]] as its [[genetic material]] and replicates using a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]. The [[nucleic acid]] is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). DNA viruses belong to either ''Group I'' or ''Group II'' of the [[Baltimore classification]] system for viruses. Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells. Although ''Group VII'' viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] contain a DNA [[genome]], they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather [[reverse transcribing viruses]] because they replicate through an RNA intermediate. Notable diseases like [[smallpox]], [[herpes]], and the [[chickenpox]] are caused by such DNA viruses.\n\n==Group I: dsDNA viruses==\n[[File:Hhv6 genome2.png|thumb|450px|alt=HHV-6 genome|Genome of ''[[human herpesvirus-6]]'', a member of the family [[Herpesviridae]]]]\n[[Genome]] organization within this group varies considerably. Some have circular genomes (''Baculoviridae'', ''Papovaviridae'' and ''Polydnaviridae'') while others have linear genomes (''Adenoviridae'', ''Herpesviridae'' and some phages). Some families have circularly permuted linear genomes ([[phage T4]] and some ''Iridoviridae''). Others have linear genomes with covalently closed ends (''Poxviridae'' and ''Phycodnaviridae'').\n\nA virus infecting [[archaea]] was first described in 1974. Several others have been described since: most have head-tail morphologies and linear double-stranded DNA genomes. Other morphologies have also been described: spindle shaped, rod shaped, filamentous, icosahedral and spherical. Additional morphological types may exist.\n\n[[Order (biology)|Order]]s within this group are defined on the basis of morphology rather than DNA sequence similarity. It is thought that morphology is more conserved in this group than sequence similarity or gene order which is extremely variable. Three orders and 31 [[family (biology)|families]] are currently recognised. A fourth order\u2014[[Megavirales]]\u2014for the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses has been proposed.<ref name=Colson2012 /><ref name=\"Colson2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Colson P, De Lamballerie X, Yutin N, Asgari S, Bigot Y, Bideshi DK, Cheng XW, Federici BA, Van Etten JL, Koonin EV, La Scola B, Raoult D | title = \"Megavirales\", a proposed new order for eukaryotic nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 158 | issue = 12 | pages = 2517\u20132521 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23812617 | pmc = 4066373 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-013-1768-6 }}</ref> This proposal has yet to be ratified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV]].

These two viruses have been placed in the families ''[[Pleolipoviridae]]'' and ''[[Spiraviridae]]''\n\n===Taxonomy===\n\nFamilies in this group have been assigned on the basis of the nature of the genome (circular or linear) and the host range. Twelve families are currently recognised.\n\n* Family ''[[Anelloviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Bacilladnavirus|Bacilladnaviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Bidnaviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Circoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Geminiviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Genomoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Inoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Microviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Nanoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Parvoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Smacoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Spiraviridae]]''\n\n===Classification===\nA division of the circular single stranded viruses into four types has been proposed.<ref name=Rosario2009/> This division seems likely to reflect their phylogenetic relationships.\n\nType I genomes are characterized by a small circular DNA genome (approximately 2-kb), with the Rep protein and the major open reading frame (ORF) in opposite orientations. This type is characteristic of the circoviruses, geminiviruses and nanoviruses.\n\nType II genomes have the unique feature of two separate Rep ORFs.\n\nType III genomes contain two major ORFs in the same orientation. This arrangement is typical of the anelloviruses.\n\nType IV genomes have the largest genomes of nearly 4-kb, with up to eight ORFs. This type of genome is found in the Inoviridae and the Microviridae.\n\nGiven the variety of single stranded viruses that have been described this scheme\u2014if it is accepted by the ICTV\u2014will need to be extended.\n\n====CRESS DNA viruses====\n\nAll known eukaryotic ssDNA viruses have icosahedral capsids. With the exception of the family ''Bidnaviridae'' and ''Anelloviridae'', all eukaryotic ssDNA viruses encode homologous rolling-circle replication initiation proteins with characteristic N-terminal endonuclease domains and C-terminal superfamily three helicase domains.<ref name=Krupovic2013>Krupovic M (2013) \"Networks of evolutionary interactions underlying the polyphyletic origin of ssDNA viruses\".

The ''Bidnaviridae'' have a two part genome and infect invertebrates. The ''Inoviridae'' and ''Microviridae'' infect [[bacteria]]; the ''Anelloviridae'' and ''Circoviridae'' infect [[animal]]s ([[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s respectively); and the ''Geminiviridae'' and ''Nanoviridae'' infect [[plant]]s. In both the ''Geminiviridae'' and ''Nanoviridae'' the genome is composed of more than a single chromosome. The ''Bacillariodnaviridae'' infect [[diatom]]s and have a unique genome: the major chromosome is circular (~6 kilobases in length): the minor chromosome is linear (~1 kilobase in length) and complementary to part of the major chromosome. Members of the ''Spiraviridae'' infect archaea. Members of the ''Genomoviridae'' infect fungi.\n\n===Molecular biology===\nAll viruses in this group require formation of a replicative form\u2014a double stranded DNA intermediate\u2014for genome replication.

There are two types of DNA satellite viruses\u2014the [[alphasatellite]]s and the [[betasatellite]]s\u2014both of which are dependent on [[begomovirus]]es. At present satellite viruses are not classified into genera or higher taxa.\n\nAlphasatellites are small circular single strand DNA viruses that require a begomovirus for transmission. Betasatellites are small linear single stranded DNA viruses that require a begomovirus to replicate.\n\n==Phylogenetic relationships==\n===Introduction===\n\nPhylogenetic relationships between these families are difficult to determine. The genomes differ significantly in size and organisation. Most studies that have attempted to determine these relationships are based either on some of the more conserved proteins\u2014DNA polymerase and others\u2014or on common structural features. In general most of the proposed relationships are tentative and have not yet been used by the ICTV in their classification.\n\n===ds DNA viruses===\n====Herpesviruses and caudoviruses====\nWhile determining the phylogenetic relations between the various known clades of viruses is difficult, on a number of grounds the herpesviruses and caudoviruses appear to be related.\n\nWhile the three families in the order Herpesvirales are clearly related on morphological grounds, it has proven difficult to determine the dates of divergence between them because of the lack of gene conservation.<ref name=McGeoch2006/> On morphological grounds they appear to be related to the bacteriophages\u2014specifically the Caudoviruses.\n\nThe branching order among the herpesviruses suggests that ''Alloherpesviridae'' is the basal clade and that ''Herpesviridae'' and ''Malacoherpesviridae'' are sister clades.<ref name=\"Davison2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davison AJ | title = Herpesvirus systematics | journal = Veterinary Microbiology | volume = 143 | issue = 1 | pages = 52\u201369 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20346601 | pmc = 2995426 | doi = 10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.014 }}</ref> Given the phylogenetic distances between vertebrates and molluscs this suggests that herpesviruses were initially fish viruses and that they have evolved with their hosts to infect other vertebrates.\n\nThe vertebrate herpesviruses initially evolved ~{{Ma|400}} and underwent subsequent evolution on the supercontinent [[Pangaea]].<ref name=Grose2012/> The alphaherpesvirinae separated from the branch leading to the betaherpesvirinae and gammaherpesvirinae about {{Ma|180}} to {{Ma|220}}.<ref name=McGeoch1995/> The avian herpes viruses diverged from the branch leading to the mammalian species.<ref name=McGeoch1994/> The mammalian species divided into two branches\u2014the Simplexvirus and Varicellovirus genera. This latter divergence appears to have occurred around the time of the mammalian radiation.\n\nSeveral dsDNA bacteriophages and the herpesviruses encode a powerful ATP driven DNA translocating machine that encapsidates a viral genome into a preformed capsid shell or prohead. The critical components of the packaging machine are the packaging enzyme (terminase) which acts as the motor and the portal protein that forms the unique DNA entrance vertex of prohead. The terminase complex consists of a recognition subunit (small terminase) and an endonuclease/translocase subunit (large terminase) and cuts viral genome concatemers. It forms a motor complex containing five large terminase subunits. The terminase-viral DNA complex docks on the portal vertex. The pentameric motor processively translocates DNA until the head shell is full with one viral genome.

These are nearly exclusively hyperthermophiles or extreme halophiles. Tailed archaeal viruses are found only in the [[Euryarchaeota]], whereas most filamentous and pleomorphic archaeal viruses occur in the [[Crenarchaeota]]. Bacterial viruses belong to 10 families and infect members of 179 bacterial genera: most of these are members of the [[Firmicutes]] and \u03b3-[[proteobacteria]].\n\nThe vast majority (96.3%) are tailed with and only 230 (3.7%) are polyhedral, filamentous or pleomorphic. The family [[Siphoviridae]] is the largest family (>3600 descriptions: 57.3%). The tailed phages appear to be monophyletic and are the oldest known virus group.<ref name=Ackermann2003/> They arose repeatedly in different hosts and there are at least 11 separate lines of descent.\n\nAll of the known temperate phages employ one of only three different systems for their lysogenic cycle: lambda-like integration/excision, Mu-like transposition or the plasmid-like partitioning of phage N15.\n\nA putative course of evolution of these phages has been proposed by Ackermann.<ref name=Ackermann1998/>\n\nTailed phages originated in the early [[Precambrian]], long before [[eukaryote]]s and their viruses. The ancestral tailed phage had an icosahedral head of about 60 [[nanometer]]s in diameter and a long non contractile tail with sixfold symmetry. The [[capsid]] contained a single molecule of double stranded DNA of about 50 kilobases. The tail was probably provided with a fixation apparatus. The head and tail were held together by a connector. The viral particle contained no [[lipid]]s, was heavier than its descendant viruses and had a high DNA content proportional to its capsid size (~50%). Most of the genome coded for structural proteins. Morphopoietic genes clustered at one end of the genome, with head genes preceding tail genes. Lytic enzymes were probably coded for. Part of the phage genome was nonessential and possibly bacterial.\n\nThe virus infected its host from the outside and injected its DNA. Replication involved transcription in several waves and formation of DNA [[concatemer]]s.\n\nNew phages were released by burst of the infected cell after lysis of host membranes by a [[peptidoglycan hydrolase]]. Capsids were assembled from a starting point, the connector and around a scaffold. They underwent an elaborate maturation process involving protein cleavage and capsid expansion. Heads and tails were assembled separately and joined later. The DNA was cut to size and entered preformed capsids by a headful mechanism.\n\nSubsequently, the phages evolved contractile or short tails and elongated heads. Some viruses become temperate by acquiring an [[integrase]]\u2013[[excisionase]] complex, [[plasmid]] parts or [[transposon]]s.\n\nA possible evolutionary pathway using vesicles rather than a protein coat has been described in the archaeal plasmid pR1SE.<ref name=Erdmann2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Erdmann S, Tschitschko B, Zhong L, Raftery MJ, Cavicchioli R | title = A plasmid from an

classification}}\n{{Portal bar|Viruses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[Category:DNA viruses| ]]\n[[Category:DNA]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Virus that has DNA as its genetic material}}\nA '''DNA virus''' is a [[virus]] that has [[DNA]] as its [[genetic material]] and replicates using a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]. The [[nucleic acid]] is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). DNA viruses belong to either ''Group I'' or ''Group II'' of the [[Baltimore classification]] system for viruses. Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells. Although ''Group VII'' viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] contain a DNA [[genome]], they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather [[reverse transcribing viruses]] because they replicate through an RNA intermediate. Notable diseases like [[smallpox]], [[herpes]], and the [[chickenpox]] are caused by such DNA viruses.\n\n==Group I: dsDNA viruses==\n[[File:Hhv6 genome2.png|thumb|450px|alt=HHV-6 genome|Genome of ''[[human herpesvirus-6]]'', a member of the family [[Herpesviridae]]]]\n[[Genome]] organization within this group varies considerably. Some have circular genomes (''Baculoviridae'', ''Papovaviridae'' and ''Polydnaviridae'') while others have linear genomes (''Adenoviridae'', ''Herpesviridae'' and some phages). Some families have circularly permuted linear genomes ([[phage T4]] and some ''Iridoviridae''). Others have linear genomes with covalently closed ends (''Poxviridae'' and ''Phycodnaviridae'').\n\nA virus infecting [[archaea]] was first described in 1974. Several others have been described since: most have head-tail morphologies and linear double-stranded DNA genomes. Other morphologies have also been described: spindle shaped, rod shaped, filamentous, icosahedral and spherical. Additional morphological types may exist.\n\n[[Order (biology)|Order]]s within this group are defined on the basis of morphology rather than DNA sequence similarity.

There are two types of DNA satellite viruses\u2014the [[alphasatellite]]s and the [[betasatellite]]s\u2014both of which are dependent on [[begomovirus]]es. At present satellite viruses are not classified into genera or higher taxa.\n\nAlphasatellites are small circular single strand DNA viruses that require a begomovirus for transmission. Betasatellites are small linear single stranded DNA viruses that require a begomovirus to replicate.\n\n==Phylogenetic relationships==\n===Introduction===\n\nPhylogenetic relationships between these families are difficult to determine. The genomes differ significantly in size and organisation. Most studies that have attempted to determine these relationships are based either on some of the more conserved proteins\u2014DNA polymerase and others\u2014or on common structural features. In general most of the proposed relationships are tentative and have not yet been used by the ICTV in their classification.\n\n===ds DNA viruses===\n====Herpesviruses and caudoviruses====\nWhile determining the phylogenetic relations between the various known clades of viruses is difficult, on a number of grounds the herpesviruses and caudoviruses appear to be related.\n\nWhile the three families in the order Herpesvirales are clearly related on morphological grounds, it has proven difficult to determine the dates of divergence between them because of the lack of gene conservation.<ref name=McGeoch2006/> On morphological grounds they appear to be related to the bacteriophages\u2014specifically the Caudoviruses.\n\nThe branching order among the herpesviruses suggests that ''Alloherpesviridae'' is the basal clade and that ''Herpesviridae'' and ''Malacoherpesviridae'' are sister clades.<ref name=\"Davison2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davison AJ | title = Herpesvirus systematics | journal = Veterinary Microbiology | volume = 143 | issue = 1 | pages = 52\u201369 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20346601 | pmc = 2995426 | doi = 10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.014 }}</ref> Given the phylogenetic distances between vertebrates and molluscs this suggests that herpesviruses were initially fish viruses and that they have evolved with their hosts to infect other vertebrates.\n\nThe vertebrate herpesviruses initially evolved ~{{Ma|400}} and underwent subsequent evolution on the supercontinent [[Pangaea]].<ref name=Grose2012/> The alphaherpesvirinae separated from the branch leading to the betaherpesvirinae and gammaherpesvirinae about {{Ma|180}} to {{Ma|220}}.<ref name=McGeoch1995/> The avian herpes viruses diverged from the branch leading to the mammalian species.<ref name=McGeoch1994/> The mammalian species divided into two branches\u2014the Simplexvirus and Varicellovirus genera. This latter divergence appears to have occurred around the time of the mammalian radiation.\n\nSeveral dsDNA bacteriophages and the herpesviruses encode a powerful ATP driven DNA translocating machine that encapsidates a viral genome into a preformed capsid shell or prohead. The critical components of the packaging machine are the packaging enzyme (terminase) which acts as the motor and the portal protein that forms the unique DNA entrance vertex of prohead. The terminase complex consists of a recognition subunit (small terminase) and an endonuclease/translocase subunit (large terminase) and cuts viral genome concatemers. It forms a motor complex containing five large terminase subunits. The terminase-viral DNA complex docks on the portal vertex. The pentameric motor processively translocates DNA until the head shell is full with one viral genome. The motor cuts the DNA again and dissociates from the full head, allowing head-finishing proteins to assemble on the portal, sealing the portal, and constructing a platform for tail attachment. Only a single gene encoding the putative ATPase subunit of the [[terminase]] (''UL15'') is conserved among all herpesviruses. To a lesser extent this gene is also found in [[T4-like]] [[bacteriophages]] suggesting a common ancestor for these two groups of viruses.<ref name=Davison2002/> Another paper has also suggested that herpesviruses originated among the bacteriophages.<ref name=\"Koonin2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Krupovic M, Yutin N | title = Evolution of double-stranded DNA viruses of eukaryotes: from bacteriophages to transposons to giant viruses | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1341 | issue = 1 | pages = 10\u201324 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25727355 | pmc = 4405056 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12728 | bibcode = 2015NYASA1341...10K }}</ref>\n\nA common origin for the herpesviruses and the caudoviruses has been suggested on the basis of parallels in their capsid assembly pathways and similarities between their portal complexes, through which DNA enters the capsid.<ref name=Baker2005/> These two groups of viruses share a distinctive 12-fold arrangement of subunits in the portal complex.

These are nearly exclusively hyperthermophiles or extreme halophiles. Tailed archaeal viruses are found only in the [[Euryarchaeota]], whereas most filamentous and pleomorphic archaeal viruses occur in the [[Crenarchaeota]]. Bacterial viruses belong to 10 families and infect members of 179 bacterial genera: most of these are members of the [[Firmicutes]] and \u03b3-[[proteobacteria]].\n\nThe vast majority (96.3%) are tailed with and only 230 (3.7%) are polyhedral, filamentous or pleomorphic. The family [[Siphoviridae]] is the largest family (>3600 descriptions: 57.3%). The tailed phages appear to be monophyletic and are the oldest known virus group.<ref name=Ackermann2003/> They arose repeatedly in different hosts and there are at least 11 separate lines of descent.\n\nAll of the known temperate phages employ one of only three different systems for their lysogenic cycle: lambda-like integration/excision, Mu-like transposition or the plasmid-like partitioning of phage N15.\n\nA putative course of evolution of these phages has been proposed by Ackermann.<ref name=Ackermann1998/>\n\nTailed phages originated in the early [[Precambrian]], long before [[eukaryote]]s and their viruses. The ancestral tailed phage had an icosahedral head of about 60 [[nanometer]]s in diameter and a long non contractile tail with sixfold symmetry. The [[capsid]] contained a single molecule of double stranded DNA of about 50 kilobases. The tail was probably provided with a fixation apparatus. The head and tail were held together by a connector. The viral particle contained no [[lipid]]s, was heavier than its descendant viruses and had a high DNA content proportional to its capsid size (~50%). Most of the genome coded for structural proteins. Morphopoietic genes clustered at one end of the genome, with head genes preceding tail genes. Lytic enzymes were probably coded for. Part of the phage genome was nonessential and possibly bacterial.\n\nThe virus infected its host from the outside and injected its DNA. Replication involved transcription in several waves and formation of DNA [[concatemer]]s.\n\nNew phages were released by burst of the infected cell after lysis of host membranes by a [[peptidoglycan hydrolase]]. Capsids were assembled from a starting point, the connector and around a scaffold. They underwent an elaborate maturation process involving protein cleavage and capsid expansion. Heads and tails were assembled separately and joined later. The DNA was cut to size and entered preformed capsids by a headful mechanism.\n\nSubsequently, the phages evolved contractile or short tails and elongated heads. Some viruses become temperate by acquiring an [[integrase]]\u2013[[excisionase]] complex, [[plasmid]] parts or [[transposon]]s.\n\nA possible evolutionary pathway using vesicles rather than a protein coat has been described in the archaeal plasmid pR1SE.<ref name=Erdmann2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Erdmann S, Tschitschko B, Zhong L, Raftery MJ, Cavicchioli R | title = A plasmid from an
