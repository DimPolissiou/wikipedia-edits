His work deals with the nature of [[identity (social science)|identity]] as an ever-evolving and uncharted terrain, bringing together a variety of seemingly disparate forms and themes. He undertook his first major public art project through the Future Arts Research program at the [[Arizona State University]],<ref>{{cite web | title=F.A.R.

His sound based work is concerned with the innate lyricism of his traditional language and the expression of this in contemporary traditional and experimental musical forms. His work has appeared in various national and international publications including [[frieze (magazine)|''Frieze'']], ''Art and Australia'', ''Art Monthly'', ''Realtime'', ''Art Review'', ''Vogue'' magazine and in [[Susan Bright]]'s book ''Auto Focus'' published by [[Thames & Hudson]].

By Washington State's [[Port District Act]], the port construction plan had to be presented and voted upon before construction could start. One of the biggest factors that swayed the votes in favor of creating the port was the prospect of economic growth.<ref name=oldham>Oldham Kit. \"Port of Seattle's Commissioners Meet for the First Time September 12, 1911\". Historylink.org essay 9726. February 16, 2011.</ref> The first Commission Report for 1912 records that: \"The Port of Seattle came into existence on September 5, 1911, by a vote of the people of the Port District held on that date in accordance with the Port District Act of March 14, 1911.  The work of the commission for the first six months was confined almost entirely to the preparation of projects which were duly approved by the people at a special election held on March 5, 1912.\"\n\n===Development and growth===\nPort construction began in 1913 with the creation of a home port for the local fishermen; this terminal was completed in 1914 and became the Northern Pacific Fishing Fleet's home of operations. It took over 20 years to get the port up and running due to opposing positions on the board regarding public port legislation, and the balance of economic benefits as against disadvantages. The creation of the Port of Seattle provided facilities for an expansion of shipping trade, later including [[container shipping]], generating increasing economic activity in the area. The [[Second World War]] halted much of the global shipping trade and negatively impacted the economy. In 1949 the U.S. Department of Commerce designated a [[Foreign-trade zones of the United States|foreign-trade zone]] in the port.<ref name=US-ITA>{{citation |url=http://enforcement.trade.gov/ftzpage/orders/ftzorder.html |title=U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones Board Order Summary |publisher= U.S. Department of Commerce, [[International Trade Administration]] |accessdate=September 16, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe port has grown rapidly throughout the years. In 1993 the Bell Street Pier, constructed in 1915, was relocated. Construction began again on the pier in 1988 with the development of the World Trade Center of Seattle. In the early 2000s the Bell Street Pier Cruise Terminal opened, creating employment and economic opportunities in the tourism business. Improvements to security were put in hand following the September 11th attack. As of 2010 the port was continuing to expand as well as create records for cargo holding and efficiency. To mark the centennial in 2011, the Port of Seattle created a historical file with photos and information about the port's and the region's history. Today the port is still a major contributor to the Seattle economy.\n\n===Alliance with Tacoma===\nOn October 7, 2014, the Port of Seattle and [[Port of Tacoma]] announced an agreement to \"jointly market and operate the marine terminals of both ports as a single entity,\" though they were not merging.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/10/07/3419467_ports-of-tacoma-seattle-announce.html |title= Ports of Tacoma, Seattle announce alliance |newspaper= The News-Tribune |accessdate= October 7, 2014 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141012061539/http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/10/07/3419467_ports-of-tacoma-seattle-announce.html |archivedate= October 12, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Joint operations began with the formation of the [[Northwest Seaport Alliance]] on August 4, 2015, creating the third-largest cargo gateway in the United States;<ref>{{cite news |last=Garnick |first=Coral |date=August 4, 2015 |title=Seattle, Tacoma ports OK \u2018bold\u2019 alliance in marine cargo business |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/international-trade/seattle-tacoma-ports-ok-bold-alliance-in-marine-cargo-business/ |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=February 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Wilhelm |first=Steve |date=August 4, 2015 |title=The Northwest Seaport Alliance just became the third-largest cargo gateway in the U.S. |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2015/08/04/the-northwest-seaport-alliance-just-became-the.html |newspaper=[[Puget Sound Business Journal]] |accessdate=February 29, 2016}}</ref> by the end of the year, it reported more than 3.5 million [[twenty-foot equivalent unit]]s handled by the two ports, an increase of 4 percent.<ref>{{cite press release |date=January 21, 2016 |title=Northwest Seaport Alliance tops 3.5 million containers in 2015 |url=https://www.nwseaportalliance.com/news/1212016/northwest-seaport-alliance-tops-35-million-containers-2015 |publisher=Northwest Seaport Alliance |accessdate=February 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Long-term impoundment===\nA [[Porsche 959]] imported by [[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] was stored at the Port of Seattle for 13 years from 1987 by the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]], until regulations were changed to allow vehicles of \"historical or technological significance\" to be imported with severe limitations on their use.<ref name=\"Wilkinson2005\">{{cite book|author=Stephan Wilkinson|title=Gold-Plated Porsche: How I Sank a Small Fortune into a Used Car, and Other Misadventures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eICuDY-No6AC|year=2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-59921-678-2|page=22}}</ref> Gates and Allen both helped pass the \"[[Show or Display]]\" law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import/ShowDisplay/howtosd072003.html|title=How To Import A Motor Vehicle For Show Or Display|work=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]|date=July 7, 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Current issues==\nRecent years have brought significant changes to the Port of Seattle.

By Washington State's [[Port District Act]], the port construction plan had to be presented and voted upon before construction could start. One of the biggest factors that swayed the votes in favor of creating the port was the prospect of economic growth.<ref name=oldham>Oldham Kit. \"Port of Seattle's Commissioners Meet for the First Time September 12, 1911\". Historylink.org essay 9726. February 16, 2011.</ref> The first Commission Report for 1912 records that: \"The Port of Seattle came into existence on September 5, 1911, by a vote of the people of the Port District held on that date in accordance with the Port District Act of March 14, 1911.  The work of the commission for the first six months was confined almost entirely to the preparation of projects which were duly approved by the people at a special election held on March 5, 1912.\"\n\n===Development and growth===\nPort construction began in 1913 with the creation of a home port for the local fishermen; this terminal was completed in 1914 and became the Northern Pacific Fishing Fleet's home of operations. It took over 20 years to get the port up and running due to opposing positions on the board regarding public port legislation, and the balance of economic benefits as against disadvantages. The creation of the Port of Seattle provided facilities for an expansion of shipping trade, later including [[container shipping]], generating increasing economic activity in the area. The [[Second World War]] halted much of the global shipping trade and negatively impacted the economy. In 1949 the U.S. Department of Commerce designated a [[Foreign-trade zones of the United States|foreign-trade zone]] in the port.<ref name=US-ITA>{{citation |url=http://enforcement.trade.gov/ftzpage/orders/ftzorder.html |title=U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones Board Order Summary |publisher= U.S. Department of Commerce, [[International Trade Administration]] |accessdate=September 16, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe port has grown rapidly throughout the years. In 1993 the Bell Street Pier, constructed in 1915, was relocated. Construction began again on the pier in 1988 with the development of the World Trade Center of Seattle. In the early 2000s the Bell Street Pier Cruise Terminal opened, creating employment and economic opportunities in the tourism business. Improvements to security were put in hand following the September 11th attack. As of 2010 the port was continuing to expand as well as create records for cargo holding and efficiency. To mark the centennial in 2011, the Port of Seattle created a historical file with photos and information about the port's and the region's history. Today the port is still a major contributor to the Seattle economy.\n\n===Alliance with Tacoma===\nOn October 7, 2014, the Port of Seattle and [[Port of Tacoma]] announced an agreement to \"jointly market and operate the marine terminals of both ports as a single entity,\" though they were not merging.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/10/07/3419467_ports-of-tacoma-seattle-announce.html |title= Ports of Tacoma, Seattle announce alliance |newspaper= The News-Tribune |accessdate= October 7, 2014 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141012061539/http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/10/07/3419467_ports-of-tacoma-seattle-announce.html |archivedate= October 12, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Joint operations began with the formation of the [[Northwest Seaport Alliance]] on August 4, 2015, creating the third-largest cargo gateway in the United States;<ref>{{cite news |last=Garnick |first=Coral |date=August 4, 2015 |title=Seattle, Tacoma ports OK \u2018bold\u2019 alliance in marine cargo business |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/international-trade/seattle-tacoma-ports-ok-bold-alliance-in-marine-cargo-business/ |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=February 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Wilhelm |first=Steve |date=August 4, 2015 |title=The Northwest Seaport Alliance just became the third-largest cargo gateway in the U.S. |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2015/08/04/the-northwest-seaport-alliance-just-became-the.html |newspaper=[[Puget Sound Business Journal]] |accessdate=February 29, 2016}}</ref> by the end of the year, it reported more than 3.5 million [[twenty-foot equivalent unit]]s handled by the two ports, an increase of 4 percent.<ref>{{cite press release |date=January 21, 2016 |title=Northwest Seaport Alliance tops 3.5 million containers in 2015 |url=https://www.nwseaportalliance.com/news/1212016/northwest-seaport-alliance-tops-35-million-containers-2015 |publisher=Northwest Seaport Alliance |accessdate=February 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Long-term impoundment===\nA [[Porsche 959]] imported by [[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] was stored at the Port of Seattle for 13 years from 1987 by the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]], until regulations were changed to allow vehicles of \"historical or technological significance\" to be imported with severe limitations on their use.<ref name=\"Wilkinson2005\">{{cite book|author=Stephan Wilkinson|title=Gold-Plated Porsche: How I Sank a Small Fortune into a Used Car, and Other Misadventures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eICuDY-No6AC|year=2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-59921-678-2|page=22}}</ref> Gates and Allen both helped pass the \"[[Show or Display]]\" law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import/ShowDisplay/howtosd072003.html|title=How To Import A Motor Vehicle For Show Or Display|work=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]|date=July 7, 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Current issues==\nRecent years have brought significant changes to the Port of Seattle.
