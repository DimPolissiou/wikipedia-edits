This coincided with the establishment of Hainan as a separate administrative region. In September 1988,the authority's name was officially changed to the \"Hainan Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority\". On 25 December 2006, Woody Island 'census-town's' first-ever \"Residents' and Fishermen's Congress\" was held. Three representatives at the township and village levels were selected to represent the census-town's Neighborhood Committee of the North and South Villages. The Neighborhood Committee began work on Woody Island the following day with an office at the Border Guards of the Paracels' Police Station. These were the first ever actual subdivisions created within the county-level authority.<ref name=\"Beijing Review\"/>\n<!--\nBefore the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea]]'s (UNCLOS III) addendums to the Law of the Sea, the Central government had always maintained a claim to nearly 3.5 million km<sup>2</sup> (1.35 million sq. mi.) in maritime area of the South China Sea {{fact|date=August 2012}}, which equated to roughly one-third of China's total land area. The Central government claimed this as part of China's sovereign [[territorial waters]], commonly known as \"China's blue territories\". It was delineated on maps by the 9 or 10 dashed lines. Although many Chinese maps published after UNCLOS III still retain these dashed lines, they have no legal value and are used solely as a reference line to denote that \"all features (islands, reefs, banks, shoals, cays, sands) located within the dashed lines are sovereign territory of the People's Republic of China\". UNCLOS III, which has been ratified by China, went into force on the 16 November 1994. New [[Baseline (sea)|baselines]] of the [[Mainland China|mainland]] and the Paracels were released on the 15 May 1996. The addendum for the EEZ's extension via [[Continental shelf#Economic significance|Continental Shelves (in the legal sense)]] was also handed to the [[Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] (CLCS). Coupled with officially published laws of the past, China's new [[internal waters]] and [[territorial waters]], namely, China's \"blue territories\", could thus be calculated to an area of approximately {{convert|31000|km2|abbr=on}}.\n-->\n\nThe prospect of the establishment of a \"city\" on Woody Island was first publicized on 19 November 2007 in a report by [[Mingpao]], a Hong Kong-based newspaper, through a telephone interview with a Mr. Zhang of the Propaganda Department of [[Wenchang]], Hainan.

The rest of the Paracels, the Zhongsha Islands and the Spratlys were only accessible to military personnel. The situation was improved in 1977 with the construction of a freighter given approval by then Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. Having a tonnage of 2160 tonnes and a maximum load of 200 passengers, the \"Qiongsha 1\" (literally \"Hainan-South China Sea Islands 1\") freighter carried supplies and people between Woody Island and Hainan Island. In 1997, \"Qiongsha 1\" was destroyed in a typhoon while en route to [[Zhanjiang]], [[Guangdong]] Province for routine maintenance and upkeep. A smaller \"Qiongsha 2\" freighter of 1410 tonnes and a maximum load of 100 passengers was commissioned that same year. It operated for 10 years, and was decommissioned in January 2007.\n\nSince 2008, the \"lifeboat\" of the islands is the \"Qiongsha 3\" freighter (Tonnage: 2500 tonnes; Load: 200 passengers; Payload: 750 tonnes in cargo; Length: 84 metres; Width: 13.8 metres). This is essentially the only means of transportation to and from the islands for non-military personnel (mostly fishermen and researchers). Its maiden voyage was on 10 February 2007, and it has been sailing regularly between [[Wenchang]]'s Qinglan Port on southeastern Hainan Island and Woody Island in the Paracels roughly every 20 days.

This coincided with the establishment of Hainan as a separate administrative region. In September 1988,the authority's name was officially changed to the \"Hainan Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority\". On 25 December 2006, Woody Island 'census-town's' first-ever \"Residents' and Fishermen's Congress\" was held. Three representatives at the township and village levels were selected to represent the census-town's Neighborhood Committee of the North and South Villages. The Neighborhood Committee began work on Woody Island the following day with an office at the Border Guards of the Paracels' Police Station. These were the first ever actual subdivisions created within the county-level authority.<ref name=\"Beijing Review\"/>\n<!--\nBefore the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea]]'s (UNCLOS III) addendums to the Law of the Sea, the Central government had always maintained a claim to nearly 3.5 million km<sup>2</sup> (1.35 million sq. mi.) in maritime area of the South China Sea {{fact|date=August 2012}}, which equated to roughly one-third of China's total land area. The Central government claimed this as part of China's sovereign [[territorial waters]], commonly known as \"China's blue territories\". It was delineated on maps by the 9 or 10 dashed lines. Although many Chinese maps published after UNCLOS III still retain these dashed lines, they have no legal value and are used solely as a reference line to denote that \"all features (islands, reefs, banks, shoals, cays, sands) located within the dashed lines are sovereign territory of the People's Republic of China\". UNCLOS III, which has been ratified by China, went into force on the 16 November 1994. New [[Baseline (sea)|baselines]] of the [[Mainland China|mainland]] and the Paracels were released on the 15 May 1996. The addendum for the EEZ's extension via [[Continental shelf#Economic significance|Continental Shelves (in the legal sense)]] was also handed to the [[Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] (CLCS). Coupled with officially published laws of the past, China's new [[internal waters]] and [[territorial waters]], namely, China's \"blue territories\", could thus be calculated to an area of approximately {{convert|31000|km2|abbr=on}}.\n-->\n\nThe prospect of the establishment of a \"city\" on Woody Island was first publicized on 19 November 2007 in a report by [[Mingpao]], a Hong Kong-based newspaper, through a telephone interview with a Mr. Zhang of the Propaganda Department of [[Wenchang]], Hainan.

The Vietnamese broke Champa's power in [[Cham\u2013Vietnamese War (1471)|an invasion of Champa in 1471]], and then finally conquered the last remnants of the Cham people in an invasion in 1832. A Cham named Katip Suma who received Islamic education in Kelantan declared a [[Jihad]] against the Vietnamese, and fighting continued until the Vietnamese crushed the remnants of the resistance in 1835. The Cham organization Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Champa was part of the [[United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races]], which waged war against the Vietnamese for independence in the [[Vietnam War]] along with the [[Degar people|Montagnard]] and [[Khmer Krom]] minorities.

The rest of the Paracels, the Zhongsha Islands and the Spratlys were only accessible to military personnel. The situation was improved in 1977 with the construction of a freighter given approval by then Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. Having a tonnage of 2160 tonnes and a maximum load of 200 passengers, the \"Qiongsha 1\" (literally \"Hainan-South China Sea Islands 1\") freighter carried supplies and people between Woody Island and Hainan Island. In 1997, \"Qiongsha 1\" was destroyed in a typhoon while en route to [[Zhanjiang]], [[Guangdong]] Province for routine maintenance and upkeep. A smaller \"Qiongsha 2\" freighter of 1410 tonnes and a maximum load of 100 passengers was commissioned that same year. It operated for 10 years, and was decommissioned in January 2007.\n\nSince 2008, the \"lifeboat\" of the islands is the \"Qiongsha 3\" freighter (Tonnage: 2500 tonnes; Load: 200 passengers; Payload: 750 tonnes in cargo; Length: 84 metres; Width: 13.8 metres). This is essentially the only means of transportation to and from the islands for non-military personnel (mostly fishermen and researchers). Its maiden voyage was on 10 February 2007, and it has been sailing regularly between [[Wenchang]]'s Qinglan Port on southeastern Hainan Island and Woody Island in the Paracels roughly every 20 days. A normal trip takes 13 to 15 hours, navigating between dangerous reefs and banks, through a distance of {{convert|186|nmi|km}}. -->\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China}}\n* [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[South China Sea Islands]]\n** [[James Shoal]]\n** [[Macclesfield Bank]]\n** [[Paracel Islands]]\n** [[Scarborough Shoal]]\n** [[Spratly Islands]]\n* [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea]]\n* [[Kalayaan, Palawan|Kalayaan]], [[Palawan]], [[Philippines]]\n* [[Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Sa District|Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Sa]], [[Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a Province|Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a]], [[Vietnam]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.sansha.gov.cn Sansha Government] {{in lang|zh-cn}}\n* [https://archive.today/20121127061700/http://en.hainan.gov.cn/englishgov/AboutHaiNan/200904/t20090419_1366.html Administrative divisions of Hainan Province]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071117131114/http://xnzsha.hainan.gov.cn/ Hainan Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080412060318/http://yjs.hainan.gov.cn/web/2001/main/sx_01_21.htm Hainan Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority Woody Island Census Town]\n* [http://www.xzqh.org/quhua/46hn/9037.htm Subdivision Information of the Hainan Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority]\n* [http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/asia/305969/us-criticises-china-garrison US criticises China garrison]\n\n{{South China Sea}}\n{{Sansha topics}}\n{{Hainan topics}}\n{{Hainan}}\n{{Metropolitan cities of China}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Sansha]]\n[[Category:2012 establishments in China]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 2012]]\n[[Category:Prefecture-level divisions of Hainan]]\n", "name_user": "2001:b400:e401:f3c2:4e3:ad5c:ce11:aba9", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sansha"}

It surrounds the world headquarters of [[Nike, Inc.]], which occupies [[unincorporated area|unincorporated county land]].\n\nThe hunter\u2013gatherer [[Atfalati]] tribe of the [[Kalapuya]] people inhabited the Tualatin Valley prior to the arrival of European\u2013American settlers in the 19th century. They occupied a village near the Beaverton and Fanno creeks called Chakeipi, which meant \"place of the beaver.\" Early white settlers referred to this village as Beaverdam. Lawrence Hall took up the first land claim in 1847 and established a [[grist mill]]. The entry of a railroad in 1868 spurred growth in the small farming communities and led to the town's incorporation in 1893. \n\n==History==\n===Early settlement===\n\nAccording to ''[[Oregon Geographic Names]]'', Beaverton's name is derived from the settlement's proximity to a large body of water resulting from [[American Beaver|beaver]] dams.\n\nThe area of Tualatin Valley that became Beaverton was originally the home of a Native American tribe known as the ''[[Atfalati]]'', which settlers mispronounced as ''Tualatin''.  The Atfalati population dwindled in the latter part of the 18th century, and the prosperous tribe was no longer dominant in the area by the 19th century when settlers arrived. The tribe named their village Chakeipi, which translates to \"place of the beaver\".<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/history.aspx | title = Beaverton History | publisher = City of Beaverton | accessdate = September 7, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928062919/http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/history.aspx | archivedate = September 28, 2007 | url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nThe natives had a village called ''Chakeipi'', meaning ''Place of the Beaver'', and early settlers referred to it as \"Beaverdam\".  Early settlers include the Hall Family from [[Kentucky]], the Denneys who lived on their claim near present-day Scholls Ferry Road and Hall Blvd, and Orin S. Allen, from western New York.<ref name=\"hist\"/>  Lawrence Hall purchased {{convert|640|acre|km2}} in Beaverdam in 1847 and built a [[grist mill]] with his brother near present-day Walker Road.<ref name=\"hist\" />  His was the first land claim in the area.  He was soon followed by Thomas Denney in 1848, who came to the area and built its first sawmill.  In 1860, a toll [[plank road]] from Portland to Beaverton was completed over a trail called [[Canyon Road]].<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nAfter the [[American Civil War]], numerous other settlers, including Joshua Welch, George Betts, Charles Angel, W. P. Watson, and John Henry, laid out what is now known as Beaverton hoping they could bring a railroad to an area once described as, \"mostly swamps & marshes connected by beaver dams to create what looked like a huge lake.\"  In 1872,  Beaverton's first post office opened in a general store operated by Betts, who also served as the first postmaster of the community.  Betts Street, where the current post office now stands, is named in honor of him.  In 1893, Beaverton, which by that time had a population of 400, was officially incorporated. Alonzo Cady, a local businessman, served as the first mayor. Many major roads in Beaverton are named for these early settlers.\n\n===20th century===\n\nBeaverton was an early home to automobile dealerships. A [[Ford Motor Company]] dealership was established there in 1915; it was purchased by Guy Carr in 1923 and over the years Carr expanded it into several locations throughout Beaverton. There are still several dealerships near the intersection of Walker and Canyon Roads.\n\n[[File:View of Beaverton 1950's (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (10).jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Beaverton in the 1950s]]\nIn the early 1920s, Beaverton was home to [[Premium Picture Productions]], a [[movie studio]] which produced about fifteen films.  The studio site was later converted into [[Bernard's Airport#History|Watt's Field]] and associated aircraft manufacturing facilities.  A second Beaverton airport, [[Bernard's Airport]], was later developed farther north, at the present location of the [[Cedar Hills Crossing]] mall.\n\nThe [[Beaverton City Library|town's first library]] opened in 1925. Originally on the second floor of the Cady building, it has moved repeatedly; in 2000 it was moved to its current location on Hall Boulevard and 5th Street.  A branch location was opened for the first time in June 2010, when the Murray-Scholls location opened near the Murrayhill neighborhood.  The Beaverton libraries and 15 other local libraries participate in the [[Washington County Cooperative Library Services]].\n\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|left|Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway, ca. 1911]]\n\nIn the 1940s, [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|Tualatin Valley Stages]], a division of Portland Stages, Inc., provided limited [[Public transport bus service|bus transit]] service connecting the city with [[downtown Portland]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Stage Fares To Increase|date=August 6, 1947|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=9}}</ref> operating later as a separate company, Tualatin Valley Buses, Inc., through the 1960s. This was one of four privately owned bus companies serving the [[Portland metropolitan area]] which became collectively known as the [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|\"Blue Bus\" lines]].  All four companies were replaced in 1970 by [[TriMet]], a then-new regional transit authority,<ref name=\"tri-met action averts\">{{cite news|last=Federman|first=Stan|date=September 2, 1970|title=Tri-Met Action Averts Strike Of Bus Drivers; Agency To Assume Operation Of Four Suburban Blue Lines|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=1}}</ref> which expanded bus service to cover more areas of Beaverton.\n\nIn the late 1970s, a [[light rail]] system was proposed to connect Beaverton to downtown Portland,<ref>{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Nancy|date=November 9, 1979|title=Westside transitway options narrowed to 5|newspaper=[[Beaverton Valley Times|The Valley Times]]|location=Beaverton|page=A-1}}</ref> as part of [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro's]] plans for the region's transportation.

Six stations are located within the city of Beaverton: [[Elmonica / Southwest 170th Avenue|Elmonica/SW 170th Avenue]], [[Merlo Road / Southwest 158th Avenue|Merlo Road/SW 158th]], [[Beaverton Creek (MAX station)|Beaverton Creek]], [[Millikan Way (MAX station)|Millikan Way]], [[Beaverton Central (MAX station)|Beaverton Central]], and the [[Beaverton Transit Center (MAX station)|Beaverton Transit Center]].  All but the last of these (the transit center) are located along [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] formerly owned by [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] and originally by the [[Oregon Electric Railway]], which provided [[interurban]] service through Beaverton until 1933.  The present-day light rail service (MAX) is operated by TriMet, which also continues to operate several bus routes serving Beaverton and the surrounding communities.  Since early 2009, Beaverton has also been served by [[commuter rail]] service, TriMet's [[Westside Express Service]] (WES), running south to [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]] via [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] and [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]].\n\n===21st century=== <!-- note forward reference to this section in intro -->\n{{Update|date=July 2009}}\n[[File:Southwest corner of The Round - Beaverton, Oregon.JPG|thumb|The Round in 2009]]\n\nIn December 2004, the city and Washington County announced an \"interim plan\" which would lead to Beaverton becoming the second-largest city in Oregon, second only to Portland.<ref name=\"county\">[http://www.co.washington.or.us/deptmts/cao/news/bvtnplan.htm County Board Approves Interim Plan with Beaverton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818231719/http://www.co.washington.or.us/deptmts/cao/news/bvtnplan.htm |date=August 18, 2006 }}, a December 2004 article from the [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]] website</ref>  The \"interim\" plan actually covered a period of more than ten years; from the county's perspective,<ref name=\"county\" /> the plan supported its strategy of having cities and special districts provide urban services.

It is located {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} west of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in the [[Tualatin Valley]] and is among the main cities that make up the [[Portland metropolitan area]]. The city's population was 89,803 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], making it the second-largest city in the county and the sixth-largest city in Oregon.<ref name=factfinder>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST10&prodType=table|title=American Factfinder|author= |date=|work=2010 Census|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=August 4, 2012}}{{dead link|bot=medic|date=April 2020}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Beaverton is an economic center for Washington County along with neighboring [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]]. It surrounds the world headquarters of [[Nike, Inc.]], which occupies [[unincorporated area|unincorporated county land]].\n\nThe hunter\u2013gatherer [[Atfalati]] tribe of the [[Kalapuya]] people inhabited the Tualatin Valley prior to the arrival of European\u2013American settlers in the 19th century. They occupied a village near the Beaverton and Fanno creeks called Chakeipi, which meant \"place of the beaver.\" Early white settlers referred to this village as Beaverdam. Lawrence Hall took up the first land claim in 1847 and established a [[grist mill]]. The entry of a railroad in 1868 spurred growth in the small farming communities and led to the town's incorporation in 1893. \n\n==History==\n===Early settlement===\n\nAccording to ''[[Oregon Geographic Names]]'', Beaverton's name is derived from the settlement's proximity to a large body of water resulting from [[American Beaver|beaver]] dams.\n\nThe area of Tualatin Valley that became Beaverton was originally the home of a Native American tribe known as the ''[[Atfalati]]'', which settlers mispronounced as ''Tualatin''.  The Atfalati population dwindled in the latter part of the 18th century, and the prosperous tribe was no longer dominant in the area by the 19th century when settlers arrived. The tribe named their village Chakeipi, which translates to \"place of the beaver\".<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/history.aspx | title = Beaverton History | publisher = City of Beaverton | accessdate = September 7, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928062919/http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/history.aspx | archivedate = September 28, 2007 | url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nThe natives had a village called ''Chakeipi'', meaning ''Place of the Beaver'', and early settlers referred to it as \"Beaverdam\".  Early settlers include the Hall Family from [[Kentucky]], the Denneys who lived on their claim near present-day Scholls Ferry Road and Hall Blvd, and Orin S. Allen, from western New York.<ref name=\"hist\"/>  Lawrence Hall purchased {{convert|640|acre|km2}} in Beaverdam in 1847 and built a [[grist mill]] with his brother near present-day Walker Road.<ref name=\"hist\" />  His was the first land claim in the area.  He was soon followed by Thomas Denney in 1848, who came to the area and built its first sawmill.  In 1860, a toll [[plank road]] from Portland to Beaverton was completed over a trail called [[Canyon Road]].<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nAfter the [[American Civil War]], numerous other settlers, including Joshua Welch, George Betts, Charles Angel, W. P. Watson, and John Henry, laid out what is now known as Beaverton hoping they could bring a railroad to an area once described as, \"mostly swamps & marshes connected by beaver dams to create what looked like a huge lake.\"  In 1872,  Beaverton's first post office opened in a general store operated by Betts, who also served as the first postmaster of the community.  Betts Street, where the current post office now stands, is named in honor of him.  In 1893, Beaverton, which by that time had a population of 400, was officially incorporated. Alonzo Cady, a local businessman, served as the first mayor. Many major roads in Beaverton are named for these early settlers.\n\n===20th century===\n\nBeaverton was an early home to automobile dealerships. A [[Ford Motor Company]] dealership was established there in 1915; it was purchased by Guy Carr in 1923 and over the years Carr expanded it into several locations throughout Beaverton. There are still several dealerships near the intersection of Walker and Canyon Roads.\n\n[[File:View of Beaverton 1950's (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (10).jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Beaverton in the 1950s]]\nIn the early 1920s, Beaverton was home to [[Premium Picture Productions]], a [[movie studio]] which produced about fifteen films.  The studio site was later converted into [[Bernard's Airport#History|Watt's Field]] and associated aircraft manufacturing facilities.  A second Beaverton airport, [[Bernard's Airport]], was later developed farther north, at the present location of the [[Cedar Hills Crossing]] mall.\n\nThe [[Beaverton City Library|town's first library]] opened in 1925. Originally on the second floor of the Cady building, it has moved repeatedly; in 2000 it was moved to its current location on Hall Boulevard and 5th Street.  A branch location was opened for the first time in June 2010, when the Murray-Scholls location opened near the Murrayhill neighborhood.  The Beaverton libraries and 15 other local libraries participate in the [[Washington County Cooperative Library Services]].\n\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|left|Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway, ca. 1911]]\n\nIn the 1940s, [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|Tualatin Valley Stages]], a division of Portland Stages, Inc., provided limited [[Public transport bus service|bus transit]] service connecting the city with [[downtown Portland]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Stage Fares To Increase|date=August 6, 1947|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=9}}</ref> operating later as a separate company, Tualatin Valley Buses, Inc., through the 1960s. This was one of four privately owned bus companies serving the [[Portland metropolitan area]] which became collectively known as the [[Blue Bus lines (Oregon)|\"Blue Bus\" lines]].  All four companies were replaced in 1970 by [[TriMet]], a then-new regional transit authority,<ref name=\"tri-met action averts\">{{cite news|last=Federman|first=Stan|date=September 2, 1970|title=Tri-Met Action Averts Strike Of Bus Drivers; Agency To Assume Operation Of Four Suburban Blue Lines|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=1}}</ref> which expanded bus service to cover more areas of Beaverton.\n\nIn the late 1970s, a [[light rail]] system was proposed to connect Beaverton to downtown Portland,<ref>{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Nancy|date=November 9, 1979|title=Westside transitway options narrowed to 5|newspaper=[[Beaverton Valley Times|The Valley Times]]|location=Beaverton|page=A-1}}</ref> as part of [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro's]] plans for the region's transportation.

Six stations are located within the city of Beaverton: [[Elmonica / Southwest 170th Avenue|Elmonica/SW 170th Avenue]], [[Merlo Road / Southwest 158th Avenue|Merlo Road/SW 158th]], [[Beaverton Creek (MAX station)|Beaverton Creek]], [[Millikan Way (MAX station)|Millikan Way]], [[Beaverton Central (MAX station)|Beaverton Central]], and the [[Beaverton Transit Center (MAX station)|Beaverton Transit Center]].  All but the last of these (the transit center) are located along [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] formerly owned by [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] and originally by the [[Oregon Electric Railway]], which provided [[interurban]] service through Beaverton until 1933.  The present-day light rail service (MAX) is operated by TriMet, which also continues to operate several bus routes serving Beaverton and the surrounding communities.  Since early 2009, Beaverton has also been served by [[commuter rail]] service, TriMet's [[Westside Express Service]] (WES), running south to [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]] via [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] and [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]].\n\n===21st century=== <!-- note forward reference to this section in intro -->\n{{Update|date=July 2009}}\n[[File:Southwest corner of The Round - Beaverton, Oregon.JPG|thumb|The Round in 2009]]\n\nIn December 2004, the city and Washington County announced an \"interim plan\" which would lead to Beaverton becoming the second-largest city in Oregon, second only to Portland.<ref name=\"county\">[http://www.co.washington.or.us/deptmts/cao/news/bvtnplan.htm County Board Approves Interim Plan with Beaverton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818231719/http://www.co.washington.or.us/deptmts/cao/news/bvtnplan.htm |date=August 18, 2006 }}, a December 2004 article from the [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]] website</ref>  The \"interim\" plan actually covered a period of more than ten years; from the county's perspective,<ref name=\"county\" /> the plan supported its strategy of having cities and special districts provide urban services.

But its full implementation was not considered practicable during the major military operations, and was prevented  by Germany's defeat.<ref>[http://www.dfg.de/pub/generalplan/planung_1.html WISSENSCHAFT - PLANUNG - VERTREIBUNG.] Der Generalplan Ost der Nationalsozialisten\u00b7 Eine Ausstellung der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft \u00a9 2006</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160314101712/http://www.rosalux.de/fileadmin/rls_uploads/pdfs/167eichholtz.pdf Dietrich Eichholtz\u00bbGeneralplan Ost\u00ab zur Versklavung osteurop\u00e4ischer V\u00f6lker.] PDF file, direct download.</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%206247.pdf|title=Generalplan Ost|last=Yad Vashem}}</ref>\n\nThe extermination document for the Slavic people of Eastern Europe did survive the war and has been quoted by [[Yale University|Yale]] historian [[Timothy D.

There are four known versions of it, developed as time went on. After the [[invasion of Poland]], the original blueprint for ''Generalplan Ost'' (GPO) was discussed by the [[RKFDV]] in mid-1940 during the [[Nazi\u2013Soviet population transfers]]. The second known version of GPO was procured by the [[RSHA]] from [[:de:Erhard Wetzel|Erhard Wetzel]] in April 1942. The third version was officially dated June 1942. The final settlement master plan for the East came in from the RKFDV on October 29, 1942. However, after the German [[defeat at Stalingrad]] planning of the colonization in the East was suspended, and the program was gradually abandoned.{{r|WFF_1}} The planning had nonetheless included implementation cost estimates, which ranged from 40 to 67 billion Reichsmarks, the latter figure being close to Germany\u2019s entire GDP for 1941.<ref>Tooze, Adam (2007) The Wages of Destruction p. 472 {{ISBN|978-0-141-00348-1}}</ref> A cost estimate of 45.7 billion Reichsmarks was included in the spring 1942 version of the plan in which more than half the expenditure was to be allocated to land remediation, agricultural development and transport infrastructure. This aspect of the funding was to be provided directly from state sources and the remainder, for urban and industrial development projects, was to be raised on commercial terms. <ref>Tooze p. 473</ref>\n\n==Development and reconstruction of the plan==\nThe body responsible for the ''Generalplan Ost'' was the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]'s [[Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA) under [[Heinrich Himmler]], which commissioned the work. The document was revised several times between June 1941 and spring 1942 as the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|war in the east]] progressed successfully. It was a strictly confidential proposal whose content was known only to those at the top level of the Nazi hierarchy; it was circulated by RSHA to the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]] (''Ostministerium'') in early 1942.{{r|Browning07_240}}\n\nAccording to testimony of SS-''[[Standartenf\u00fchrer]]'' Dr. [[Hans Ehlich]] (one of the witnesses before the [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials]]), the original version of the plan was drafted in 1940. As a high official in the RSHA, Ehlich was the man responsible for the drafting of ''Generalplan Ost'' along with Dr. [[Konrad Meyer]], Chief of the Planning Office of Himmler's [[Reich Commission for the Strengthening of Germandom]]. It had been preceded by the ''[[Ostforschung]]''.{{r|Browning07_240}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1974-079-57, Berlin, Ausstellung \"Planung und Aufbau im Osten\".jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rudolf Hess|Hess]] and [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] visit a [[VoMi]] display of proposed rural German settlements in the East, March 1941.]]\n\nThe preliminary versions were discussed by Heinrich Himmler and his most trusted colleagues even before the outbreak of war. This was mentioned by SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski]] during his [[RuSHA trial|evidence as a prosecution witness]] in the trial of officials of the Race and Settlement Main Office ([[RuSHA]]). According to Bach-Zelewski, Himmler stated openly: \"It is a question of existence, thus it will be a racial struggle of pitiless severity, in the course of which 20 to 30 million Slavs and Jews will perish through military actions and crises of food supply.\"{{r|Browning07_240}} A fundamental change in the plan was introduced on June 24, 1941 \u2013 two days after the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]] \u2013 when the [[Final Solution|'solution']] to the [[Jewish question]] ceased to be part of that particular framework gaining a lethal, autonomous priority.{{r|Browning07_240}}\n\nNearly all the wartime documentation on ''Generalplan Ost'' was deliberately destroyed shortly before Germany's defeat in May 1945,{{r|Schmuhl08_348|Poprzeczny04_186}} and the full proposal has never been found, though several documents refer to it or supplement it.

It would have included the extermination of most [[Slavic peoples|Slavic people]] in Europe. The plan, prepared in the years 1939-1942, was part of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s and the [[Nazi Party|Nazi movement]]'s  ''[[Lebensraum]]'' policy and a fulfilment of the ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' ({{lang-en|Drive towards the East}}) ideology of German expansion to the east, both of them part of the larger plan to establish the [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]].\n\nThe final version of the ''Generalplan Ost'' proposal was divided into two parts; the \"Small Plan\" (''Kleine Planung''), which covered actions carried out in the course of the war; and the \"Big Plan\" (''Grosse Planung''), which described steps to be taken gradually over a period of 25 to 30 years after the war was won. Both plans entailed the policy of ethnic cleansing.{{r|Gellately96|Madajczyk80_105}} As of June 1941, the policy envisaged the deportation of 31 million Slavs to Siberia.{{r|Browning07_240}}\n\nThe ''Generalplan Ost'' proposal offered various percentages of the conquered or colonized people who were targeted for removal and physical destruction; the net effect of which would be to ensure that the conquered territories would become German. In ten years' time, the plan effectively called for the extermination, [[deportation|expulsion]], [[Germanization]] or [[slavery|enslavement]] of most or all [[East Slavs|East]] and [[West Slavs]] living behind the [[front line]]s of East-Central Europe. The \"Small Plan\" was to be put into practice as the Germans conquered the areas to the east of their pre-war borders. In this way the plan for Poland was drawn up at the end of November 1939 and is probably responsible for much of the World War II [[expulsion of Poles by Germany]] (first to colonial district of the [[General Government]] and, from 1942 also to [[Polenlager]]).{{r|TomaszewskiW10_10}} After the war, under the \"Big Plan\", Generalplan Ost  Many people of eastern Europe were to be affected by it. {{r|MisiunasT93_48|GumkowskiL61}}{{r|Schmuhl08_348}} {{r|Gellately96}} In their place up to 10  million of  [[Germans]] would be settled in an extended \"living space\" (''Lebensraum''). Because the number of Germans appeared to be insufficient to populate the vast territories of Central and Eastern Europe, the peoples judged to lie racially between the Germans and the Russians (''Mittelschicht''), namely, Latvians and even Czechs, were also supposed to be resettled there.{{r|Connelly99_1}}\n\n[[File:Krych\u00f3w forced labour camp 1940 (Krowie Bagno).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Prisoners of the [[Krych\u00f3w]] [[Forced labor under German rule during World War II|forced labor camp]] dig irrigation ditches for the new German [[Latifundium|latifundia]] of the General Plan East in 1940. Most of them, [[Polish Jews]] and some [[Romani people|Roma people]], were sent to [[Sobib\u00f3r extermination camp]] afterwards.{{r|Ha\u0144skInfo}}]]\n\nAccording to Nazi intentions, attempts at Germanization were to be undertaken only in the case of those foreign nationals in Central and Eastern Europe who could be considered a desirable element for the future Reich from the point of view of its racial theories. The Plan stipulated that there were to be different methods of treating particular nations and even particular groups within them. Attempts were even made to establish the basic criteria to be used in determining whether a given group lent itself to Germanization. These criteria were to be applied more liberally in the case of nations whose racial material (''rassische Substanz'') and level of cultural development made them more suitable than others for Germanization. The Plan considered that there were a large number of such elements among the Baltic nations. [[:de:Erhard Wetzel|Erhard Wetzel]]<nowiki/> felt that thought should be given to a possible Germanization of the whole of the Estonian nation and a sizable proportion of the Latvians. On the other hand, the Lithuanians seemed less desirable since \"they contained too great an admixture of Slav blood.\" Himmler's view was that \"almost the whole of the Lithuanian nation would have to be deported to the East\".{{r|GumkowskiL61}} Himmler is described to even have had a positive attitude towards germanizing the populations of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], border areas of [[Slovenia]] ([[Upper Carniola]] and Southern [[Styria]]) and [[Bohemia]]-[[Moravia]], but not [[Lithuania]], claiming its population to be of \"inferior race\"{{r|Heinemann99_370}}.\n\nLithuania, Latvia and Estonia were to be deprived of their statehood, while their territories were to be included in the area of German settlement. This meant that Latvia and especially Lithuania would be covered by the deportation plans, though in a somewhat milder form than the expulsion of [[Slavs]] to western Siberia. While the Baltic nations like Estonians would be spared from repressions and physical liquidation (that the Jews and the Poles were experiencing), in the long term the Nazi planners did not foresee their existence as independent entitites and they would be deported as well, with eventual denationalisation; initial designs were for Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to be Germanized within 25 years, however [[Heinrich Himmler]] revised them to 20 years.{{r|Raun02_161}}\n\n[[File:Die 'gro\u00dfz\u00fcgigste Umsiedlungsaktion' with Poland superimposed, 1939.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Nazi propaganda poster of the [[Third Reich]] in 1939 (dark grey) after the [[Invasion of Poland|conquest of Poland]].

The outline of Poland (here superimposed in red) was missing from the original poster.{{r|Nicholas11_194}}]]\n\nIn 1941 it was decided to destroy the [[Poles|Polish nation]] completely and the German leadership decided that in 15\u201320 years the Polish state under German occupation was to be fully cleared of any ethnic Poles and settled by German colonists.{{r|Berghahn99_15|p=32}} A majority of them, now [[Intelligenzaktion|deprived of their leaders and most of their intelligentsia]] (through mass murder, [[cultural genocide|destruction of culture]], the ban on education above the absolutely basic level, and [[Kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany|kidnapping of children]] for [[Germanization]]), would have to be deported to regions in the East and scattered over as wide an area of Western Siberia as possible. According to the plan this would result in their [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] by the local populations, which would cause the Poles to vanish as a nation.{{r|Connelly99_1}}\n\nAccording to plan, by 1952 only about 3\u20134 million 'non-Germanized' Poles (all of them peasants) were to be left residing in the former Poland. Those of them who would still not Germanize were to be forbidden to marry, the existing ban on any medical help to Poles in Germany would be extended, and eventually Poles would cease to exist.  Experiments in mass sterilization in concentration camps may also have been intended for use on the populations.{{r|Weinberg05_24}}  The ''[[Wehrbauer]]'', or soldier-peasants, would be settled in a fortified line to prevent civilization reanimating beyond the [[Ural Mountains]] and threatening Germany.{{r|Cecil72_19}}  \"[[Blood and soil|Tough peasant races]]\" would serve as a bulwark against attack{{r|Spiegel20110527}} \u2014 however, it was not very far east of the \"frontier\" that [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere#Projected territorial extent|the westernmost reaches within continental Asia]] of the Third Reich's major Axis partner, [[Imperial Japan]]'s own [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] would have existed, had a complete defeat of the Soviet Union occurred.\n\nThe seizure of food supplies in Ukraine brought about starvation, as it was intended to do to depopulate that region for German settlement.{{sfnp|Berkhoff|2004|p=45}} Soldiers were told to steel their hearts against starving women and children, because every bit of food given to them was stolen from the German people, endangering their nourishment.{{sfnp|Berkhoff|2004|p=166}}\n\n[[File:Pia\u015bnica before execution.jpg|thumb|Execution of Polish intelligentsia during the [[Massacres in Pia\u015bnica|mass murders in Pia\u015bnica]]]]\nWidely varying policies were envisioned by the creators of ''Generalplan Ost'', and some of them were actually implemented by Germany in regards to the different Slavic territories and ethnic groups. For example, by August\u2013September 1939 ([[Operation Tannenberg]] followed by the [[German AB-Aktion operation in Poland|A-B Aktion]] in 1940), [[Einsatzgruppen]] death squads and concentration camps had been employed to deal with the Polish elite, while the small number of Czech intelligentsia were allowed to emigrate overseas.

As such, it was intended to be a part of [[New Order (Nazism)|the New Order]] in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/lebensraum|title=Lebensraum|website=encyclopedia.ushmm.org|language=en|access-date=2019-06-23}}</ref>\n\nThe master plan was a work in progress. There are four known versions of it, developed as time went on. After the [[invasion of Poland]], the original blueprint for ''Generalplan Ost'' (GPO) was discussed by the [[RKFDV]] in mid-1940 during the [[Nazi\u2013Soviet population transfers]]. The second known version of GPO was procured by the [[RSHA]] from [[:de:Erhard Wetzel|Erhard Wetzel]] in April 1942. The third version was officially dated June 1942. The final settlement master plan for the East came in from the RKFDV on October 29, 1942. However, after the German [[defeat at Stalingrad]] planning of the colonization in the East was suspended, and the program was gradually abandoned.{{r|WFF_1}} The planning had nonetheless included implementation cost estimates, which ranged from 40 to 67 billion Reichsmarks, the latter figure being close to Germany\u2019s entire GDP for 1941.<ref>Tooze, Adam (2007) The Wages of Destruction p. 472 {{ISBN|978-0-141-00348-1}}</ref> A cost estimate of 45.7 billion Reichsmarks was included in the spring 1942 version of the plan in which more than half the expenditure was to be allocated to land remediation, agricultural development and transport infrastructure. This aspect of the funding was to be provided directly from state sources and the remainder, for urban and industrial development projects, was to be raised on commercial terms. <ref>Tooze p. 473</ref>\n\n==Development and reconstruction of the plan==\nThe body responsible for the ''Generalplan Ost'' was the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]'s [[Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA) under [[Heinrich Himmler]], which commissioned the work. The document was revised several times between June 1941 and spring 1942 as the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|war in the east]] progressed successfully. It was a strictly confidential proposal whose content was known only to those at the top level of the Nazi hierarchy; it was circulated by RSHA to the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]] (''Ostministerium'') in early 1942.{{r|Browning07_240}}\n\nAccording to testimony of SS-''[[Standartenf\u00fchrer]]'' Dr. [[Hans Ehlich]] (one of the witnesses before the [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials]]), the original version of the plan was drafted in 1940. As a high official in the RSHA, Ehlich was the man responsible for the drafting of ''Generalplan Ost'' along with Dr. [[Konrad Meyer]], Chief of the Planning Office of Himmler's [[Reich Commission for the Strengthening of Germandom]]. It had been preceded by the ''[[Ostforschung]]''.{{r|Browning07_240}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1974-079-57, Berlin, Ausstellung \"Planung und Aufbau im Osten\".jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rudolf Hess|Hess]] and [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] visit a [[VoMi]] display of proposed rural German settlements in the East, March 1941.]]\n\nThe preliminary versions were discussed by Heinrich Himmler and his most trusted colleagues even before the outbreak of war. This was mentioned by SS-''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski]] during his [[RuSHA trial|evidence as a prosecution witness]] in the trial of officials of the Race and Settlement Main Office ([[RuSHA]]). According to Bach-Zelewski, Himmler stated openly: \"It is a question of existence, thus it will be a racial struggle of pitiless severity, in the course of which 20 to 30 million Slavs and Jews will perish through military actions and crises of food supply.\"{{r|Browning07_240}} A fundamental change in the plan was introduced on June 24, 1941 \u2013 two days after the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]] \u2013 when the [[Final Solution|'solution']] to the [[Jewish question]] ceased to be part of that particular framework gaining a lethal, autonomous priority.{{r|Browning07_240}}\n\nNearly all the wartime documentation on ''Generalplan Ost'' was deliberately destroyed shortly before Germany's defeat in May 1945,{{r|Schmuhl08_348|Poprzeczny04_186}} and the full proposal has never been found, though several documents refer to it or supplement it. Nonetheless, most of the plan's essential elements have been reconstructed from related [[memorandum|memos]], [[abstract (summary)|abstract]]s and other documents.{{r|Gellately96}}\n\nA major document which enabled historians to accurately reconstruct the ''Generalplan Ost'' was a memorandum released on April 27, 1942, by [[:de:Erhard Wetzel|Erhard Wetzel]], director of the [[NSDAP Office of Racial Policy]], entitled \"Opinion and thoughts on the master plan for the East of the Reichsf\u00fchrer SS\".{{sfnp|Wetzel|1942|}} Wetzel's memorandum was a broad elaboration of the ''Generalplan Ost'' proposal.{{r|WeissW10_69|Gellately96}} It came to light only in 1957.{{sfnp|Madajczyk|1962|}}\n\nThe extermination document for the Slavic people of Eastern Europe did survive the war and has been quoted by [[Yale University|Yale]] historian [[Timothy D.

It would have included the extermination of most [[Slavic peoples|Slavic people]] in Europe. The plan, prepared in the years 1939-1942, was part of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s and the [[Nazi Party|Nazi movement]]'s  ''[[Lebensraum]]'' policy and a fulfilment of the ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' ({{lang-en|Drive towards the East}}) ideology of German expansion to the east, both of them part of the larger plan to establish the [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order]].\n\nThe final version of the ''Generalplan Ost'' proposal was divided into two parts; the \"Small Plan\" (''Kleine Planung''), which covered actions carried out in the course of the war; and the \"Big Plan\" (''Grosse Planung''), which described steps to be taken gradually over a period of 25 to 30 years after the war was won. Both plans entailed the policy of ethnic cleansing.{{r|Gellately96|Madajczyk80_105}} As of June 1941, the policy envisaged the deportation of 31 million Slavs to Siberia.{{r|Browning07_240}}\n\nThe ''Generalplan Ost'' proposal offered various percentages of the conquered or colonized people who were targeted for removal and physical destruction; the net effect of which would be to ensure that the conquered territories would become German. In ten years' time, the plan effectively called for the extermination, [[deportation|expulsion]], [[Germanization]] or [[slavery|enslavement]] of most or all [[East Slavs|East]] and [[West Slavs]] living behind the [[front line]]s of East-Central Europe. The \"Small Plan\" was to be put into practice as the Germans conquered the areas to the east of their pre-war borders. In this way the plan for Poland was drawn up at the end of November 1939 and is probably responsible for much of the World War II [[expulsion of Poles by Germany]] (first to colonial district of the [[General Government]] and, from 1942 also to [[Polenlager]]).{{r|TomaszewskiW10_10}} After the war, under the \"Big Plan\", Generalplan Ost  Many people of eastern Europe were to be affected by it. {{r|MisiunasT93_48|GumkowskiL61}}{{r|Schmuhl08_348}} {{r|Gellately96}} In their place up to 10  million of  [[Germans]] would be settled in an extended \"living space\" (''Lebensraum''). Because the number of Germans appeared to be insufficient to populate the vast territories of Central and Eastern Europe, the peoples judged to lie racially between the Germans and the Russians (''Mittelschicht''), namely, Latvians and even Czechs, were also supposed to be resettled there.{{r|Connelly99_1}}\n\n[[File:Krych\u00f3w forced labour camp 1940 (Krowie Bagno).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Prisoners of the [[Krych\u00f3w]] [[Forced labor under German rule during World War II|forced labor camp]] dig irrigation ditches for the new German [[Latifundium|latifundia]] of the General Plan East in 1940. Most of them, [[Polish Jews]] and some [[Romani people|Roma people]], were sent to [[Sobib\u00f3r extermination camp]] afterwards.{{r|Ha\u0144skInfo}}]]\n\nAccording to Nazi intentions, attempts at Germanization were to be undertaken only in the case of those foreign nationals in Central and Eastern Europe who could be considered a desirable element for the future Reich from the point of view of its racial theories. The Plan stipulated that there were to be different methods of treating particular nations and even particular groups within them. Attempts were even made to establish the basic criteria to be used in determining whether a given group lent itself to Germanization. These criteria were to be applied more liberally in the case of nations whose racial material (''rassische Substanz'') and level of cultural development made them more suitable than others for Germanization. The Plan considered that there were a large number of such elements among the Baltic nations. [[:de:Erhard Wetzel|Erhard Wetzel]]<nowiki/> felt that thought should be given to a possible Germanization of the whole of the Estonian nation and a sizable proportion of the Latvians. On the other hand, the Lithuanians seemed less desirable since \"they contained too great an admixture of Slav blood.\" Himmler's view was that \"almost the whole of the Lithuanian nation would have to be deported to the East\".{{r|GumkowskiL61}} Himmler is described to even have had a positive attitude towards germanizing the populations of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], border areas of [[Slovenia]] ([[Upper Carniola]] and Southern [[Styria]]) and [[Bohemia]]-[[Moravia]], but not [[Lithuania]], claiming its population to be of \"inferior race\"{{r|Heinemann99_370}}.\n\nLithuania, Latvia and Estonia were to be deprived of their statehood, while their territories were to be included in the area of German settlement. This meant that Latvia and especially Lithuania would be covered by the deportation plans, though in a somewhat milder form than the expulsion of [[Slavs]] to western Siberia. While the Baltic nations like Estonians would be spared from repressions and physical liquidation (that the Jews and the Poles were experiencing), in the long term the Nazi planners did not foresee their existence as independent entitites and they would be deported as well, with eventual denationalisation; initial designs were for Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to be Germanized within 25 years, however [[Heinrich Himmler]] revised them to 20 years.{{r|Raun02_161}}\n\n[[File:Die 'gro\u00dfz\u00fcgigste Umsiedlungsaktion' with Poland superimposed, 1939.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Nazi propaganda poster of the [[Third Reich]] in 1939 (dark grey) after the [[Invasion of Poland|conquest of Poland]].

The outline of Poland (here superimposed in red) was missing from the original poster.{{r|Nicholas11_194}}]]\n\nIn 1941 it was decided to destroy the [[Poles|Polish nation]] completely and the German leadership decided that in 15\u201320 years the Polish state under German occupation was to be fully cleared of any ethnic Poles and settled by German colonists.{{r|Berghahn99_15|p=32}} A majority of them, now [[Intelligenzaktion|deprived of their leaders and most of their intelligentsia]] (through mass murder, [[cultural genocide|destruction of culture]], the ban on education above the absolutely basic level, and [[Kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany|kidnapping of children]] for [[Germanization]]), would have to be deported to regions in the East and scattered over as wide an area of Western Siberia as possible. According to the plan this would result in their [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] by the local populations, which would cause the Poles to vanish as a nation.{{r|Connelly99_1}}\n\nAccording to plan, by 1952 only about 3\u20134 million 'non-Germanized' Poles (all of them peasants) were to be left residing in the former Poland. Those of them who would still not Germanize were to be forbidden to marry, the existing ban on any medical help to Poles in Germany would be extended, and eventually Poles would cease to exist.  Experiments in mass sterilization in concentration camps may also have been intended for use on the populations.{{r|Weinberg05_24}}  The ''[[Wehrbauer]]'', or soldier-peasants, would be settled in a fortified line to prevent civilization reanimating beyond the [[Ural Mountains]] and threatening Germany.{{r|Cecil72_19}}  \"[[Blood and soil|Tough peasant races]]\" would serve as a bulwark against attack{{r|Spiegel20110527}} \u2014 however, it was not very far east of the \"frontier\" that [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere#Projected territorial extent|the westernmost reaches within continental Asia]] of the Third Reich's major Axis partner, [[Imperial Japan]]'s own [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] would have existed, had a complete defeat of the Soviet Union occurred.\n\nThe seizure of food supplies in Ukraine brought about starvation, as it was intended to do to depopulate that region for German settlement.{{sfnp|Berkhoff|2004|p=45}} Soldiers were told to steel their hearts against starving women and children, because every bit of food given to them was stolen from the German people, endangering their nourishment.{{sfnp|Berkhoff|2004|p=166}}\n\n[[File:Pia\u015bnica before execution.jpg|thumb|Execution of Polish intelligentsia during the [[Massacres in Pia\u015bnica|mass murders in Pia\u015bnica]]]]\nWidely varying policies were envisioned by the creators of ''Generalplan Ost'', and some of them were actually implemented by Germany in regards to the different Slavic territories and ethnic groups.

There are five teachers and three coaches, some of whom live on campus and act as residential supervisors.\n\n==History==\n\nCanada Prep Academy began in the former Merritton High School building, once the community high school until its closure due to low enrollment in 1999. The building was purchased by Pinehurst School in 2001, and operated as Pinehurst until November 2013. Canada Prep Academy, then Canada Prep Football Academy, was founded in January 2012 as a football program which aimed to fill the void created by the closure of the similar but controversial Niagara Football Academy. The head coach of the Niagara Spartans, Geoff McArthur, came to lead the Canada Prep Raiders, as they were now called. Canada Prep Academy partnered with Pinehurst School to offer its academics, and operated a separate wing and campus of Pinehurst. This partnership remained until Pinehurst ceased operations due to its own low enrollment numbers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCanada Prep Academy, the school, was founded in 2014 to allow the program to have control over its own academics. Its original teacher, Patrick Fife, became principal and oversaw the process of becoming inspected by the Ministry of Education. The original Canada Prep logo, a red football with a white maple leaf, became only one part of a larger school crest that emphasizes academics, university preparation, and fitness.\n\nIn January 2015, Canada Prep Academy announced that it was relocating out of the city to the countryside where there was room to grow and expand.\n\n==Academics==\n\nCanada Prep Academy graduates earn the [[Ontario Secondary School Diploma]] (OSSD), while also being prepared for the eligibility requirements of American universities. The majority of courses offered are [[NCAA]] core courses of English, math, science, and social studies. Class sizes usually vary between 8 and 12 students, and teaching approaches consist of hands-on and active learning opportunities that are geared towards boys' learning styles. Students also have opportunities to prepare for the [[SAT]] and [[ACT (test)|ACT]], as well as get one-on-one help and tutoring during evening study hall.\n\nCanada Prep Academy is a member of the Ontario Federation of Independent Schools.\n\n==Athletics==\n\nCanada Prep Academy specializes in American football and provides a [[Varsity team|varsity]] football team that travels to the United States on weekends from late August to early November in order to compete against American high schools. Notable opponents include [[St. Mary's Preparatory School|Orchard Lake-St. Mary's Preparatory School]], [[Brother Rice High School (Michigan)|Brother Rice High School]], [[Saint Ignatius High School (Cleveland)|St. Ignatius High School]] in Cleveland, [[St. Edward High School (Lakewood, Ohio)|St. Edward High School]] near Cleveland, and [[Steubenville High School]], among others.\n\nUnlike other Canadian high schools, whose coaches are usually teachers or staff members with other roles at the school, Canada Prep Academy employs an experienced coaching staff of coaches with backgrounds in the [[NCAA]], [[NFL]], or [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]. Previous Head Coach Geoff McArthur is a former All-American wide receiver from [[University of California, Berkeley]] who previously coached at [[Lindenwood University]], a Division II school in [[Missouri]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://247sports.com/Article/Canada-Prep-Football-Academy-Set-For-Year-Two-30548985|title=Canada Prep Football Academy Set For Year Two|last=Wiltfong|first=Steve|date=2014-08-25|website=247Sports|access-date=2016-05-21}}</ref>\n\nIn the off-season, the football focus continues as students receive daily training in fitness, speed/agility, and football skills.\n\n==Recruiting==\n\nCanada Prep Academy prepares student-athletes for [[NCAA]] and [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|CIS]] entrance requirements, and offers [[SAT]] and [[ACT (test)|ACT]] tutoring.

Boarding is akin to a university setting.  Students live with a roommate, and washrooms/showers, laundry facilities, and a kitchen are all located on site. Students are served three meals a day on weekdays, and a large sized brunch and dinner on weekends. Boarding students also used to have evening access to the gymnasium and fitness centre.

Canada Prep Academy partnered with Pinehurst School to offer its academics, and operated a separate wing and campus of Pinehurst. This partnership remained until Pinehurst ceased operations due to its own low enrollment numbers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCanada Prep Academy, the school, was founded in 2014 to allow the program to have control over its own academics. Its original teacher, Patrick Fife, became principal and oversaw the process of becoming inspected by the Ministry of Education. The original Canada Prep logo, a red football with a white maple leaf, became only one part of a larger school crest that emphasizes academics, university preparation, and fitness.\n\nIn January 2015, Canada Prep Academy announced that it was relocating out of the city to the countryside where there was room to grow and expand. \n\n==Academics==\n\nCanada Prep Academy graduates earn the [[Ontario Secondary School Diploma]] (OSSD), while also being prepared for the eligibility requirements of American universities. The majority of courses offered are [[NCAA]] core courses of English, math, science, and social studies. Class sizes usually vary between 8 and 12 students, and teaching approaches consist of hands-on and active learning opportunities that are geared towards boys' learning styles. Students also have opportunities to prepare for the [[SAT]] and [[ACT (test)|ACT]], as well as get one-on-one help and tutoring during evening study hall.\n\nCanada Prep Academy is a member of the Ontario Federation of Independent Schools.\n\n==Athletics==\n\nCanada Prep Academy specializes in American football and provides a [[Varsity team|varsity]] football team that travels to the United States on weekends from late August to early November in order to compete against American high schools. Notable opponents include [[St. Mary's Preparatory School|Orchard Lake-St. Mary's Preparatory School]], [[Brother Rice High School (Michigan)|Brother Rice High School]], [[Saint Ignatius High School (Cleveland)|St. Ignatius High School]] in Cleveland, [[St. Edward High School (Lakewood, Ohio)|St. Edward High School]] near Cleveland, and [[Steubenville High School]], among others.\n\nUnlike other Canadian high schools, whose coaches are usually teachers or staff members with other roles at the school, Canada Prep Academy employs an experienced coaching staff of coaches with backgrounds in the [[NCAA]], [[NFL]], or [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]. Previous Head Coach Geoff McArthur is a former All-American wide receiver from [[University of California, Berkeley]] who previously coached at [[Lindenwood University]], a Division II school in [[Missouri]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://247sports.com/Article/Canada-Prep-Football-Academy-Set-For-Year-Two-30548985|title=Canada Prep Football Academy Set For Year Two|last=Wiltfong|first=Steve|date=2014-08-25|website=247Sports|access-date=2016-05-21}}</ref>\n\nIn the off-season, the football focus continues as students receive daily training in fitness, speed/agility, and football skills.\n\n==Recruiting==\n\nCanada Prep Academy prepares student-athletes for [[NCAA]] and [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|CIS]] entrance requirements, and offers [[SAT]] and [[ACT (test)|ACT]] tutoring. The school visited by Division I coaches from universities such as Nevada, Ohio State, Buffalo, Mississippi State, Fordham, Wisconsin, and more.<ref name=\":0\" /> One current student, Neville Gallimore, is the first international player to attend The Opening and to be invited to the US Army All-American Bowl.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://floridastate.247sports.com/Article/Neville-Gallimore-Has-Top-Notch-Official-To-FSU-32201743|title=Top50 DT Gallimore Has \"Top-Notch\" Official To FSU|last=Wiltfong|first=Steve|date=2014-10-20|website=Noles247|access-date=2016-05-21}}</ref> Gallimore has earned 28 Division I offers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==School life==\n\nCanada Prep Academy offers on-campus boarding in former classrooms that have been rezoned and converted to dormitories. Boarding is akin to a university setting.  Students live with a roommate, and washrooms/showers, laundry facilities, and a kitchen are all located on site. Students are served three meals a day on weekdays, and a large sized brunch and dinner on weekends. Boarding students also used to have evening access to the gymnasium and fitness centre. Students are taken on a trip to Niagara Falls.\n\n===Notable students and alumni===\n*[[Neville Gallimore (American football)|Neville Gallimore]], Class of 2015 student with 28 Division I offers\n*Troy Hansen, Class of 2015 with full offer to [[University of North Dakota|North Dakota]]\n*Brendan O'Leary-Orange, Class of 2014, commit to [[University of Nevada-Reno|Nevada]]\n*[[Brady Oliveira]], Class of 2015, commit to [[University of North Dakota|North Dakota]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winnipegsun.com/2014/11/05/oliveira-and-raiders-out-to-end-crusaders-high-school-football-reign|title=Oliveira and Raiders out to end Crusaders high school football reign|last=Penton|first=Kirk|date=2014-11-05|website=Winnipeg Sun|access-date=2016-05-21}}</ref>\n*Andrew Peirson, [[Gannon University]] college football player\n*[[Justin Vaughn]], [[Fordham University]] college football player\n*Jonathan Zamora, [[Seton Hill University]] college football player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.canadaprepacademy.ca Canada Prep Academy Official Web site]\n*[http://www.hudl.com/team/138515 Canada Prep Academy Hudl]\n*[http://www.ofis.ca Ontario Federation of Independent Schools]\n\n[[Category:Boys' schools in Canada]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2014]]\n[[Category:High schools in Niagara Region]]\n[[Category:2014 establishments in Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "Joeykai", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Prep_Academy"}

The team was led by [[Lincoln Riley]], in his third year as head coach. They played their home games at [[Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma]]. They are a charter member of the [[Big 12 Conference football|Big 12 Conference]].\n\nOklahoma began the year ranked fourth in the [[AP Poll]] and were the overwhelming favorites to repeat as Big 12 Conference champions. The Sooners won their first seven games of the season before being upset on the road by [[2019 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State]]. On November 16, Oklahoma overcame a 25-point deficit to beat previously-undefeated [[2019 Baylor Bears football team|Baylor]], 34\u201331. Oklahoma finished conference play tied with Baylor for the best record in the conference with an 8\u20131 record, earning them each a spot in the [[2019 Big 12 Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]]. There, they defeated Baylor a second time, this time by a score of 30\u201323 in overtime, to win Oklahoma's fifth consecutive and 13th overall Big 12 title. In the final [[College Football Playoff]] rankings of the season, Oklahoma was ranked fourth, earning them a spot in the [[2019 Peach Bowl]], in a national semi-final game against first-seeded [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]]. This was Oklahoma's third consecutive and fourth overall CFP bid. The Sooners fell to the Tigers, 63\u201328, to end the season at 12\u20132, and were ranked seventh in the final AP Poll.\n\nThe Sooners were led on offense by quarterback [[Jalen Hurts]], a graduate transfer from [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] that had previously played in three separate College Football Playoffs with the Crimson Tide. Hurts finished in second in the conference in both passing yards and rushing yards, and led the conference with 53 total touchdowns. He finished in second in voting for the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Wide receiver [[CeeDee Lamb]] was a [[2019 College Football All-America Team|consensus All-American]]. Hurts, Lamb, and center [[Creed Humphrey]] were named [[2019 All-Big 12 Conference football team|first-team all-conference]]. On defense, the team was led by first-team all-conference linebacker [[Kenneth Murray (American football)|Kenneth Murray]].\n\n==Previous season==\nThe Sooners finished the season 12\u20131, 8\u20131 in Big 12 play. Finishing with the best record in conference play the Sooners clinched a berth in the [[2018 Big 12 Championship Game|conference championship game]] where they defeated Texas 39\u201327 to win their 12th Big 12 Championship. Oklahoma was selected as the fourth seed to play in the 2018 College Football playoff against first seed [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama Crimson Tide]] in the [[2018 Orange Bowl]], which ended up being a 34\u201345 loss.\n\n==Preseason==\n\n===Award watch lists=== \n<small>Listed in the order that they were released</small>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Oklahoma Sooners|Award|Player|Position|Year}}\n|-\n|[[Lott Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lottimpacttrophy.org/2019-watch-list/|title=2019 LOTT IMPACT TROPHY WATCH LIST CANDIDATES \u2013 Lott IMPACT Trophy|publisher=}}</ref>\n|[[Kenneth Murray (American football)|Kenneth Murray]]\n|LB\n|JR\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Maxwell Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2019-maxwell-award-watch-list/|title=2019 Maxwell Award Watch List \u2013 Maxwell Football Club|date=15 July 2019|publisher=}}</ref>\n|[[Jalen Hurts]]\n|QB\n|GS\n|- \n|[[CeeDee Lamb]]\n|WR\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Bednarik Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2019-bednarik-award-watch-list/|title=2019 Bednarik Award Watch List \u2013 Maxwell Football Club|date=15 July 2019|publisher=}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR \n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Fred Biletnikoff Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Biletnikoff Award Preseason Watch List Released|url=http://biletnikoffaward.com/2019-biletnikoff-award-watch-list|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|Grant Calcaterra\n|TE\n|JR\n|- \n|CeeDee Lamb\n|WR\n|JR\n|-\n|[[John Mackey Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 John Mackey Award Preseason Watch List Released|url=http://www.johnmackeyaward.com/uploads/3/4/7/9/34791900/2019_john_mackey_award_preseason_watch_list_-_final_7-18-19.pdf|date=July 19, 2019|accessdate=July 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|Grant Calcaterra\n|TE\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Rimington Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Rimington Trophy Press Release|url=http://www.rimingtontrophy.com/news/?article_id=109|date=July 19, 2019|accessdate=July 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|[[Creed Humphrey]]\n|C\n|RS SO\n|-\n|[[Butkus Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Butkus Award Preseason Watch List Released|url=http://thebutkusaward.com/watchlist/view.aspx?t=c|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=July 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR\n|- \n|rowspan=2|[[Outland Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Outland Trophy Award Watchlist Unveiled|url=http://www.sportswriters.net/fwaa/news/2019/outland190723.html|date=July 23, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|Creed Humphrey\n|OL\n|RS SO\n|-\n|[[Neville Gallimore]]\n|DL\n|RS SR\n|-\n|[[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Bronko Nagurski Trophy Watchlist Unveiled|url=http://www.sportswriters.net/fwaa/news/2019/nagurski190723.html|date=July 23, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award|Dodd Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dodd Trophy Announces 2019 Preseason Watch List|url=http://www.thedoddtrophy.com/the-dodd-trophy-announces-2019-preseason-watch-list/|date=July 25, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n| [[Lincoln Riley]]\n| HC\n| \u2013\n|-\n|[[Wuerffel Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Wuerffel Trophy Unveils 2019 Watch List|url=https://www.wuerffeltrophy.org/post/wuerffel-trophy-unveils-watch-list-for-2019|date=July 25, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Walter Camp Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter Camp Foundation Announces 2019 Player of the Year Preseason Watch List|url=https://waltercamp.org/walter-camp-foundation-announces-2019-player-of-the-year-preseason-watch-list/|date=July 26, 2019|accessdate=July 26, 2019}}</ref>\n|Jalen Hurts \n|QB\n|GS\n|-\n|rowspan=4|[[Earl Campbell Tyler Rose Award]]\n|Kennedy Brooks\n|RB\n|RS SO\n|-\n|CeeDee Lamb\n|WR\n|JR\n|-\n|Jalen Hurts\n|QB\n|GS\n|-\n|Tanner Mordecai \n|QB\n|RS FR\n|-\n|[[Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Golden Arm Award Announces 2019 Class of Candidates|url=http://www.goldenarmfoundation.com/golden-arm-award-announces-2019-class-candidates/|date=August 19, 2019|accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|Jalen Hurts\n|QB\n|GS\n|}\n\n===Big 12 media days===\nThe 2019 Big 12 media days were held July 15\u201316, 2019 in [[Frisco, Texas]].

The team was led by [[Lincoln Riley]], in his third year as head coach. They played their home games at [[Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma]]. They are a charter member of the [[Big 12 Conference football|Big 12 Conference]].\n\nOklahoma began the year ranked fourth in the [[AP Poll]] and were the overwhelming favorites to repeat as Big 12 Conference champions. The Sooners won their first seven games of the season before being upset on the road by [[2019 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State]]. On November 16, Oklahoma overcame a 25-point deficit to beat previously-undefeated [[2019 Baylor Bears football team|Baylor]], 34\u201331. Oklahoma finished conference play tied with Baylor for the best record in the conference with an 8\u20131 record, earning them each a spot in the [[2019 Big 12 Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]]. There, they defeated Baylor a second time, this time by a score of 30\u201323 in overtime, to win Oklahoma's fifth consecutive and 13th overall Big 12 title. In the final [[College Football Playoff]] rankings of the season, Oklahoma was ranked fourth, earning them a spot in the [[2019 Peach Bowl]], in a national semi-final game against first-seeded [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]]. This was Oklahoma's third consecutive and fourth overall CFP bid. The Sooners fell to the Tigers, 63\u201328, to end the season at 12\u20132, and were ranked seventh in the final AP Poll. \n\nThe Sooners were led on offense by quarterback [[Jalen Hurts]], a graduate transfer from [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] that had previously played in three separate College Football Playoffs with the Crimson Tide.
