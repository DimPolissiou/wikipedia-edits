The character of Vicky is the sisters' real-life aunty and the character of Debbie, their real-life mother. The writers discovered when they reached adulthood that Vicky was born biologically male and had transitioned before they were born. They began to hear stories from their mother, Vicky, and Vicky's mother about her journey from male to female, with all the trials and tribulations that ensued.

The two visit the Golden Girl club in the backstreets of Soho where Vicky goes on to find work as a drag queen, alongside her various jobs in the [[sex work]] industry; all in aid to save up for her [[sex reassignment surgery]]. Drugs and other illegal acts ensue until an encounter with a prospective client goes wrong and Vicky finds herself in prison, at the mercy of abusive prison officers and fellow inmates. Throughout all of this, Vicky manages to find love in the form of Sid, whom she met at the Golden Girl club earlier in the story, and mends her tumultuous relationship with her mother. The play ends five years from when we first meet Vicky and her friends and family. Vicky has had her long-awaited surgery and has settled down with Sid, and the closing scene ends with the revelation that best friend Debbie is expecting a baby, and Vicky is to become an aunty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://playdeadpress.bigcartel.com/product/call-me-vicky|title=Call Me Vicky|last=Press|first=Playdead|website=Playdead Press|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Bland|first=Nicola|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Call_Me_Vicky.html?id=tUt2wgEACAAJ|title=Call Me Vicky|last2=Bland|first2=Stacey|date=2019-02-19|publisher=Playdead Press|isbn=978-1-910067-74-1|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Theatrical Production ==\n''Call Me Vicky'' was first performed at The Pleasance Theatre, London from February to March 2019 as part of The Pleasance Theatre\u2019s #YouWillKnowTheirNames season.

The inker downloads them, prints them in blue, inks the pages, scans them in and loads the finished pages back on the FTP site for the company to download. While this procedure saves a company time and shipping costs, it requires artists to spend money for computer equipment.\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}\nFor a long time, inking was considered a minor part of the comics industry, only marginally above [[letterer|lettering]] in the pecking order. In the early days of comic books, many publishers hired \"packagers\" to produce entire books. Although some \"star\" creators' names (such as [[Joe Simon|Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby|Kirby]] or [[Bob Kane]]) usually appeared at the beginning of each story, the publisher generally didn't care which artists worked on the book. Packagers instituted an [[assembly line]] style method of creating books, using top talents like Kirby to create the look and pace of the story and then handing off the inking, lettering, and coloring to largely anonymous \u2014 and low-paid \u2014 creators to finish it.\n\nDeadline pressures and a desire for consistency in the look of a feature led to having one artist pencil a feature while one or more other artists inked it. At [[Marvel Comics]], where the pencil artist was responsible for the frame-by-frame breakdown of the story plot, an artist who was skilled in story-telling would be encouraged to do as many books as possible, maximizing the number of books he could do by leaving the inking to others. By contrast, at other companies where the writer did the frame-by-frame breakdown in script form, more artists inked or even lettered their own work. [[Joe Kubert]] and [[Jim Aparo]] would usually pencil, ink and letter, considering the placing of word balloons as an integral part of the page, and artists such as [[Bill Everett]], [[Steve Ditko]], [[Kurt Schaffenberger]], [[Murphy Anderson]], and [[Nick Cardy]] almost always inked their own work (and sometimes the work of other pencilers as well). Most artists, however \u2014 even experienced inkers of their own work like [[Lou Fine]], [[Reed Crandall]], [[Will Eisner]], and [[Alex Toth]] \u2014 at times hired or allowed other artists to ink their drawings. Some artists could make more money by pencilling more pages and leaving the inking to others; different artists with different working methods might find it more profitable to both pencil and ink, as they could place less information and detail in the pencil drawings if they were inking it themselves and could put that detail in at the inking stage.\n\nDue to the absence of credits on most Golden Age comic books, many inkers of that period are largely forgotten. For those whose names are known, it is difficult to compile r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Inkers like [[Chic Stone]], [[George Papp]], and [[Marvin Stein]] embellished thousands of pages during that era, most of which are still unidentified.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Marvel Comics began giving the inker credit in each of their publications. This allowed finishers like [[Dick Ayers]], [[Joe Sinnott]], [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]], [[John Severin]], [[Syd Shores]], and [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]] to earn a reputation as inkers as well as pencillers. In addition, penciller-inker teams like Kirby and Sinnott, [[Curt Swan]] and [[Murphy Anderson]], [[Gene Colan]] and Palmer, and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] captured the attentions of comic book fandom.\n\nIn 2008 Marvel and DC inker [[Bob Almond]] founded the [[Inkwell Awards]], which is an award established to celebrate the craft of inking and to lift the profile of the art in general. The [[Inkwell Awards]] has gained much publicity and counts notable inkers such as Joe Sinnott, [[Nathan Massengill]] and [[Tim Townsend]] as members and associates.\n\n== Notable inkers ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dan Adkins]]\n* [[Mike Allred]]\n* [[Murphy Anderson]]\n* [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]]\n* [[Brett Breeding]]\n* [[Vince Colletta]]\n* [[Vince Deporter]]\n* [[Tony DeZuniga]]\n* [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]]\n* [[Joe Giella]]\n* [[Dick Giordano]]\n* [[Al Gordon (comics)|Al Gordon]]\n* [[Dan Green (artist)|Dan Green]]\n* [[Mark Irwin]]\n* [[Billy Graham (comics)|Billy Graham]]\n* [[Klaus Janson]]\n* [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]]\n* [[Paul Neary]]\n* [[Kevin Nowlan]]\n* [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]]\n* [[Jimmy Palmiotti]]\n* [[Branko Plav\u0161i\u0107]]\n* [[Josef Rubinstein]]\n* [[Joe Sinnott]]\n* [[Alex Toth]]\n* [[Frank Frazetta]]\n* [[Al Williamson]]\n* [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]\n* [[Bob Smith (comics)|Bob Smith]]\n* [[Karl Story]]\n* [[Art Thibert]]\n* [[Rade Tovladijac]]\n* [[Dexter Vines]]\n* [[Scott Williams (comics)|Scott Williams]]\n* [[Al Williamson]]\n* [[Wally Wood]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notable penciller\u2013inker partnerships ==\n* [[Curt Swan]]/[[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]] \u2014 Worked for decades on DC's [[Superman]] titles.

Some artists could make more money by pencilling more pages and leaving the inking to others; different artists with different working methods might find it more profitable to both pencil and ink, as they could place less information and detail in the pencil drawings if they were inking it themselves and could put that detail in at the inking stage.\n\nDue to the absence of credits on most Golden Age comic books, many inkers of that period are largely forgotten. For those whose names are known, it is difficult to compile r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Inkers like [[Chic Stone]], [[George Papp]], and [[Marvin Stein]] embellished thousands of pages during that era, most of which are still unidentified.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Marvel Comics began giving the inker credit in each of their publications. This allowed finishers like [[Dick Ayers]], [[Joe Sinnott]], [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]], [[John Severin]], [[Syd Shores]], and [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]] to earn a reputation as inkers as well as pencillers. In addition, penciller-inker teams like Kirby and Sinnott, [[Curt Swan]] and [[Murphy Anderson]], [[Gene Colan]] and Palmer, and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] captured the attentions of comic book fandom.\n\nIn 2008 Marvel and DC inker [[Bob Almond]] founded the [[Inkwell Awards]], which is an award established to celebrate the craft of inking and to lift the profile of the art in general. The [[Inkwell Awards]] has gained much publicity and counts notable inkers such as Joe Sinnott, [[Nathan Massengill]] and [[Tim Townsend]] as members and associates.\n\n== Notable inkers ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dan Adkins]]\n* [[Mike Allred]]\n* [[Murphy Anderson]]\n* [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]]\n* [[Brett Breeding]]\n* [[Vince Colletta]]\n* [[Vince Deporter]]\n* [[Tony DeZuniga]]\n* [[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]]\n* [[Joe Giella]]\n* [[Dick Giordano]]\n* [[Al Gordon (comics)|Al Gordon]]\n* [[Dan Green (artist)|Dan Green]]\n* [[Mark Irwin]]\n* [[Billy Graham (comics)|Billy Graham]]\n* [[Klaus Janson]]\n* [[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]]\n* [[Paul Neary]]\n* [[Kevin Nowlan]]\n* [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Tom Palmer]]\n* [[Jimmy Palmiotti]]\n* [[Branko Plav\u0161i\u0107]]\n* [[Josef Rubinstein]]\n* [[Joe Sinnott]]\n* [[Alex Toth]]\n* [[Frank Frazetta]]\n* [[Al Williamson]]\n* [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]\n* [[Bob Smith (comics)|Bob Smith]]\n* [[Karl Story]]\n* [[Art Thibert]]\n* [[Rade Tovladijac]]\n* [[Dexter Vines]]\n* [[Scott Williams (comics)|Scott Williams]]\n* [[Al Williamson]]\n* [[Wally Wood]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notable penciller\u2013inker partnerships ==\n* [[Curt Swan]]/[[George Klein (comics)|George Klein]] \u2014 Worked for decades on DC's [[Superman]] titles.

RF Video also videotaped events held by other, less-popular, regional wrestling promotions; it sold these through its catalog and website. After months of trying to join [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), RF Video's owner, Rob Feinstein, decided to fill the ECW void by starting his own pro wrestling promotion, and distributing its made-for-DVD/VHS productions exclusively through RF Video. The first event, titled ''The Era of Honor Begins'', took place on February 23, 2002, in [[Philadelphia]], the former home area of ECW. It featured nine matches, including a match between [[Eddie Guerrero|<!-- Do not change to \"Eddie\". Both times he appeared in RoH he used the old \"Eddy\" spelling -->Eddy Guerrero]] and [[Super Crazy]] for the IWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship and a [[professional wrestling matches#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] between [[Christopher Daniels]], [[Daniel Bryan|Bryan Danielson]],<!--Danielson has only used \"Daniel Bryan\" in WWE. In ROH and other independent promotions, he has used his real name.--> and [[Low Ki]] (who would become known as the \"founding fathers of ROH\"). In its first year of operation, Ring of Honor confined itself to staging live events in a limited number of venues and cities \u2013 primarily in the northeastern United States. Ten shows ran in Philadelphia, two in [[Wakefield, Massachusetts]]; one in metro [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]; and, one in [[Queens|Queens, New York]]. In 2003, ROH expanded to other areas of the United States, including [[Ohio]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]], and [[Maryland]]. In [[Florida]], ROH supported [[Full Impact Pro]], which would serve as a sister promotion until 2009. It also began to build its international identity by co-promoting an event with [[Frontier Wrestling Alliance]] in [[London|London, England]] on May 17, 2003.\n\n===Rob Feinstein controversy===\n\nIn 2004, Feinstein was caught in an internet-based sting operation, in which he allegedly tried to solicit sex on the internet from a person that he thought to be an underage boy (but was actually an adult, posing as a minor). After this was publicized by some news outlets, Feinstein resigned from ROH in March 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/03/04/370237.html|title=Crisis rocks RoH|date=March 4, 2004|quote=Robert Feinstein announced today that he is leaving Ring of Honor Inc.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630002208/http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/03/04/370237.html|archivedate=June 30, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indywrestlingnews.com/columns/item/8381-rob-feinstein-five-years-later.html|title=Rob Feinstein: Five Years Later|date=March 7, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216063315/http://indywrestlingnews.com/columns/item/8381-rob-feinstein-five-years-later.html|archivedate=December 16, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nIn the aftermath of the scandal, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) ended its talent-sharing agreement with Ring of Honor, abruptly withdrawing all of its contracted wrestlers from their prior commitments to perform in ROH shows\u2014including major ROH draws [[A.J.

However, by the end of 2002, ROH began running multiple shows a month, and in 2003, multiple shows in a weekend, referred to as \"double-shots\". The first time ROH left Philadelphia was August 24, 2002, for ''Honor Invades Boston'' from the American Civic Center in [[Wakefield, Massachusetts]]. Although primarily focusing on the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] of America, ROH began expanding in 2005, both domestically and internationally. 2006 saw the first ROH show from [[Orlando, Florida]], and the first overseas tour of the United Kingdom. In 2007, ROH toured both the United Kingdom and Japan. At this point, they were running on average five shows a month, mostly across the northeastern United States.\n\nIn 2008, ROH debuted in Canada with ''Northern Navigation'', from the [[Ted Reeve Arena]], which they have run since. In the same year, they attempted to expand into [[Montreal]] with a double-shot weekend but both shows failed to impress. On February 22, 2009, ROH held their first TV taping for their [[ROH on HDNet]] show from the former [[2300 Arena|ECW Arena]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This would be the home for the ROH on HDNet TV tapings until arena officials decided to shut it down. Ring of Honor's final ROH on HDNet TV taping took place from the Davis Arena in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. All 100 episodes of ROH on HDNet were hosted by Dave Prazak and [[Mike Hogewood]].\n\nAfter Ring of Honor was purchased by the Sinclair Broadcast Group in June 2011, ROH's touring pattern changed drastically. Instead of running regular shows in (mostly northeastern) cities where the company had a traditional following, ROH shifted to primarily touring (mostly southern) cities with Sinclair-owned TV stations airing its weekly, Sinclair-produced TV show. For instance, in 2011, ROH began running shows regularly in [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]]. In 2012, on the ''Road to Greatness'' weekend double-shot, ROH debuted in [[Alabama]] and [[Tennessee]]. In 2013, ROH debuted in [[San Antonio, Texas]], with ''Honor in the Heart of Texas''. In 2014, ROH debuted in [[Louisiana]], [[Minnesota]], and returned to Florida for a TV taping in [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]]. In 2015, ROH debuted in [[Redwood City, California]] for ''Supercard of Honor'', and returned to [[Atlanta]] for the first time in three years (on February 21). ROH has regularly returned to Atlanta -- one of the Sinclair's highest-population markets -- since then. \n\nSince debuting on Sinclair Broadcasting stations, ''[[Ring of Honor Wrestling]]'' has been taped in numerous locations and continues to tour. [[Kevin Kelly (announcer)|Kevin Kelly]] hosted the Sinclair-era ROH television broadcasts from its first episode on September 24, 2011, until February 20, 2017. On February 27, 2017, [[Ian Riccaboni]] became the ''[[Ring of Honor Wrestling]]'' show's lead announcer and host. In mid-2019, wrestler/actor/model Quinn McKay joined ROH in a backstage 'reporter'/'interviewer' role; in late-2019, she became Riccaboni's in-studio co-host, as well. In early 2020 Quinn McKay became ''[[Ring of Honor Wrestling]]'''s host, in addition to her backstage interviewer role; Ian Riccaboni remained the lead play-by-play announcer.\n\n==ROH contracts==\n{{Main|List of Ring of Honor personnel}}\nIn its formation, Ring of Honor was classified as a \"super indy\", meaning that it would bring together all the top talent from the then bustling [[independent wrestling]] circuit for one show a month. As time moved on, gradually then ROH booker [[Gabe Sapolsky]] began introducing contracts as the promotion began to grow. Performers began signing unofficial contracts to do \"x\" amounts of dates for \"x\" amount of money, but the contracts were never official. This saw a dispute after [[Ric Flair]], who had agreed to work several dates for the promotion, took the money and failed to show up to a scheduled show without notice. After this ROH began introducing more professional contracts for its performers, but also included more incentives such as cuts in merchandise sales from T-shirts and DVDs.\n\nIn 2011, after the purchase by Sinclair Broadcasting, Ring of Honor signed some talent to exclusive contracts which prevented them from appearing on any other televised wrestling show, internet pay-per-view or [[pay-per-view]]. It also gave ROH power over the performers' dates. This caused controversy due to the few dates ROH were running and would eventually be discontinued in-favor of more open contracts which just saw talent not be allowed to appear on television, iPPV or PPV. In 2014, ROH re-introduced the exclusivity clause and introduced other clauses into their contracts, which a handful of performers signed; certain deals also included a salary, which some such as [[Michael Elgin]] have praised. These contracts give ROH as much power over their roster as a [[WWE]] contract would, but does allow them to take outside independent dates with ROH management's approval.\n\n==International partnerships==\nThroughout its history, Ring of Honor has had various working agreements with various domestic and international wrestling promotions. \nROH shows have had outside championships defended on them and on some occasions, wrestlers have held both ROH and outside championships simultaneously.\n\n===Current===\nIn February 2014, ROH and NJPW announced a working relationship which would see talent exchanges and dual events between the two promotions.

The Code of Honor aimed to infuse Ring of Honor's matches with a feel similar to [[Puroresu|Japanese professional wrestling]]. Initially, the Code of Honor included five \"Laws\", mentioned at some point during each ROH production. ROH considered it a moral requirement to follow these rules, which usually appeared in the following order:\n\n# You must shake hands before and after every match\n# No outside interference \n# No sneak attacks\n# No harming the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|officials]]\n# Any action resulting in a disqualification violates the Code of Honor\n\nThe Code of Honor (especially its first three rules) helped [[heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#O|get over]] more quickly than in other promotions. The first rule applied especially to [[Christopher Daniels]], whom the promotion pushed as its first major heel. Daniels and his faction, [[The Prophecy (professional wrestling)|The Prophecy]], rejected the Code of Honor and refused to shake anyone's hand. The fourth and fifth rules emphasized the finishes of ROH matches \u2013 the vast majority of which ended decisively (with clean [[pinfall]]s, submissions, or knockouts) \u2013 unlike what most rival promotions at the time did. On the rare occasion that a match did end with outside interference, with a \"ref bump\", or with some other traditional heel scenario, the live audiences reacted much more negatively than rival promotions' live audiences. In ROH's early days, on-air commentators even suggested (within [[kayfabe]]) that getting disqualified in a match may result in that wrestler never appearing in ROH again.\n\nIn early 2004, ROH's [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|booker]] at the time, [[Gabe Sapolsky]], began to feel that the Code of Honor had run its course.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/02/12/929388.html|title=2004 a year of triumph for Ring of Honor|date=February 16, 2005|quote=At the time I was really hating the 'Code of Honor'.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630002211/http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/02/12/929388.html|archivedate=June 30, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As a result, wrestlers no longer had to follow it. The Code of Honor eventually re-appeared \u2013 revamped \u2013 as three rules:\n\n# Shake hands before and after the match if you respect your opponent\n# Keep the playing-field level\n# Respect the officials\n\n==Women of Honor==\n{{Main|Women of Honor}}\n'''Women of Honor''' is a term used by Ring of Honor (ROH) to refer to its female talent.

RF Video also videotaped events held by other, less-popular, regional wrestling promotions; it sold these through its catalog and website. After months of trying to join [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW), RF Video's owner, Rob Feinstein, decided to fill the ECW void by starting his own pro wrestling promotion, and distributing its made-for-DVD/VHS productions exclusively through RF Video. The first event, titled ''The Era of Honor Begins'', took place on February 23, 2002, in [[Philadelphia]], the former home area of ECW. It featured nine matches, including a match between [[Eddie Guerrero|<!-- Do not change to \"Eddie\". Both times he appeared in RoH he used the old \"Eddy\" spelling -->Eddy Guerrero]] and [[Super Crazy]] for the IWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship and a [[professional wrestling matches#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] between [[Christopher Daniels]], [[Daniel Bryan|Bryan Danielson]],<!--Danielson has only used \"Daniel Bryan\" in WWE. In ROH and other independent promotions, he has used his real name.--> and [[Low Ki]] (who would become known as the \"founding fathers of ROH\"). In its first year of operation, Ring of Honor confined itself to staging live events in a limited number of venues and cities \u2013 primarily in the northeastern United States. Ten shows ran in Philadelphia, two in [[Wakefield, Massachusetts]]; one in metro [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]; and, one in [[Queens|Queens, New York]]. In 2003, ROH expanded to other areas of the United States, including [[Ohio]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]], and [[Maryland]]. In [[Florida]], ROH supported [[Full Impact Pro]], which would serve as a sister promotion until 2009. It also began to build its international identity by co-promoting an event with [[Frontier Wrestling Alliance]] in [[London|London, England]] on May 17, 2003.\n\n===Rob Feinstein controversy===\n\nIn 2004, Feinstein was caught in an internet-based sting operation, in which he allegedly tried to solicit sex on the internet from a person that he thought to be an underage boy (but was actually an adult, posing as a minor). After this was publicized by some news outlets, Feinstein resigned from ROH in March 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/03/04/370237.html|title=Crisis rocks RoH|date=March 4, 2004|quote=Robert Feinstein announced today that he is leaving Ring of Honor Inc.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630002208/http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/03/04/370237.html|archivedate=June 30, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indywrestlingnews.com/columns/item/8381-rob-feinstein-five-years-later.html|title=Rob Feinstein: Five Years Later|date=March 7, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216063315/http://indywrestlingnews.com/columns/item/8381-rob-feinstein-five-years-later.html|archivedate=December 16, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nIn the aftermath of the scandal, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) ended its talent-sharing agreement with Ring of Honor, abruptly withdrawing all of its contracted wrestlers from their prior commitments to perform in ROH shows\u2014including major ROH draws [[A.J.

However, by the end of 2002, ROH began running multiple shows a month, and in 2003, multiple shows in a weekend, referred to as \"double-shots\". The first time ROH left Philadelphia was August 24, 2002, for ''Honor Invades Boston'' from the American Civic Center in [[Wakefield, Massachusetts]]. Although primarily focusing on the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] of America, ROH began expanding in 2005, both domestically and internationally. 2006 saw the first ROH show from [[Orlando, Florida]], and the first overseas tour of the United Kingdom. In 2007, ROH toured both the United Kingdom and Japan. At this point, they were running on average five shows a month, mostly across the northeastern United States.\n\nIn 2008, ROH debuted in Canada with ''Northern Navigation'', from the [[Ted Reeve Arena]], which they have run since. In the same year, they attempted to expand into [[Montreal]] with a double-shot weekend but both shows failed to impress. On February 22, 2009, ROH held their first TV taping for their [[ROH on HDNet]] show from the former [[2300 Arena|ECW Arena]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This would be the home for the ROH on HDNet TV tapings until arena officials decided to shut it down. Ring of Honor's final ROH on HDNet TV taping took place from the Davis Arena in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. All 100 episodes of ROH on HDNet were hosted by Dave Prazak and [[Mike Hogewood]].\n\nAfter Ring of Honor was purchased by the Sinclair Broadcast Group in June 2011, ROH's touring pattern changed drastically. Instead of running regular shows in (mostly northeastern) cities where the company had a traditional following, ROH shifted to primarily touring (mostly southern) cities with Sinclair-owned TV stations airing its weekly, Sinclair-produced TV show. For instance, in 2011, ROH began running shows regularly in [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]]. In 2012, on the ''Road to Greatness'' weekend double-shot, ROH debuted in [[Alabama]] and [[Tennessee]]. In 2013, ROH debuted in [[San Antonio, Texas]], with ''Honor in the Heart of Texas''. In 2014, ROH debuted in [[Louisiana]], [[Minnesota]], and returned to Florida for a TV taping in [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]]. In 2015, ROH debuted in [[Redwood City, California]] for ''Supercard of Honor'', and returned to [[Atlanta]] for the first time in three years (on February 21). ROH has regularly returned to Atlanta -- one of the Sinclair's highest-population markets -- since then. \n\nSince debuting on Sinclair Broadcasting stations, ''[[Ring of Honor Wrestling]]'' has been taped in numerous locations and continues to tour. [[Kevin Kelly (announcer)|Kevin Kelly]] hosted the Sinclair-era ROH television broadcasts from its first episode on September 24, 2011, until February 20, 2017. On February 27, 2017, [[Ian Riccaboni]] became the ''[[Ring of Honor Wrestling]]'' show's lead announcer and host. In mid-2019, wrestler/actor/model Quinn McKay joined ROH in a backstage 'reporter'/'interviewer' role; in late-2019, she became Riccaboni's in-studio co-host, as well. In early 2020 Quinn McKay became ''[[Ring of Honor Wrestling]]'''s host, in addition to her backstage interviewer role; Ian Riccaboni remained the lead play-by-play announcer.\n\n==ROH contracts==\n{{Main|List of Ring of Honor personnel}}\nIn its formation, Ring of Honor was classified as a \"super indy\", meaning that it would bring together all the top talent from the then bustling [[independent wrestling]] circuit for one show a month. As time moved on, gradually then ROH booker [[Gabe Sapolsky]] began introducing contracts as the promotion began to grow. Performers began signing unofficial contracts to do \"x\" amounts of dates for \"x\" amount of money, but the contracts were never official. This saw a dispute after [[Ric Flair]], who had agreed to work several dates for the promotion, took the money and failed to show up to a scheduled show without notice. After this ROH began introducing more professional contracts for its performers, but also included more incentives such as cuts in merchandise sales from T-shirts and DVDs.\n\nIn 2011, after the purchase by Sinclair Broadcasting, Ring of Honor signed some talent to exclusive contracts which prevented them from appearing on any other televised wrestling show, internet pay-per-view or [[pay-per-view]]. It also gave ROH power over the performers' dates. This caused controversy due to the few dates ROH were running and would eventually be discontinued in-favor of more open contracts which just saw talent not be allowed to appear on television, iPPV or PPV. In 2014, ROH re-introduced the exclusivity clause and introduced other clauses into their contracts, which a handful of performers signed; certain deals also included a salary, which some such as [[Michael Elgin]] have praised. These contracts give ROH as much power over their roster as a [[WWE]] contract would, but does allow them to take outside independent dates with ROH management's approval.\n\n==International partnerships==\nThroughout its history, Ring of Honor has had various working agreements with various domestic and international wrestling promotions. \nROH shows have had outside championships defended on them and on some occasions, wrestlers have held both ROH and outside championships simultaneously.\n\n===Current===\nIn February 2014, ROH and NJPW announced a working relationship which would see talent exchanges and dual events between the two promotions. The first co-promoted shows Global Wars and War of the Worlds, took place in May 2014, in Toronto and New York City respectively,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rohwrestling.com/news/roh-and-new-japan-pro-wrestling-present-2-super-shows-may |title=ROH AND NEW JAPAN PRO WRESTLING TO PRESENT 2 SUPER SHOWS THIS MAY |publisher=ROH Wrestling |accessdate=August 18, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129214829/http://www.rohwrestling.com/news/roh-and-new-japan-pro-wrestling-present-2-super-shows-may |archivedate=November 29, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> with the two companies again co-promoting these events in May 2015 \u2013 with the [[ROH/NJPW War of the Worlds (2015)|War of the Worlds '15]] taking place at the [[2300 Arena]] in [[Philadelphia]] on the 12th and 13th, and the [[Global Wars '15]] event in [[Toronto]] on the 15th and 16th.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rohwrestling.com/news/roh-njpw-present-3-super-shows-may|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226191104/http://www.rohwrestling.com/news/roh-njpw-present-3-super-shows-may|url-status=dead|title=News &#124; ROH Wrestling|archivedate=February 26, 2015|website=www.rohwrestling.com}}</ref> As part of the relationship with NJPW, ROH announced it would promote two shows, entitled [[Honor Rising: Japan 2016]], in Tokyo in February 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/104-ring-of-honor/44178-roh-makes-announcement-about-new-japan-relationship|title=ROH, New Japan to extend relationship in 2016 with more shows, more talent|work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]|date=August 21, 2015|accessdate=August 22, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823152612/http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/104-ring-of-honor/44178-roh-makes-announcement-about-new-japan-relationship|archivedate=August 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn August 10, 2016, Mexican promotion [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) officially announced a working relationship with ROH.

The Code of Honor aimed to infuse Ring of Honor's matches with a feel similar to [[Puroresu|Japanese professional wrestling]]. Initially, the Code of Honor included five \"Laws\", mentioned at some point during each ROH production. ROH considered it a moral requirement to follow these rules, which usually appeared in the following order:\n\n# You must shake hands before and after every match\n# No outside interference \n# No sneak attacks\n# No harming the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|officials]]\n# Any action resulting in a disqualification violates the Code of Honor\n\nThe Code of Honor (especially its first three rules) helped [[heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] [[List of professional wrestling terms#O|get over]] more quickly than in other promotions. The first rule applied especially to [[Christopher Daniels]], whom the promotion pushed as its first major heel. Daniels and his faction, [[The Prophecy (professional wrestling)|The Prophecy]], rejected the Code of Honor and refused to shake anyone's hand. The fourth and fifth rules emphasized the finishes of ROH matches \u2013 the vast majority of which ended decisively (with clean [[pinfall]]s, submissions, or knockouts) \u2013 unlike what most rival promotions at the time did. On the rare occasion that a match did end with outside interference, with a \"ref bump\", or with some other traditional heel scenario, the live audiences reacted much more negatively than rival promotions' live audiences. In ROH's early days, on-air commentators even suggested (within [[kayfabe]]) that getting disqualified in a match may result in that wrestler never appearing in ROH again.\n\nIn early 2004, ROH's [[List of professional wrestling terms#B|booker]] at the time, [[Gabe Sapolsky]], began to feel that the Code of Honor had run its course.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/02/12/929388.html|title=2004 a year of triumph for Ring of Honor|date=February 16, 2005|quote=At the time I was really hating the 'Code of Honor'.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120630002211/http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/02/12/929388.html|archivedate=June 30, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As a result, wrestlers no longer had to follow it.

It eventually left Brooklyn for good in the 20th century. In 1895, the descendants of Peter Cooper sold the site glue factory on Maspeth Avenue to The City of Brooklyn for $55,000.
