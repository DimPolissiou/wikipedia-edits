Since this sequence of [[related key]]s is much closer to common harmonic practice, it is thought that Chopin might have conceived the cycle as a single performance entity for continuous recital.<ref name=Taruskin-p333/> An opposing view is that the set was never intended for continuous performance, and that the individual preludes were indeed conceived as possible introductions for other works.<ref name=Kallberg-p143/>\n\nChopin himself never played more than four of the preludes at any single public performance.<ref name=meier /> Nowadays, the complete set of Op. 28 preludes has become repertory fare, and many concert pianists have recorded the entire set, beginning with [[Ferruccio Busoni]] in 1915, when making piano rolls for the Duo-Art label.

Chopin is known to have studied Bach's music, although he is not known to have performed it publicly.\n\n[[Harold C.

The original signature was hastily scrawled (more so than usual of Chopin's original manuscripts).\n\nChopin left this piece uncompleted and seems to have discarded it; while he worked on it during his stay on Majorca, the E{{music|flat}} minor prelude that ultimately formed part of the Op. 28 set is a completely unrelated piece. Kallberg's realisation of the prelude from Chopin's almost illegible sketches goes no further than where Chopin left off.

Since this sequence of [[related key]]s is much closer to common harmonic practice, it is thought that Chopin might have conceived the cycle as a single performance entity for continuous recital.<ref name=Taruskin-p333/> An opposing view is that the set was never intended for continuous performance, and that the individual preludes were indeed conceived as possible introductions for other works.<ref name=Kallberg-p143/>\n\nChopin himself never played more than four of the preludes at any single public performance.<ref name=meier /> Nowadays, the complete set of Op. 28 preludes has become repertory fare, and many concert pianists have recorded the entire set, beginning with [[Ferruccio Busoni]] in 1915, when making piano rolls for the Duo-Art label.

Schonberg, ''The Great Pianists'', p. 110</ref> The dedicatee of Chopin's set, [[Joseph Christoph Kessler]], also used the circle of fifths in his 24 \u00c9tudes, Op. 20, which were dedicated to Hummel.\n\n==Chopin's other preludes==\n[[File:Full page, Chopin Prelude 26.png|thumb|right|Prelude No. 26 (autograph)]]\n[[File:Full page, Chopin Prelude 27.png|thumb|right|Prelude No. 27 (autograph)]]\nChopin wrote three other preludes.\n\n===Prelude No. 25 (Op. 45)===\nThe Prelude in C{{music|sharp}} minor, Op. 45 (sometimes listed as Prelude No. 25), was composed in 1841.<ref>{{cite web|title=Memory of Poland Chopin Worklist Entry for Opus 45|url=http://www.archiwa.gov.pl/memory/sub_chopin/index.php?va_lang=en&fileid=004_1_3|accessdate=19 July 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023081905/http://www.archiwa.gov.pl/memory/sub_chopin/index.php?va_lang=en&fileid=004_1_3|archivedate=23 October 2007}}</ref> It was dedicated to Princess E.

Kallberg gave it this nickname for its similarities to [[Giuseppe Tartini]]'s violin sonata known as ''[[Devil's Trill Sonata|The Devil's Trill]]'', Tartini being a likely influence on Chopin. The original signature was hastily scrawled (more so than usual of Chopin's original manuscripts).\n\nChopin left this piece uncompleted and seems to have discarded it; while he worked on it during his stay on Majorca, the E{{music|flat}} minor prelude that ultimately formed part of the Op. 28 set is a completely unrelated piece. Kallberg's realisation of the prelude from Chopin's almost illegible sketches goes no further than where Chopin left off. The piece had its first public performance in July 2002 at the [[Newport Music Festival]] in Newport, Rhode Island, with the pianist Alain Jacquon.<ref>Herrup, Katharine.

{"title_page": "Henry Barry, 4th Baron Barry of Santry", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n'''Henry Barry, 4th Baron Barry of Santry''' (1710\u20131751), often referred to simply as  '''Lord Santry''', was an [[Irish peer]]. He is unique in being the only  member of the [[Irish  House of Lords]]  to be convicted of murder by his peers, for which crime he was  sentenced to death. He later received a full pardon, but died when he was  still a young man.\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Dublin]] on 3 September 1710, only son of Henry Barry, 3rd [[Baron Barry of Santry]], and Bridget Domvile, daughter of Sir Thomas Domvile, 1st Baronet, of [[Templeogue]],  and his first wife (and cousin)   Elizabeth Lake, daughter of [[Lancelot Lake|Sir Lancelot Lake]].<ref>Cokayne, G. E. ''Complete Peerage'' Reprinted Gloucester 2000 Vol.1, p. 448</ref> He succeeded to the title in 1735 and took his seat in the [[Irish House of Lords]].  He married firstly Anne Thornton, daughter of William Thornton of [[Finglas]], who died in 1742, and secondly  in 1750 Elizabeth Shore of [[Derby]], but had no issue by either marriage.  He died in Nottingham on 22 March 1751 and was buried at [[St. Nicholas' Church, Nottingham]].<ref>Cokayne p. 448</ref>\n\n==Murder of Laughlin Murphy==\nLord Barry of [[Santry]] seems to have been the typical eighteenth-century [[rake (character)|rake]], with a quarrelsome and violent nature, and a heavy drinker.  He  was a member of the notorious  Dublin [[Hellfire Club]]: the Club's  reputation never  recovered from the sensational publicity surrounding his trial for murder, although there is no reason to think that any of  his fellow members knew of or  condoned the crime.<ref>O'Flanagan, J. Roderick  ''The Irish Bar'' Sampson Low, Marston, Searle and Rivington London 1879 p.7</ref> There were rumours that he had committed at least one previous murder which was successfully hushed up, although there seems to be  no firm evidence for this.<ref>Ryan, David \"Uncovering the origins of Dublin's  Hellfire  Club\" ''[[Irish Times]]'' August 10, 2012 </ref>\n\nOn 9 August 1738, Lord Santry (as he was usually known) was drinking with some friends at a [[tavern]] in [[Palmerstown]], which is now a [[suburb]]  but  was then a small village near [[Dublin]] city.  Santry, who had  drunk even more heavily than usual, attacked a Mr Humphries, but was unable to draw his sword. Enraged, he ran to the kitchen, where he chanced to meet Laughlin Murphy, the tavern [[doorman (profession)|porter]], and for no known  reason ran him through with his sword.<ref>O'Flanagan p.8</ref> He bribed the innkeeper to let him  escape. Murphy was taken to Dublin where he lingered for some weeks; he died on 25 September 1738.<ref>O'Flanagan p.8</ref>\n\n===Trial===\nAlthough Lord Santry was not immediately apprehended, there is no reason to think that [[the Crown]] intended that he should escape justice; indeed the authorities clearly aimed not only to prosecute him but to secure a conviction.  Even in an age when the [[aristocracy]] enjoyed special privileges, the murder of Murphy, who by all accounts was an honest and hardworking man with a wife and young family to support, had shocked public opinion, whereas Lord Santry was regarded, even in Government circles,  as a public nuisance.  In due course Santry was arrested and [[indicted]] for murder. He  demanded, as the [[privilege of peerage]], a trial by his peers. The trial, which took place in the [[Irish Houses of Parliament]] on 27 April 1739, aroused immense public interest.<ref>O'Flanagan p.9</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Wyndham, 1st Baron Wyndham|Lord Wyndham]],  the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], presided in his office  [[Lord High Steward of Ireland]], with 23 peers sitting as judges. The [[Attorney-General for Ireland]], [[Robert Jocelyn, 1st Viscount Jocelyn|Robert Jocelyn]],  and the [[Solicitor-General for Ireland]], [[John Bowes, 1st Baron Bowes|John Bowes]], led for the prosecution.\n\nBowes dominated the proceedings and his speeches made his reputation as an orator. [[Thomas Rundle]], [[Bishop of Derry]], who as a [[spiritual peer]] was only an observer at the trial,<ref>By a long-standing tradition spiritual peers in both the English and Irish Lords did not vote in criminal cases.</ref> said \"I never heard, never read,  so perfect a piece of eloquence...the strength and light of his reason, the fairness and candour\".<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'' London John Murray 1926 Vol.2 pp.133\u20134</ref> The Bishop was scathing about counsel for the defence, describing the performance of Santry's counsel as \"detestable\".<ref>O'Flanagan p.12</ref> The defence case was that Murphy had died not from his wound but from a long-standing illness, but in view of the medical evidence produced by the prosecution  this was a hopeless argument. According to Bishop Rundle, Santry's counsel failed even to mention the possibility that Murphy, who lingered for 6 weeks after being stabbed, might have died through inadequate medical care. Given the overwhelming evidence of  Lord Santry's guilt, however,  any defence would probably  have been useless, and despite what was described as their \"looks of horror\", his peers had little difficulty in finding Santry guilty. Wyndham, who had conducted the trial with exemplary fairness, pronounced the death sentence.<ref>O'Flanagan p.12</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[George II of Great Britain and Ireland|King George II]], like all British monarchs, had the [[prerogative of mercy]], and  a campaign was launched by Santry's friends and relatives to persuade the King to grant a pardon. Their plea seems to have concentrated on the victim's low social standing, the implication being that the life of a peer was worth more than that of a tavern worker, despite the victim's blameless character and the savage and wanton nature of the murder.  The King proved reluctant to grant a pardon,<ref>[[Horace Walpole]] wrote that King George II, though merciful enough in other cases involving the death penalty, rarely pardoned a murderer.</ref> and for a  time it seemed that Santry must   die, but in due course a reprieve was issued. Popular legend had it that his uncle Sir Compton Domvile, through whose estate at [[Templeogue]] the [[River Dodder]] flowed, secured a [[royal pardon]] for his nephew by threatening to divert the course of the river, thus depriving the citizens of Dublin of their main supply of drinking water.<ref>O'Flanagan p.13</ref>\n\n[[File:River Dodder.jpg|thumb|River Dodder today]]\n\nOn 17 June 1740, Lord Santry received a full [[royal pardon]] and the restoration of his title and estates; soon afterwards he left Ireland for good and settled in England. His last years are said to have been wretched: although he made a second marriage  shortly before his death,  he was abandoned by all  his  former friends,  was in great pain from [[gout]] and prone to [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref>Ryan  ''Irish  Times''</ref> On his death in 1751 the title became extinct; his estates passed to his Domvile cousins. His widow Elizabeth outlived him by many years, dying in December 1816.\n\n==Parallel cases==\nIn 1628 [[Edmond Butler, 3rd/13th Baron Dunboyne|Lord Dunboyne]] was tried by his peers for [[manslaughter]] but acquitted. In 1743 [[Nicholas Netterville, 5th Viscount Netterville|The 5th Viscount Netterville]] was acquitted of murder by his peers in 1743,   as was [[Robert King, 2nd Earl of Kingston]] in 1798.<ref>O'Flanagan pp.14\u201315</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barry Of Santry, Henry Barry, 4th Baron}}\n[[Category:Barons in the Peerage of Ireland]]\n[[Category:1710 births]]\n[[Category:1751 deaths]]\n[[Category:Irish murderers]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Dublin (city)]]\n[[Category:18th-century Irish people]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n'''Henry Barry, 4th Baron Barry of Santry''' (1710\u20131751), often referred to simply as  '''Lord Santry''', was an [[Irish peer]].

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success.

The earlier exhibition included sixteen paintings of which ''The Persistence of Memory'' attracted the most attention. Some of the notable features of the exhibitions were the proliferation of images and references to Dal\u00ed's muse Gala and the inclusion of Surrealist Objects such as ''Hypnagogic Clock'' and ''Clock Based on the Decomposition of Bodies''.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 279-283, 299-300</ref> Dal\u00ed's last, and largest, exhibition at the Pierre Colle Gallery was held in June 1933 and included twenty-two paintings, ten drawings and two objects. One critic noted Dal\u00ed's precise draftsmanship and attention to detail, describing him as a \"paranoiac of geometrical temperament\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 314-15</ref> Dal\u00ed's first New York exhibition was held at Julien Levy's gallery in November-December 1933. The exhibition featured twenty-six works and was a commercial and critical success. The ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' critic praised the precision and lack of sentimentality in the works, calling them \"frozen nightmares.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p316</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed and Gala, having lived together since 1929, were civilly married on 30 January 1934 in Paris.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 323</ref> They later remarried in a Church ceremony on 8 August 1958 at [[Sant Mart\u00ed Vell]].<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 492</ref> In addition to inspiring many artworks throughout her life, Gala would act as Dal\u00ed's [[business manager]], supporting their extravagant lifestyle while adeptly steering clear of insolvency. Gala, who herself engaged in extra-marital affairs,<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 421-22, 508-10, 620-21</ref> seemed to tolerate Dal\u00ed's dalliances with younger muses, secure in her own position as his primary relationship. Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her. The \"tense, complex and ambiguous relationship\" lasting over 50 years would later become the subject of an opera, ''Jo, Dal\u00ed'' (''I, Dal\u00ed'') by [[Catalan people|Catalan]] composer Xavier Benguerel.<ref name=\"Opera\">{{cite web|last=Amengual|first=Margalida|title=An opera on the relationship between Salvador Dal\u00ed and Gala arrives at Barcelona's Liceu|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/culture/item/an-opera-on-the-relationship-between-salvador-dali-and-gala-arrives-at-barcelonas-liceu|work=Catalan News Agency (CNA)|publisher=Intracatal\u00f2nia, SA|accessdate=27 May 2012|date=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed's first visit to the United States in November 1934 attracted widespread press coverage. His second New York exhibition was held at the Julien Levy Gallery in November-December 1934 and was again a commercial and critical success. Dal\u00ed delivered three lectures on Surrealism at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) and other venues during which he told his audience for the first time that \"[t]he only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 336-41</ref> The heiress [[Caresse Crosby]], the inventor of the brassiere, organised a farewell fancy dress ball for Dal\u00ed on 18 January 1935. Dal\u00ed wore a glass case on his chest containing a brassiere and Gala dressed as a woman giving birth through her head.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Don Salvador Dal\u00ed y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

Halsman produced the ''Dal\u00ed Atomica'' series (1948)&nbsp;\u2013  inspired by Dal\u00ed's painting ''Leda Atomica''&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013  which in one photograph depicts \"a painter's easel, three cats, a bucket of water, and Dal\u00ed himself floating in the air\".<ref name=designws />\n\n=== Architecture ===\n[[File:Dali museum.jpg|thumb|[[Dal\u00ed Theatre and Museum]] in [[Figueres]] also holds the crypt where Dal\u00ed is buried]]\nDal\u00ed's architectural achievements include his [[Port Lligat]] house near [[Cadaqu\u00e9s]], as well as his [[Dal\u00ed Theatre and Museum|Theatre and Museum]] in [[Figueres]].

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dal\u00ed also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nThe artist worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Workers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

Dal\u00ed's painting ''[[Tuna Fishing (painting)|Tuna Fishing (Homage to Meissonier)]]'' (1967) was inspired by his reading of Chardin.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 525</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nDal\u00ed's sexuality had a profound influence on his work. He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!

The most common types of power tools use [[electric motor]]s. [[Internal combustion engine]]s and [[compressed air]] are also commonly used. Other power sources include [[steam engine]]s, direct burning of fuels and propellants, such as in [[powder-actuated tool]]s, or even natural power sources such as [[wind power|wind]] or [[hydropower|moving water]]. Tools directly driven by [[animal power]] are not generally considered power tools.\n\nPower tools are used in industry, in [[construction]], in the [[garden]], for [[Homemaking|housework]] tasks such as [[Outline of food preparation#Food preparation techniques|cooking]], [[housekeeping|cleaning]], and [[Do it yourself|around the house]] for purposes of driving ([[fastener]]s), [[drill]]ing, [[saw|cutting]], shaping, [[sander|sanding]], grinding, [[wood router|routing]], polishing, painting, heating and more.\n\nPower tools are classified as either stationary or portable, where portable means hand-held. Portable power tools have obvious advantages in mobility. Stationary power tools, however, often have advantages in speed and precision. A typical table saw, for instance, not only cuts faster than a regular hand saw, but the cuts are smoother, straighter, and more square than what is normally achievable with a hand-held power saw. Some stationary power tools can produce objects that cannot be made in any other way. [[lathe (tool)|Lathes]], for example,  produce truly round objects.\n\nStationary power tools for [[metalworking]] are usually called [[machine tools]]. The term ''machine tool'' is not usually applied to stationary power tools for [[woodworking]], although such usage is occasionally heard, and in some cases, such as [[Drill#Drill press|drill presses]] and [[bench grinder]]s, exactly the same tool is used for both woodworking and metalworking.\n\n==History==\nThe [[lathe]] is the oldest power tool, being known to the ancient Egyptians (albeit in a hand-powered form).

In 1862, a committee was established to inquire into [[venereal disease]] (i.e. sexually transmitted infections) in the [[armed forces]]. On its recommendation the first Contagious Diseases Act was passed. The legislation allowed police officers to arrest women suspected of being [[prostitute]]s in certain ports and army towns. The women were then subjected to compulsory checks for venereal disease. If a woman was declared to be infected, she would be confined in what was known as a [[lock hospital]] until she recovered or her sentence finished. The original act only applied to a few selected naval ports and army towns, but by 1869 the acts had been extended to cover eighteen \"subjected districts\".{{sfnp|Walkowitz|1980|p=1}}\n\nThe Act of 1864 stated that women found to be infected could be interned in locked hospitals for up to three months, a period gradually extended to one year with the 1869 Act. These measures were justified by medical and military officials as the most effective method to shield men from venereal disease. Because military men were often unmarried and homosexuality was criminal, prostitution was considered a necessary evil. However, no provision was made for the examination of prostitutes' clientele, which became one of the many points of contention in a campaign to repeal the Acts.\n\nAfter 1866, proposals were introduced to extend the acts to the north of England and to the civilian population. It was suggested that this extension would regulate prostitution and stop street disorders caused by it in large cities.\n\nThe subject of venereal disease, known as social disease, created significant controversy within Victorian society. The Contagious Diseases Acts themselves affected thousands of people's lives, from campaigners to prostitutes themselves. They sparked the debate over inequality between men and women. It was an early political issue that led to women organising themselves and actively campaigning for their rights.\n\nThe inconsistent treatment of genders inherent in the acts was a key part of [[Josephine Butler]]'s campaigns for their repeal. In one of her public letters, she allowed a prostitute to deliver her own account of her personal encounters with men:\n{{quote|It is men, only men, from the first to the last that we have to do with! To please a man I did wrong at first, then I was flung about from man to man. Men police lay hands on us. By men we are examined, handled, doctored. In the hospital it is a man again who makes prayer and reads the Bible for us. We are had up before magistrates who are men, and we never get out of the hands of men till we die!}}\n\n== Early opposition to the Contagious Diseases Acts ==\n\n[[Florence Nightingale]]\u2019s opposition to the \u201cContinental system\u201d or state regulation of prostitution probably delayed passage of the legislation by a couple of years. However, the first Contagious Diseases Act was adopted, after scarcely any debate\u2014it was introduced without warning\u2014in 1864.<ref>McDonald, Lynn. (2005) \u201cProstitution, the Contagious Diseases Acts and the Treatment of Syphilitic Prostitutes,\u201d Florence Nightingale on Women, Medicine, Midwifery and Prostitution (Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Press</ref>\n\nIn 1862, she prepared and had printed a thorough critique of the regulatory approach in ''Note on the Supposed Protection Afforded against Venereal Diseases, by recognizing Prostitution and Putting it under Police Regulation''.<ref>Nightingale, Florence. Note on the Supposed Protection Afforded Against Venereal Diseases, by recognizing Prostitution and Putting It under Police Regulation. Privately printed 1862.</ref> The paper included statistics of hospital admissions for venereal disease for various army units at various stations. It showed that the system  of regulation did not result in lower rates of disease. However, the legislation proceeded.\n\nNightingale next recruited journalist [[Harriet Martineau]] to write on the subject and gave her background material. She published ''The Contagious Diseases Acts, as applied to Garrison Towns and Naval Stations'', in 1870. Her  four articles in it, in the ''Daily News,'' by \u201can Englishwoman\u201d ran on each of the last four days of 1869, the last of which launched \u201cThe Ladies\u2019 National Association for the Repeal of the contagious Diseases Acts.\u201d It was co-signed by leading women opponents of the Acts. Josephine Butler, who went on to lead the lengthy campaign for repeal, was the third signatory, after Nightingale and Martineau.\n\nWhen the first woman to qualify as a doctor in England, [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson|Elizabeth Garrett]], wrote in favour of the Acts, Nightingale, using the name \u201cJustina,\u201d opposed her, with two articles, in the ''Pall Mall Gazette'' in 1870.<ref>Justina [Nightingale, Florence]. \u201cThe Contagious Diseases Acts.\u201d Pall Mall Gazette (3 March 1870):3.</ref><ref>Justina [Nightingale, Florence] \u201cMiss Garrett on the Contagious Diseases Acts.\u201d Pall Mall Gazette Friday (18 March 1870):6</ref>  Nightingale continued to give support behind-the-scenes to the repeal campaign.\n\n== Prostitution in Victorian England ==\nThe level of prostitution was high in Victorian England. The acts themselves would have affected a large proportion of the female workforce in Britain. For several reasons prostitution was predominantly a working class profession. For many working-class women their journey into prostitution was one of circumstance. During the nineteenth century the public began to concern itself with particular social problems, an increasing view of the \"ideal woman\" was beginning to emerge and the \"angel of the home\" was becoming a popular [[stereotype]]. This rise of the middle class domestic morality made it increasingly harder for women to obtain work in certain professions, causing an increase in such areas as needle-trades, shop girls, [[agricultural gang]]s, factory work, and domestic servants,{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=81}} all occupations with long hours and little pay. Low earnings, it is argued, meant that women had to resort to prostitution to be able to provide for themselves and their families, particularly in households where the main breadwinner was no longer around. The figures below, however, show this to be untrue. A study from the late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period showed that more than 90 per cent of prostitutes in Millbank prison were the daughters of \"unskilled and semiskilled workingmen\", more than 50 per cent of whom had been servants, the rest having worked in dead-end jobs such as laundering, charring, and street selling.{{sfnp|Walkowitz|1980|p=16}}\n\nThe nature of the occupation makes it difficult to establish the exact number of prostitutes in operation during the Victorian Period. Judicial reports of the years 1857 to 1869 show that prostitutes were more common in commercial ports and pleasure resorts and less so in hardware towns, cotton and linen manufacturing centres and woollen and worsted centres.{{sfnp|Walkowitz|1980|p=22}} The Westminster Review placed the figure between 50,000 and 368,000.{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=77}} This would make prostitution the fourth-largest female occupation. However, the police estimates of known prostitutes portray an entirely different estimate:\n\nPolice estimates of known prostitutes{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=77}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The unreliability of statistics during the nineteenth century prevents one from knowing if prostitution was increasing or decreasing during this period, but it is clear that Victorians during the 1840s and 1850s thought that prostitution and venereal disease were increasing.{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=80}}\n\nRegulating prostitution was the government's attempt to control the high level of venereal disease in its armed forces. By 1864, one out of three sick cases in the army was caused by venereal disease; admissions into hospitals for gonorrhoea and syphilis reached 290.7 per 1,000 of total troop strength.{{sfnp|Walkowitz|1980|p=49}}\n\nProstitutes found work within the armed forces, mainly due to servicemen's forced celibacy and the conditions of the barracks the men were forced to endure.{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=88}} The barracks were overcrowded, and had a lack of ventilation and defective sanitation. Very few servicemen were permitted to marry, and even those who were, were not given an allowance to support their wives, which occasionally lured them to become prostitutes as well.{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=89}}\n\n== Extension and repeal ==\nIn 1867, the [[Association for Promoting the Extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts]] was established and was just as prominent in the publishing of pamphlets and articles as the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]] was. The Association strongly campaigned for the extension of the Contagious Diseases Acts to be extended outside of the naval and army barracks and be made effective to the whole of the country, as they believed this was the best way of regulating prostitution.\n\n=== Opposition ===\nThere was much action taken towards the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. In 1869, the [[National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]] was established; initially restricting women from its meetings, causing the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]] to be quickly established by [[Josephine Butler]]. These repeal organisations attracted the vigorous support of moralists and feminists but also those more generally concerned with civil liberties, especially since the Acts were perceived as having violated basic human rights. Both groups actively campaigned against the acts and between 1870 and 1885, 17,365 petitions against the acts bearing 2,606,429 signatures were presented to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and during the same period, more than 900 meetings were held.{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=77}}\nThe repealists struck a chord with the public consensus on the issues surrounding prostitution and they highlighted the issue of double standards.\n\nIt was the men and women of the National Association and the Ladies National Association who won the battle over the Contagious Diseases Acts, and, in 1886, the Acts were repealed.\n\n== Conditions in lock hospitals ==\nIf a woman was declared diseased she would be confined in what were known as [[lock hospital]]s.

In 1862, a committee was established to inquire into [[venereal disease]] (i.e. sexually transmitted infections) in the [[armed forces]]. On its recommendation the first Contagious Diseases Act was passed. The legislation allowed police officers to arrest women suspected of being [[prostitute]]s in certain ports and army towns. The women were then subjected to compulsory checks for venereal disease. If a woman was declared to be infected, she would be confined in what was known as a [[lock hospital]] until she recovered or her sentence finished. The original act only applied to a few selected naval ports and army towns, but by 1869 the acts had been extended to cover eighteen \"subjected districts\".{{sfnp|Walkowitz|1980|p=1}}\n\nThe Act of 1864 stated that women found to be infected could be interned in locked hospitals for up to three months, a period gradually extended to one year with the 1869 Act. These measures were justified by medical and military officials as the most effective method to shield men from venereal disease. Because military men were often unmarried and homosexuality was criminal, prostitution was considered a necessary evil. However, no provision was made for the examination of prostitutes' clientele, which became one of the many points of contention in a campaign to repeal the Acts.\n\nAfter 1866, proposals were introduced to extend the acts to the north of England and to the civilian population. It was suggested that this extension would regulate prostitution and stop street disorders caused by it in large cities.\n\nThe subject of venereal disease, known as social disease, created significant controversy within Victorian society. The Contagious Diseases Acts themselves affected thousands of people's lives, from campaigners to prostitutes themselves. They sparked the debate over inequality between men and women. It was an early political issue that led to women organising themselves and actively campaigning for their rights.\n\nThe inconsistent treatment of genders inherent in the acts was a key part of [[Josephine Butler]]'s campaigns for their repeal. In one of her public letters, she allowed a prostitute to deliver her own account of her personal encounters with men:\n{{quote|It is men, only men, from the first to the last that we have to do with! To please a man I did wrong at first, then I was flung about from man to man. Men police lay hands on us. By men we are examined, handled, doctored. In the hospital it is a man again who makes prayer and reads the Bible for us. We are had up before magistrates who are men, and we never get out of the hands of men till we die!}}\n\n== Early opposition to the Contagious Diseases Acts ==\n \n[[Florence Nightingale]]\u2019s opposition to the \u201cContinental system\u201d or state regulation of prostitution probably delayed passage of the legislation by a couple of years. However, the first Contagious Diseases Act was adopted, after scarcely any debate\u2014it was introduced without warning\u2014in 1864.<ref>McDonald, Lynn. (2005) \u201cProstitution, the Contagious Diseases Acts and the Treatment of Syphilitic Prostitutes,\u201d Florence Nightingale on Women, Medicine, Midwifery and Prostitution (Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Press </ref>\n\nIn 1862, she prepared and had printed a thorough critique of the regulatory approach in ''Note on the Supposed Protection Afforded against Venereal Diseases, by recognizing Prostitution and Putting it under Police Regulation''.<ref>Nightingale, Florence. Note on the Supposed Protection Afforded Against Venereal Diseases, by recognizing Prostitution and Putting It under Police Regulation. Privately printed 1862.</ref> The paper included statistics of hospital admissions for venereal disease for various army units at various stations. It showed that the system  of regulation did not result in lower rates of disease. However, the legislation proceeded.\n\nNightingale next recruited journalist [[Harriet Martineau]] to write on the subject and gave her background material. She published ''The Contagious Diseases Acts, as applied to Garrison Towns and Naval Stations'', in 1870. Her  four articles in it, in the ''Daily News,'' by \u201can Englishwoman\u201d ran on each of the last four days of 1869, the last of which launched \u201cThe Ladies\u2019 National Association for the Repeal of the contagious Diseases Acts.\u201d It was co-signed by leading women opponents of the Acts. Josephine Butler, who went on to lead the lengthy campaign for repeal, was the third signatory, after Nightingale and Martineau.\n\nWhen the first woman to qualify as a doctor in England, [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson| Elizabeth Garrett]], wrote in favour of the Acts, Nightingale, using the name \u201cJustina,\u201d opposed her, with two articles, in the ''Pall Mall Gazette'' in 1870.<ref>Justina [Nightingale, Florence]. \u201cThe Contagious Diseases Acts.\u201d Pall Mall Gazette (3 March 1870):3.</ref> <ref>Justina [Nightingale, Florence] \u201cMiss Garrett on the Contagious Diseases Acts.\u201d Pall Mall Gazette Friday (18 March 1870):6</ref>  Nightingale continued to give support behind-the-scenes to the repeal campaign.\n\n== Prostitution in Victorian England ==\nThe level of prostitution was high in Victorian England. The acts themselves would have affected a large proportion of the female workforce in Britain. For several reasons prostitution was predominantly a working class profession. For many working class women their journey into prostitution was one of circumstance. During the nineteenth century the public began to concern itself with particular social problems, an increasing view of the \"ideal woman\" was beginning to emerge and the \"angel of the home\" was becoming a popular [[stereotype]]. This rise of the middle class domestic morality made it increasingly harder for women to obtain work in certain professions, causing an increase in such areas as needle-trades, shop girls, [[Agricultural gang|agricultural gangs]], factory work, and domestic servants,{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=81}} all occupations with long hours and little pay. Low earnings, it is argued, meant that women had to resort to prostitution to be able to provide for themselves and their families, particularly in households where the main breadwinner was no longer around. The figures below, however, show this to be untrue. A study from the late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] period showed that more than 90 per cent of prostitutes in Millbank prison were the daughters of \"unskilled and semiskilled workingmen\", more than 50 per cent of whom had been servants, the rest having worked in dead-end jobs such as laundering, charring, and street selling.{{sfnp|Walkowitz|1980|p=16}}\n\nThe nature of the occupation makes it difficult to establish the exact number of prostitutes in operation during the Victorian Period. Judicial reports of the years 1857 to 1869 show that prostitutes were more common in commercial ports and pleasure resorts and less so in hardware towns, cotton and linen manufacturing centres and woollen and worsted centres.{{sfnp|Walkowitz|1980|p=22}} The Westminster Review placed the figure between 50,000 and 368,000.{{sfnp|Sigworth|Wyke|1980|p=77}} This would make prostitution the fourth-largest female occupation.

While many campaigns of civil resistance are intended for much more limited goals than revolution, generally a nonviolent revolution is characterized by simultaneous advocacy of [[democracy]], [[human rights]], and [[national independence]] in the country concerned. In some cases a campaign of civil resistance with a revolutionary purpose may be able to bring about the defeat of a dictatorial regime only if it obtains a degree of support from the armed forces, or at least their benevolent neutrality.\n\nAn effective campaign of civil resistance, and even the achievement of a nonviolent revolution, may be possible in a particular case despite the controlling government taking brutal measures against [[protest]]ers; the commonly held belief that most revolutions which have happened in [[Dictatorship|dictatorial]] regimes were bloody or violent uprisings is not borne out by historical analysis. Nonviolent revolutions in the 20th century became more successful and more common, especially in the 1980s as [[Cold War]] [[Military alliance|political alliances]] which supported [[status quo]] governance waned.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, intellectuals in the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Communist state]]s, and in some other countries, began to focus on [[civil resistance]] as the most promising means of opposing entrenched authoritarian regimes. The use of various forms of unofficial exchange of information, including by [[samizdat]], expanded. Two major revolutions during the 1980s strongly influenced [[political movement]]s that followed. The first was the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]], in the [[Philippines]] from which the term 'people power' came to be widely used, especially in [[Hispanic]] and [[Asia]]n nations.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1914872,00.html | work=Time | title=Corazon Aquino 1933\u20132009: The Saint of Democracy | date=August 17, 2009 | accessdate=May 20, 2010 | first=Hannah | last=Beech}}</ref> Three years later, the [[Revolutions of 1989]] that ousted [[communist]] regimes in the [[Eastern Bloc]] reinforced the concept (with the notable exception of the notoriously bloody [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]]), beginning with the victory of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] in [[1989 Polish legislative elections|that year's Polish legislative elections]]. The Revolutions of 1989 provided the template for the so-called [[color revolution]]s in mainly [[post-communist]] states, which tended to use a [[color]] or [[flower]] as a [[symbol]], somewhat in the manner of the [[Velvet Revolution]] in [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\nIn December 1989, inspired by the anti-communist revolutions in Eastern Europe, the [[Mongolian Democratic Union]] (MDU) organized popular street protests and hunger strikes [[1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia|against the communist regime]]. In 1990, dissidents in the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] started civil resistance against the government, but were initially crushed by [[Red Army]] in the [[Black January]] massacre.\n\nRecent nonviolent revolutions include the [[Orange Revolution]] in Ukraine, which was highlighted by a series of acts of [[civil disobedience]], [[sit-in]]s, and [[general strike]]s organized by the opposition movement.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{See also|Nonviolent resistance}}\nThe beginnings of the [[nonviolence]] movement lie in the [[satyagraha]] philosophy of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], who guided the people of [[British India|India]] to [[independence]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Despite the violence of the [[Partition of India]] following independence, and numerous revolutionary uprisings which were not under Gandhi's control, India's independence was achieved through legal processes after a period of national [[resistance movement|resistance]] rather than through a military revolution.\n\nAccording to the [[socialist]] [[Fourth International]], [[Karl Marx]] acknowledged a theoretical possibility of \"peaceful\" revolutions, but the Fourth International articles also say \"The development and preservation of good relations with the military forces is one of the absolute priorities of preparatory revolutionary work\". Some have argued that a nonviolent revolution would require fraternisation with military forces, like in the relatively nonviolent\nPortuguese [[Carnation Revolution]].<ref>[http://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1555 Dan Jakopovich: Revolution and the Party in Gramsci's Thought: A Modern Application.]</ref>\n\n== Peaceful revolution ==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2014}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2014}}\nA '''peaceful revolution''' or bloodless coup is an overthrow of a government that occurs without violence. If the [[revolutionist]]s refuse to use violence, it is known as a nonviolent revolution. If the revolutionists are willing to use force, but the [[loyalists]] (government) [[negotiate]] or [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] to divert armed conflict, it is called a [[bloodless war]].\n\nPeaceful revolutions that have occurred are the [[Bloodless Revolution|Bloodless Revolution (also known as the Glorious Revolution)]] of 1688 in [[United Kingdom]], the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986 in the [[Philippines]], and the [[peaceful revolution (German)|peaceful revolution]] of 1989 in [[Germany]].\n\n==As it relates to democracy==\n{{cleanup|section|reason=Arguments should also be reviewed by an expert in the area, in light of other sources/references.|date=March 2014}}\n\nOne theory of democracy is that its main purpose is to allow peaceful revolutions. The idea is that majorities voting in elections approximate the result of a coup. In 1962, [[John F. Kennedy]] famously said, \"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.\"<ref>JFK's \"Address on the First Anniversary of the Alliance for Progress,\" White House reception for diplomatic corps of the Latin American republics, March 13, 1962.

Affinity groups or nonviolent revolutionary groups are organized to provide support, maintain nonviolent discipline, organize and train other people into similar affinity groups and networks.\n\nStage 3 \u2013 Confrontation: Organized and sustained campaigns of picketing, strikes, sit-ins, marches, boycotts, die-ins, blockades to disrupt business as usual in institutions and government. By putting one's body on the line nonviolently the rising movement stops the normal gears of government and business.\n\nStage 4 \u2013 Mass Non Cooperation: Similar affinity groups and networks of affinity groups around the country and world, engage in similar actions to disrupt business as usual.\n\nStage 5 \u2013 Developing Parallel Institutions to take over functions and services of government and commerce. In order to create a new society without violence, oppression, environmental destruction, discrimination and one that is environmentally sustainable, nonviolent, democratic, equitable, tolerant, and fair, alternative organizations and structures including businesses must be created to provide the needed services and goods that citizens of a society need.\n\n[[Gene Sharp]], who influenced many in the [[Arab Spring]] revolutions, has documented and described over 198 different methods of nonviolent action that nonviolent revolutionaries might use in struggle. He argues that no government or institution can rule without the [[consent of the governed]] or oppressed as that is the source of nonviolent power. Gandhi and Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] argued this as well.<ref>Sharp, Gene. (1973) ''[[The Politics of Nonviolent Action]]''.

These demonstrations are considered by many to be the first example of the revolutions that followed in Georgia and Ukraine; however, the Serbs adopted an approach that had already been used in parliamentary elections in [[Slovakia]] and [[Croatia]] in 1998 and 2000, respectively, characterized by civic mobilization through get-out-the-vote campaigns and unification of the political opposition. The protesters in Serbia didn't adopt a colour or specific symbol (the most recognizable symbol of the revolution was a stylized fist), and despite the commonalities, many others refer to Georgia as the most definite beginning of the series of \"colour revolutions.\" The demonstrations were supported by youth movement [[Otpor!]].\n* 2003 \u2013 The '''[[Rose Revolution]]''' in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], following the disputed [[2003 Georgia legislative election]], led to the overthrow of [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] and his replacement by [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] after [[2004 Georgia legislative election|new elections]] were held in March 2004. The Rose Revolution was supported by the civic resistance movement, [[Kmara]].\n* 2004 \u2013 The '''[[Orange Revolution]]''' in [[Ukraine]], followed the disputed second round of the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004 presidential election]] and led to the annulment of the result and the repeat of the round\u2014the leader of the opposition [[Viktor Yushchenko]] was declared President, defeating [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. The Orange Revolution was supported by [[Pora]].\n*[[2018 Armenian revolution|2018 \u2013 Armenian velvet revolution]] achieved in nonviolent transition of power to opposition, enjoying wide public support throughout the country.  In [[National Assembly (Armenia)|National Assembly]] [[2018 Armenian parliamentary election|elections]] held in seven months after resignation of the former leader the party of the new government gained 88% of votes. However, it is not common to refer to it as a [[Colour revolution|Colour Revolution]], nor do its leaders use the term.\n\n==== Revolutions in the Middle East ====\n\nThe media attention given to the [[color revolutions]] has inspired movements in the [[Middle East]], and their supporters, to adopt similar symbology.\n\n*The '''[[Cedar Revolution]]''' in [[Lebanon]] followed the assassination of opposition leader [[Rafik Hariri]] in 2005. Chiefly, the movement demanded the withdrawal of [[Syria]]n troops from Lebanon, ending a ''de facto'' [[Military occupation|occupation]]. Unlike the revolutions in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, this movement did not seek to overturn disputed election results, but did cause the pro-Syrian government of Lebanon to fall. Due to similarities in motivation and organization strategies, it is widely considered{{By whom|date=February 2011}} a cousin of the color revolutions.\n\n==== Revolutions in Latin America and Asia ====\n\nDrawing inspiration from the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986 in the [[Philippines]], as well as other succeeding [[color revolution]] movements, several [[South America]]n countries experienced what were effectively non-violent revolutions.\n\n* [[Dominican Republic]]- \"The Butterflies\" or \"Las Mariposas\".  The [[Mirabal sisters]] fought to change their government, by underground movements. Also, by rejecting sexual advances from the president himself.  Three sisters were ordered to be killed by the president at the time, Rafael Trujillo, and only one survived to tell the story. There is also a movie made about their ordeal.\n* [[Ecuador]] \u2013 The impeachment of President [[Lucio Gutierrez]], by the Congress of that country after days of increasing demonstrations and protests by citizens led by the citizens of [[Quito]], the capital. Thousands of demonstrators were present in the Plaza of Independence. Flags were waved in celebration shortly after Congress voted out Gutierrez 62-0. Airport runways were blocked by demonstrators to prevent Gutierrez from leaving the country. The former president was later given asylum by [[Brazil]] and was transported out of the country on April 24. Protesters also intended to depose the Congress after accusing the body of alleged corruption as well.\n* the [[Philippines]] \u2013 [[EDSA Revolution of 2001]] (EDSA II), a four-day popular revolt that peacefully overthrew Philippine [[President of the Philippines|president]] [[Joseph Estrada]] in January 2001, self-organized through [[Short message service|SMS]] messaging.\n\n==Current nonviolent resistance==\nSeveral countries are experiencing the rise of non-violent resistance movements with the intent of effecting a non-violent revolution.\n===Sudan===\nThe Sudanese Revolution was a major shift of political power in Sudan that started with protests throughout the streets of Sudan on 19 December 2018[25] and continued with sustained civil disobedience for about eight months, during which the 11 April 2019 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat deposed President Omar al-Bashir after thirty years in power, the 3 June Khartoum massacre took place under the leadership of the Transitional Military Council (TMC) that replaced al-Bashir, and in July and August 2019 the TMC and the Forces of Freedom and Change alliance (FFC) signed a Political Agreement and a Draft Constitutional Declaration legally defining a planned 39-month phase of transitional state institutions and procedures to return Sudan to a civilian democracy.[16][14][15] In August and September 2019, the TMC formally transferred executive power to a mixed military\u2013civilian collective head of state, the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, and to a civilian prime minister (Abdalla Hamdok) and a mostly civilian cabinet, while judicial power was apparently (according to Sudan Daily and Khartoum Star) transferred to Nemat Abdullah Khair, Sudan's first female Chief Justice.[18][19] This article mainly covers this eight-month period.

While many campaigns of civil resistance are intended for much more limited goals than revolution, generally a nonviolent revolution is characterized by simultaneous advocacy of [[democracy]], [[human rights]], and [[national independence]] in the country concerned. In some cases a campaign of civil resistance with a revolutionary purpose may be able to bring about the defeat of a dictatorial regime only if it obtains a degree of support from the armed forces, or at least their benevolent neutrality.\n\nAn effective campaign of civil resistance, and even the achievement of a nonviolent revolution, may be possible in a particular case despite the controlling government taking brutal measures against [[protest]]ers; the commonly held belief that most revolutions which have happened in [[Dictatorship|dictatorial]] regimes were bloody or violent uprisings is not borne out by historical analysis. Nonviolent revolutions in the 20th century became more successful and more common, especially in the 1980s as [[Cold War]] [[Military alliance|political alliances]] which supported [[status quo]] governance waned.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, intellectuals in the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Communist state]]s, and in some other countries, began to focus on [[civil resistance]] as the most promising means of opposing entrenched authoritarian regimes. The use of various forms of unofficial exchange of information, including by [[samizdat]], expanded. Two major revolutions during the 1980s strongly influenced [[political movement]]s that followed. The first was the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]], in the [[Philippines]] from which the term 'people power' came to be widely used, especially in [[Hispanic]] and [[Asia]]n nations.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1914872,00.html | work=Time | title=Corazon Aquino 1933\u20132009: The Saint of Democracy | date=August 17, 2009 | accessdate=May 20, 2010 | first=Hannah | last=Beech}}</ref> Three years later, the [[Revolutions of 1989]] that ousted [[communist]] regimes in the [[Eastern Bloc]] reinforced the concept (with the notable exception of the notoriously bloody [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]]), beginning with the victory of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] in [[1989 Polish legislative elections|that year's Polish legislative elections]]. The Revolutions of 1989 provided the template for the so-called [[color revolution]]s in mainly [[post-communist]] states, which tended to use a [[color]] or [[flower]] as a [[symbol]], somewhat in the manner of the [[Velvet Revolution]] in [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\nIn December 1989, inspired by the anti-communist revolutions in Eastern Europe, the [[Mongolian Democratic Union]] (MDU) organized popular street protests and hunger strikes [[1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia|against the communist regime]]. In 1990, dissidents in the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] started civil resistance against the government, but were initially crushed by [[Red Army]] in the [[Black January]] massacre.\n\nRecent nonviolent revolutions include the [[Orange Revolution]] in Ukraine, which was highlighted by a series of acts of [[civil disobedience]], [[sit-in]]s, and [[general strike]]s organized by the opposition movement.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{See also|Nonviolent resistance}}\nThe beginnings of the [[nonviolence]] movement lie in the [[satyagraha]] philosophy of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], who guided the people of [[British India|India]] to [[independence]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Despite the violence of the [[Partition of India]] following independence, and numerous revolutionary uprisings which were not under Gandhi's control, India's independence was achieved through legal processes after a period of national [[resistance movement|resistance]] rather than through a military revolution.\n\nAccording to the [[socialist]] [[Fourth International]], [[Karl Marx]] acknowledged a theoretical possibility of \"peaceful\" revolutions, but the Fourth International articles also say \"The development and preservation of good relations with the military forces is one of the absolute priorities of preparatory revolutionary work\". Some have argued that a nonviolent revolution would require fraternisation with military forces, like in the relatively nonviolent\nPortuguese [[Carnation Revolution]].<ref>[http://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1555 Dan Jakopovich: Revolution and the Party in Gramsci's Thought: A Modern Application.]</ref>\n\n== Peaceful revolution ==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2014}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2014}}\nA '''peaceful revolution''' or bloodless coup is an overthrow of a government that occurs without violence. If the [[revolutionist]]s refuse to use violence, it is known as a nonviolent revolution. If the revolutionists are willing to use force, but the [[loyalists]] (government) [[negotiate]] or [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] to divert armed conflict, it is called a [[bloodless war]].\n\nPeaceful revolutions that have occurred are the [[Bloodless Revolution|Bloodless Revolution (also known as the Glorious Revolution)]] of 1688 in [[United Kingdom]], the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986 in the [[Philippines]], and the [[peaceful revolution (German)|peaceful revolution]] of 1989 in [[Germany]].\n\n==As it relates to democracy==\n{{cleanup|section|reason=Arguments should also be reviewed by an expert in the area, in light of other sources/references.|date=March 2014}}\n\nOne theory of democracy is that its main purpose is to allow peaceful revolutions. The idea is that majorities voting in elections approximate the result of a coup. In 1962, [[John F. Kennedy]] famously said, \"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.\"<ref>JFK's \"Address on the First Anniversary of the Alliance for Progress,\" White House reception for diplomatic corps of the Latin American republics, March 13, 1962.

Affinity groups or nonviolent revolutionary groups are organized to provide support, maintain nonviolent discipline, organize and train other people into similar affinity groups and networks.\n\nStage 3 \u2013 Confrontation: Organized and sustained campaigns of picketing, strikes, sit-ins, marches, boycotts, die-ins, blockades to disrupt business as usual in institutions and government. By putting one's body on the line nonviolently the rising movement stops the normal gears of government and business.\n\nStage 4 \u2013 Mass Non Cooperation: Similar affinity groups and networks of affinity groups around the country and world, engage in similar actions to disrupt business as usual.\n\nStage 5 \u2013 Developing Parallel Institutions to take over functions and services of government and commerce. In order to create a new society without violence, oppression, environmental destruction, discrimination and one that is environmentally sustainable, nonviolent, democratic, equitable, tolerant, and fair, alternative organizations and structures including businesses must be created to provide the needed services and goods that citizens of a society need.\n\n[[Gene Sharp]], who influenced many in the [[Arab Spring]] revolutions, has documented and described over 198 different methods of nonviolent action that nonviolent revolutionaries might use in struggle. He argues that no government or institution can rule without the [[consent of the governed]] or oppressed as that is the source of nonviolent power. Gandhi and Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] argued this as well.<ref>Sharp, Gene. (1973) ''[[The Politics of Nonviolent Action]]''.

The protests ended in bloodshed after an intervention of miners called in by President [[Ion Iliescu]]  (the [[Mineriad#June 1990 mineriad|Mineriad]]).\n* The successful resistance to [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]], which had the effect of a revolution, was mostly non-violent.\n\n==== Outside of the Warsaw Pact ====\n* 1974 \u2013 The [[Carnation Revolution]] in [[Portugal]].\n* 1979 \u2013 The [[Iranian Revolution]] in [[Iran]].\n* 1986 \u2013 The [[People Power Revolution]] (EDSA I People Power Revolution) in the [[Philippines]], where the term ''people power'' was coined. The nonviolent revolution led to the removal of dictator Ferdinand Marcos and the end of his 21-year regime. The success of the event then led to the restoration of democracy in the Philippines.\n* 1990 \u2013 The [[Mongolian Revolution of 1990]]\n* 1969 \u2013 The [[al-Fateh Revolution]] in [[Libya]]\n\n=== Post\u2013Cold War period ===\n\n==== Colour revolutions ====\n\n{{Main|Colour revolution}}\n\nThese are revolutions in [[post-communist]] [[authoritarian]] Europe and other new countries that were part of the former [[Soviet Union]] or [[Warsaw Pact]]. Each of these had massive street protests and/or followed disputed elections and led to the resignation or overthrow of leaders considered by their opponents to be [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]. Almost all of them used a particular colour or a flower to be their symbol of unity.\n\n* 2000 \u2013 The '''[[Overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Bulldozer Revolution]]''', which led to the overthrow of [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]. These demonstrations are considered by many to be the first example of the revolutions that followed in Georgia and Ukraine; however, the Serbs adopted an approach that had already been used in parliamentary elections in [[Slovakia]] and [[Croatia]] in 1998 and 2000, respectively, characterized by civic mobilization through get-out-the-vote campaigns and unification of the political opposition. The protesters in Serbia didn't adopt a colour or specific symbol (the most recognizable symbol of the revolution was a stylized fist), and despite the commonalities, many others refer to Georgia as the most definite beginning of the series of \"colour revolutions.\" The demonstrations were supported by youth movement [[Otpor!]].\n* 2003 \u2013 The '''[[Rose Revolution]]''' in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], following the disputed [[2003 Georgia legislative election]], led to the overthrow of [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] and his replacement by [[Mikhail Saakashvili]] after [[2004 Georgia legislative election|new elections]] were held in March 2004. The Rose Revolution was supported by the civic resistance movement, [[Kmara]].\n* 2004 \u2013 The '''[[Orange Revolution]]''' in [[Ukraine]], followed the disputed second round of the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004 presidential election]] and led to the annulment of the result and the repeat of the round\u2014the leader of the opposition [[Viktor Yushchenko]] was declared President, defeating [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. The Orange Revolution was supported by [[Pora]].\n*[[2018 Armenian revolution|2018 \u2013 Armenian velvet revolution]] achieved in nonviolent transition of power to opposition, enjoying wide public support throughout the country.  In [[National Assembly (Armenia)|National Assembly]] [[2018 Armenian parliamentary election|elections]] held in seven months after resignation of the former leader the party of the new government gained 88% of votes. However, it is not common to refer to it as a [[Colour revolution|Colour Revolution]], nor do its leaders use the term.\n\n==== Revolutions in the Middle East ====\n\nThe media attention given to the [[color revolutions]] has inspired movements in the [[Middle East]], and their supporters, to adopt similar symbology.\n\n*The '''[[Cedar Revolution]]''' in [[Lebanon]] followed the assassination of opposition leader [[Rafik Hariri]] in 2005. Chiefly, the movement demanded the withdrawal of [[Syria]]n troops from Lebanon, ending a ''de facto'' [[Military occupation|occupation]]. Unlike the revolutions in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, this movement did not seek to overturn disputed election results, but did cause the pro-Syrian government of Lebanon to fall. Due to similarities in motivation and organization strategies, it is widely considered{{By whom|date=February 2011}} a cousin of the color revolutions.\n\n==== Revolutions in Latin America and Asia ====\n\nDrawing inspiration from the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986 in the [[Philippines]], as well as other succeeding [[color revolution]] movements, several [[South America]]n countries experienced what were effectively non-violent revolutions.\n\n* [[Dominican Republic]]- \"The Butterflies\" or \"Las Mariposas\".  The [[Mirabal sisters]] fought to change their government, by underground movements. Also, by rejecting sexual advances from the president himself.  Three sisters were ordered to be killed by the president at the time, Rafael Trujillo, and only one survived to tell the story. There is also a movie made about their ordeal.\n* [[Ecuador]] \u2013 The impeachment of President [[Lucio Gutierrez]], by the Congress of that country after days of increasing demonstrations and protests by citizens led by the citizens of [[Quito]], the capital. Thousands of demonstrators were present in the Plaza of Independence. Flags were waved in celebration shortly after Congress voted out Gutierrez 62-0. Airport runways were blocked by demonstrators to prevent Gutierrez from leaving the country. The former president was later given asylum by [[Brazil]] and was transported out of the country on April 24. Protesters also intended to depose the Congress after accusing the body of alleged corruption as well.\n* the [[Philippines]] \u2013 [[EDSA Revolution of 2001]] (EDSA II), a four-day popular revolt that peacefully overthrew Philippine [[President of the Philippines|president]] [[Joseph Estrada]] in January 2001, self-organized through [[Short message service|SMS]] messaging.\n\n==Current nonviolent resistance==\nSeveral countries are experiencing the rise of non-violent resistance movements with the intent of effecting a non-violent revolution.\n===Sudan===\nThe Sudanese Revolution was a major shift of political power in Sudan that started with street protests throughout Sudan on 19 December 2018[25] and continued with sustained civil disobedience for about eight months, during which the 11 April 2019 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat deposed President Omar al-Bashir after thirty years in power, the 3 June Khartoum massacre took place under the leadership of the Transitional Military Council (TMC) that replaced al-Bashir, and in July and August 2019 the TMC and the Forces of Freedom and Change alliance (FFC) signed a Political Agreement and a Draft Constitutional Declaration legally defining a planned 39-month phase of transitional state institutions and procedures to return Sudan to a civilian democracy.[16][14][15] In August and September 2019, the TMC formally transferred executive power to a mixed military\u2013civilian collective head of state, the Sovereignty Council of Sudan, and to a civilian prime minister (Abdalla Hamdok) and a mostly civilian cabinet, while judicial power was apparently (according to Sudan Daily and Khartoum Star) transferred to Nemat Abdullah Khair, Sudan's first female Chief Justice.[18][19] This article mainly covers this eight-month period. See Terminology below for debates on the definition of the \"Sudanese Revolution\", which may also be interpreted to include the period during the prime ministership of Abdalla Hamdok, who promised that the transitional period would carry out \"the program\" of the revolution\n\n===Bahrain===\n{{main|Bahraini uprising (2011\u2013present)}}\n[[File:Hundreds of thousands of Bahrainis taking part in march of loyalty to martyrs.jpg|thumb|right|Over 100,000 protesters took part in a [[March of loyalty to martyrs|pro-democracy march]] on February 22, 2011.]]\nInspired by the regional [[Arab Spring]], protests started in Bahrain on [[Day of Rage (Bahrain)|February 14]].<ref name=\"reutbahsoe\"/><ref name=\"bici\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bici.org.bh/|title=Report of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry |publisher=BICI}}</ref>{{rp|162\u20133}} The government responded harshly, [[Bloody Thursday (2011)|killing]] four protesters camping in [[Pearl Roundabout]].<ref name=\"bici\"/>{{rp|73\u20134}} Later, protesters were allowed to reoccupy the roundabout where they staged [[March of loyalty to martyrs|large marches]] amounting to 150,000 participants.<ref name=\"bici\"/>{{rp|88}}\n\nOn March 14, [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]]-led [[Peninsula Shield|GCC forces]] were requested by the government and entered the country,<ref name=\"bici\" />{{rp|132}} which the opposition called an \"occupation\".<ref name=\"BBCBahr14Mar\">{{cite news| title = Gulf States Send Force to Bahrain Following Protests | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12729786 |publisher=BBC News  | date=March 14, 2011 | accessdate=April 15, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110420040119/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12729786| archivedate= April 20, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> The following day [[state of emergency]] was declared<ref name=\"reutbahsoe\">{{cite news|title=Bahrain declares state of emergency after unrest|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/03/15/us-bahrain-emergency-idUKTRE72E3E620110315|work=Reuters|date=March 15, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"bici\" />{{rp|139}} and protests paused<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/28/us-bahrain-idUSBRE85R0SG20120628 \"Bahrain says seizes explosives, fines protest chief\"].

In accordance to limits imposed by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] on the number of radio stations a single broadcasting entity can own in a single market, Tyler sold [[KTLR]] and [[KKNG]] to WPA Radio for $1.6 million.<ref>[http://www.radioink.com/Article.asp?id=2494638&spid=24698 Is Renda Cashing Out?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216060021/http://www.radioink.com/Article.asp?id=2494638&spid=24698 |date=2013-12-16 }}, ''RadioInk'', July 16, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/in-oklahoma-city-tyler-spins-two-so-it-can-buy-four-from-renda-for-40m In Oklahoma City, Tyler spins two so it can buy four from Renda (for $40M)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722222952/http://www.radio-info.com/news/in-oklahoma-city-tyler-spins-two-so-it-can-buy-four-from-renda-for-40m |date=2012-07-22 }}, ''RadioInfo'', July 16, 2012.</ref> Tyler's purchase of KOMA and its sister stations was consummated on November 13, 2012.\n\n==Oklahoma City sister stations==\n*[[KEBC]] 1560 AM - [[Sports]]\n*[[KJKE]] 93.3 FM - [[Country music|Country]]\n*[[KMGL]] 104.1 FM - [[Adult contemporary|Adult Contemporary]]\n*[[KOKC (AM)|KOKC]] 1520 AM - [[All-news radio|News]]/[[Talk radio|Talk]]\n*[[KRXO-FM]] 107.7 FM - [[Sports]]\n*[[KTUZ-FM|KTUZ]] 106.7 FM - [[Spanish language|Spanish]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.komaradio.com KOMA official website]\n{{FM station data|KOMA}}\n*{{FMQ|K225BN}}\n*{{FXL|K225BN}}\n*{{FXL|K276EX}}\n*[http://www.dddynamo.com Danny Williams]\n*[http://www.kent-jones.com Kent Jones Productions]\n*[http://www.fybush.com/sites/2004/site-040129.html  Renda's OKC Studios]\n*[http://voicesofoklahoma.com/danny_williams.html Voices of Oklahoma interview with Danny Williams].

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n=Squadron History=\n\n==1950s==\n\n===Roots===\n[[File:Consolidated PB4Y-2 Naval Aviation Museum.jpg|left|thumb|PB4Y-2 BuNo 66261 (marked as BuNo 66304) in the collection of the [[National Naval Aviation Museum]] at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]].]]\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified [[PB4Y-2 Privateer|PB4Y-2 Privateers]] from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig], and [[RAF Hal Far|Malta]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig], and [[RAF Hal Far|Malta]].\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.

The county is best known for its white sand beaches and emerald green water, where large pods of dolphins swim year-round. These beaches attract hundreds of thousands of visitors from all over the world each year.\n\n==History==\nOn February 12, 1913, representatives from five towns on [[St. Andrews Bay (Florida)|St. Andrews Bay]] met in Panama City to select a name for a proposed new county. The name Bay was selected because it was satisfactory to the majority of the citizens and descriptive of the territory that would be included. On July 1, 1913, the Legislature created Bay County from portions of [[Washington County, Florida|Washington]], [[Calhoun County, Florida|Calhoun]] and [[Walton County, Florida|Walton]] counties.\n\nPanama City was where ''[[Gideon v.
