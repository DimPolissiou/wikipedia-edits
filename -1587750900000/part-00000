Maratha commanders [[Raghunathrao|Raghunath Rao]], the Peshwa's brother, [[Shamsher Bahadur I (Krishna Rao)|Shamsher Bahadur]], the Peshwa's half-brother, and [[Sadashivrao Bhau|Sadashiv Rao Bhau]], the Peshwa's cousin, defeat the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] and capture their commander of artillery [[Ibrahim Khan Gardi]], with Sadashiv inducting him into the [[Maratha Army]] as their commander of artillery. They return home to the Empire's capital at [[Pune]] and are welcomed.  Due to pressure by his wife [[Gopikabai|Gopika Bai]], the Peshwa appoints Sadashiv as the Empire's finance minister in favour of the Peshwa's son [[Vishwasrao|Vishwas Rao]], which he reluctantly accepts. \n\nSadashiv lists the defaulters who failed to pay taxes to the Maratha Empire on time, and notes that the Rohilla chieftain [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] has the largest amount of tax due. Najib, determined to teach the Marathas a lesson, allies himself with [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali]], inviting him to Delhi. News of this formidable alliance reaches Pune, along with the news of [[Dattaji Rao Scindia|Dattaji Shinde]]'s death in battle against Najib. The Peshwa appoints Raghunath Rao as the commander of the Maratha forces which will be dispatched to fight Abdali and defend Delhi. However, Raghunath asks for a large amount of money, which Sadashiv denies, citing the treasury's condition after consecutive battles. Raghunath, therefore, refuses to march north, which leads the Peshwa to appoint Sadashiv as the commander-in-chief of the Maratha army, under the overlordship of [[Vishwasrao|Vishwas Rao]], the Peshwa's son and heir. The army, along with a large number of non-combatants (women, children and pilgrims), begin their long and arduous journey north.\n\nThey arrive at [[Dholpur]], where they're welcomed by their fellow Maratha generals\u2014 Govind Pant Bundela, Balwant Rao Mehendale, Jankoji Shinde, and the veteran Malhar Rao Holkar. They start making alliances with other kingdoms, including [[Suraj Mal|Maharaja Suraj Mal]] and [[Shuja-ud-Daula|Nawab Shuja-ud-Daulah]], and are successful, with their army size growing to 50000 men. Abdali is also making alliances, taking advantage of the Rajput kings' hatred for the Marathas. Sadashiv and the commanders receive intelligence that Abdali has camped on the other side of the [[Yamuna]] and spot Shuja's flags along with Abdali's, revealing that the Nawab had switched allegiance. Due to the heavy rains, the Marathas are unable to build a bridge to cross the Yamuna. Sadashiv decides to march north and capture Delhi and then cross the Yamuna to defeat Abdali.\n\nNajib receives intelligence that the Marathas have retreated, from which Abdali deduces that they are marching north to Delhi. He suggests that they also march north and cross the Yamuna. Meanwhile, the Marathas defeat Najib's general and capture Delhi. After finding out the Afghans are chasing the Marathas, Sadashiv decides to strategically capture Kunjpura Fort, which angers Abdali to such an extent that he immediately reacts by crossing the swollen Yamuna in heavy rainfall. This leaves the [[Maharaja of Patiala]], [[Ala Singh]], unable to send his soldiers. Food begins to dwindle, and the Maratha soldiers and civilians are forced to go without food. Although the arrival of King Araadhak Singh provides some relief to the Maratha camp, but soon after camping at [[Panipat]], Abdali catches up with the Marathas and comes face to face. However, after hearing of a possible [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] at his capital in [[Kandahar]], Abdali arranges for a truce with Sadashiv but scraps it after the latter doesn't agree with to terms Abdali presents him. After both sides decide strategies and formations, they prepare for the [[Third Battle of Panipat|final confrontation]].\n\n[[Parvatibai|Parvati Bai]] and the civilians and pilgrims stay at a small camp towards the back, and Vishwas promises Sadashiv that he'll never get off his elephant during the battle for his own protection. Artillery firing begins by both sides, with substantial damage done to Abdali's army due to Ibrahim Khan's leadership. The riflemen also start attacking. The infantry then begin the main attack, with the Marathas doing well. Overcome with fear, many soldiers of Abdali's army retreat, but Abdali threatens them with severe punishment and forces them to return to the battle. Meanwhile, on seeing Shamsher wounded, Vishwas descends from his elephant to protect him. Sadashiv fends off the Afghans who attacked the young prince, but a bullet hits Vishwas on his head, killing him. This is a huge blow to the morale of the Marathas, who begin to lose ground from then. One by one, the Maratha chieftains are either wounded or killed. Araadhak Singh unexpectedly retreats from the battle. It is then revealed that he was angry with the Marathas for the high taxes imposed upon them, so he secretly allied himself with Abdali and passed information onto him. Seeing the tide of the battle turn, Malhar Rao retreats from the battlefield and escorts the non-combatants to safety, as promised to Sadashiv on the eve of the battle. Abdali's soldiers close in on Sadashiv but he bravely fights back, sustaining serious injuries. He eventually succumbs to his wounds and dies, but not before making Abdali aware of his pyrrhic victory.\n\nBack in Pune, Parvati Bai dies from grief. Abdali sends the Peshwa a letter, praising Sadashiv's bravery and courage. The epilogue reveals that even though victorious, Abdali never returned to India. Under the leadership of [[Madhavrao I|Peshwa Madhav Rao]], the generals [[Mahadaji Shinde]] and [[Tukoji Rao Holkar]] saved the Maratha empire from extinction, and [[Maratha Resurrection|re-captured Delhi]] ten years later, making the Marathas a dominant force once again.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Arjun Kapoor]] as [[Sadashivrao Bhau|Sadashiv Rao Bhau]]\n*[[Sanjay Dutt]] as [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali]]\n*[[Kriti Sanon]] as [[Parvatibai|Parvati Bai]]\n*[[Mantra (actor)|Mantra]] as [[Najib ad-Dawlah|Najib-Ud-Daula]]\n*[[Mohnish Bahl]] as [[Balaji Baji Rao|Nana Saheb Peshwa]]\n*[[Padmini Kolhapure]] as [[Gopikabai|Gopika Bai]] (Peshwinbai)\n*[[Sahil Salathia]] as [[Shamsher Bahadur I (Krishna Rao)|Shamsher Bahadur]]\n*[[Kunal Kapoor (actor)|Kunal Kapoor]] as [[Shuja-ud-Daula]]\n*[[Mir Sarwar]] as [[Imad-ul-Mulk]]\n*[[Milind Gunaji]] as Sardar Dattaji Shinde\n*Abhishek Nigam as [[Vishwasrao|Vishwas Rao]] Peshwa\n*[[Ravindra Mahajani]] as Subhedar [[Malhar Rao Holkar]]\n*[[Gashmeer Mahajani]] as Sardar[[Jankoji Rao Scindia|Jankoji Shinde]]\n*[[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as [[Ibrahim Khan Gardi]]\n* Kashyap Parulekar as [[Raghunathrao|Raghunath Rao]]\n*[[Suhasini Mulay]] as Radhabai\n*[[S.

Maratha commanders [[Raghunathrao|Raghunath Rao]], the Peshwa's brother, [[Shamsher Bahadur I (Krishna Rao)|Shamsher Bahadur]], the Peshwa's half-brother, and [[Sadashivrao Bhau|Sadashiv Rao Bhau]], the Peshwa's cousin, defeat the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] and capture their commander of artillery [[Ibrahim Khan Gardi]], with Sadashiv inducting him into the [[Maratha Army]] as their commander of artillery. They return home to the Empire's capital at [[Pune]] and are welcomed.  Due to pressure by his wife [[Gopikabai|Gopika Bai]], the Peshwa appoints Sadashiv as the Empire's finance minister in favour of the Peshwa's son [[Vishwasrao|Vishwas Rao]], which he reluctantly accepts. \n\nSadashiv lists the defaulters who failed to pay taxes to the Maratha Empire on time, and notes that the Rohilla chieftain [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] has the largest amount of tax due. Najib, determined to teach the Marathas a lesson, allies himself with [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali]], inviting him to Delhi. News of this formidable alliance reaches Pune, along with the news of [[Dattaji Rao Scindia|Dattaji Shinde]]'s death in battle against Najib. The Peshwa appoints Raghunath Rao as the commander of the Maratha forces which will be dispatched to fight Abdali and defend Delhi. However, Raghunath asks for a large amount of money, which Sadashiv denies, citing the treasury's condition after consecutive battles. Raghunath, therefore, refuses to march north, which leads the Peshwa to appoint Sadashiv as the commander-in-chief of the Maratha army, under the overlordship of [[Vishwasrao|Vishwas Rao]], the Peshwa's son and heir. The army, along with a large number of non-combatants (women, children and pilgrims), begin their long and arduous journey north.\n\nThey arrive at [[Dholpur]], where they're welcomed by their fellow Maratha generals\u2014 Govind Pant Bundela, Balwant Rao Mehendale, Jankoji Shinde, and the veteran Malhar Rao Holkar. They start making alliances with other kingdoms, including [[Suraj Mal|Maharaja Suraj Mal]] and [[Shuja-ud-Daula|Nawab Shuja-ud-Daulah]], and are successful, with their army size growing to 50000 men. Abdali is also making alliances, taking advantage of the Rajput kings' hatred for the Marathas. Sadashiv and the commanders receive intelligence that Abdali has camped on the other side of the [[Yamuna]] and spot Shuja's flags along with Abdali's, revealing that the Nawab had switched allegiance. Due to the heavy rains, the Marathas are unable to build a bridge to cross the Yamuna. Sadashiv decides to march north and capture Delhi and then cross the Yamuna to defeat Abdali.\n\nNajib receives intelligence that the Marathas have retreated, from which Abdali deduces that they are marching north to Delhi. He suggests that they also march north and cross the Yamuna. Meanwhile, the Marathas defeat Najib's general and capture Delhi. After finding out the Afghans are chasing the Marathas, Sadashiv decides to strategically capture Kunjpura Fort, which angers Abdali to such an extent that he immediately reacts by crossing the swollen Yamuna in heavy rainfall. This leaves the [[Maharaja of Patiala]], [[Ala Singh]], unable to send his soldiers. Food begins to dwindle, and the Maratha soldiers and civillians are forced to go without food. Although the arrival of King Araadhak Singh provides some relief to the Maratha camp, but soon after camping at [[Panipat]], Abdali catches up with the Marathas and comes face to face. However, after hearing of a possible [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] at his capital in [[Kandahar]], Abdali arranges for a truce with Sadashiv but scraps it after the latter doesn't agree with to terms Abdali presents him. After both sides decide strategies and formations, they prepare for the [[Third Battle of Panipat|final confrontation]].\n\n[[Parvatibai|Parvati Bai]] and the civilians and pilgrims stay at a small camp towards the back, and Vishwas promises Sadashiv that he'll never get off his elephant during the battle for his own protection. Artillery firing begins by both sides, with substantial damage done to Abdali's army due to Ibrahim Khan's leadership. The riflemen also start attacking. The infantry then begin the main attack, with the Marathas doing well. Overcome with fear, many soldiers of Abdali's army retreat, but Abdali threatens them with severe punishment and forces them to return to the battle. Meanwhile, on seeing Shamsher wounded, Vishwas descends from his elephant to protect him. Sadashiv fends off the Afghans who attacked the young prince, but a bullet hits Vishwas on his head, killing him. This is a huge blow to the morale of the Marathas, who begin to lose ground from then. One by one, the Maratha chieftains are either wounded or killed. Araadhak Singh unexpectedly retreats from the battle. It is then revealed that he was angry with the Marathas for the high taxes imposed upon them, so he secretly allied himself with Abdali and passed information onto him. Seeing the tide of the battle turn, Malhar Rao retreats from the battlefield and escorts the non-combatants to safety, as promised to Sadashiv on the eve of the battle. Abdali's soldiers close in on Sadashiv but he bravely fights back, sustaining serious injuries. He eventually succumbs to his wounds and dies, but not before making Abdali aware of his pyrrhic victory.\n\nBack in Pune, Parvati Bai dies from grief. Abdali sends the Peshwa a letter, praising Sadashiv's bravery and courage. The epilogue reveals that even though victorious, Abdali never returned to India. Under the leadership of [[Madhavrao I|Peshwa Madhav Rao]], the generals [[Mahadaji Shinde]] and [[Tukoji Rao Holkar]] saved the Maratha empire from extinction, and [[Maratha Resurrection|re-captured Delhi]] ten years later, making the Marathas a dominant force once again.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Arjun Kapoor]] as [[Sadashivrao Bhau|Sadashiv Rao Bhau]]\n*[[Sanjay Dutt]] as [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali]]\n*[[Kriti Sanon]] as [[Parvatibai|Parvati Bai]]\n*[[Mantra (actor)|Mantra]] as [[Najib ad-Dawlah|Najib-Ud-Daula]]\n*[[Mohnish Bahl]] as [[Balaji Baji Rao|Nana Saheb Peshwa]]\n*[[Padmini Kolhapure]] as [[Gopikabai|Gopika Bai]] (Peshwinbai)\n*[[Sahil Salathia]] as [[Shamsher Bahadur I (Krishna Rao)|Shamsher Bahadur]]\n*[[Kunal Kapoor (actor)|Kunal Kapoor]] as [[Shuja-ud-Daula]]\n*[[Mir Sarwar]] as [[Imad-ul-Mulk]]\n*[[Milind Gunaji]] as Sardar Dattaji Shinde\n*Abhishek Nigam as [[Vishwasrao|Vishwas Rao]] Peshwa\n*[[Ravindra Mahajani]] as Subhedar [[Malhar Rao Holkar]]\n*[[Gashmeer Mahajani]] as Sardar[[Jankoji Rao Scindia|Jankoji Shinde]]\n*[[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as [[Ibrahim Khan Gardi]]\n* Kashyap Parulekar as [[Raghunathrao|Raghunath Rao]]\n*[[Suhasini Mulay]] as Radhabai\n*[[S.

She married the head of the German Imperial House, [[Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia|Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Princess Kyra.jpg|left|thumb|{{center|Princess Kira of Russia, ca. 1912}}]]\nGrand Duchess Kira Kirilovna of Russia was born on 9 May 1909, at her parents' house on Avenue d' Henri Martin in [[Paris]]. Named after her father, she was the second child of [[Kirill Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia]], and his wife, [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. Her parents were then living in exile because their marriage had not been approved by Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] due to the fact that they were first cousins. The [[Russian Orthodox]] religion forbids the marriage of two first cousins, so they had been forced to live abroad. In addition, her mother had divorced her former husband, [[Ernst Ludwig, Grand Duke of Hesse]], the brother of the [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra Feodorovna]].\n\nShortly after Kira's birth, her parents were  restored to favor by Tsar Nicholas II and, in May 1910, the family returned to Russia. They settled at the Cavalier's house in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] as her father, a Captain in the Russian Navy, was attached to a nearby naval academy. Kira and her elder sister, [[Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna of Russia|Maria]], had a privileged childhood. They had an English nanny and learned the languages spoken by the Romanovs: [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]].\n\nKira's early years were spent in luxury at her father's palace on Nikolskaya street in [[Saint Petersburg]], where her parents entertained their guests lavishly. There were family outings with her grandmother at the opulent [[Vladimir Palace]] and in the summer at the Vladimir villa in Tsarskoye Selo.\n\n== War and revolution==\nThe family was spending the summer of 1914 on their yacht in the [[Gulf of Finland]] and were in [[Riga]] when the war broke out. During [[World War I]], Kira's father served as the commander of a unit of the Naval Guards, while her mother oversaw a motorized ambulance.

She married the head of the German Imperial House, [[Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia|Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Princess Kyra.jpg|left|thumb|{{center|Princess Kira of Russia, ca. 1912}}]]\nGrand Duchess Kira Kirilovna of Russia was born on 9 May 1909, at her parents' house on Avenue d' Henri Martin in [[Paris]]. Named after her father, she was the second child of [[Kirill Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia]], and his wife, [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. Her parents were then living in exile because their marriage had not been approved by Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] due to the fact that they were first cousins. The [[Russian Orthodox]] religion forbids the marriage of two first cousins, so they had been forced to live abroad. In addition, her mother had divorced her former husband, [[Ernst Ludwig, Grand Duke of Hesse]], the brother of the [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra Feodorovna]].\n\nShortly after Kira's birth, her parents were  restored to favor by Tsar Nicholas II and, in May 1910, the family returned to Russia. They settled at the Cavalier's house in [[Tsarskoye Selo]] as her father, a Captain in the Russian Navy, was attached to a nearby naval academy. Kira and her elder sister, [[Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna of Russia|Maria]], had a privileged childhood. They had an English nanny and learned the languages spoken by the Romanovs: [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]].\n\nKira's early years were spent in luxury at her father's palace on Nikolskaya street in [[Saint Petersburg]], where her parents entertained their guests lavishly. There were family outings with her grandmother at the opulent [[Vladimir Palace]] and in the summer at the Vladimir villa in Tsarskoye Selo.\n\n== War and revolution==\nThe family was spending the summer of 1914 on their yacht in the [[Gulf of Finland]] and were in [[Riga]] when the war broke out. During [[World War I]], Kira's father served as the commander of a unit of the Naval Guards, while her mother oversaw a motorized ambulance. At the outbreak of the Russian revolution, Kira's father marched to the [[Tauride Palace]] at the head of the Naval Guards before the establishment of the [[Russian Provisional Government]].\n\nFollowing the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the family initially remained living at their palace amid the upheavals. In June, Kira's father obtained permission from the provisional government to move to [[Finland]]. Kira, eight at the time, recalled that they rode on a public train. \"For the first time there were no royal trappings ... i.e. red carpets, special comforts, etc.,\" she recalled.<ref>Michael John Sullivan, A Fatal Passion: The Story of the Uncrowned Last Empress of Russia, Random House, 1997, p. 322</ref> In Finland, the family lived at Haiko Manor, [[Porvoo|Borga]]. A month later, her 40-year-old mother gave birth to a son, [[Vladimir Kirillovich, Grand Duke of Russia|Vladimir]]. The family waited in Finland, hoping that the [[White Movement|White Russians]] would defeat the [[Bolshevik]]s and they could return to Russia. The family lived under harsh conditions, with food, fuel and money in short supply. Kira, then age nine, amused herself by taking long walks hunting for mushrooms, and as a treat went to the cinema every Friday.

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]] and Tall Girls Productions, with [[Melissa Rosenberg]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Krysten Ritter]] stars as Jones, while [[David Tennant]] plays Kilgrave. The two are joined by principal cast members [[Mike Colter]], [[Rachael Taylor]], [[Wil Traval]], [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]], [[Eka Darville]], and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]]. ''Jessica Jones'' entered development in late 2013, with Rosenberg reworking a series she had previously developed for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Ritter was cast as Jones in December 2014, and production took place in New York City from February to August 2015. The season addresses issues of rape and assault, and was always intended to be far more \"adult\" than other Marvel projects, particularly in terms of sex. The show's cinematography took inspiration from [[Neo-noir|noir]], while visual effects house Shade VFX focused on creating \"invisible\" effects that would support its realistic approach.\n\nThe first two episodes of the season premiered in New York City on November 17, 2015, with the full season of 13 episodes released on [[Netflix]] on November 20 to an estimated high viewership and critical acclaim. Critics praised the performances of Ritter and Tennant, as well as the season's noir tone, approach to sexuality, and coverage of darker topics such as rape, assault and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. The season was awarded a [[Peabody Award]] in the category of \"Entertainment and Children's programs\", and a [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation#Short Form|short form dramas]]. A [[Jessica Jones (season 2)|second season]] of ''Jessica Jones'' was ordered on January 17, 2016.<ref name=\"S2Order\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#6A498D |overall=5 |season=5 |title=29 |director=16 |writer=30 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-jessica-jones/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's jessica jones on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = AKA Ladies Night\n |DirectedBy      = [[S.

While not working, Jones spies on [[Luke Cage]], a bar owner who sees her looking into his bar and offers her free alcohol as a \"Ladies Night\" promotion, leading to the two sleeping together. She leaves upset after seeing a photo of a woman in his bathroom. Jones is approached by Barbara and Bob Shlottman after their daughter Hope began acting differently and disappeared. Jones discovers that Hope is with [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]], a man with mind control abilities who once controlled Jones, leaving her with [[PTSD]], and whom she believed was dead. Jones wants to flee, but is convinced by her friend and foster-sister [[Patsy Walker|Trish Walker]] to help Hope.

Jones lies to Cage that she had been hired by the husband of a woman who Cage had slept with. Cage, having not known that the woman was married, confronts the woman about it, and when she goes to her husband, he attacks Cage with a group. Jones helps fight off the men, and learns that Cage is gifted with unbreakable skin. Hogarth agrees to represent Shlottman if Jones can prove that Kilgrave exists. Jones remembers leaving Kilgrave to die after he was hit by a bus, and now tracks down the ambulance driver who had picked him up. The driver had donated both his kidneys to Kilgrave, and is now on dialysis. Jones finds the operating doctor who anonymously donated the dialysis machine. He agrees to testify for Shlottman, and reveals that he operated on Kilgrave without anesthesia since that would have blocked Kilgrave's abilities. When Hogarth meets with Shlottman, the latter reveals that Jones was once under Kilgrave's control as well.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = AKA It's Called Whiskey\n |DirectedBy      = [[David Petrarca]]\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=[[Liz Friedman]]|t=Liz Friedman & [[Scott Reynolds (writer)|Scott Reynolds]]}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jones and Cage bond over their mutual powers, while Jones also tracks down a surgical grade anesthetic to subdue Kilgrave with. Hogarth, now divorcing Wendy (who discovered the affair) and unwilling to risk herself and her reputation despite Wendy's testimony, organizes for Walker to interview Shlottman about Kilgrave live on her radio talk show. Walker asks that anyone who believes they have been approached or controlled by Kilgrave contact Hogarth, and then publicly insults Kilgrave on air. Angered, Kilgrave sends police sergeant Will Simpson to kill Walker, with Jones having to use the anesthetic on Walker to convince Simpson that he has carried out his orders. Jones follows Simpson back to Kilgrave, who orders Simpson to walk off a balcony. Jones again convinces Simpson that he has carried out this order by knocking him out and taking him to the street below, telling him as he wakes that she caught him. Searching through the house that Kilgrave was occupying, Jones discovers a room full of photographs of her.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = AKA 99 Friends\n |DirectedBy      = David Petrarca\n |WrittenBy       = [[Hilly Hicks, Jr.]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jones accepts a case from jewelry designer Audrey Eastman who seeks evidence of her husband cheating. Jones tracks Eastman's husband to a rendezvous with his girlfriend only to discover a trap set by Eastman, who blames gifted people for the death of her mother during \"[[The Avengers (2012 film)#Plot|the incident]]\" and who learned of Jones' powers from Spheeris. Angered as she recalls the death of her own parents, Jones convinces the Eastmans to leave her alone with a show of her power and a bluff over the number of other gifted in the city. Hogarth and Jones process a large number of people claiming to have been controlled by Kilgrave, forming a support group for those legitimately affected by him. Simpson attempts to apologize to a frightened Walker over his action while under Kilgrave's control; they eventually bond over the experience. Jones uses surveillance footage provided by Simpson and clues offered by the Kilgrave support group to learn that the photographer spying on her for Kilgrave is her drug addicted neighbor [[Malcolm Ducasse]]. \n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = AKA The Sandwich Saved Me\n |DirectedBy      = [[Stephen Surjik]]\n |WrittenBy       = Dana Baratta\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jones recalls her brief time as a superhero as she debates whether to save Ducasse or to use him as a means of locating Kilgrave. Walker and Simpson begin a romantic relationship with Jones grudgingly allowing him to assist in a plot to capture Kilgrave. Simpson supplies ex-special operations skills and contacts, including access to a hermetically sealed room in which Kilgrave could be kept once the effects of the anesthetic wear off. They follow Ducasse to his daily meeting with Kilgrave where photographs of Jones are exchanged for drugs, which Kilgrave had forced Ducasse to become addicted to so he would obey Kilgrave even after his powers wore off, after around 12 hours of no contact. Simpson shoots Kilgrave with the anesthetic; Jones refuses to let him kill Kilgrave so he can be used to prove Shlottman innocent. Jones gets Kilgrave to Walker and the getaway car, but they are attacked by hired bodyguards who escape with the unconscious Kilgrave.

After paying a fellow inmate to beat her, Shlottman confesses to Jones that she is pregnant with Kilgrave's child and has been trying to miscarry. Jones gives her an abortion pill; Hogarth secretly takes the fetal remains. Cage hires Jones to help find the brother of someone, who has evidence on the death of Cage's wife [[Reva Connors]]. Connors had left Cage instructions to find a box she had hidden, but it was not there when he looked. Jones recalls Kilgrave having Connors lead them to the box, with Jones digging it up before killing Connors. Jones and Cage find the missing brother, and are given the file of the bus driver that accidentally hit Kilgrave (and who Cage believes hit Connors). Seeing that the driver had been drunk, Cage seeks revenge. Jones intervenes and confesses that Kilgrave forced her to kill Connors.

Wendy refuses to sign the papers. Ducasse helps Jones back to her apartment, where they find her neighbor Ruben, dead. Knowingly blaming Kilgrave, Jones devises a desperate plan: get herself imprisoned in a [[supermax prison]] so when Kilgrave inevitably comes for her, his abilities will be caught on camera. Walker and Simpson have their own plan, with Simpson following Kilgrave's security detail, though he does not tell Walker when he finds them at Jones's old house. Ducasse disposes of Ruben's body, though Jones finds him. Enacting her plan, Jones goes to a police station with Ruben's severed head and confesses to his murder. Her processing is interrupted when Kilgrave takes control of the station and declares his love for Jones, as she was the first person to resist him.

Though he takes her phone so she cannot record him, she secretly gets Simpson's when she catches him sneaking into the house to plant a bomb. Not willing to let Kilgrave die until Shlottman is free, Jones tells Kilgrave about the bomb. Kilgrave, in an effort to prove that his nature was forced upon him, shows Jones a pendrive (which Connors had hidden in the box) containing footage of his parents experimenting on him as a child, and him eventually stopping them by his command. Jones shows Kilgrave that he can do good with his powers by convincing him to save several people. She visits Walker and asks whether she should stay with Kilgrave and try to use his abilities to change the world for good. When Jones, knowing that Kilgrave will harm some of his \"servants\" if she does not return, goes back to Kilgrave, she instead uses a distraction to incapacitate him, and flies away with him.

Kozlov gives him some pills, and his injuries heal miraculously. Jones imprisons Kilgrave in the hermetically sealed room, where she plans to torture him until he reveals his abilities on camera. Hogarth warns her that this would forfeit their case in court, and that the D.A. has offered a 20 year plea deal to Shlottman if she pleads guilty. Jones convinces Shlottman to not take the deal, and devises a new plan. From the footage of Kilgrave's experiments, Jones discovers the names of his parents, Louise and Albert Thompson, and from photographs realizes that his mother is a member of the support group. Jones confronts her and Albert, and convinces them to face their son. Jones also forces Clemons to act as a witness. In the cell, Kilgrave is remorseful, but Louise attempts to kill him to stop him from hurting anyone again, and he makes her kill herself.

Pam arrives, and accidentally kills Wendy to stop her by hitting her in the head with a [[vase]]. Thompson reveals that Kilgrave's abilities are a virus that he releases, and that a vaccine could be created from Jones's blood as Jones appears to have become immune to Kilgrave's influence. Simpson, under the influence of Kozlov's drugs (that enhance combat performance and numb pain) arrives at the cell, where Clemons is guarding the evidence needed to imprison Kilgrave. Set on killing Kilgrave instead, Simpson kills Clemons and destroys the evidence. He finds Walker with Thompson, who is unsuccessful in creating the vaccine, but she sends Simpson away when she sees how unstable he is, managing to take some of his pills from him in the process.

Affected by an increasing lack of sleep, Jones is injured in an accident, but does manage to find Clemons' body and deduces that Simpson killed him rather than Kilgrave. She agrees to meet with Simpson, and he attacks her in her apartment, overpowering the injured Jones. Walker arrives and uses Simpson's pills to help Jones defeat him. Not used to the pills, Walker requires medical attention. As she recovers in the hospital, Kozlov retrieves the unconscious Simpson from Jones's apartment, and Kilgrave warns Jones that he has found Cage; Jones finds Cage herself, in time to see his bar explode with him inside.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 12\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n |Title           = AKA Take a Bloody Number\n |DirectedBy      = [[Billy Gierhart]]\n |WrittenBy       = Hilly Hicks, Jr.\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Cage survives the explosion, and reveals to Jones that he was ordered by Kilgrave to destroy his bar.

After Cage recounts the events leading up to the explosion, in which he followed Jones to confront Kilgrave, they realize that Kilgrave is keeping Thompson alive to try and boost his abilities, and may be testing his increasing hold over people. While they investigate, Cage forgives Jones for her role in Connors' death, and the two begin to grow close again. They find a nightclub where Kilgrave tested his enhanced powers, and are confronted by him there. He reveals that he has been controlling Cage the whole time, having made him forgive Jones to earn her trust, and now unleashes Cage on Jones, escaping while they fight.

Thompson has been using the fetal remains that Hogarth kept, and believes that a full dose of his extracted drug could now make Kilgrave powerful enough to control Jones. Using Cage's phone, Jones tracks Kilgrave to the apartment of a wealthy couple, whom he has enslaved, in time to see Thompson die. Cage awakens, and decides to leave. Jones confronts Kilgrave at the couple's yacht, where he takes Walker hostage. When Jones allows this, Kilgrave believes that he finally has control over her again. However, when he tells her to say \"I love you\", Jones says it to Walker instead, and snaps Kilgrave's neck. Jones is arrested for the murder, but Hogarth secures her release, leaving her to get calls from people around the city who have heard of her heroics and seek her assistance.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Jessica Jones characters}}\n{{Columns-start|num=3}}\n\n===Main===<!-- Per the series' official crediting. -->\n* [[Krysten Ritter]] as [[Jessica Jones]]<ref name=\"Ritter\" />\n* [[Mike Colter]] as [[Luke Cage]]<ref name=\"Colter\" />\n* [[Rachael Taylor]] as [[Patsy Walker|Patricia \"Trish\" Walker]]<ref name=\"Taylor\" />\n* [[Wil Traval]] as [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Will Simpson]]<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" />\n* [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]] as Hope Shlottman<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" />\n* [[Eka Darville]] as [[Malcolm Ducasse]]<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" />\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeri Hogarth]]<ref name=\"Moss\" /><ref name=\"Moss2\" />\n* [[David Tennant]] as [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]]<ref name=\"Tennant\" />\n{{column}}\n\n===Recurring===<!-- The following all appear in 4 or more episode across the season, defined for this series as recurring. -->\n* Susie Abromeit as Pam<ref name=\"Abromeit\" />\n* [[Robin Weigert]] as Wendy Ross-Hogarth<ref name=\"Weigert\" />\n* Nichole Yannetty as Nicole<ref name=\"Ep3Cite\" />\n* Kieran Mulcare as Ruben<ref name=\"MinifieMulcare\" />\n* [[Clarke Peters]] as [[Oscar Clemons]]<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\"/>\n* [[Colby Minifie]] as Robyn<ref name=\"MinifieMulcare\"/>\n* [[Danielle Ferland]] as Clair<ref name=\"Supporters\" />\n* Gillian Glasco as Emma<ref name=\"Supporters\" />\n* Ryan Farrell as Jackson<ref name=\"Supporters\" />\n* Paul Pryce as Donald<ref name=\"Supporters\" />\n* [[Lisa Emery]] as Louise Thompson<ref name=\"ScienceAnalysis\" />\n* [[Michael Siberry]] as Albert Thompson<ref name=\"ScienceAnalysis\" />\n{{column}}\n\n===Notable guests===<!-- Only characters that have appeared previously in other MCU media -->\n* Royce Johnson as [[Brett Mahoney]]<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\"/>\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]]<ref name=\"DawsonJJ\" />\n{{Columns-end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nIn October 2013, Marvel and [[Disney]] announced that [[Marvel Television]] and [[ABC Studios]] would provide Netflix with live action series centered around [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[Luke Cage]], leading up to a miniseries based on the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref name=\"DeadlineNov2013\" /> [[Melissa Rosenberg]] was brought on to [[showrun]] the Jessica Jones series,<ref name=\"THRRosenbergHired\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineRosenbergHired\" /> to be reconfigured as a \"page one do-over\" from an original project she had developed in December 2010 for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].<ref name=\"AKAJones\" /><ref name=\"RosenbergLoebJuly2015\" /> In December 2014, the official title was revealed to be ''Marvel's A.K.A.

There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season.\" Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head [[Jeph Loeb]] said that the \"fun about being a private detective is that the line between what's legal and what's not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, as much as it is to go, 'Okay, can I pay the rent? How am I going to get through this day?'\" He also added that inspiration for the season came from \"the noir films from the '40s\" and \"film[s] like ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergLoebJuly2015\" />\n\nDescribing the tone of the season, Loeb said, \"When we first started talking about ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a psychological thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that's a very powerful, emotional place to start from.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called \"lazy storytelling\" and often a way to \"spice up\" male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an \"issue\" for the season to tackle.<ref name=\"RosenbergHRNov2015\" /> When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity and the use of the word 'fuck' in the season.<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /> Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as \"issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [and] issues of consent\" while also exploring \"feminism and being a woman in this world\", Rosenberg said, \"It was never our intention going in [to hit a social issue], and I think the minute you intend to do that, you're stepping up on a soap box. If you're digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you're going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you're also going to hit social issues.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes [[Krysten Ritter]] as [[Jessica Jones]],<ref name=\"Ritter\" /> [[Mike Colter]] as [[Luke Cage]],<ref name=\"Colter\" /> [[Rachael Taylor]] as [[Patsy Walker|Patricia \"Trish\" Walker]],<ref name=\"Taylor\" /> [[Wil Traval]] as [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Will Simpson]],<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]] as Hope Shlottman,<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> [[Eka Darville]] as [[Malcolm Ducasse]],<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /> [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]],<ref name=\"Moss\" /><ref name=\"Moss2\" /> and [[David Tennant]] as [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]].<ref name=\"Tennant\" />\n\nAppearing in recurring roles for the season are Susie Abromeit as Pam,<ref name=\"Abromeit\" /> Colby Minifie and Kieran Mulcare as Robyn and Ruben,<ref name=\"MinifieMulcare\" /> Nichole Yannetty as Nicole,<ref name=\"Ep3Cite\" /> [[Clarke Peters]] as Oscar Clemons,<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> [[Michael Siberry]] and [[Lisa Emery]] as Albert and Louise Thompson,<ref name=\"ScienceAnalysis\" /> and [[Robin Weigert]] as Wendy Ross-Hogarth.<ref name=\"Weigert\" /> [[Danielle Ferland]], Gillian Glasco, Ryan Farrell, and Paul Pryce also recur as victims of Kilgrave who join a support group established by Jones,<ref name=\"Supporters\" /> while [[Rosario Dawson]] and Royce Johnson reprise their roles of [[Claire Temple]] and Brett Mahoney, respectively, from ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"DawsonJJ\" />\n\n===Design===\nStephanie Maslansky returned as the costume designer for ''Jessica Jones'' from ''Daredevil'',<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> and was assisted on the first episode by Jenn Rogien, who crafted Jessica Jones' leather jacket, faded jeans, and boots costume.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> On Jones's costume, Maslansky said she \"considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from having to deal with the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way.\" At least 10 versions of Jones's jacket were made, which started as an [[Acne Studios]] leather motorcycle jacket that had any \"bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details\" removed. 20 pairs of jeans were used, with both sets of clothing being aged and distressed.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nBecause Jones's costume does not evolve much throughout the season, Maslansky used flashbacks to show how her costume had evolved to the present day: for 'pre-Kilgrave' Jessica Jones, Maslansky gave the character \"more pulled together\" clothes, albeit \"still kind of edgy\" clothes that did not change who she was as a character, but were just \"different\". For instance, in a flashback to Jones working in a corporate environment, she does not wear a suit, instead \"wear[s] her jeans and find[s] a really cool jacket, maybe a vintage thing, maybe something that she borrowed from Trish\". For a flashback where Jones wears a large sandwich costume, a \"variety\" of costumes were ordered online, with the chosen suit then distressed to \"look dirty and old\"; \"a mere shadow of its former sandwich self,\" becoming \"more of a hoagie than a sandwich.\" In another flashback, Jones imagines escaping Kilgrave's control. The bright yellow dress the character wears in the dream sequence was chosen for its juxtaposition to the character's real situation, with Maslansky calling it \"so beautiful and so free and so light\".<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" />\n\nFor Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits created by designer [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]], rather than custom-making them as she originally planned, as Smith \"was {{em|all}} about purple\" in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers \"wanted to find a place where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally \"fairly friendly color, and he's anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon.\"<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" /> Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone \"who wears his clothing like an armor,\" with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> For a character like Trish Walker, who does not have the same kind of \"statement costume\" as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so \"even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of [[rag & bone]] jeans with a [[Chlo\u00e9]] top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans.\" Maslansky added that Robin was \"a blast to dress\" because of her \"quirky\" personality, yet she was still able to \"put herself together aesthetically.\" For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming \"a little brighter and a little more hopeful.\"<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" />\n\n===Filming===\nIn February 2014, Marvel announced that ''Jessica Jones'' would be filmed in New York City.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> In April, Marvel Comics' [[Editor in chief|editor-in-chief]] [[Joe Quesada]] stated that the show would be filming in areas of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Long Island City]] that still look like the old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> The season went into production in February 2015 in [[The Bronx]] at [[Lehman College]] with the [[working title]] ''Violet'',<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /><ref name=\"DaredevilFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"FilmingBronx\" /> and aimed to film each episode over nine days, on average.<ref name=\"Billeter\" /> Filming concluded in mid-late August.<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" /> Other filming locations in New York City used included the East Village's Horseshoe Bar for Luke's Bar; the [[33rd Street (PATH station)|33rd Street PATH station]] and a [[PATH (rail system)|PATH]] train; the 101st Street area for the exterior of Jessica's apartment (with the interior apartment settings created on a sound stage); [[Douglaston, Queens]] for Jessica's childhood home; the [[Angel Orensanz Center]] for Jessica and Luke's fight in \"[[AKA Take a Bloody Number]]\"; [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower]] and Pier 88 for locations in \"[[AKA Smile]]\";<ref name=\"FilmingLocations\" /> the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]]; [[Nolita]]; near the 39th Street entrance to the [[Lincoln Tunnel]]; [[Tribeca]]; [[Bryant Park]]; [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]]; [[Gramercy Park|Gramercy]]; [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]] near the [[Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant]]; [[Long Island City]], including the Allied Extruder Factory for the weed growing facility, with exteriors shots taken from near [[Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York)|Calvary Cemetery]]; the [[Queensboro Bridge]] on the Queens side; the [[Manhattan Bridge]]; the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]; [[Bethesda Terrace and Fountain]] in [[Central Park]]; and [[Industry City]].<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" />\n\nConcerning inspirations on the season, Loeb revealed that \"''Chinatown''... is one of the things that influenced [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Michael Gaydos]] when they created the character. So those kind of beautiful, long, wide expansive shots, where people sort of come into frame and go back out of frame and someone's in the foreground and then someone is way in the background and they're having a conversation, that's the stuff that makes it interesting.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> Director of Photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director [[S. J. Clarkson]] took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette, while looking to the works of [[Wong Kar-wai]] as reference to create \"unconventional\" compositions, with Billeter explaining, \"There were a lot of foreground elements [and] headroom as well, and we never wanted to show an open frame. We wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia.\" Billeter shot the season with a [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company#Red Dragon|Red Epic Dragon]] camera in [[4K resolution]], with [[5K resolution|5K]] used for some visual effects shots, and with [[Panavision]] PVintage lenses; he focused mostly on static frames and \"good composition\", but did occasionally employ a [[camera dolly]] or [[steadicam]]. For lighting, Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from [[sodium-vapor lamp]]s to [[LED]]s, so he tried to recreate the \"warm, dirty color of sodium vapor\" for night exterior scenes.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\nProduction designer Loren Weeks described Marvel's Hell's Kitchen as having \"a little more [[East Village, Manhattan|[East] Village]] quality.\"<ref name=\"FilmingLocations\" /> To achieve the explosion at Luke's Bar, Weeks said, \"We could not take out the windows [at Horseshoe Bar], which are [made up of] multiple small colored glass and metal frames. We didn't know frankly when we picked that location that we would have that explosion... What we did was build a fireproof box in the entrance and we had a cannon in there which blew out debris and smoke and some fire. And then we did a lighting effect on the inside and then the rest of the explosion was handled by visual effects.\" For the scenes on the PATH train and station, location manager Jason Farrar noted that production had exclusive use of the tracks and platform during the day when ridership was low to get their shots.<ref name=\"FilmingLocations\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nShade VFX created over 600 effects shots for the season, with \"invisible\" effects \"the showpiece, helping to push forward the darker elements the series.\" Therefore, effects supervisor Karl Coyner and producer Julie Long worked closely with the crew on set to \"execute stunts, set extensions, explosions, wetwork and fire sequences\" while filming, rather than have Shade create those effects digitally.<ref name=\"ShadeVFXShots\" /> An effect that Shade was required to create was tinting Kilgrave's skin purple \"in a few key scenes\" where he is using his powers, a nod to the comic iteration's purple-skinned appearance.<ref name=\"ShadeVFXPurple\" />\n\n===Music===\nAt the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, [[Sean Callery]] revealed he was composing music for ''Jessica Jones'',<ref name=\"CalleryComposer\" /> eventually stating that the music required for each episode ranged from 9 to 20 minutes, totaling approximately 415 minutes of music for the season.<ref name=\"CalleryVariety\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released by [[Marvel Music]] digitally on June 3, 2016.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" />\n\nAll music composed by Sean Callery, unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" /><ref name=\"SoundtrackiTunes\" />\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = \n| total_length    = 59:53\n\n| title1          = Jessica Jones Main Title\n| length1         = 1:09\n\n| title2          = Then There's the Matter of You\n| length2         = 1:18\n\n| title3          = Fire Escape Night Shift\n| length3         = 4:16\n\n| title4          = Alias Investigations\n| length4         = 2:28\n\n| title5          = Fight at Luke's Bar\n| length5         = 2:21\n\n| title6          = Nurse Jessica\n| length6         = 2:13\n\n| title7          = Rescuing Hope from the Hotel Bed\n| length7         = 3:50\n\n| title8          = Kidnapping Kilgrave\n| length8         = 3:20\n\n| title9          = Sleepover at Luke's\n| length9         = 3:03\n\n| title10         = Jessica on the Move\n| length10        = 2:44\n\n| title11         = Cockroach\n| length11        = 3:09\n\n| title12         = Luke's Revenge on the Bus Driver\n| music12     = Sean Callery & Jamie Forsyth\n| length12        = 2:31\n\n| title13         = Elevator Massacre\n| length13        = 2:52\n\n| title14         = Looking for Kilgrave\u2013Bus Accident Vision\n| length14        = 1:56\n\n| title15         = Hospital Cat and Mouse\n| length15        = 3:11\n\n| title16         = Gift from Trish\n| length16        = 2:55\n\n| title17         = Kilgrave Escapes His Glass Prison\n| length17        = 1:41\n\n| title18         = Tailing Malcolm\n| length18        = 2:22\n\n| title19         = Jessica Confesses to Luke\n| music19     = Sean Callery & Jamie Forsyth\n| length19        = 2:58\n\n| title20         = Restaurant Flashback\n| length20        = 1:48\n\n| title21         = Jones\u2013Cage Match\n| music21     = Sean Callery & Jamie Forsyth\n| length21        = 2:58\n\n| title22         = Final Justice for the Purple Man\n| length22        = 2:33\n\n| title23         = Maybe It's Enough the World Thinks I'm a Hero\n| length23        = 2:17\n}}\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nOn existing in the MCU, specifically in the same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, \"''Jessica Jones'' is a very, very different show than ''Daredevil''. We exist in a cinematic universe, [and] the mythology of the universe is connected, but they look very different, tonally they're very different\u2026 That was my one concern coming in: Am I going to have to fit into ''Daredevil'' or what's come before? And the answer is no.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergJuly2015\" /> On references or \"[[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]]\" in the season, Rosenberg explained that \"A little is always there and in the writer's room we have some fanboys that know all this stuff and they're all geeking out with different stuff....a lot of references are to the [''Alias'' comic].\" She also said that nods to the larger MCU are in the season, with each episode having a \"little something in it.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" />\n\nJeryn Hogarth is closely associated with [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] in the comics, and also worked with Luke Cage as part of those characters' ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' team.<ref name=\"Moss2\" /> Like ''Daredevil'', the season makes references to the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and the Avengers (specifically Hulk and Captain America, though not by name).<ref name=\"EasterEggs\" /> Jessica also mentions [[White Tiger (Angela del Toro)|Angela del Toro]] as another private investigator,<ref name=\"EasterEggs\" /> who in the comics is the hero White Tiger and has connections with K'un-Lun and Iron Fist.<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> Paul Tassi, writing for ''[[Forbes]]'', was disappointed with how the season fit into the larger MCU, feeling the season seemed \"removed from the world of ''The Avengers''\" and did not acknowledge ''Daredevil'' enough given that \"it's supposed to be sharing at least this little {{em|corner}} of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with it.\"<ref name=\"ForbesMCUConnection\" /> Eric Francisco of Inverse countered that ''Jessica Jones''{{'}}s lack of overt connections to the MCU was \"the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, ''Jessica Jones'' also proves the MCU's thematic durability.\"<ref name=\"InverseJJ\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nIn May 2015, Marvel announced plans to reprint ''Alias'', the comic that the series is based on, with new covers from [[David W. Mack|David Mack]], the original cover artist on the comic who is also providing artwork for the series' opening credits. The reprints, which were all released digitally in June 2015, and up to issue 15 in two trade paperbacks in September, were intended to both celebrate the history of Jessica Jones, and introduce new audiences to the character ahead of the release of the season.<ref name=\"AliasReprint\" /> In late September through early October, Marvel and Netflix released short teasers for the season, which chronicled a day of Jones' life.<ref name=\"Teasers1\" /><ref name=\"Teasers2\" /> Also in early October, Marvel digitally released a 12-page [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic by the original ''Alias'' creative team\u2014Bendis, Gaydos, and Mack\u2014set in the universe of the television series.<ref name=\"OneShotComic\" /> The one-shot was created as an exclusive for [[New York Comic Con]], where a print version was distributed.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|The comic]] sees Jessica Jones coming into contact with ''Daredevil'' character [[Turk Barrett]], and includes a short sequence featuring Daredevil,<ref name=\"OneShot\" /> to celebrate \"the connective tissue that will build between the series.\"<ref name=\"OneShotComic\" /> Also during New York Comic Con, Marvel set up a [[street marketing]] campaign, and screened \"[[AKA Ladies Night]]\" on October 10, while at the Marvel Booth fans could take their picture with the Alias Investigations desk, with Kilgrave's eyes appearing in the background of the final animation.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /><ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /> Marvel additionally partnered with [[Uber]] during the event to provide select riders with complimentary trips to or from the convention in custom designed SUVs.<ref name=\"NYCCUber\" />\n\nA full trailer was released at the end of October, with Meagan Damore of [[Comic Book Resources]] feeling that it helped establish the same tone as ''Daredevil'' and introduced \"Marvel's creepiest villain yet\" with Kilgrave. She also compared Jessica to some of the other female characters of the MCU\u2014[[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Melinda May]], and [[Peggy Carter]]\u2014feeling that Jessica stood out from the others because she does not have \"a sense of togetherness\" and was the most relatable because of her struggle with trauma, and that the season would have the amount of creative space required to explore the character that the other female characters were lacking.<ref name=\"CBRTrailer\" /> A second trailer was released on November 10, 2015. Sarene Leeds of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' felt that this trailer highlighted empowerment, compared to the first that \"was about illustrating the fear behind Jones's past\".<ref name=\"WSJTrailer2\" /> The season held its premiere in New York City on November 17.<ref name=\"Premiere\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Streaming===\nThe first season of ''Jessica Jones'' was released on November 20, 2015, on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available,<ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /><ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> In January 2015, a month after Marvel announced a 2015 release for the season,<ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /> Sarandos had said that it was \"too hard to say now\" if the season would actually release in 2015, with Netflix's plan to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after ''Daredevil''{{'}}s April 2015 release.<ref name=\"NetflixReleasePlans\" /> However, Netflix soon confirmed that the season would indeed release in 2015,<ref name=\"NetflixReleaseConfirm\" /> announcing the November 20 release date in September.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> The season was enhanced to be available in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] and [[Blu-ray]] in [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]] on August 22, 2017,<ref name=\"Region1HomeMedia\" /> in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] and [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]] on December 5, 2016,<ref name=\"Region2HomeMedia\" /> and in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] on December 7, 2016.<ref name=\"Region4HomeMedia\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Audience viewership===\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, [[Symphony Technology Group]] compiled data for the season based on a sample size of 15,000 people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, from September to December 2015, episodes of ''Jessica Jones'' averaged 4.8 million viewers during a 35-day viewing cycle. The data was presented by Alan Wurtzel, [[NBCUniversal]] president of research and media development, in a presentation aimed to provide \"perspective\" when stating \"digital platforms are hurting the traditional TV business\".<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers\" /> Netflix CCO [[Ted Sarandos]] responded to the data by saying that \"the whole methodology and the measurement and the data itself doesn't reflect any sense of reality of anything that we keep track of.\"<ref name=\"NetflixViewersResponse\" /> A further study from Symphony, for the same time period, found ''Jessica Jones'' to be one of the four most watched series in the 18 to 24 demographic, ahead of any broadcast network series.<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers2\" /> The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the fifth-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 26% of the viewers that the [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] of ''Daredevil'' received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.<ref name=\"JumpshotViewers\" /><ref name=\"JumpshotViewersPrecise\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align             = left\n | width             = 150\n | direction         = vertical\n | footer          = Krysten Ritter (top) and David Tennant (bottom) received near universal praise for their portrayals of Jessica Jones and Kilgrave, respectively, with Ritter able to \"display her impressive range\" to give \"an exceptional performance\", and Tennant being called \"a horrific joy to behold\".<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"LATimesReview\" />\n <!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Krysten Ritter 2011.jpg\n | width1            = \n | alt1              = \n <!--image 2-->\n | image2            = 2009 07 31 David Tennant smile 09.jpg\n | width2            = \n | alt2              = \n}}\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 94% approval rating with an average rating of 8.24/10 based on 80 reviews.

He concluded by applauding the season's bringing up of the topics of [[rape]] and PTSD.<ref name=\"VulturePilotSexuality\" />\n\nReviewing the first seven episodes of the season, Maureen Ryan of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave positive thoughts on ''Jessica Jones'', stating, \"The show, which features an exceptional performance from Krysten Ritter and sure-handed guidance from executive producer Melissa Rosenberg, is not just a contender for the title Best Marvel-related TV property; in a supremely crowded TV scene, it is one of the year's most distinctive new dramas.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Jack Shepard of ''[[The Independent]]'', also on the first seven episodes, felt the season \"not only matches [''Daredevil''] but exceeds expectations.\" Shepard gave exceptional praise to Tennant's Kilgrave, feeling he was one of the best villains produced by Marvel, and possibly \"the best on-screen comic book villain since [[Heath Ledger]]'s [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].\"<ref name=\"IndependentReview\" /> ''Forbes''{{'}} Merrill Barr stated that after seeing the first seven episodes, \"the answer is a resounding yes\" if lightning could strike twice for Marvel Television, claiming, \"In no uncertain terms, ''Jessica Jones'' is the best thing Marvel Television has ever produced.

Though Maerz felt Ritter was a good choice for Jessica and enjoyed the cinematography, she felt the season \"could've made for a gritty character drama if it weren't for the noir clich\u00e9s (saxophone music, shadows through glass) and a procedural structure that's very ''CSI: Marvel''. The show's biggest weakness is the same as Jessica's: It starts out with extraordinary potential, but somewhere along the way, it loses what make it special.\"<ref name=\"EWReview\" />\n\nGoldman, later reviewing the whole season, gave it a 9.3 out of 10. He commended all the actors, the relationship between Jessica and Trish, and the episode \"Sin Bin\", though was critical of the character Robyn. Additionally, Goldman also felt the season spent \"too many scenes devoted to Jeri's marital strife\" and that it hit its peak \"a bit before the actual end of the season\" similar to ''Daredevil'', with most of the thrilling moments earlier in the season.<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" />\n\n===Analysis===\nLibby Hill of the ''Los Angeles Times'' commented on how ''Jessica Jones'' exposed modern day sexism and [[misogyny]] through Kilgrave's use of the phrase \"Smile\", calling the season \"the most innocuous and incisive cultural critique\" from Marvel to date. Hill likened an early scene that shows Kilgrave asking Jones to smile, and her obliging, to \"similar well-meaning scenarios [that] play out in the real world time and again each day\" many in the form of gendered [[street harassment]], that resonates with many women. Hill also added that \"Kilgrave serves as an exaggerated representation of perceived consent,\" due to the response he gives later in the season to Jessica about never knowing if someone is doing what they want or what he tells them to do. She concludes that \"''Jessica Jones'' is revolutionary because in acknowledging casual misogyny and exaggerating its most destructive tendencies, it exposes the pervasive toxicity therein. It does all of this without making a show of its politics, instead resting easy on the knowledge that all too many women will relate to the subtleties of its premise.\"<ref name=\"LATimesAnalysis\" /> Amy C. Chambers, writing for The Science and Entertainment Laboratory, noted how the season moved away from sexism even more so than the comics, by changing Kilgrave's abilities from phermone based, with a particular effect on women, to viral, with equal effect no matter gender, indicating that \"powerlessness is not gendered.\"<ref name=\"ScienceAnalysis\" />\n\nKwame Opam at ''[[The Verge]]'' chose to examine rape and the nature of consent in the season. Comparing ''Jessica Jones'' to other television series that have depicted rape (''[[Game of Thrones]]'', ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'', and ''[[Outlander (TV series)|Outlander]]''), Opam felt that \"since rape is one of the show's core themes, we never need to see it... rape is a foundational part of the text, and its presence is constant. Even if it's invisible, it's always there.\" He also felt the season took the time to examine how rape happens and what it means, especially in terms of power and consent, concluding, \"''Jessica Jones'' moves the conversation about rape forward by treating it as a complex subject worth investigating, rather than as spice for a story...Maybe we don't need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it is. Maybe our energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all.\"<ref name=\"VergeAnalysis\" /> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Lili Loofbourow also discussed the season's depiction of rape and consent, noting the complications that come with Kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than just how to act, and saying, \"however exceptional Kilgrave's power seems, the moral quagmire it produces is all too common. It's the condition of the rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault. It's the condition of the soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets are innocent. It's the condition of the battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays \"of her own free will\". It's the condition of...any person, really, who agrees, whatever the context, to consent to forgo consent in the future.\" Loofbourow also discussed the character of Simpson, comparing his power-inducing red pill to the anti-feminist \"red pillers\", and noting that his taking of the pills \"renders him not just dangerously delusional, but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts the pill's effects.\"<ref name=\"GuardianAnalysis\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n''Jessica Jones'' was included on multiple Best/Top TV Shows of 2015 lists, ranking on ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''{{'}}s (1st, along with ''Daredevil''),<ref name=\"PeopleTop102015\" /> [[Indiewire]] and ''[[The Star-Ledger]]''{{'}}s (2nd),<ref name=\"IndiewireTop102015\" /><ref name=\"StarLedgerTop102015\" /> [[NPR]]'s (3rd),<ref name=\"NPRTop122015\" /> [[ScreenCrush]]'s (4th),<ref name=\"ScreenCrushTop102015\" /> [[Digital Spy]]'s (5th),<ref name=\"DigitalSpyTop102015\" /> ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]''{{'}}s (6th),<ref name=\"ComplexTop252015\" /> [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'s (7th),<ref name=\"VultureTop102015\" /> ''[[Slate Magazine]]''{{'}}s (9th),<ref name=\"SlateTop252015\" /> and ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s (11th).<ref name=\"TVGuideTop202015\" /> It was also included on un-ranked lists from Maureen Ryan of ''Variety'',<ref name=\"VarietyTop202015\" /> Mary McNamara of the ''Los Angeles Times'',<ref name=\"LATimesTop102015\" /> ''[[The Week (magazine)|The Week]]'',<ref name=\"WeekTop102015\" /> and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.<ref name=\"WiredTop152015\" /> In December 2015, IGN named ''Jessica Jones'' the Netflix's best original series released to date,<ref name=\"IGNNetflixTop10\" /> and it was named one of the Best New Shows of 2015 by Ryan,<ref name=\"VarietyTop20New2015\" /> as well as the tenth best new show of 2015 by ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'}}s Jeff Jensen.<ref name=\"EWJensenTop102015\" /> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' named \"[[AKA WWJD?]]\" one of the best television episodes of 2015.<ref name=\"AtlanticBest2015\" /> Additionally, ''Jessica Jones'' was the second most trending television series search on [[Google]] for 2015.<ref name=\"GoogleTrend\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

Comics]] character [[Jessica Jones|of the same name]], follows a former superhero who opens her own detective agency after her superhero career comes to an end at the hands of [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]]. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]] and Tall Girls Productions, with [[Melissa Rosenberg]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Krysten Ritter]] stars as Jones, while [[David Tennant]] plays Kilgrave. The two are joined by principal cast members [[Mike Colter]], [[Rachael Taylor]], [[Wil Traval]], [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]], [[Eka Darville]], and [[Carrie-Anne Moss]]. ''Jessica Jones'' entered development in late 2013, with Rosenberg reworking a series she had previously developed for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Ritter was cast as Jones in December 2014, and production took place in New York City from February to August 2015. The season addresses issues of rape and assault, and was always intended to be far more \"adult\" than other Marvel projects, particularly in terms of sex. The show's cinematography took inspiration from [[Neo-noir|noir]], while visual effects house Shade VFX focused on creating \"invisible\" effects that would support its realistic approach.\n\nThe first two episodes of the season premiered in New York City on November 17, 2015, with the full season of 13 episodes released on [[Netflix]] on November 20 to an estimated high viewership and critical acclaim. Critics praised the performances of Ritter and Tennant, as well as the season's noir tone, approach to sexuality, and coverage of darker topics such as rape, assault and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. The season was awarded a [[Peabody Award]] in the category of \"Entertainment and Children's programs\", and a [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation#Short Form|short form dramas]]. A [[Jessica Jones (season 2)|second season]] of ''Jessica Jones'' was ordered on January 17, 2016.<ref name=\"S2Order\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#6A498D |overall=5 |season=5 |title=29 |director=16 |writer=30 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-jessica-jones/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's jessica jones on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = AKA Ladies Night\n |DirectedBy      = [[S.

While not working, Jones spies on [[Luke Cage]], a bar owner who sees her looking into his bar and offers her free alcohol as a \"Ladies Night\" promotion, leading to the two sleeping together. She leaves upset after seeing a photo of a woman in his bathroom. Jones is approached by Barbara and Bob Shlottman after their daughter Hope began acting differently and disappeared. Jones discovers that Hope is with [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]], a man with mind control abilities who once controlled Jones, leaving her with [[PTSD]], and whom she believed was dead. Jones wants to flee, but is convinced by her friend and foster-sister [[Patsy Walker|Trish Walker]] to help Hope.

Jones lies to Cage that she had been hired by the husband of a woman who Cage had slept with. Cage, having not known that the woman was married, confronts the woman about it, and when she goes to her husband, he attacks Cage with a group. Jones helps fight off the men, and learns that Cage is gifted with unbreakable skin. Hogarth agrees to represent Shlottman if Jones can prove that Kilgrave exists. Jones remembers leaving Kilgrave to die after he was hit by a bus, and now tracks down the ambulance driver who had picked him up. The driver had donated both his kidneys to Kilgrave, and is now on dialysis. Jones finds the operating doctor who anonymously donated the dialysis machine. He agrees to testify for Shlottman, and reveals that he operated on Kilgrave without anesthesia since that would have blocked Kilgrave's abilities. When Hogarth meets with Shlottman, the latter reveals that Jones was once under Kilgrave's control as well.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = AKA It's Called Whiskey\n |DirectedBy      = [[David Petrarca]]\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=[[Liz Friedman]]|t=Liz Friedman & [[Scott Reynolds (writer)|Scott Reynolds]]}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jones and Cage bond over their mutual powers, while Jones also tracks down a surgical grade anesthetic to subdue Kilgrave with. Hogarth, now divorcing Wendy (who discovered the affair) and unwilling to risk herself and her reputation despite Wendy's testimony, organizes for Walker to interview Shlottman about Kilgrave live on her radio talk show. Walker asks that anyone who believes they have been approached or controlled by Kilgrave contact Hogarth, and then publicly insults Kilgrave on air. Angered, Kilgrave sends police sergeant Will Simpson to kill Walker, with Jones having to use the anesthetic on Walker to convince Simpson that he has carried out his orders. Jones follows Simpson back to Kilgrave, who orders Simpson to walk off a balcony. Jones again convinces Simpson that he has carried out this order by knocking him out and taking him to the street below, telling him as he wakes that she caught him. Searching through the house that Kilgrave was occupying, Jones discovers a room full of photographs of her.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = AKA 99 Friends\n |DirectedBy      = David Petrarca\n |WrittenBy       = [[Hilly Hicks, Jr.]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jones accepts a case from jewelry designer Audrey Eastman who seeks evidence of her husband cheating. Jones tracks Eastman's husband to a rendezvous with his girlfriend only to discover a trap set by Eastman, who blames gifted people for the death of her mother during \"[[The Avengers (2012 film)#Plot|the incident]]\" and who learned of Jones' powers from Spheeris. Angered as she recalls the death of her own parents, Jones convinces the Eastmans to leave her alone with a show of her power and a bluff over the number of other gifted in the city. Hogarth and Jones process a large number of people claiming to have been controlled by Kilgrave, forming a support group for those legitimately affected by him. Simpson attempts to apologize to a frightened Walker over his action while under Kilgrave's control; they eventually bond over the experience. Jones uses surveillance footage provided by Simpson and clues offered by the Kilgrave support group to learn that the photographer spying on her for Kilgrave is her drug addicted neighbor [[Malcolm Ducasse]]. \n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = AKA The Sandwich Saved Me\n |DirectedBy      = [[Stephen Surjik]]\n |WrittenBy       = Dana Baratta\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jones recalls her brief time as a superhero as she debates whether to save Ducasse or to use him as a means of locating Kilgrave. Walker and Simpson begin a romantic relationship with Jones grudgingly allowing him to assist in a plot to capture Kilgrave. Simpson supplies ex-special operations skills and contacts, including access to a hermetically sealed room in which Kilgrave could be kept once the effects of the anesthetic wear off. They follow Ducasse to his daily meeting with Kilgrave where photographs of Jones are exchanged for drugs, which Kilgrave had forced Ducasse to become addicted to so he would obey Kilgrave even after his powers wore off, after around 12 hours of no contact. Simpson shoots Kilgrave with the anesthetic; Jones refuses to let him kill Kilgrave so he can be used to prove Shlottman innocent. Jones gets Kilgrave to Walker and the getaway car, but they are attacked by hired bodyguards who escape with the unconscious Kilgrave.

After paying a fellow inmate to beat her, Shlottman confesses to Jones that she is pregnant with Kilgrave's child and has been trying to miscarry. Jones gives her an abortion pill; Hogarth secretly takes the fetal remains. Cage hires Jones to help find the brother of someone, who has evidence on the death of Cage's wife [[Reva Connors]]. Connors had left Cage instructions to find a box she had hidden, but it was not there when he looked. Jones recalls Kilgrave having Connors lead them to the box, with Jones digging it up before killing Connors. Jones and Cage find the missing brother, and are given the file of the bus driver that accidentally hit Kilgrave (and who Cage believes hit Connors). Seeing that the driver had been drunk, Cage seeks revenge. Jones intervenes and confesses that Kilgrave forced her to kill Connors. Cage leaves, unable to forgive her for hiding the truth and instigating an intimate relationship with him.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n |Title           = AKA Top Shelf Perverts\n |DirectedBy      = [[Simon Cellan Jones]]\n |WrittenBy       = Jenna Reback & Micah Schraft\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = A drunk Jones, having been asked by Hogarth to convince Wendy to sign divorce papers, accosts Wendy in a subway and almost kills her. Wendy refuses to sign the papers. Ducasse helps Jones back to her apartment, where they find her neighbor Ruben, dead. Knowingly blaming Kilgrave, Jones devises a desperate plan: get herself imprisoned in a [[supermax prison]] so when Kilgrave inevitably comes for her, his abilities will be caught on camera. Walker and Simpson have their own plan, with Simpson following Kilgrave's security detail, though he does not tell Walker when he finds them at Jones's old house. Ducasse disposes of Ruben's body, though Jones finds him. Enacting her plan, Jones goes to a police station with Ruben's severed head and confesses to his murder. Her processing is interrupted when Kilgrave takes control of the station and declares his love for Jones, as she was the first person to resist him. He invites her \"home\", and Simpson later watches as Jones voluntarily enters the house with Kilgrave.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n |Title           = AKA WWJD?\n |DirectedBy      = Simon Cellan Jones\n |WrittenBy       = Scott Reynolds\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Jones spends several days living with Kilgrave. Though he takes her phone so she cannot record him, she secretly gets Simpson's when she catches him sneaking into the house to plant a bomb. Not willing to let Kilgrave die until Shlottman is free, Jones tells Kilgrave about the bomb. Kilgrave, in an effort to prove that his nature was forced upon him, shows Jones a pendrive (which Connors had hidden in the box) containing footage of his parents experimenting on him as a child, and him eventually stopping them by his command. Jones shows Kilgrave that he can do good with his powers by convincing him to save several people. She visits Walker and asks whether she should stay with Kilgrave and try to use his abilities to change the world for good. When Jones, knowing that Kilgrave will harm some of his \"servants\" if she does not return, goes back to Kilgrave, she instead uses a distraction to incapacitate him, and flies away with him. Then, Simpson is seriously injured by his own bomb, which Kilgrave left for him.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n |Title           = AKA Sin Bin\n |DirectedBy      = [[John Dahl]]\n |WrittenBy       = Jamie King & Dana Baratta\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Walker races Simpson to the hospital, where he insists on seeing a Dr. Kozlov from his days as an army sergeant. Kozlov gives him some pills, and his injuries heal miraculously. Jones imprisons Kilgrave in the hermetically sealed room, where she plans to torture him until he reveals his abilities on camera. Hogarth warns her that this would forfeit their case in court, and that the D.A. has offered a 20 year plea deal to Shlottman if she pleads guilty. Jones convinces Shlottman to not take the deal, and devises a new plan. From the footage of Kilgrave's experiments, Jones discovers the names of his parents, Louise and Albert Thompson, and from photographs realizes that his mother is a member of the support group. Jones confronts her and Albert, and convinces them to face their son. Jones also forces Clemons to act as a witness. In the cell, Kilgrave is remorseful, but Louise attempts to kill him to stop him from hurting anyone again, and he makes her kill herself. Jones saves Albert from a similar fate, but Kilgrave escapes.\n |LineColor       = 6A498D\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Jessica Jones (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n |Title           = AKA 1,000 Cuts\n |DirectedBy      = [[Rosemary Rodriguez]]\n |WrittenBy       = Dana Baratta & Micah Schraft \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|11|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = Kilgrave forces Hogarth to take him to a doctor; she goes to Wendy, hoping Kilgrave will force her to sign their divorce papers, but Kilgrave instead orders Wendy to kill Hogarth [[Lingchi|with a thousand cuts]] as revenge. Pam arrives, and accidentally kills Wendy to stop her by hitting her in the head with a [[vase]]. Thompson reveals that Kilgrave's abilities are a virus that he releases, and that a vaccine could be created from Jones's blood as Jones appears to have become immune to Kilgrave's influence. Simpson, under the influence of Kozlov's drugs (that enhance combat performance and numb pain) arrives at the cell, where Clemons is guarding the evidence needed to imprison Kilgrave. Set on killing Kilgrave instead, Simpson kills Clemons and destroys the evidence. He finds Walker with Thompson, who is unsuccessful in creating the vaccine, but she sends Simpson away when she sees how unstable he is, managing to take some of his pills from him in the process.

Jones discovered her abilities soon after. Now, Jones covers up Shlottman's death and Kilgrave's involvement in it, and begins searching morgues for Thompson's body as a lead. Affected by an increasing lack of sleep, Jones is injured in an accident, but does manage to find Clemons' body and deduces that Simpson killed him rather than Kilgrave. She agrees to meet with Simpson, and he attacks her in her apartment, overpowering the injured Jones. Walker arrives and uses Simpson's pills to help Jones defeat him. Not used to the pills, Walker requires medical attention.

After Cage recounts the events leading up to the explosion, in which he followed Jones to confront Kilgrave, they realize that Kilgrave is keeping Thompson alive to try and boost his abilities, and may be testing his increasing hold over people. While they investigate, Cage forgives Jones for her role in Connors' death, and the two begin to grow close again. They find a nightclub where Kilgrave tested his enhanced powers, and are confronted by him there. He reveals that he has been controlling Cage the whole time, having made him forgive Jones to earn her trust, and now unleashes Cage on Jones, escaping while they fight.

Thompson has been using the fetal remains that Hogarth kept, and believes that a full dose of his extracted drug could now make Kilgrave powerful enough to control Jones. Using Cage's phone, Jones tracks Kilgrave to the apartment of a wealthy couple, whom he has enslaved, in time to see Thompson die. Cage awakens, and decides to leave. Jones confronts Kilgrave at the couple's yacht, where he takes Walker hostage. When Jones allows this, Kilgrave believes that he finally has control over her again. However, when he tells her to say \"I love you\", Jones says it to Walker instead, and snaps Kilgrave's neck.

Jessica Jones'',<ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /> but that was shortened to ''Marvel's Jessica Jones'' in June 2015.<ref name=\"NewTitle\" /> The season consists of 13 hour-long episodes.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe writers for the season worked in Los Angeles, with one member of the writing team on set in New York for filming.<ref name=\"WritersLocation\" /> Actress [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] talked about how the scripts developed through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary.<ref name=\"MossColterNYCC\" /> Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some [[Procedural (genre)|procedural]] elements to the show, \"but that's not our focus. There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season.\" Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head [[Jeph Loeb]] said that the \"fun about being a private detective is that the line between what's legal and what's not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, as much as it is to go, 'Okay, can I pay the rent? How am I going to get through this day?'\" He also added that inspiration for the season came from \"the noir films from the '40s\" and \"film[s] like ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergLoebJuly2015\" />\n\nDescribing the tone of the season, Loeb said, \"When we first started talking about ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a psychological thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that's a very powerful, emotional place to start from.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called \"lazy storytelling\" and often a way to \"spice up\" male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an \"issue\" for the season to tackle.<ref name=\"RosenbergHRNov2015\" /> When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity and the use of the word 'fuck' in the season.<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /> Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as \"issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [and] issues of consent\" while also exploring \"feminism and being a woman in this world\", Rosenberg said, \"It was never our intention going in [to hit a social issue], and I think the minute you intend to do that, you're stepping up on a soap box. If you're digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you're going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you're also going to hit social issues.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergAug2016\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes [[Krysten Ritter]] as [[Jessica Jones]],<ref name=\"Ritter\" /> [[Mike Colter]] as [[Luke Cage]],<ref name=\"Colter\" /> [[Rachael Taylor]] as [[Patsy Walker|Patricia \"Trish\" Walker]],<ref name=\"Taylor\" /> [[Wil Traval]] as [[Nuke (Marvel Comics)|Will Simpson]],<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]] as Hope Shlottman,<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /><ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> [[Eka Darville]] as [[Malcolm Ducasse]],<ref name=\"3MoreJoin\" /> [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Jeryn Hogarth|Jeri Hogarth]],<ref name=\"Moss\" /><ref name=\"Moss2\" /> and [[David Tennant]] as [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]].<ref name=\"Tennant\" />\n\nAppearing in recurring roles for the season are Susie Abromeit as Pam,<ref name=\"Abromeit\" /> Colby Minifie and Kieran Mulcare as Robyn and Ruben,<ref name=\"MinifieMulcare\" /> Nichole Yannetty as Nicole,<ref name=\"Ep3Cite\" /> [[Clarke Peters]] as Oscar Clemons,<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> [[Michael Siberry]] and [[Lisa Emery]] as Albert and Louise Thompson,<ref name=\"ScienceAnalysis\" /> and [[Robin Weigert]] as Wendy Ross-Hogarth.<ref name=\"Weigert\" /> [[Danielle Ferland]], Gillian Glasco, Ryan Farrell, and Paul Pryce also recur as victims of Kilgrave who join a support group established by Jones,<ref name=\"Supporters\" /> while [[Rosario Dawson]] and Royce Johnson reprise their roles of [[Claire Temple]] and Brett Mahoney, respectively, from ''Daredevil''.<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"DawsonJJ\" />\n\n===Design===\nStephanie Maslansky returned as the costume designer for ''Jessica Jones'' from ''Daredevil'',<ref name=\"Maslansky\" /> and was assisted on the first episode by Jenn Rogien, who crafted Jessica Jones' leather jacket, faded jeans, and boots costume.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> On Jones's costume, Maslansky said she \"considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from having to deal with the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way.\" At least 10 versions of Jones's jacket were made, which started as an [[Acne Studios]] leather motorcycle jacket that had any \"bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details\" removed. 20 pairs of jeans were used, with both sets of clothing being aged and distressed.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nBecause Jones's costume does not evolve much throughout the season, Maslansky used flashbacks to show how her costume had evolved to the present day: for 'pre-Kilgrave' Jessica Jones, Maslansky gave the character \"more pulled together\" clothes, albeit \"still kind of edgy\" clothes that did not change who she was as a character, but were just \"different\". For instance, in a flashback to Jones working in a corporate environment, she does not wear a suit, instead \"wear[s] her jeans and find[s] a really cool jacket, maybe a vintage thing, maybe something that she borrowed from Trish\". For a flashback where Jones wears a large sandwich costume, a \"variety\" of costumes were ordered online, with the chosen suit then distressed to \"look dirty and old\"; \"a mere shadow of its former sandwich self,\" becoming \"more of a hoagie than a sandwich.\" In another flashback, Jones imagines escaping Kilgrave's control. The bright yellow dress the character wears in the dream sequence was chosen for its juxtaposition to the character's real situation, with Maslansky calling it \"so beautiful and so free and so light\".<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" />\n\nFor Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits created by designer [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]], rather than custom-making them as she originally planned, as Smith \"was {{em|all}} about purple\" in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers \"wanted to find a place where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally \"fairly friendly color, and he's anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon.\"<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" /> Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone \"who wears his clothing like an armor,\" with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> For a character like Trish Walker, who does not have the same kind of \"statement costume\" as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so \"even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of [[rag & bone]] jeans with a [[Chlo\u00e9]] top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans.\" Maslansky added that Robin was \"a blast to dress\" because of her \"quirky\" personality, yet she was still able to \"put herself together aesthetically.\" For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming \"a little brighter and a little more hopeful.\"<ref name=\"EWBestCostumes\" />\n\n===Filming===\nIn February 2014, Marvel announced that ''Jessica Jones'' would be filmed in New York City.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> In April, Marvel Comics' [[Editor in chief|editor-in-chief]] [[Joe Quesada]] stated that the show would be filming in areas of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Long Island City]] that still look like the old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> The season went into production in February 2015 in [[The Bronx]] at [[Lehman College]] with the [[working title]] ''Violet'',<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /><ref name=\"DaredevilFilmingAnnounced\" /><ref name=\"FilmingBronx\" /> and aimed to film each episode over nine days, on average.<ref name=\"Billeter\" /> Filming concluded in mid-late August.<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" /> Other filming locations in New York City used included the East Village's Horseshoe Bar for Luke's Bar; the [[33rd Street (PATH station)|33rd Street PATH station]] and a [[PATH (rail system)|PATH]] train; the 101st Street area for the exterior of Jessica's apartment (with the interior apartment settings created on a sound stage); [[Douglaston, Queens]] for Jessica's childhood home; the [[Angel Orensanz Center]] for Jessica and Luke's fight in \"[[AKA Take a Bloody Number]]\"; [[Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower]] and Pier 88 for locations in \"[[AKA Smile]]\";<ref name=\"FilmingLocations\" /> the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]]; [[Nolita]]; near the 39th Street entrance to the [[Lincoln Tunnel]]; [[Tribeca]]; [[Bryant Park]]; [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]]; [[Gramercy Park|Gramercy]]; [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]] near the [[Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant]]; [[Long Island City]], including the Allied Extruder Factory for the weed growing facility, with exteriors shots taken from near [[Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York)|Calvary Cemetery]]; the [[Queensboro Bridge]] on the Queens side; the [[Manhattan Bridge]]; the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]; [[Bethesda Terrace and Fountain]] in [[Central Park]]; and [[Industry City]].<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" />\n\nConcerning inspirations on the season, Loeb revealed that \"''Chinatown''... is one of the things that influenced [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Michael Gaydos]] when they created the character. So those kind of beautiful, long, wide expansive shots, where people sort of come into frame and go back out of frame and someone's in the foreground and then someone is way in the background and they're having a conversation, that's the stuff that makes it interesting.\"<ref name=\"LoebJuly2015\" /> Director of Photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director [[S. J. Clarkson]] took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette, while looking to the works of [[Wong Kar-wai]] as reference to create \"unconventional\" compositions, with Billeter explaining, \"There were a lot of foreground elements [and] headroom as well, and we never wanted to show an open frame. We wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia.\" Billeter shot the season with a [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company#Red Dragon|Red Epic Dragon]] camera in [[4K resolution]], with [[5K resolution|5K]] used for some visual effects shots, and with [[Panavision]] PVintage lenses; he focused mostly on static frames and \"good composition\", but did occasionally employ a [[camera dolly]] or [[steadicam]]. For lighting, Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from [[sodium-vapor lamp]]s to [[LED]]s, so he tried to recreate the \"warm, dirty color of sodium vapor\" for night exterior scenes.<ref name=\"Billeter\" />\n\nProduction designer Loren Weeks described Marvel's Hell's Kitchen as having \"a little more [[East Village, Manhattan|[East] Village]] quality.\"<ref name=\"FilmingLocations\" /> To achieve the explosion at Luke's Bar, Weeks said, \"We could not take out the windows [at Horseshoe Bar], which are [made up of] multiple small colored glass and metal frames. We didn't know frankly when we picked that location that we would have that explosion... What we did was build a fireproof box in the entrance and we had a cannon in there which blew out debris and smoke and some fire. And then we did a lighting effect on the inside and then the rest of the explosion was handled by visual effects.\" For the scenes on the PATH train and station, location manager Jason Farrar noted that production had exclusive use of the tracks and platform during the day when ridership was low to get their shots.<ref name=\"FilmingLocations\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nShade VFX created over 600 effects shots for the season, with \"invisible\" effects \"the showpiece, helping to push forward the darker elements the series.\" Therefore, effects supervisor Karl Coyner and producer Julie Long worked closely with the crew on set to \"execute stunts, set extensions, explosions, wetwork and fire sequences\" while filming, rather than have Shade create those effects digitally.<ref name=\"ShadeVFXShots\" /> An effect that Shade was required to create was tinting Kilgrave's skin purple \"in a few key scenes\" where he is using his powers, a nod to the comic iteration's purple-skinned appearance.<ref name=\"ShadeVFXPurple\" />\n\n===Music===\nAt the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, [[Sean Callery]] revealed he was composing music for ''Jessica Jones'',<ref name=\"CalleryComposer\" /> eventually stating that the music required for each episode ranged from 9 to 20 minutes, totaling approximately 415 minutes of music for the season.<ref name=\"CalleryVariety\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released by [[Marvel Music]] digitally on June 3, 2016.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" />\n\nAll music composed by Sean Callery, unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" /><ref name=\"SoundtrackiTunes\" />\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = \n| total_length    = 59:53\n\n| title1          = Jessica Jones Main Title\n| length1         = 1:09\n\n| title2          = Then There's the Matter of You\n| length2         = 1:18\n\n| title3          = Fire Escape Night Shift\n| length3         = 4:16\n\n| title4          = Alias Investigations\n| length4         = 2:28\n\n| title5          = Fight at Luke's Bar\n| length5         = 2:21\n\n| title6          = Nurse Jessica\n| length6         = 2:13\n\n| title7          = Rescuing Hope from the Hotel Bed\n| length7         = 3:50\n\n| title8          = Kidnapping Kilgrave\n| length8         = 3:20\n\n| title9          = Sleepover at Luke's\n| length9         = 3:03\n\n| title10         = Jessica on the Move\n| length10        = 2:44\n\n| title11         = Cockroach\n| length11        = 3:09\n\n| title12         = Luke's Revenge on the Bus Driver\n| music12     = Sean Callery & Jamie Forsyth\n| length12        = 2:31\n\n| title13         = Elevator Massacre\n| length13        = 2:52\n\n| title14         = Looking for Kilgrave\u2013Bus Accident Vision\n| length14        = 1:56\n\n| title15         = Hospital Cat and Mouse\n| length15        = 3:11\n\n| title16         = Gift from Trish\n| length16        = 2:55\n\n| title17         = Kilgrave Escapes His Glass Prison\n| length17        = 1:41\n\n| title18         = Tailing Malcolm\n| length18        = 2:22\n\n| title19         = Jessica Confesses to Luke\n| music19     = Sean Callery & Jamie Forsyth\n| length19        = 2:58\n\n| title20         = Restaurant Flashback\n| length20        = 1:48\n\n| title21         = Jones\u2013Cage Match\n| music21     = Sean Callery & Jamie Forsyth\n| length21        = 2:58\n\n| title22         = Final Justice for the Purple Man\n| length22        = 2:33\n\n| title23         = Maybe It's Enough the World Thinks I'm a Hero\n| length23        = 2:17\n}}\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nOn existing in the MCU, specifically in the same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, \"''Jessica Jones'' is a very, very different show than ''Daredevil''. We exist in a cinematic universe, [and] the mythology of the universe is connected, but they look very different, tonally they're very different\u2026 That was my one concern coming in: Am I going to have to fit into ''Daredevil'' or what's come before? And the answer is no.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergJuly2015\" /> On references or \"[[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]]\" in the season, Rosenberg explained that \"A little is always there and in the writer's room we have some fanboys that know all this stuff and they're all geeking out with different stuff....a lot of references are to the [''Alias'' comic].\" She also said that nods to the larger MCU are in the season, with each episode having a \"little something in it.\"<ref name=\"RosenbergRitterNYCC\" />\n\nJeryn Hogarth is closely associated with [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] in the comics, and also worked with Luke Cage as part of those characters' ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' team.<ref name=\"Moss2\" /> Like ''Daredevil'', the season makes references to the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and the Avengers (specifically Hulk and Captain America, though not by name).<ref name=\"EasterEggs\" /> Jessica also mentions [[White Tiger (Angela del Toro)|Angela del Toro]] as another private investigator,<ref name=\"EasterEggs\" /> who in the comics is the hero White Tiger and has connections with K'un-Lun and Iron Fist.<ref name=\"ScreenrantEasterEggs\" /> Paul Tassi, writing for ''[[Forbes]]'', was disappointed with how the season fit into the larger MCU, feeling the season seemed \"removed from the world of ''The Avengers''\" and did not acknowledge ''Daredevil'' enough given that \"it's supposed to be sharing at least this little {{em|corner}} of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with it.\"<ref name=\"ForbesMCUConnection\" /> Eric Francisco of Inverse countered that ''Jessica Jones''{{'}}s lack of overt connections to the MCU was \"the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, ''Jessica Jones'' also proves the MCU's thematic durability.\"<ref name=\"InverseJJ\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe first season of ''Jessica Jones'' was released on November 20, 2015, on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available,<ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /><ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> In January 2015, a month after Marvel announced a 2015 release for the season,<ref name=\"AKAJJTitle\" /> Sarandos had said that it was \"too hard to say now\" if the season would actually release in 2015, with Netflix's plan to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after ''Daredevil''{{'}}s April 2015 release.<ref name=\"NetflixReleasePlans\" /> However, Netflix soon confirmed that the season would indeed release in 2015,<ref name=\"NetflixReleaseConfirm\" /> announcing the November 20 release date in September.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> The season was enhanced to be available in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nIn May 2015, Marvel announced plans to reprint ''Alias'', the comic that the series is based on, with new covers from [[David W.

The reprints, which were all released digitally in June 2015, and up to issue 15 in two trade paperbacks in September, were intended to both celebrate the history of Jessica Jones, and introduce new audiences to the character ahead of the release of the season.<ref name=\"AliasReprint\" /> In late September through early October, Marvel and Netflix released short teasers for the season, which chronicled a day of Jones' life.<ref name=\"Teasers1\" /><ref name=\"Teasers2\" /> Also in early October, Marvel digitally released a 12-page [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comic by the original ''Alias'' creative team\u2014Bendis, Gaydos, and Mack\u2014set in the universe of the television series.<ref name=\"OneShotComic\" /> The one-shot was created as an exclusive for [[New York Comic Con]], where a print version was distributed.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|The comic]] sees Jessica Jones coming into contact with ''Daredevil'' character [[Turk Barrett]], and includes a short sequence featuring Daredevil,<ref name=\"OneShot\" /> to celebrate \"the connective tissue that will build between the series.\"<ref name=\"OneShotComic\" /> Also during New York Comic Con, Marvel set up a [[street marketing]] campaign, and screened \"[[AKA Ladies Night]]\" on October 10, while at the Marvel Booth fans could take their picture with the Alias Investigations desk, with Kilgrave's eyes appearing in the background of the final animation.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /><ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /> Marvel additionally partnered with [[Uber]] during the event to provide select riders with complimentary trips to or from the convention in custom designed SUVs.<ref name=\"NYCCUber\" />\n\nA full trailer was released at the end of October, with Meagan Damore of [[Comic Book Resources]] feeling that it helped establish the same tone as ''Daredevil'' and introduced \"Marvel's creepiest villain yet\" with Kilgrave. She also compared Jessica to some of the other female characters of the MCU\u2014[[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Melinda May]], and [[Peggy Carter]]\u2014feeling that Jessica stood out from the others because she does not have \"a sense of togetherness\" and was the most relatable because of her struggle with trauma, and that the season would have the amount of creative space required to explore the character that the other female characters were lacking.<ref name=\"CBRTrailer\" /> A second trailer was released on November 10, 2015. Sarene Leeds of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' felt that this trailer highlighted empowerment, compared to the first that \"was about illustrating the fear behind Jones's past\".<ref name=\"WSJTrailer2\" /> The season held its premiere in New York City on November 17.<ref name=\"Premiere\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] and [[Blu-ray]] in [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]] on August 22, 2017,<ref name=\"Region1HomeMedia\" /> in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] and [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]] on December 5, 2016,<ref name=\"Region2HomeMedia\" /> and in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] on December 7, 2016.<ref name=\"Region4HomeMedia\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Audience viewership===\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, [[Symphony Technology Group]] compiled data for the season based on a sample size of 15,000 people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, from September to December 2015, episodes of ''Jessica Jones'' averaged 4.8 million viewers during a 35-day viewing cycle. The data was presented by Alan Wurtzel, [[NBCUniversal]] president of research and media development, in a presentation aimed to provide \"perspective\" when stating \"digital platforms are hurting the traditional TV business\".<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers\" /> Netflix CCO [[Ted Sarandos]] responded to the data by saying that \"the whole methodology and the measurement and the data itself doesn't reflect any sense of reality of anything that we keep track of.\"<ref name=\"NetflixViewersResponse\" /> A further study from Symphony, for the same time period, found ''Jessica Jones'' to be one of the four most watched series in the 18 to 24 demographic, ahead of any broadcast network series.<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers2\" /> The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the fifth-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 26% of the viewers that the [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] of ''Daredevil'' received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.<ref name=\"JumpshotViewers\" /><ref name=\"JumpshotViewersPrecise\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align             = left\n | width             = 150\n | direction         = vertical\n | footer          = Krysten Ritter (top) and David Tennant (bottom) received near universal praise for their portrayals of Jessica Jones and Kilgrave, respectively, with Ritter able to \"display her impressive range\" to give \"an exceptional performance\", and Tennant being called \"a horrific joy to behold\".<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"LATimesReview\" />\n <!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Krysten Ritter 2011.jpg\n | width1            = \n | alt1              = \n <!--image 2-->\n | image2            = 2009 07 31 David Tennant smile 09.jpg\n | width2            = \n | alt2              = \n}}\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 94% approval rating with an average rating of 8.24/10 based on 80 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"''Jessica Jones'' builds a multifaceted drama around its engaging antihero, delivering what might be Marvel's strongest TV franchise to date.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/jessica-jones/s01/ |title=Marvel's Jessica Jones: Season 1 (2015) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 81 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating what the website considers to be \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-jessica-jones |title=Marvel's Jessica Jones : Season 1 |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=November 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe early screening of the first episode at New York Comic Con was met by a very positive reaction from the crowd.<ref name=\"IGNInitialThoughts\" /> George Marston of [[Newsarama]] gave the first episode a 10 out of 10, saying the season \"strikes a balance between self-aware noir and Marvel's first flirtations with psychological horror....not just another hit for Marvel and Netflix, but a landmark moment for female superheroes on TV.\"<ref name=\"NramaPilotReview\" /> Eric Goldman of [[IGN]] felt that \"''Jessica Jones'' starts out with a strong premiere episode that...easily goes further than anything in the MCU in terms of sexuality.\" He called Ritter \"a commendably tough, sardonic\" Jessica Jones and praised the supporting cast for the strong impressions they made,<ref name=\"IGNInitialThoughts\" /> later scoring the episode an 8.5 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNEp1Review\" /> Evan Valentine of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] gave the episode 5 stars out of 5, feeling that Tennant would \"ascend to the same level as [[Tom Hiddleston]]'s [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]'s [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] as one of the cornerstones of villainy in the MCU\".<ref name=\"ColliderPilotReview\" /> Katharine Trendacosta of [[io9]] also had positive thoughts on \"AKA Ladies Night\", highlighting the episode's use of light and color, especially with purple, and the way it portrays New York as how it \"actually looks\u2014not overly bright and shiny and clean, but not suffering a never-ending power-outage either\".<ref name=\"io9PilotThoughts\" /> Abraham Riesman noted the episode's presentation of sexuality, which \"was shockingly and refreshingly honest\", compared to Marvel's other films and television series. He concluded by applauding the season's bringing up of the topics of [[rape]] and PTSD.<ref name=\"VulturePilotSexuality\" />\n\nReviewing the first seven episodes of the season, Maureen Ryan of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave positive thoughts on ''Jessica Jones'', stating, \"The show, which features an exceptional performance from Krysten Ritter and sure-handed guidance from executive producer Melissa Rosenberg, is not just a contender for the title Best Marvel-related TV property; in a supremely crowded TV scene, it is one of the year's most distinctive new dramas.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Jack Shepard of ''[[The Independent]]'', also on the first seven episodes, felt the season \"not only matches [''Daredevil''] but exceeds expectations.\" Shepard gave exceptional praise to Tennant's Kilgrave, feeling he was one of the best villains produced by Marvel, and possibly \"the best on-screen comic book villain since [[Heath Ledger]]'s [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].\"<ref name=\"IndependentReview\" /> ''Forbes''{{'}} Merrill Barr stated that after seeing the first seven episodes, \"the answer is a resounding yes\" if lightning could strike twice for Marvel Television, claiming, \"In no uncertain terms, ''Jessica Jones'' is the best thing Marvel Television has ever produced. It contains all the hopeful anticipation of [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|[''Agents of''&nbsp;] ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'']], all the feminist-overtones of ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' and all the grittiness of ''Daredevil''.\"<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" /> \n\n''[[Deadline Hollywood]]''{{'s}} Dominic Patten also had praise for the season, particularly Rosenberg's influence on it, the coverage of topics such as \"PTSD, abuse, assault, shame, and death\" and the cast, highlighting Tennant's Kilgrave as the actor's best role as well as the MCU's best villain.<ref name=\"DeadlineReview\" /> Mary McNamara from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' felt ''Jessica Jones'' \"rewrote the definition of superhuman\" and was \"a marvel\", lauding the season's \"breathtaking\" examination of recovery from a sexually, emotionally and physically abusive relationship.<ref name=\"LATimesReview\" /> Daniel Fienberg for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' was also positive, saying the season \"looks and feels a bit like a cable anti-hero series\u2014but it's really more of a post-hero story, making it fascinating and unique in a marketplace that doesn't lack for costumed do-gooders of all types.\" His one criticism was that \"the show shares Jessica's monomaniacal fixation on [Kilgrave] and the result is a sort of narrative claustrophobia...Everything in these opening episodes ties back to Kilgrave and Kilgrave is such a twisted figure that it's hard for any light to get in.\"<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> Melissa Maerz of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' was slightly more critical of the season, awarding it a \"B\". Though Maerz felt Ritter was a good choice for Jessica and enjoyed the cinematography, she felt the season \"could've made for a gritty character drama if it weren't for the noir clich\u00e9s (saxophone music, shadows through glass) and a procedural structure that's very ''CSI: Marvel''. The show's biggest weakness is the same as Jessica's: It starts out with extraordinary potential, but somewhere along the way, it loses what make it special.\"<ref name=\"EWReview\" />\n\nGoldman, later reviewing the whole season, gave it a 9.3 out of 10. He commended all the actors, the relationship between Jessica and Trish, and the episode \"Sin Bin\", though was critical of the character Robyn. Additionally, Goldman also felt the season spent \"too many scenes devoted to Jeri's marital strife\" and that it hit its peak \"a bit before the actual end of the season\" similar to ''Daredevil'', with most of the thrilling moments earlier in the season.<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" />\n\n===Analysis===\nLibby Hill of the ''Los Angeles Times'' commented on how ''Jessica Jones'' exposed modern day sexism and [[misogyny]] through Kilgrave's use of the phrase \"Smile\", calling the season \"the most innocuous and incisive cultural critique\" from Marvel to date. Hill likened an early scene that shows Kilgrave asking Jones to smile, and her obliging, to \"similar well-meaning scenarios [that] play out in the real world time and again each day\" many in the form of gendered [[street harassment]], that resonates with many women. Hill also added that \"Kilgrave serves as an exaggerated representation of perceived consent,\" due to the response he gives later in the season to Jessica about never knowing if someone is doing what they want or what he tells them to do. She concludes that \"''Jessica Jones'' is revolutionary because in acknowledging casual misogyny and exaggerating its most destructive tendencies, it exposes the pervasive toxicity therein. It does all of this without making a show of its politics, instead resting easy on the knowledge that all too many women will relate to the subtleties of its premise.\"<ref name=\"LATimesAnalysis\" /> Amy C. Chambers, writing for The Science and Entertainment Laboratory, noted how the season moved away from sexism even more so than the comics, by changing Kilgrave's abilities from phermone based, with a particular effect on women, to viral, with equal effect no matter gender, indicating that \"powerlessness is not gendered.\"<ref name=\"ScienceAnalysis\" />\n\nKwame Opam at ''[[The Verge]]'' chose to examine rape and the nature of consent in the season. Comparing ''Jessica Jones'' to other television series that have depicted rape (''[[Game of Thrones]]'', ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]'', and ''[[Outlander (TV series)|Outlander]]''), Opam felt that \"since rape is one of the show's core themes, we never need to see it... rape is a foundational part of the text, and its presence is constant. Even if it's invisible, it's always there.\" He also felt the season took the time to examine how rape happens and what it means, especially in terms of power and consent, concluding, \"''Jessica Jones'' moves the conversation about rape forward by treating it as a complex subject worth investigating, rather than as spice for a story...Maybe we don't need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it is. Maybe our energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all.\"<ref name=\"VergeAnalysis\" /> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Lili Loofbourow also discussed the season's depiction of rape and consent, noting the complications that come with Kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than just how to act, and saying, \"however exceptional Kilgrave's power seems, the moral quagmire it produces is all too common. It's the condition of the rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault. It's the condition of the soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets are innocent. It's the condition of the battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays \"of her own free will\". It's the condition of...any person, really, who agrees, whatever the context, to consent to forgo consent in the future.\" Loofbourow also discussed the character of Simpson, comparing his power-inducing red pill to the anti-feminist \"red pillers\", and noting that his taking of the pills \"renders him not just dangerously delusional, but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts the pill's effects.\"<ref name=\"GuardianAnalysis\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n''Jessica Jones'' was included on multiple Best/Top TV Shows of 2015 lists, ranking on ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''{{'}}s (1st, along with ''Daredevil''),<ref name=\"PeopleTop102015\" /> [[Indiewire]] and ''[[The Star-Ledger]]''{{'}}s (2nd),<ref name=\"IndiewireTop102015\" /><ref name=\"StarLedgerTop102015\" /> [[NPR]]'s (3rd),<ref name=\"NPRTop122015\" /> [[ScreenCrush]]'s (4th),<ref name=\"ScreenCrushTop102015\" /> [[Digital Spy]]'s (5th),<ref name=\"DigitalSpyTop102015\" /> ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]''{{'}}s (6th),<ref name=\"ComplexTop252015\" /> [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'s (7th),<ref name=\"VultureTop102015\" /> ''[[Slate Magazine]]''{{'}}s (9th),<ref name=\"SlateTop252015\" /> and ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s (11th).<ref name=\"TVGuideTop202015\" /> It was also included on un-ranked lists from Maureen Ryan of ''Variety'',<ref name=\"VarietyTop202015\" /> Mary McNamara of the ''Los Angeles Times'',<ref name=\"LATimesTop102015\" /> ''[[The Week (magazine)|The Week]]'',<ref name=\"WeekTop102015\" /> and ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.<ref name=\"WiredTop152015\" /> In December 2015, IGN named ''Jessica Jones'' the Netflix's best original series released to date,<ref name=\"IGNNetflixTop10\" /> and it was named one of the Best New Shows of 2015 by Ryan,<ref name=\"VarietyTop20New2015\" /> as well as the tenth best new show of 2015 by ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'}}s Jeff Jensen.<ref name=\"EWJensenTop102015\" /> ''[[The Atlantic]]'' named \"[[AKA WWJD?]]\" one of the best television episodes of 2015.<ref name=\"AtlanticBest2015\" /> Additionally, ''Jessica Jones'' was the second most trending television series search on [[Google]] for 2015.<ref name=\"GoogleTrend\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

She and Misty find Danny, and Ward gets his NA sponsor Bethany to tend to Danny's injuries. While Ward stays with Danny, Colleen and Misty go to ensure that Joy is safe and find her with Walker. Colleen and Misty overpower Walker, and take the two back to the dojo where Joy confirms that she knew what Davos planned all along and had wanted to hurt Danny.\n |LineColor = 314548\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 19\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n |Title = The Dragon Dies at Dawn\n |DirectedBy = [[Philip John]]\n |WrittenBy = Matthew White\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|9|7}}\n |ShortSummary = Joy reveals that the ritual was carried out by three tattoo artists called the Crane Sisters. Hoping that they can reverse the process, Colleen and Misty go to find them leaving Ward to watch over Danny, Joy, and Walker. Walker agrees to take Danny back to where the ritual took place to confront Davos, leaving Ward and Joy to discuss their relationship. Joy refuses to forgive Ward and leaves him. After explaining that they are accessories to a crime, Misty gets the Crane Sisters to agree to reversing the ritual. Walker reveals to Danny that she actually plans to kill Davos before running away to live in a secluded cabin in peace. This would allow her to avoid any of the triggers that bring Mary to the surface. Danny convinces her to take Davos hostage instead, and when he returns from his killing spree across the city Davos is subdued. He manages to break Danny's leg before falling unconscious. Walker calls an ambulance for Danny, but Davos is left behind when Mary is triggered and runs away after hearing that Walker plans to keep her trapped.\n |LineColor = 314548\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 20\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = Morning of the Mindstorm\n |DirectedBy = [[Stephen Surjik]]\n |WrittenBy = Rebecca Dameron\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|9|7}}\n |ShortSummary = With the help of a state-of-the-art leg brace, Danny begins to recover from his injury but is unable to fight. Misty hopes to gain the help of the local police precinct to stop Davos, but Captain William Pike is unwilling to do so since Davos is putting an end to organised crime in the neighborhood. In addition to continuing his killing spree, Davos recruits the gang of local kids and plans to train them as soldiers to help fight his war against crime in New York City. Danny also wants to begin training again, hoping that Colleen will re-open her dojo for teaching. She does not want to take the responsibility for a student who could fight and die, but eventually relents and begins training Danny to fight with his injury. Misty learns the requirements of the ritual from Prada, and goes in search of more help. Ward turns to alcohol to drown his sorrows, despite the protests of Bethany. Ward later hears her reveal in an NA meeting that she is pregnant with his child. Joy visits Mary, who realizes that she is protected by Walker.

Walker always believed that it was Mary who broke them out, and psychiatrist Paul Edmonds suggests that they may have another alternate personality; Walker dismisses this idea. Joy attempts to undermine Davos by searching for the bowl, and asks Ward to take over a business venture that she is carrying out in the memory of their mother. He worries that she is in danger, and Walker agrees to help him kill Davos. BB helps Joy steal the bowl, while Davos unsuccessfully tries to convince the wider community of the nobility of his crusade. The remnants of the triads band together to stop him, and all Danny can do is try and stop him first. Colleen tries to teach Danny to overcome his emotional bond to Davos, allowing him to realize the negative impact on his life that the Iron Fist has had.

Misty returns with a police taskforce ready to capture Davos, as well as Frank Choi who had cut a deal to turn on the Golden Tigers. From Choi's information, Colleen deduces that her mother came to New York and could still be in the city. Davos discovers the missing bowl, and critically injures Joy by pushing her off a balcony. BB contacts the rest of his gang, hoping that they will see reason, but they tell Davos that he has gone to a community center where Colleen volunteers. Danny and Colleen go to the center to stop the combined triads from mobilizing to attack, but Davos and his gang arrive. BB faces his gang, and is killed. Colleen fights the rest off until Misty and the police can arrive. Danny overpowers Davos, and meets the Crane Sisters at the dojo to undertake the ritual again.

Misty wakes up, escapes capture, and helps Danny stop Walker by triggering Mary. Colleen fights Davos, and is able to draw the rest of the Iron Fist power out of him. With Davos arrested, Danny is unsure of his purpose in life. Colleen prepares to protect the streets of Chinatown as the new Iron Fist, while Joy attempts to return to her normal life. Walker, considering the possibility of having another, more violent identity, decides to stay affiliated with Joy and her influence. Ward attempts to reconcile with Bethany, but she chooses to raise their child on her own. Danny decides to leave New York to find [[Orson Randall]], the man from whom Davos acquired the Iron Fist corpse.

Metzner pitched a story for the season that excited Marvel, and Loeb compared the change to a new writer taking over on a comic.<ref name=\"NewShowrunnerExplanation\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe season begins after the events of ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', and sees Rand fulfill his promise to protect New York following the supposed death of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] at the end of that miniseries. For the season, Metzner also wanted to explore more of the mythology of [[K'un-Lun]] than was shown in the first season by spending more time there.<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> Each episode is named after the issue title of various comics Danny Rand has appeared in,<ref name=\"S2EpisodeTitlesEliteDaily\" /> after the first season named each episode after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences.<ref name=\"S1EpTitlesKungFu\" />\n\nWhen asked how the season would be influenced by the criticisms of the first, Metzner said that Marvel had allowed him to tell his own story rather than follow on from the first season and so he just approached the project as a fan of the comics and characters. He described the second season as an \"evolution\" of the first.<ref name=\"MetznerS1Criticisms\" /> Jones felt that Rand would be more relatable for the audience in the second season after moving in with his girlfriend and spending less time around Rand Enterprises. Metzner described this approach as \"[[holistic]]\", wanting the series to feel like being on the streets of New York.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesRelatableSDCCCBR\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[Finn Jones]], [[Jessica Henwick]], [[Tom Pelphrey]], [[Jessica Stroup]], and [[Sacha Dhawan]] reprise their roles as [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand / Iron Fist]], [[Colleen Wing]], [[Ward Meachum]], [[Joy Meachum]], and [[Steel Serpent|Davos]], respectively. They are joined in the season by [[Alice Eve]] as [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]].<ref name=\"EveCast\" /><ref name=\"TyphoidMary\" /> Metzner had previously written a different version of Typhoid Mary for the film ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'' (2005), and was always interested in that character and well-versed in her comic story. Eve described her introduction in the season as an origin story that explores the mystery of the character's multiple personalities, while Loeb said, \"We meet her at a certain point in her life and then cards get tipped over as you go.\"<ref name=\"EveCBRAug2018\" />\n\nWith the announcement of the season, it was revealed that [[Simone Missick]] would appear, reprising her role as [[Misty Knight]] from previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|MCU Netflix series]].<ref name=\"S2Announce\" /> This allows for the exploration of the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] team that Wing and Knight form in the comics.<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> [[James C. Chen|James Chen]] had also joined the cast as Sam Chung, a role loosely based on the comics supporting character of the [[Blindspot (Sam Chung)|same name]].<ref name=\"SamChung\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the season was expected to begin \"soon\" after it was announced at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"FilmingSoon\" /> with actor [[Sacha Dhawan]] saying then that \"they're hopefully starting\" by December 2017.<ref name=\"DhawanFilming\" /> By December 13, filming on the season had begun,<ref name=\"FilmingBegin\" /> in New York City where the production [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on May 10, 2018. Jones described this as the end of a \"long and physical 7 month winter shoot\".<ref name=\"FilmingWrapped\" /> Extensive filming took place in New York's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> Niels Alpert served as cinematographer for the season.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesRelatableSDCCCBR\" />\n\nClayton Barber took over as the fight coordinator for the season, having also served in the role on Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018),<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> after the fight choreography of the first season was widely criticized. Barber was inspired by \"old school kung fu\" such as the works of [[Jackie Chan]], and wanted to make the fights of the series feel like \"a punk rock song\".<ref name=\"BarberSDCC\" /><ref name=\"BarberSDCCVid\" /> Metzner noted that Jones had months of lead time before work on the season began to \"hone his skills\" with the fighting and stunts, and said that he and the rest of the cast along with Barber \"really pushed themselves\" with the fight sequences in the season. Jones added that all of the fight scenes have \"an emotional standpoint\" so that they drive the story forward rather than simply being \"awesome fight scenes\" for the sake of having fights.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesFightsSDCCCBR\" />\n\n===Music===\nRobert Lydecker composed the music for the season.<ref name=\"Lydecker\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nThe fictional country of Sokovia that was introduced in the MCU film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015) is referenced in the season as part of Walker's past as an operative in the country.<ref name=\"AoU\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nJones, Henwick, Missick, Eve, Loeb, Metzner, and Barber promoted the season at San Diego Comic-Con 2018.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Charles Pulliam-Moore of [[io9]] felt the footage shown at the panel left him optimistic for the season, since \"It finally feels like ''Iron Fist'' may have figured out what people wanted out of this show in the first place.\" He felt the clips showed \"how drastic an improvement\" there was to the fight choreography, thanks in part to new fight coordinator Barber joining the series. One clip that showed Rand facing Davos in K'un-Lun felt \"brutal and bloody\" while also being \"fluid and elegant in a way that feels fresh, new, and {{em|exactly}} like what you want from ''Iron Fist''.\"<ref name=\"io9ComicCon\" /> At the panel, Loeb appeared in a karate costume, as part of a comedic bit with Henwick, who later appeared on stage telling Loeb to remove the outfit. Some criticized the outfit as insensitive and \"several layers of bad\".<ref name=\"TeenVogueLoebOutfit\" /><ref name=\"BuzzFeedLoebOutfit\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe second season of ''Iron Fist'', consisting of ten episodes,<ref name=\"IFS2Episodes\" /> was released on September 7, 2018, on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] [[Netflix]] worldwide,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" />\n\n==Critical response==\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 57% approval rating, based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 5.69/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Better action scenes and tighter pacing elevate ''Iron Fist''{{'}}s second season, but it remains a lesser light among MCU shows.\"<ref>{{cite web

name]], follows Danny Rand / Iron Fist, a martial arts expert with the ability to call upon the power of the Iron Fist. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with [[Raven Metzner]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Finn Jones]] stars as Rand, who protects New York following the events of ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]''. [[Jessica Henwick]], [[Tom Pelphrey]], [[Jessica Stroup]], and [[Sacha Dhawan]] also return from the [[Iron Fist (season 1)|first season]] to star, and are joined by [[Simone Missick]], reprising her role from previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel Netflix series]], and [[Alice Eve]]. The season was ordered in July 2017, with Metzner replacing [[Scott Buck]] as showrunner. Filming for the season began in late 2017 in New York City, and continued until May 2018. Focus was placed on improving the fight sequences for the series after [[Iron Fist (season 1)#Fight scene criticisms|criticisms of the first season]], with Clayton Barber taking over as fight coordinator after doing so for the MCU film ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''. Each episode in the season is named after a comics issue that Rand has appeared in.\n\nThe season was released on September 7, 2018, and consists of ten episodes. The season received mixed reviews from critics, but was considered a major improvement over the previous season. Netflix canceled the series on October 12, 2018.<ref name=\"Canceled\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#314548 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=24 |titleR={{efn|name=Titles|Each episode is named after the issue title of various comics Danny Rand has appeared in.<ref name=\"S2EpisodeTitlesEliteDaily\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elitedaily.com/p/the-iron-fist-season-2-episode-titles-will-be-tweeted-out-one-at-a-time-9904752|title=The 'Iron Fist' Season 2 Episode Titles Will Be Tweeted Out One At A Time|last=Bundel|first=Ani|work=[[Elite Daily]]|date=July 26, 2018|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"S2EpisodeTitlesComicBook\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2018/07/24/iron-fist-season-2-episode-titles/|title=\u2018Iron Fist\u2019 Twitter Feed Teases Season 2 Episode Titles|last=Barnhardt|first=Adam|publisher=Comicbook.com|date=July 24, 2018|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}</ref>}} |director=15 |writer=36 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-iron-fist/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's iron fist on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 14\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = The Fury of Iron Fist\n |DirectedBy = [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Raven Metzner|M.

Colleen finds a box bearing the [[Kamon (crest)|kamon]] of her family, who pushed her away years earlier. She begins investigating where the box may have come from, and comes to believe that furniture shop owner Frank Choi may know of its origin. He goes missing when he is unable to pay the Golden Tigers for protection. Danny and Ward Meachum\u2014who runs Danny's company\u2014meet with Ward's sister Joy, who asks for them to buy her out of the company; Danny agrees. Joy is working with Davos, who was raised with Danny in the mystical city of [[K'un-Lun]]. Davos confronts Danny, revealing that he has discovered a way to take the Iron Fist from Danny.

Now, fighting between the Golden Tigers and the Hatchets escalates and Danny is unable to convince Hai-Qing Yang, the leader of the Hatchets, to look for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. On the streets, Danny meets a strange newcomer to the city, [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Mary]], and helps her by giving her directions and trying to protect her from the gang violence. She develops feelings for Danny in response to his kindness. Joy and Davos use blackmail to acquire an antique bowl from Mika Prada, an old acquaintance of Joy's. Colleen convinces Hai-Qing's wife Sherry to talk her husband into peace. Davos later meets with Hai-Qing regarding shipments that he has coming into the Hatchet's docks, and when he learns that the group can no longer secure his items given they now plan to share the docks with the Golden Tigers Davos gives Hai-Qing a stroke.\n |LineColor = 314548\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 16\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = This Deadly Secret\n |DirectedBy = [[Toa Fraser]]\n |WrittenBy = Tatiana Suarez-Pico\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|9|7}}\n |ShortSummary = Learning of Joy and Davos's partnership, Ward asks Danny to invite the pair over for dinner so they can all discuss their differences. Despite Davos's protests, Joy agrees to avoid suspicion. Mary leaves a set of surveillance photos showing Danny and Colleen at the dojo, and when Danny confronts her about them Mary says that they are being watched by someone named Walker. Ward believes that someone at his [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings is working for Joy, and becomes paranoid. He ultimately does not come to the dinner. Joy and Davos feign niceties until Colleen demands that they discuss their grievances with Danny. Davos finds the surveillance photos, which he and Joy had arranged to be taken, and the pair leave. Danny and Colleen come to a parlay between the Golden Tigers and the Hatchets, now represented by Mrs. Yang. Negotiations appear successful, but Danny believes that the Golden Tigers have set a trap and attacks them. Mrs. Yang escapes with Colleen.

Danny attempts to reignite peace talks between the triads, but the Golden Tigers have already seized the docks and the Hatchets are preparing to fight back. Danny visits Hai-Qing and realizes that Davos had caused the stroke. Hai-Qing is able to tell Danny what Davos was having brought in at the docks. Danny and Colleen are met by Detective [[Misty Knight]], a friend who Danny gave a robotic arm to after she lost hers fighting the Hand. Misty explains that the trap Danny had seen was actually police officers watching the parlay, and asks Danny to stay away from now on. He instead goes to the docks on his own, but Davos has already killed the Golden Tiger soldiers there and taken what he wanted: the tattooed skin from the corpse of an old Iron Fist. Danny is attacked, drugged, and taken by Walker to the site of a ritual in which the bowl, skin, and Danny's blood are used to transfer the power of the Iron Fist to Davos.\n |LineColor = 314548\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 18\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = Heart of the Dragon\n |DirectedBy = [[Mairzee Almas]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Declan de Barra]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|9|7}}\n |ShortSummary = Bleeding out, Danny is found by a group of local kids who have started their own triad. They plan to give Danny to the Golden Tigers in exchange for a bounty. Colleen and Misty attempt to find Danny by tracking down Walker, and get Ward's help to quickly run a fingerprint search on the surveillance photos. Davos looks to become the Iron Fist that Danny never was, starting with ending the triad war himself. He goes to a nightclub owned by the Golden Tigers and kills their leadership. Joy begins to fear what Davos may do to her, and hires Walker for protection. One of the kids holding Danny, BB\u2014who Colleen had run into several times before\u2014is convinced by Danny to call Colleen. She and Misty find Danny, and Ward gets his NA sponsor Bethany to tend to Danny's injuries. While Ward stays with Danny, Colleen and Misty go to ensure that Joy is safe and find her with Walker.

Hoping that they can reverse the process, Colleen and Misty go to find them leaving Ward to watch over Danny, Joy, and Walker. Walker agrees to take Danny back to where the ritual took place to confront Davos, leaving Ward and Joy to discuss their relationship. Joy refuses to forgive Ward and leaves him. After explaining that they are accessories to a crime, Misty gets the Crane Sisters to agree to reversing the ritual. Walker reveals to Danny that she actually plans to kill Davos before running away to live in a secluded cabin in peace. This would allow her to avoid any of the triggers that bring Mary to the surface. Danny convinces her to take Davos hostage instead, and when he returns from his killing spree across the city Davos is subdued. He manages to break Danny's leg before falling unconscious.

Misty hopes to gain the help of the local police precinct to stop Davos, but Captain William Pike is unwilling to do so since Davos is putting an end to organised crime in the neighborhood. In addition to continuing his killing spree, Davos recruits the gang of local kids and plans to train them as soldiers to help fight his war against crime in New York City. Danny also wants to begin training again, hoping that Colleen will re-open her dojo for teaching. She does not want to take the responsibility for a student who could fight and die, but eventually relents and begins training Danny to fight with his injury. Misty learns the requirements of the ritual from Prada, and goes in search of more help. Ward turns to alcohol to drown his sorrows, despite the protests of Bethany. Ward later hears her reveal in an NA meeting that she is pregnant with his child. Joy visits Mary, who realizes that she is protected by Walker.

Walker always believed that it was Mary who broke them out, and psychiatrist Paul Edmonds suggests that they may have another alternate personality; Walker dismisses this idea. Joy attempts to undermine Davos by searching for the bowl, and asks Ward to take over a business venture that she is carrying out in the memory of their mother. He worries that she is in danger, and Walker agrees to help him kill Davos. BB helps Joy steal the bowl, while Davos unsuccessfully tries to convince the wider community of the nobility of his crusade. The remnants of the triads band together to stop him, and all Danny can do is try and stop him first. Colleen tries to teach Danny to overcome his emotional bond to Davos, allowing him to realize the negative impact on his life that the Iron Fist has had. Danny suggests that Colleen should take the power from Davos.\n |LineColor = 314548\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 22\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = War Without End\n |DirectedBy = Sanford Bookstaver\n |WrittenBy = Daniel Shattuck\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|9|7}}\n |ShortSummary = Colleen refuses to take the power of the Iron Fist. Misty returns with a police taskforce ready to capture Davos, as well as Frank Choi who had cut a deal to turn on the Golden Tigers. From Choi's information, Colleen deduces that her mother came to New York and could still be in the city. Davos discovers the missing bowl, and critically injures Joy by pushing her off a balcony. BB contacts the rest of his gang, hoping that they will see reason, but they tell Davos that he has gone to a community center where Colleen volunteers. Danny and Colleen go to the center to stop the combined triads from mobilizing to attack, but Davos and his gang arrive. BB faces his gang, and is killed. Colleen fights the rest off until Misty and the police can arrive. Danny overpowers Davos, and meets the Crane Sisters at the dojo to undertake the ritual again. Mourning BB, Colleen agrees to take the Iron Fist, but the ritual is interrupted leaving both Davos and Colleen with the power. Misty, Ward, and Walker find Joy, and Ward takes her to safety.

Walker waits for Davos to return and attempts to kill him, but Danny warns that killing Davos will kill Colleen as well until the ritual is complete. Misty wakes up, escapes capture, and helps Danny stop Walker by triggering Mary. Colleen fights Davos, and is able to draw the rest of the Iron Fist power out of him. With Davos arrested, Danny is unsure of his purpose in life. Colleen prepares to protect the streets of Chinatown as the new Iron Fist, while Joy attempts to return to her normal life. Walker, considering the possibility of having another, more violent identity, decides to stay affiliated with Joy and her influence. Ward attempts to reconcile with Bethany, but she chooses to raise their child on her own. Danny decides to leave New York to find [[Orson Randall]], the man from whom Davos acquired the Iron Fist corpse. Ward travels with him, and months later Danny has stolen two guns from Randall with which he can form Iron Fists.\n |LineColor = 314548\n}}\n}}\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Iron Fist characters}}\n{{Columns-start|num=3}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Finn Jones]] as [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand / Iron Fist]]<ref name=\"EveCast\" />\n* [[Jessica Henwick]] as [[Colleen Wing]]<ref name=\"EveCast\" />\n* [[Tom Pelphrey]] as [[Ward Meachum]]<ref name=\"EveCast\" />\n* [[Jessica Stroup]] as [[Joy Meachum]]<ref name=\"EveCast\" />\n* [[Sacha Dhawan]] as [[Steel Serpent|Davos]]<ref name=\"EveCast\" />\n* [[Simone Missick]] as [[Misty Knight]]<ref name=\"S2Announce\" />\n* [[Alice Eve]] as [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|\"Typhoid Mary\" Walker]]<ref name=\"EveCast\" />\n{{column}}\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Giullian Yao Gioiello]] as BB\n* Natalie Smith as Bethany\n* Jason Lai as Rhyno\n* Christine Toy Johnson as Sherry Yang\n* [[James C.

Metzner pitched a story for the season that excited Marvel, and Loeb compared the change to a new writer taking over on a comic.<ref name=\"NewShowrunnerExplanation\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe season begins after the events of ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', and sees Rand fulfill his promise to protect New York following the supposed death of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] at the end of that miniseries. For the season, Metzner also wanted to explore more of the mythology of [[K'un-Lun]] than was shown in the first season by spending more time there.<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> Each episode is named after the issue title of various comics Danny Rand has appeared in,<ref name=\"S2EpisodeTitlesEliteDaily\" /> after the first season named each episode after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences.<ref name=\"S1EpTitlesKungFu\" />\n\nWhen asked how the season would be influenced by the criticisms of the first, Metzner said that Marvel had allowed him to tell his own story rather than follow on from the first season and so he just approached the project as a fan of the comics and characters. He described the second season as an \"evolution\" of the first.<ref name=\"MetznerS1Criticisms\" /> Jones felt that Rand would be more relatable for the audience in the second season after moving in with his girlfriend and spending less time around Rand Enterprises. Metzner described this approach as \"[[holistic]]\", wanting the series to feel like being on the streets of New York.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesRelatableSDCCCBR\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[Finn Jones]], [[Jessica Henwick]], [[Tom Pelphrey]], [[Jessica Stroup]], and [[Sacha Dhawan]] reprise their roles as [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand / Iron Fist]], [[Colleen Wing]], [[Ward Meachum]], [[Joy Meachum]], and [[Steel Serpent|Davos]], respectively. They are joined in the season by [[Alice Eve]] as [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]].<ref name=\"EveCast\" /><ref name=\"TyphoidMary\" /> Metzner had previously written a different version of Typhoid Mary for the film ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'' (2005), and was always interested in that character and well-versed in her comic story. Eve described her introduction in the season as an origin story that explores the mystery of the character's multiple personalities, while Loeb said, \"We meet her at a certain point in her life and then cards get tipped over as you go.\"<ref name=\"EveCBRAug2018\" />\n\nWith the announcement of the season, it was revealed that [[Simone Missick]] would appear, reprising her role as [[Misty Knight]] from previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|MCU Netflix series]].<ref name=\"S2Announce\" /> This allows for the exploration of the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] team that Wing and Knight form in the comics.<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> [[James C. Chen|James Chen]] had also joined the cast as Sam Chung, a role loosely based on the comics supporting character of the [[Blindspot (Sam Chung)|same name]].<ref name=\"SamChung\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the season was expected to begin \"soon\" after it was announced at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"FilmingSoon\" /> with actor [[Sacha Dhawan]] saying then that \"they're hopefully starting\" by December 2017.<ref name=\"DhawanFilming\" /> By December 13, filming on the season had begun,<ref name=\"FilmingBegin\" /> in New York City where the production [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on May 10, 2018. Jones described this as the end of a \"long and physical 7 month winter shoot\".<ref name=\"FilmingWrapped\" /> Extensive filming took place in New York's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> Niels Alpert served as cinematographer for the season.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesRelatableSDCCCBR\" />\n\nClayton Barber took over as the fight coordinator for the season, having also served in the role on Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018),<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> after the fight choreography of the first season was widely criticized. Barber was inspired by \"old school kung fu\" such as the works of [[Jackie Chan]], and wanted to make the fights of the series feel like \"a punk rock song\".<ref name=\"BarberSDCC\" /><ref name=\"BarberSDCCVid\" /> Metzner noted that Jones had months of lead time before work on the season began to \"hone his skills\" with the fighting and stunts, and said that he and the rest of the cast along with Barber \"really pushed themselves\" with the fight sequences in the season. Jones added that all of the fight scenes have \"an emotional standpoint\" so that they drive the story forward rather than simply being \"awesome fight scenes\" for the sake of having fights.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesFightsSDCCCBR\" />\n\n===Music===\nRobert Lydecker composed the music for the season.<ref name=\"Lydecker\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nThe fictional country of Sokovia that was introduced in the MCU film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015) is referenced in the season as part of Walker's past as an operative in the country.<ref name=\"AoU\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe second season of ''Iron Fist'', consisting of ten episodes,<ref name=\"IFS2Episodes\" /> was released on September 7, 2018, on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] [[Netflix]] worldwide,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nJones, Henwick, Missick, Eve, Loeb, Metzner, and Barber promoted the season at San Diego Comic-Con 2018.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Charles Pulliam-Moore of [[io9]] felt the footage shown at the panel left him optimistic for the season, since \"It finally feels like ''Iron Fist'' may have figured out what people wanted out of this show in the first place.\" He felt the clips showed \"how drastic an improvement\" there was to the fight choreography, thanks in part to new fight coordinator Barber joining the series. One clip that showed Rand facing Davos in K'un-Lun felt \"brutal and bloody\" while also being \"fluid and elegant in a way that feels fresh, new, and {{em|exactly}} like what you want from ''Iron Fist''.\"<ref name=\"io9ComicCon\" /> At the panel, Loeb appeared in a karate costume, as part of a comedic bit with Henwick, who later appeared on stage telling Loeb to remove the outfit. Some criticized the outfit as insensitive and \"several layers of bad\".<ref name=\"TeenVogueLoebOutfit\" /><ref name=\"BuzzFeedLoebOutfit\" />\n\n==Critical response==\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 57% approval rating, based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 5.69/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Better action scenes and tighter pacing elevate ''Iron Fist''{{'}}s second season, but it remains a lesser light among MCU shows.\"<ref>{{cite web
