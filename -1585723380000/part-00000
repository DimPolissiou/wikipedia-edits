Often considered his \"most enduring and well-known song,\" Van Zandt first recorded it for his 1972 album ''[[The Late Great Townes Van Zandt]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beviglia|first=Jim|title=Townes van Zandt, \"Pancho and Lefty\"|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/04/townes-van-zandt-pancho-and-lefty//|accessdate=5 June 2012|publisher=American Songwriter|date=30 April 2012}}</ref> The song has been recorded by several artists since its composition and performance by van Zandt, with the Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard version selling the most copies and reaching the Billboard top hits list.\n\n==Content and composition==\n The song is a ballad of four stanzas which use a 2-verse refrain:(\"All the Federales say they could've had him any day/ They only let him slip away out of kindness I suppose.\") The first two stanzas are sung back-to-back - the first introduces Pancho as a young idealist and his mother's favorite son, who left home expecting that being on the road would result in freedom and purity of heart - but actually produced \"skin like iron and breath like kerosene\". The second stanza explains that he had become a bandit, rode a fast horse, made no excuses about what he now was, and was ultimately cut down in the deserts of Mexico.  After the refrain, the third stanza introduces Lefty who was severely traumatized by Pancho's death but indicates he was also directly responsible - that he fled to the U.S. the same day Pancho died using funds from an unknown source. The final stanza is an epilogue which depicts Pancho's life being glorified by others while Lefty's fate is to just grow old under abject conditions. A line from the last stanza suggests that the betrayal could be attributed to Lefty's disillusionment with outlaw life and needing the reward money to break free (\"He only did what he had to do\")\n  Summary and Conclusion: Pancho and Lefty are the main protagonists against the paradoxical backdrop of the Federales who attempt to portray themselves as competent and generous (we could have had him any day but out of kindness let him slip away) while knowing they never could have caught Pancho without paying for Lefty's betrayal.  Although everyone has flaws, the betrayal and bribery by Lefty and the Federales elevates Pancho to a sympathetic and tragic anti-hero who's even denied any last words for his tombstone.  The song concludes with some poetic justice - for Lefty it's getting older while destitute, and for the few remaining elderly Federales to ineffectually continue claiming how virtuous they always were.  \n\nThe lyrics don't really coincide with the historic details of the life and death of the famous Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa although in an interview, the writer (Townes Van Zandt), doesn't completely rule out the idea but adds \"It came from out of the blue. It came through me and it's a real nice song...I've always wondered what it's about. I kinda always knew it wasn't about Pancho Villa but then somebody told me that Pancho Villa had a buddy whose name in Spanish meant 'Lefty.' \nIn the same interview, Van Zandt recalled, \"We got stopped by these two policeman and...they said 'What do you do for a living?', and I said, 'Well, I'm a songwriter', and they both kind of looked around like 'pitiful, pitiful', and so on to that I added, 'I wrote that song \"Pancho and Lefty\". You ever heard that song \"Pancho and Lefty\"? I wrote that', and they looked back around and they looked at each other and started grinning, and it turns out that their squad car, you know their partnership, it was two guys, it was an Anglo and a Hispanic, and it turns out, they're called Pancho and Lefty ... so I think maybe that's what it's about, those two guys ... I hope I never see them again.   \"<ref name=\"AustinPickers\">1984 PBS series, \"Austin Pickers\". Ed Heffelfinger. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZrAy6iXj7o</ref>\n\n==Video release==\nA music video was released for the song in 1983, depicting [[Willie Nelson]] as Pancho, and [[Merle Haggard]] as Lefty. [[Townes Van Zandt]] also appears in a supporting role.

Often considered his \"most enduring and well-known song,\" Van Zandt first recorded it for his 1972 album ''[[The Late Great Townes Van Zandt]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beviglia|first=Jim|title=Townes van Zandt, \"Pancho and Lefty\"|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/04/townes-van-zandt-pancho-and-lefty//|accessdate=5 June 2012|publisher=American Songwriter|date=30 April 2012}}</ref> The song has been recorded by several artists since its composition and performance by van Zandt, with the Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard version selling the most copies and reaching the Billboard top hits list.\n\n==Content and composition==\nThe song is a ballad of four stanzas which use a 2-verse refrain: \"All the Federales say they could've had him any day/ They only let him slip away out of kindness I suppose.\" The first two stanzas are sung back-to-back followed by the refrain. The first introduces Pancho as a young idealist and his mother's favorite son, who left home imagining that being on the road would result in freedom and purity of heart - but only resulted in having \"skin like iron and breath like kerosene\". The second stanza adds that he acquired a fast horse, had become a bandit, made no excuses about what he now was, and was ultimately cut down in the deserts of Mexico.  After the refrain, the third stanza introduces Lefty who was negatively impacted by Pancho's death but also indicates he was directly responsible - that he fled to the US the same day using funds from an unknown source. The final stanza is an epilogue which depicts Pancho's life being glorified by others while Lefty's fate is to just grow old in ignoble circumstances. A line from the last stanza implies that the betrayal was most likely due to Lefty's disillusionment with the life of being an outlaw and needing the reward money to break free - \"He only did what he had to do\"  \n\nThe lyrics don't really coincide with the historic details of the life and death of the famous Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa although in an interview, the writer (Townes Van Zandt), doesn't completely rule out the idea but adds \"It came from out of the blue. It came through me and it's a real nice song...I've always wondered what it's about. I kinda always knew it wasn't about Pancho Villa but then somebody told me that Pancho Villa had a buddy whose name in Spanish meant 'Lefty.' \nIn the same interview, Van Zandt recalled, \"We got stopped by these two policeman and...they said 'What do you do for a living?', and I said, 'Well, I'm a songwriter', and they both kind of looked around like 'pitiful, pitiful', and so on to that I added, 'I wrote that song \"Pancho and Lefty\". You ever heard that song \"Pancho and Lefty\"? I wrote that', and they looked back around and they looked at each other and started grinning, and it turns out that their squad car, you know their partnership, it was two guys, it was an Anglo and a Hispanic, and it turns out, they're called Pancho and Lefty ... so I think maybe that's what it's about, those two guys ... I hope I never see them again.   \"<ref name=\"AustinPickers\">1984 PBS series, \"Austin Pickers\". Ed Heffelfinger. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZrAy6iXj7o</ref>\n\n==Video release==\nA music video was released for the song in 1983, depicting [[Willie Nelson]] as Pancho, and [[Merle Haggard]] as Lefty. [[Townes Van Zandt]] also appears in a supporting role. Willie's daughter Lana (who was the one that suggested the recording of the duet) directed the video, the first for Nelson and second for Haggard, the first being for \"Are the Good Times Really Over?\" a year prior.\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe song reached No. 1 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot Country Songs for chart dated July 23, 1983.

The Accord nameplate has been applied to a variety of vehicles worldwide, including [[coupe]]s, [[station wagon]]s, [[hatchback]]s and a [[Honda Crosstour]] crossover.\n\nSince initiation, Honda has offered several different [[car body style]]s and versions of the Accord, and often vehicles marketed under the Accord nameplate concurrently in different regions differ quite substantially. It debuted in 1976, as a [[compact car|compact]] hatchback, though this style only lasted through 1989, as the lineup was expanded to include a sedan, coupe and wagon. By the [[Honda Accord (sixth generation)|sixth-generation Accord]] at the end of the 1990s, it evolved into an [[mid-size car|intermediate]] vehicle, with one basic platform but with different bodies and proportions to increase its competitiveness against its rivals in different international markets.

However, the tenth-generation Accord sedan, with similar exterior dimensions, returned to full-size car status with its combined interior space of {{convert|123|cuft|m3}}; the coupe was discontinued in 2017.\n\nIn 1982, the Accord became the first car from a Japanese manufacturer to be produced in the United States when production commenced in [[Marysville, Ohio]] at Honda's [[Marysville Auto Plant]]. The Accord has achieved considerable success, especially in the United States, where it was the best-selling Japanese car for sixteen years (1982\u201397), topping its class in sales in 1991 and 2001, with around ten million vehicles sold.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0710_2008_honda_accord_vs_2007_toyota_camry/index.html |title=2008 Honda Accord vs. 2007 Toyota Camry \u2013 Head to Head |magazine=[[Motor Trend]] |accessdate=12 December 2010}}</ref> Numerous road tests, past and present, rate the Accord as one of the world's most reliable vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/go/5657/ |title=The 100 most reliable cars of the last decade (in order) |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=21 May 2006 |accessdate=28 April 2009}}</ref> The Accord has been on the [[Car and Driver 10Best|''Car and Driver'' 10Best]] list a record 30 times.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Siler |first1=Steve |title=2016 Honda Accord Sedan |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/honda/accord |website=[[Car and Driver]] |accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the Accord was the first vehicle sold under an import brand to become the best-selling automobile in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Honda Accord Beats Ford Taurus as Top Selling Car of 1989 IN U.S. |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/83806/HONDA-ACCORD-BEATS-FORD-TAURUS-AS-TOP-SELLING-CAR-OF-1989-IN-US.html?pg=all |date=26 January 1990 |work=[[Deseret News]] |accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nHonda, after establishing itself as a leading manufacturer of motorcycles during the 1950s, began production of automobiles in 1963.<ref name=\"S360/T360\">{{cite web |title=Launching the S360 and T360 / 1962 |url=https://global.honda/heritage/episodes/1962autoproduction.html |website=global.honda |publisher=Honda Global |accessdate=14 October 2019}}</ref>  Honda introduced its [[Honda N360|N360]] minicar, compliant with [[Kei car]] specifications for the Japanese market, for the 1967 model year.

Honda's original concept for a larger, quieter, more powerful and comfortable car was a four-door sedan powered by a 2000cc inline six engine, designated Project 653.<ref name= \"development\">{{cite web |title=Introducing the Accord(1976) |url=http://www.sydfynmc.dk/indexdele/mcdatamenu/hondaaargange/historie/1970erne/1976.html |accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref>  Information on that project has been interpreted as designating a V-6 powered competitor to the [[Ford Mustang]],<ref name=CurbsideClassic>{{cite web |last=Niedermeyer |first=Paul |title=Curbside Classic: 1976 Honda Accord \u2013 Modern Architecture |url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-asian/curbside-classic-1976-honda-accord-modern-architecture/ |work=Curbside Classics |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> however that appears to be a confused interpretation of the Project 653 design concept.  For reasons including managing development costs, leveraging the technology of their Civic, and ability to adapt production facilities to the new model, Honda changed their focus to build upon the Civic's successful formula in a larger package, designated Project 671.<ref name=\"development\" />  The body design of the new model was finalized in the fall of 1973, as reported in the December 1975 issue of [[Motor Trend]] magazine,<ref name=\"Motor Trend\">{{cite web |last=Markus |first=Frank |title=Feature Flashback: 1976 Honda Accord |url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/1976-honda-accord-feature-flashback/ |work=[[Motor Trend]] |accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref> which suggests that work under Project 671 had been advancing in the months prior. However, one account of the timeline reports that the mechanical engineering under Project 671 got underway in 1974.<ref name=\"development\" />  Until production of the new model, intensive engineering efforts were carried out to make the CVCC engine quieter and more suited to higher cruising speeds, to refine the suspension for better ride and handling, to develop a power steering system suitable for a lightweight compact car, and to improve noise damping in the body and frame.  Extensive pre-production testing was performed under a wide variety of conditions, to assure the Accord's suitability for the varied uses an export model would be subjected to.<ref name=\"development\" />\n\nFor the new model, Honda chose the name \"Accord\", reflecting \"Honda's desire for accord and harmony between people, society and the automobile.\"<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Honda |date=4 September 1997 |title=Accord\u2014Accord, Torneo, Accord Wagon |url=https://global.honda/newsroom/worldnews/1997/4970904a.html |accessdate=12 December 2010}}</ref> German manufacturer [[Opel]] unsuccessfully sued Honda, claiming that the name was too similar to their [[Opel Rekord|Rekord]].<ref name=DaiRede>{{citation | ref = DaiKi | title = Daihatsu Automobile: Erfahrung f\u00fcr die Zukunft | last = Kie\u00dfler | first = Bernd-Wilfried | language = de | page = 92 | isbn = 9783517012254 | publisher = S\u00fcdwest | date = 1992 }}</ref>\n\nThe Accord's final form, with an extended nose and extended coupe cabin with a sloping hatchback rear, was a logical derivation of the stubby hatchback design of the Civic and it provided ample leeway for use of Civic-derived components.  It showed similarity to the [[Volkswagen Scirocco]], which had been introduced in January 1974, leading to speculation that the form of the Accord was copied from the Scirocco.

Japanese market cars claimed {{convert|80|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} JIS (similar to SAE Gross), while European and other export markets received a model without emissions control equipment; it claimed 80&nbsp;PS as well but according to the stricter DIN norm. It was a platform expansion of the earlier [[Honda Civic]] at {{convert|4125|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} long. To comply with gradually tightening [[Emission standard#Japan|emission regulations enacted in Japan]], the engine was fitted with Honda's [[CVCC]] technology. The Accord sold well due to its moderate size and great fuel economy. It was one of the first Japanese sedans with features like cloth seats, a tachometer, intermittent wipers, and an AM/FM radio as standard equipment. In 1978 an LX version of the hatchback was added which came with air conditioning, a digital clock, and power steering. Until the Accord, and the closely related [[Honda Prelude#First generation (1979\u20131982)|Prelude]], power steering had not been available to cars under two liters.<ref>{{cite journal |last=von Fersen |first=Olaf |title=Automobiltechnik an der Zeitenwende/La technique de l'automobile \u00e0 un tournant | trans-title = Automobile technology at a turning point |journal=Automobil Revue '80 |publisher=Hallwag, AG |language=German, French |location=Berne, Switzerland |volume=75 |page=105 |date=6 March 1980}}</ref> Japanese buyers were liable for slightly more annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] over the smaller Civic, which had a smaller engine.\n\nOn 14 October 1977 (a year later in the U.S. market), a four-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] was added to the lineup, and power went to {{convert|72|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} when the {{convert|1599|cc|CID|abbr=on|lk=out}}<ref name=Autocar1967>{{cite journal |title=News |issue=147 |journal=Autocar |volume=4228 |pages=16\u201317 |date=19 November 1977}}</ref> EF1 engine was supplemented and in certain markets replaced by the {{convert|1751|cc|CID|abbr=on|lk=out}} an EK-1 unit.

In 1980 the optional two-speed semi-automatic transmission of previous years became a three-speed fully automatic gearbox (a four-speed automatic transaxle was not used in the Accord until the 1983 model year). The North American versions had slightly redesigned bumper trim. Other changes included new grilles and taillamps and remote mirrors added on the four-door (chrome) and the LX (black plastic) models. The CVCC badges were deleted, but the CVCC induction system remained.\n\nIn North America, the 1981 model year only brought detail changes such as new fabrics and some new color combinations.<ref name=RT82>{{cite journal |ref=81bg |journal=Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1981 |issue=January\u2013February 1981 |title=1981 Buyer's Guide | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg |page=99}}</ref> Nivorno Beige (code No. Y-39) was replaced by Oslo Ivory (No. YR-43).

Base model hatchbacks, along with the four-door, LX, and SE four-door, all received the same smaller black plastic remote mirror. The instrument cluster was revised with mostly pictograms which replaced worded warning lights and gauge markings.

This allowed Honda to sell the product at different sales channels called ''[[Honda Clio]]'', which sold the Accord, and ''[[Honda Verno]]'', that sold the Vigor.\n\nModernizing the interior and exterior, the second-generation Accord was mechanically very similar to the original, using the same {{convert|1751|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} EK-1 CVCC engine in the Japanese market.

The LX hatchback offered a digital clock and slightly higher fuel economy (due to its lighter weight). In Europe, the Accord was available as a fairly well equipped (for the time) standard version, as well as a very luxurious EX model at a modest upcharge.<ref name=TV178229/>\n\nIn the United States, Federal lighting regulations required [[headlamp]]s of [[sealed beam]] construction and standard size and shape on all vehicles, so Accords in North America were equipped with four rectangular headlamp units rather than the aerodynamic composite replaceable-bulb units used on Accords sold outside North America (note European specification imagery). Other [[Automotive lighting]] variations included amber front and red rear side marker lights and reflectors in North America, and headlamp washers and a red rear fog lamp for European markets. Japanese-market Accords were unique from all other markets in that they offered adjustable ride height control and side view mirrors installed on the mid-forward fenders.<ref name=Catvol30>{{citation | ref = JAMA30 | title = \u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af | trans-title = Japanese Motor Vehicles Guide Book 1983-84 | language = Japanese | volume = 30 | date = 1983-10-28 | publisher = [[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]] | location = Japan | pages = 216\u2013217 | id = 0053-830030-3400 }}</ref>\n\nIn November 1982, Honda made a fully four-speed automatic available with the 1.8-liter engine, a major improvement over the earlier, three-speed semi-automatic \"[[Hondamatic]]\" transmission. This quickly filtered through to export markets, where the outdated Hondamatic was soon superseded entirely. The manual five-speed transmission remained unchanged. A new 120&nbsp;mph speedometer replaced the earlier 88&nbsp;mph unit. The Special Edition (SE) featured Novillo leather seating, power windows, power sunroof and door locks. Gray was added as a color option. A slightly modified EK-2 engine was introduced, replacing the earlier EK-1, albeit still carbureted.\n\n=== 1983 refresh ===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1985 Honda Accord EX sedan (2015-07-09) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1985 Honda Accord EX sedan (2015-07-09) 02.jpg\n| caption2 = European Specification Sedan (facelift)\n| image3 = 1984-1985 Honda Accord hatchback 02.jpg\n| caption3 =  Hatchback (facelift)\n| image4 = Honda Accord EX 09-08-2019 1.jpg\n| image5 = Honda Accord EX 09-08-2019 2.jpg\n| caption5 = North American Specification Sedan (facelift)\n}}\n\nBy 1983, Accords sold in the eastern United States were produced at the new [[Marysville, Ohio|Marysville]] plant, with quality considered equal to those produced in Japan. In June 1983, for the 1984 model year, the Accord body was restyled with a slightly downward beveled nose and a new series of 12-valve CVCC powerplants.<ref>''[[#JAMA30|Automobile Guide Book 1983-84]]'', p. 159</ref> Globally there was a 1.6 (EY) and also the slightly more powerful ES2 {{convert|1829|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}}, yielding {{convert|86|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} in federal trim. Honda integrated rear side marker lights and reflectors into the side of the tail light units. European Accords now included a side turn signal repeater just behind each front wheel well. The U.S. requirement for standardized headlamps was rescinded in late 1983, but North American Accords continued to use sealed beams until the fourth-generation models were released in 1989.\n\nThe LX offered velour upholstery, auto-reverse cassette stereo, air conditioning, cruise control, power brakes, power steering, power windows and power door locks (sedan only), a digital clock, roof pillar antenna, along with thick black belt moldings, integrated bumpers and flush plastic mock-alloy style wheels covers that resembled the trend-setting [[Audi 5000]]. Supplies were tight, as in the Eastern states, the wait was months for a Graphite Gray sedan, a then-popular color. The LX hatchback was the only 1984 version of the Accord to include dual side view mirrors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe 1984 sedan was available in four exterior colors, Greek White and three metallic options: Columbus Gray, Regency Red (burgundy), and Stratos Blue (steel). The regular hatchback was available in Greek White, Dominican Red, and the metallic Stratos Blue. The 1984 LX hatchback came in three metallic colors only: Graphite Gray, Regency Red, and Copper Brown.\n\nIt was one of the first Japanese engineered vehicles to offer computer controlled, fuel-injection with one injector per cylinder, also known as multiple port fuel injection. This arrived on 24 May 1984 on the ES series 1.8 L engine, and was known as Honda's Programmed Fuel Injection, or [[PGM-FI]].<ref name=Catvol31>{{citation | ref = JAMA31 | title = \u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af | trans-title = Japanese Motor Vehicles Guide Book 1984~'85 | language = Japanese | volume = 31 | date = 1984-10-20 | publisher = [[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]] | location = Japan | page = 112 | id = 0053-840031-3400 }}</ref> This option was not offered until 1985 in the United States market.

A fuel-injected, {{convert|110|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} non-CVCC ES3 engine was exclusive to this model. The moniker, SE-i, was adapted from the SE trim, but included the \"-i\" to signify the higher trim level's fuel-injected engine. This 12-valve, {{convert|1829|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} engine was the first non-CVCC engine used in an Accord, and was the same basic engine design used by Honda until 1989. Like the previous SE trim in 1983, the SE-i featured [[Calfskin|Novillo]] leather seating, power moonroof, bronze tinted glass, a premium sound system with cassette, and 13-inch alloy wheels. The level of luxury equipment on the SE-i was essentially items that were installed on the [[Honda Vigor]] VTL-i, that was only sold in Japan.\n\nAvailable options differed from market to market. The 1.8-liter engine, updated four-speed automatic transmission, and 'EX' trim level options were first made available in New Zealand during the 1984 model year refresh alongside the 1.6-liter 'LX' model.\n\nJapan generally received more options earlier than the rest of the world. In 1981, the Accord offered an adjustable ride height air suspension in the Japanese market. From 1983 in Japan and 1984 in Europe, the second-generation Accord was available with anti-lock brakes (called ALB) as an option. This braking system was the first time that an Accord used four-wheel disc brakes. Fuel injection became available in 1984 in the Japan market with the earlier introduction of the ES3 engine in the SE-i. Models took a year to arrive in North American and European markets with less stringent emissions laws continuing, using carburetors throughout second-generation production.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|third|1985|CA|CA1/2/3/4/5/6}} Third generation (1985\u20131989) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation<br />series CA1/2/3/4/5/6\n| image = 1986-1989 Honda Accord sedan -- 03-16-2012.JPG\n| caption = Accord DX sedan\n| aka = [[Honda Vigor#Second generation (CA1-CA2-CA3)|Honda Vigor]] (Japan)\n| production = 1985\u20131989\n| model_years = 1986\u20131989\n| assembly = [[Sayama, Saitama]], Japan<br />[[Marysville, Ohio]], USA ([[Marysville Auto Plant]])<br />[[Alliston, Ontario]], Canada ([[Honda of Canada Manufacturing|HCM]])<br />[[Petone]]/[[Nelson, New Zealand]] (New Zealand Motor Corporation/Honda New Zealand)<br />[[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayuthaya]], [[Thailand]] (Honda Cars (Thailand) Co.)<br/>[[North Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] (PT.

It had a very striking exterior design styled by Toshi Oshika in 1983, that resonated well with buyers internationally. One notable feature was the [[hidden headlamps]]. Because this generation was also sold as the Honda Vigor, the Accord received the hidden headlamps. Honda's Japanese dealership channel called ''Honda Verno'' all had styling elements that helped identify products only available at ''[[Honda Verno]]''. As a result, Japanese market Accords had a ''Honda Verno'' styling feature, but were sold at newly established Japanese dealerships ''Honda Clio'' with the all-new, luxury [[Honda Legend]] sedan, and international Accords were now visually aligned with the Prelude, the CR-X, and the new Integra.\n\nThe retractable headlamps of the third generation Accord sedan were in Japan, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, KY region (Arabian countries) and on cars in Taiwan that were imported from the United States. In other countries, the Accord sedan had conventional headlamps, including in Japan from July 1987, on \"'''Accord CA'''\", with CA standing for \"Continental Accord\". Accords in all other bodies (hatchback, AeroDeck, coupe) had only retractable headlamps worldwide.\n\nAt its introduction in 1985, it won the [[Car of the Year Japan]] Award.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe third-generation Accord became the first Honda to employ [[double wishbone]]s at both the front and rear ends. While more expensive than competitors' [[MacPherson strut]] systems, this setup provided better stability and sharper handling for the vehicle. All had front sway bars and upper models had rear sway bars as well. Brakes were either small all-wheel discs with twin-piston calipers (only available on the Japanese-market 2.0-Si model), larger all-wheel discs with single piston calipers, or a front disc/rear drum system. ABS was available as an option on the 4-wheel disc brake models, though not in North America. Base model Accords rode on 13-inch steel wheels with hubcaps with more expensive models having the option of 14-inch alloy wheels.\n\nThe Accord's available engines varied depending on its market: Japan received the [[Honda A engine#A18A|A18A]], [[Honda A engine#A20|A20A]], [[Honda B20A engine|B18A]], [[Honda B20A engine|B20A]] and A20A3 (US imported cars); Europe received the [[Honda A engine#A16A1|A16A1]], A20A1, [[Honda A engine#A20|A20A2]], A20A3, [[Honda A engine#A20|A20A4]], [[Honda B20A engine#B20A2|B20A2]], and [[Honda B20A engine#B20A8|B20A8]]; Australia and New Zealand received A20A2 and A20A4; other regions received A20A2 and/or A16A1; while United States, Canada and Taiwan (US imported cars) received the [[Honda A engine#A20|A20A1]] and [[Honda A engine#A20|A20A3]]. On Accord 1986 model year engine block was marked as BS and BT in the United States, BS1 and BT1 in Canada, this cars had chassis code BA. Since 1987 the engine block in Indonesia was marked as NA instead of A20A2. The engine block in Thailand was marked as A.\n\nIn Japan, the introduction of a 2.0 liter engine obligated Japanese drivers to pay a higher amount of annual [[road tax]] compared to the last two previous generations, pushing the Accord into the luxury category in Japan.\n\nThe Accord's trim levels ranged from spartan to luxurious. In the Japanese home market, the Accord was available with a full power package, heated mirrors (optional), a digital instrument cluster (optional), sunroof (optional), cruise control, and climate control (which was also optional). Some North European export models also had heated front seats and head light washers. North American and Australian Accords were not available with most of these options, presumably (and in the U.S. in particular) because Honda was seen as a builder of economy cars, and not to cannibalize sales from the recently introduced{{when?|date=October 2019}} [[Acura]] line.\n\nThroughout the different markets, in addition to the sedan model the Accord was available with different bodystyles which included a three-door hatchback, a three-door [[shooting-brake]] called [[:ja:\u30db\u30f3\u30c0\u30fb\u30a2\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30a8\u30a2\u30ed\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad|Accord AeroDeck]], and a two-door coupe which was added in 1987 for the 1988 model year. The coupe, which was built exclusively in Honda's Marysville, Ohio factory, was \"reverse exported\" back to Japan where it was known as the US-coupe CA6.\n\n=== Accord AeroDeck ===\n[[File:1988 Honda Accord Aerodeck 2.0 EX (15243647990).jpg|thumb|left|Accord AeroDeck]]\n\nThe third-generation Accord was sold in Japan, Europe and New Zealand as a three-door hatchback with a flat roof over the rear seats, known in Europe as a [[shooting-brake]]. The bodystyle of a flat roof hatchback was also used on the third-generation [[Honda Civic (third generation)]] subcompact, the second-generation [[Honda City]] [[supermini]] and the first-generation [[Honda Today]] ''[[kei car]]''. The [[Honda CR-X]] was the only three-door hatchback that adopted a fastback, sloping rear hatch \"[[kammback]]\" appearance, demonstrating a performance car appearance identified with ''Honda Verno'' products during the mid-1980s.\n\nIn North America, the Accord coupe and hatchback models were offered instead. The \"AeroDeck\" name was reused on the [[Honda Orthia|Honda Civic 5-door station wagon]], sold in the UK from 1996 to 2000. In parts of Continental Europe, the Accord five-door station wagon was also called the Accord AeroDeck from 1990 until 2008, when the name of the station wagon was renamed the \"Accord Tourer\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnOvCnpfvw4 Japanese television commercial for the AeroDeck.]</ref> The AeroDeck was only available in Japan at [[Honda Clio]] dealerships as a variation of the Accord.\n\nThe cargo handling abilities of the AeroDeck were ceded to the fourth-generation Accord station wagon in 1990. The AeroDeck was unique to the Accord model line, as the AeroDeck was not available as a [[Honda Vigor]], as the Accord and Vigor were mechanically identical. The AeroDeck returned an aerodynamic value of .34, and the {{convert|2600|mm|in|1|abbr=on|}} wheelbase returned a spacious interior for both front and rear passengers, on par with a mid-size sedan. Unfortunately, the appearance was not well received in Japan, as the introduction of the Accord Coupe was more well-liked. The appearance was more popular in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe AeroDeck was equipped with a four-wheel double wishbone suspension, which gave both a comfortable ride and cornering performance. In addition, speed-sensitive power steering is included, which gives the car easy turning assistance at speeds below {{convert|40|km/h}} during operation, such as parallel parking. Note that the top model in Japan \"2.0Si\" is to 4w-ALB (4-wheel ABS) are standard equipment (with option to upgrade in other trim packages).\n\nVisibility from the driver's seat and passenger seat was better due to the lower instrument panel design of the front window and a large windshield. And switches are arranged efficiently and at the time was the driving position can be fine-tuned adjustments.\n\nBecause of the shape of the vehicle and the flat roof that continued to the rear of the vehicle, opening the rear hatch had some drawbacks in low clearance environments. The lower part of the hatch was not like one used on a station wagon that went all the way down to the rear bumper, so loading cargo into the back wasn't as convenient as a conventional station wagon with a one piece hatchback. The rear hatch also wrapped into the rear roof, similar to a [[gull wing door]] so that the rear glass was in two pieces, one for the back window, and another partially on the rear roof. When open, the hatch rose above the roof at a right angle, providing additional overhead clearance when the hatch was open.\n\nMoreover, because of the emphasis on aiding rear-seat passenger entry, a longer front door was installed, and because power windows were not installed on the lower trim packages \"LX\", \"LX-S\" and as such, the window regulator opening felt heavy.\n\n{{gallery | width = 195 |title=| height = 133\n|File:1987-1988 Honda Accord Si hatchback 02.jpg|Accord Si hatchback\n|File:'89 Honda Accord Coupe.jpg|Accord coupe\n|File:Honda Accord rear 20080121.jpg|Accord EX sedan\n|File:89 SE-i - Dash.jpg|Interior\n}}\n\n=== Chassis code configurations ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | CODE !!

Although much larger than its predecessor the sedan's styling was evolutionary, featuring the same low slung design and wraparound rear window as the third-generation Accord. For the first time a 3-door hatchback was no longer available internationally.\n\nThis was one of the first U.S. production cars to feature optic reflectors with completely clear lenses on the headlamps.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} The styling reflected influences from the flagship [[Honda Legend]] (sold in North America as an [[Acura Legend|Acura]]), as Japanese Accords were now sold at ''Honda Clio'' dealerships, where the Legend, and the [[Honda Inspire#First generation series CB5, CC2 & CC3 (1989\u20131995)|Honda Inspire]], were sold. The growing popularity of the Accord internationally was evident in the ever-increasing dimensions, which now matched almost exactly with the first-generation Legend introduced in 1985.\n\nFor this fourth-generation Accord, Honda made significant engineering design improvements. All Accords sold in North America came with a completely new all aluminum 2.2-liter 16-valve electronic fuel-injected engine standard, replacing the previous 2.0-liter 12-valve model from the past generation. Also noteworthy, all Accords equipped with automatic transmissions used an electronically controlled rear engine mount to reduce low frequency noise and vibration. The mount contained two fluid filled chambers separated by a computer controlled valve. At low engine speeds, fluid is routed through the valve damping vibration. Above 850 rpm, fluid is routed around the valve making the engine mount stiffer.\n\nIn the U.S., the LX-i and SE-i designations were dropped, being replaced with the DX, LX and EX trim levels. The Canadian Accord trim levels varied slightly from the U.S. models with LX, EX and EX-R roughly corresponding to the American DX, LX and EX, respectively. Fourth-generation Japanese-assembled EXi Accords sold in Australia offered the same [[Four wheel steering#Four-wheel steering|4-wheel steering]] technology as was available optionally on the U.S. Honda Prelude, but was not included on the New Zealand-assembled versions. The four-wheel steering system was also available on the Accord's Japanese platform mate, called the [[Honda Ascot]] FTBi. U.S. Accord Coupes were available in the same DX, LX and EX trims as the U.S. Accord Sedan (LX, EX and EX-R in Canada).\n\nA 125-horsepower (93&nbsp;kW) 4-cylinder engine was offered in the DX and LX models (F22A1), while the 1990 and 1991 model year EX received a 130&nbsp;hp (97&nbsp;kW) version (F22A4). Cruise control was dropped from the DX sedan, with air conditioning remaining a dealer-installed option. The LX kept the same features as the previous generation including air conditioning, power windows, door locks, and mirrors. The 90\u201391 EX added 5 horsepower due to a different exhaust manifold design, slightly larger exhaust piping and a twin outlet muffler. 15-inch machined aluminum-alloy wheels, sunroof, upgraded upholstery, rear stabilizer bar and a high-power 4-speaker stereo cassette were standard on all EX models. Some models though rare were special ordered with an [[anti-lock braking system]] (at that time abbreviated as ALB, now all automakers refer to it as ABS). A redesigned manual transmission with a hydraulic clutch was standard equipment in all trims while an all-new electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission was optional for all models.\n\nSome new dealer-installed accessories were now offered including a single-disc in-dash CD player or trunk mounted 6-disc CD changer, stereo equalizer, fog lights, security system, rear wing spoiler, trunk lip spoiler, luggage rack, full and half nose mask, center armrest, window visors, sunroof visor, car cover, and a cockpit cover.\n\nBecause of tightening auto safety regulations from the NHTSA, all 1990 and 1991 model year Accords sold in the United States came equipped with motorized shoulder belts for front passengers to comply with passive restraint mandates. These semi-automatic restraints were a two component system; a motorized shoulder belt along with a non-integrated and manually operated seatbelt. The shoulder belts automatically raced around each window frame encircling both the driver and front seat passenger whenever the front door closed. The process reversed to release them when opened. The lap belts however, still required manual fastening.\n\n[[File:CB9 HAM Plate.jpg|thumb|left|Honda of America badge (installed on the \"C\" pillar)]]\n\nIn early 1990 for the 1991 model year, Honda unveiled the Accord wagon, manufactured at the Marysville, Ohio plant. The Ohio plant exported right-hand drive wagons and coupes to Europe and Japan, and in Europe the station wagon (station wagon) was called the \"Aerodeck\" (in reference to the 1985\u20131989 2-door vehicle). All station wagons sold outside the United States were affixed with a small badge on the [[pillar (car)|\"C\" pillar]] denoting the vehicle was built at the Ohio facility. European and Japanese vehicles had options not available within the U.S. including automatic climate control systems, power seats and several other minor features. The Accord Wagons were available from November 1990, only in LX and EX trim in North America or just 2.2i in Japan. They had larger front brakes to compensate for the added weight and unlike other U.S. Accords, included a driver's side airbag as standard equipment. Other than a retractable tonneau cover in the rear cargo area and keyless entry on EX models, the wagons were equipped the same as their coupe and sedan counterparts.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1990/09/10/73991/ |publisher=[[CNN Money]] |first=Alex |last=Taylor III |title=Japan's new U.S. car strategy |date=10 September 1990 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416192821/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1990/09/10/73991/ |archivedate=16 April 2014 |accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Return of the SE (1991) ===\nHonda reintroduced the SE (previously SE-i) sedan for 1991. It returned to the lineup without the traditional Bose high powered audio system but with an AM/FM stereo cassette 4x20 watt EX audio system; leather-trimmed steering wheel, leather seats and door panels, a fuel-injected {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, and 4-Wheel disc brakes w/ ABS as standard equipment. For the first time, a manual transmission was not offered in the SE. Two colors were available: Solaris Silver Metallic with Graphite Black interior and Brittany Blue Metallic with Ivory interior. Unlike previous editions, the 1991 SE was not equipped with uniquely styled alloy wheels but instead carried the EX model wheels.\n\n=== Update (1992\u20131993) ===\nAccords received a minor facelift in 1991 for the 1992 model year. The SE trim was dropped again but left behind its {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} F22A6 engine for use in the EX models. This engine added 15&nbsp;hp over the DX and LX trims and 10&nbsp;hp over the 90\u201391 EX trim due to a further revised exhaust system. The system used the same EX-SE twin outlet muffler, a revised air intake tract, a revised camshaft and a revised intake manifold using IAB butterfly valves which open at 4600 rpm to increase air intake breathing at high rpm. It was similar in design to the 92\u201396 Prelude Si and VTEC models. For the 1992 and 1993 model years, the motorized shoulder belt system were replaced with a standard driver-side [[airbag]] and conventional shoulder/seatbelt arrangement for all but the center rear passenger. Anti-lock 4-wheel disc brakes became standard on the EX. The front and rear [[Fascia (car)|facias]] received a more rounded and updated look. Coupe and sedan models received a new grille, new headlamps, amber parking lights, slightly thinner [[body side molding]], updated wheel designs and for the first time, the EX coupe used wheels different from the EX sedan. The sedans received restyled shortened taillamps with inverted amber turn signal and backup light positions. The wagon taillamps though still resembled those from the 1990\u20131991 Accord. The coupe used the new revised inverted positioning of the signal and backup lights but the wagon taillamps however remained the same as the 90\u201391 models. EX trim levels included a radio anti-theft function to deter stereo theft. A front driver's seat armrest was now standard on LX and EX models. Some dealer-installed accessories were dropped including the luggage rack, trunk-lip spoiler and cockpit cover. A gold finish kit was added.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:1993 Honda Accord SE coupe 02.jpg|Coupe (1991 facelift)\nFile:1994 Honda Accord Coupe 2.0.jpg|Coupe (1991 facelift)\nFile:1993 Honda Accord 2.2 Rear.jpg|Sedan (1991 facelift)\nFile:1992-1993 Honda Accord wagon -- 03-16-2012.JPG|Wagon (1991 facelift)\n</gallery>\n\n=== 10th Anniversary Edition and return of the SE (1993) ===\nIn 1992, Honda introduced the 10th Anniversary Edition sedan to commemorate the 10th year of U.S. Accord production. The 10th Anniversary Edition was based on the Accord LX sedan but came equipped with several features not available in the LX trim. The upgrades included ABS, 4-wheel disc brakes, 15\" EX coupe six spoke alloy wheels, body colored side moldings, chin spoiler, and standard automatic transmission. Three colors were offered for the 10th Anniversary Edition: Frost White, Granada Black Pearl, and Arcadia Green Pearl. The 10th Anniversary models also included the same premium seat fabric found in EX models. The Frost White and Arcadia Green cars were paired with the same interior color as their LX/EX counterparts, Blue and Ivory, respectively. The Granada Black cars were paired with Gray interior, while the Granada Black EX had Ivory interior.\n\nThe SE returned in late 1992 as both a sedan, and for the first time since the 1989 SE-i, as a coupe. The SE sedan featured standard dual front airbags; the first Accord to do so. An 8-button, 4-speaker Honda-Bose audio system, automatic transmission, leather trim, body colored bumper and body side moldings were standard. The SE coupe included a factory rear wing spoiler which differed slightly in design from the already available dealer installed accessory rear wing spoiler. In Canada, the SE came with heated front seats and heated side view mirrors. Both the sedan and coupe received distinctive 15-inch alloy wheels as well. All SE sedans during 1990\u20131991 (1991 MY) and 1992\u20131993 (1993 MY) were manufactured in Japan, while all SE coupes were produced in the U.S. The 1993 MY sedan was available in two colors: Cashmere Silver Metallic and Geneva Green Pearl, both with Ivory interior. The coupe was offered with two colors as well: Cashmere Silver Metallic and Atlantis Blue Pearl, both again with Ivory interior. Sadly, 1993 would be the swan song for the SE as an exclusive, high content, limited edition Accord model. Later generations would use a \"Special Edition\" designation rather than the previously used \"SE\" designation. These models were a combination of an Accord LX with several EX features similar to the 1993 10th Anniversary Edition LX.\n\nAt the end of the model life of the CB Accord, a \"pillared [[hardtop]]\" model called the [[Honda Ascot Innova]] was launched in Japan, based on the CB Accord chassis, but with a different, much more modern-styled body, taking cues from the 1992 [[Honda Prelude]].\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Honda Ascot ===\n{{main|Honda Ascot}}\n[[File:CB Honda Ascot.jpg|thumb|left|Japan-spec series CB Honda Ascot]]\n\nThe fourth-generation Accord spawned a sister model in 1989, called the Honda Ascot which, while mechanically identical to the Accord, featured unique sedan bodywork, although it bore a resemblance to the Accord. The Ascot was sold through the ''[[Honda Primo]]'' network in Japan while the Accord was distributed through the ''[[Honda Clio]]'' network.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Honda Vigor and Honda Inspire ===\n{{main|Honda Vigor|Honda Inspire}}\n[[File:Honda Accord Inspire 001.JPG|thumb|left|1989 Inspire]]\n[[File:1st gereneration Honda Inspire rear.jpg|thumb|right|1989 Inspire]]\nUnlike previous generations of the Honda Vigor, which were simply upmarket versions of the Accord, the third generation 'CB5' model was spun off as a model in its own right and was based on a different platform which featured a longitudinal engine layout compared to the transverse set-up of the Accord. A sister model to the Vigor, the Honda Inspire, was also unveiled in 1989 and, bar a different front grille, front and rear lights and bumpers, sported identical bodywork. The Vigor was available in the United States and Canada under the [[Acura]] brand.\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|fifth|1993|CD|CD3/4/5/6/7/9}} Fifth generation (1993\u20131997) ==\n\nFor the first time in the model's history, Honda developed two distinct versions of the Accord when the fifth-generation model was launched in fall of 1993; one version for the European market and one for the North American and Japanese market.

Larger than its predecessor, primarily to better suit the requirements of the North American market, the new model grew in width but shrunk in length, leaving it classified as a [[mid-size car]] in North America. It thus became too wide to fit within the [[Vehicle size class#Japan|favorable tax bracket]] in Japan, where its role was to be partially taken over by the slightly narrower second-generation [[Honda Ascot]] (sold at ''Honda Primo'' Japanese dealerships) and [[Honda Rafaga]] (sold at ''Honda Verno''). Previous generations of the Accord sold in Japan were limited to a width dimension of {{convert|1695|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} while international models were slightly wider, however this generation no longer complied. The engines offered with the Accord also exceeded the maximum limit of 2000cc to remain in the favorable \"compact\" tax bracket. The installation of a 2.0 liter engine in Japanese models made buyers liable for more annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] over the smaller 1.8-liter engine, which affected sales.\n\nDevelopment began in September 1989, along with the design process in June 1990. The final design was selected by an early date of 18 December 1990 and frozen by mid-1991. Design inconsistencies in early 1992, caused several alterations to be made until April 1992, when a secondary design freeze took place, ahead of scheduled 1993 production. Design patents were later filed in the United States on 16 December 1992 for the \"CD\". Production later began at Marysville assembly on 24 August 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1993-09-12/a-car-is-born |title=A Car Is Born |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=12 September 1993 |accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD347806 |title=Patent USD347806 \u2013 Automobile \u2013 Google Patents |publisher=Google |accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nHonda of Japan marketed four different size engines in the Japanese-spec Accord sedan: 1.8, 2.0, 2.2 VTEC and 2.2 DOHC VTEC. The Japanese-spec Accord models were marketed as the following: EF, EX, 2.0EX, 2.0EXL, 2.2VTE, 2.2VTL, 2.2VTS and SiR. All Accord versions were sold at ''Honda Clio'' locations in Japan.\n\nThe fifth-generation Accord became the first Accord to be built and sold in the Philippines.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Andres|first1=Anton|title=40 years of Honda Accord |date=July 14, 2016|url=http://www.autoindustriya.com/features/40-years-of-honda-accord.html|website=Autoindustriya.com|accessdate=29 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1996-1997 Honda Accord coupe -- 03-21-2012.JPG\n| caption1 = Coupe (facelift)\n| image2 = 1995-1997 Honda Accord EXi sedan 01.jpg\n| caption2 = Sedan (facelift)\n}}\n\nThe DX, LX and EX models remained the American trim lines while Canada retained the LX, EX and EX-R. The 5-speed manual transmission remained mostly unchanged, while the 4-speed automatic noted for its hard shifts, now included Honda's \"Grade-Logic\" shift program, which would prevent \"gear-hunting\" by holding the current gear while driving on a sloped incline. All Accord models received a more ergonomic interior with standard safety features such as dual airbags and reinforced side-impact beams. Exclusive to the EX was the F22B1 SOHC VTEC version of previous generation 2.2-liter 4-cylinder (making {{convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} up from {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} on the previous generation EX), anti-lock brakes (now an option for the LX), 4-wheel disc brakes, 15-inch alloy wheels, and a rear stabilizer bar. Leather was an option in the EX trim with leather equipped models now being referred to as EX-L. DX and LX models came equipped similarly to the previous generation and were fitted with a revised version of the previous generation's 2.2-liter non-VTEC 4-cylinder engine. This F22B2 engine was rated at {{convert|130|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} up from {{convert|125|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} the previous generation. The Accord was again named [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|''Motor Trend'' Import Car of the Year]] for 1994. The Accord coupe as in the previous generation looked almost exactly like the sedan, and was the last generation of the Accord to offer a wagon variant in North America until the introduction of the Accord Crosstour in 2009.\n\n[[File:Honda Accord wagon -- 04-10-2011.jpg|thumb|left|Accord Wagon LX (rear)]]\n\nIn 1994, the 1995 Accord debuted a [[V6 engine]], the 2.7&nbsp;L ''[[Honda C engine#C27|C27]]'' borrowed from the first-generation [[Acura Legend]], in the U.S. market. The V6 was offered in both the LX and EX versions of the sedan, LX models being referred to as LX-V6 and EX models as EX-V6. EX-V6 models came equipped similarly to the EX-L with leather seats being the only option in the EX-V6. Addition of the taller C27 engine required substantial alterations to the CD platform, with V6 models sporting a redesigned engine layout, taller front fenders, and a different hood than I4 models; however, these differences are difficult to spot without both models parked side-by-side. Both versions of the V6 received a dual-outlet exhaust, a 4-speed automatic transmission, 15-inch machined aluminum alloy wheels on the EX-V6 and 15-inch steel wheels with full covers on the LX-V6, and a slightly updated front grille (which would be later used in all 96\u201397 Accords). The Accord saw very few other changes for 1995 with the exception of a few different exterior and interior color combinations.\n\nIn 1995, the Accord underwent the usual mid-generation facelift for 1996. More rounded bumpers, a slightly modified front fascia (which was originally exclusive in the V6 models in 1995) with new signal lights and rear taillamps gave the Accord a softer look. All Hondas now complied with the federal government's requirement of OBD II engine diagnostics though all three engine choices remained the same. In order to increase the Accord's competitiveness against its rivals in different international markets, Honda CEO [[Nobuhiko Kawamoto]] decided on one basic platform for the sixth-generation Accord, but with different bodies and proportions for local markets. In the U.S., the 1996 model lineup included the 25th Anniversary Edition, a model positioned between the DX and LX. The Special Edition trim package was introduced.\n\nFor the 1997 model year, Honda released the \"Special Edition\" version of the Accord (not to be confused with the SE). It was offered in three colors: Heather Mist Metallic, San Marino Red and Dark Currant Pearl. The Special Edition received a factory installed security system with keyless entry, single-disc CD player, body colored side molding, distinctive alloy wheels and a sunroof. It was offered in an automatic transmission only and was fitted with the same engine as the LX. Acclaimed for its handling, the 1996 Accord has been known{{by whom|date=June 2014}} as one of the best handling Japanese midsized sedans of all time, posting impressive lateral g figures of up to .89 g's.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn New Zealand, the fifth-generation Accord was assembled at Honda's manufacturing site in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and was released in March 1994. It was available in LXi, EXi and EXi-S trim levels. A facelift was released in December 1995, which coincided with the release of VTEC engines in the upper-spec models. Trim levels were LXi, VTi, and VTi-S. These were the first NZ-market Accords to have airbags \u2013 two in the VTi-S, one in the VTi.\n\nU.S.-built coupe and wagon models of this generation were shipped to Europe with both left and right hand drive but there was no V6 option.\n\nThis generation of the Accord is one of the most frequently stolen cars in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nicb.org/theft_and_fraud_awareness/top-vehicles-stolen-by-state |title=Hot Wheels |publisher=nicb.org/ |accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref> \n\n==== Honda Accord SiR ====\n[[File:1996-1997 Accord SiR Wagon Rear (Imported Japanese Model) 2.JPG|thumb|left|1996 Accord SiR Wagon]]\nHonda of Japan produced three high-performance models of the Accord for the [[Japanese domestic market]] referred to as the '''SiR''', which was available for sale at ''[[Honda Clio]]'' dealerships in Japan. The sports car approach to the Accord SiR was aimed at aligning the Accord with the ''Honda Verno'' sports sedan that replaced the Vigor, called the [[Honda Saber]] a platform mate shared with the [[Honda Inspire]]. The compact sedan role the Accord previously filled was now relegated to the Honda Rafaga and Ascot. The Accord SiR models came equipped with the Japan-spec H22A DOHC VTEC engine instead of the F22B1 SOHC VTEC engine found in the EX. The Japan-spec H22A DOHC VTEC engine specs were {{convert|190|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 6800 rpm; peak torque {{convert|152|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm with a compression ratio of 10.6:1. The Japan-spec H22A DOHC VTEC engine was similar to the H22A1 engine found in the North America market used in the Prelude DOHC VTEC of the same era.<ref>Yamaguchi, Jack; ''[[Road & Track]]'', December 1993 Ampersand-Letter from Japan \"The Pride of Marysville and its Japanese Siblings\" p53</ref>\n\nThe Japan-built SiR sedan (94\u201397) was available with a 5-speed manual transmission as standard equipment or an optional \"Grade-Logic\" four-speed automatic transmission.<ref>{{cite web |title=Honda Accord History |url=http://world.honda.com/ACCORD/history05.html |publisher=world.honda.com |accessdate=30 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211020952/http://world.honda.com/ACCORD/history05.html |archivedate=11 December 2015 }}</ref> The Honda of America-built (HAM) Accord SiR coupe and then the 1997 SiR wagon had the \"Grade-Logic\" four-speed automatic transmission as standard equipment (5-speed manual transmission were not available for these two models). It came with cloth sport seats styled similar to the Prelude or optional leather seats, both exclusive to the SiR. The SiR also had some power options found on the Accord EX. The Accord SiR coupe (94\u201397) and the Accord SiR wagon (1997) were exclusively available for the Japanese market. SiR chassis codes for the sedan were the CD6, the coupe-CD8 and the 1997 wagon-CF2 (production began in September 1996 for the 1997 SiR wagons which lasted for almost one year). The Accord SiR Coupe and the Accord SiR wagon (1997), which were exclusively built in the United States at Honda's Marysville Ohio plant (HAM) but were marketed for Japan export only for this particular model, was not offered in North America.<ref>Yamaguchi, Jack; ''[[Road & Track]]'', July 1994 Ampersand \"Eagles are landing in Japan\" p64-67</ref>\n\nThe Accord SiR Coupe and then Accord SiR wagon were built with the Japan-spec H22A DOHC VTEC powertrains which were shipped from Japan and were installed into the HAM-built Accord SiR models. The 1994\u20131997 \"CD\" Accord chassis was designed for the H22A DOHC VTEC powertrain to be installed; because the firewall was curved at the top to allow more space for the tilting backwards of the H22A DOHC VTEC engine near the middle of the firewall. The H22A DOHC VTEC engine was the most powerful inline four-cylinder engine Honda built for the Prelude and the Accord before the 1995 U.S.-spec V6 sedan. The Accord SiR suspension was improved with stiffer front sway bar (27.2&nbsp;mm x 4.0&nbsp;mm), stiffer rear sway bar (16&nbsp;mm), stiffer front coil springs and stiffer rear coil springs.\n\nFeatures for the 94\u201395 Accord SiR models (sedans and coupes) included the following items: cruise control, automatic climate control (Similar to the first-generation Acura CL), Bose stereo system, 7,400 redline tachometer, optional electronic traction control and optional limited slip differential for automatic transmission, optional SRS and airbags, factory installed driving lights, optional factory installed \"pop up\" navigation radio head unit, sound insulation liner under front hood, black-housing headlamps, no side molding was available on the Accord SiR sedan, optional rear sunscreen, optional sunroof and power retractable outside mirrors. Features for the 96\u201397 Accord SiR models (sedans, coupes and wagons) included the same as above while adding; optional cruise control, rear window wiper on the sedan, optional leather interior and a colored side molding for the sedan as well.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== European model ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Fifth generation<br />Europe\n| image = Honda Accord 1995.jpg\n| aka = [[Honda Ascot Innova]]\n| production = 1993\u20131998\n| assembly = [[Swindon]], England ([[Honda of the UK Manufacturing|HUKM]])\n| designer = Shigeo Ueno (1989)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD347805 |title=Patent USD347805 \u2013 Automobile \u2013 Google Patents |publisher=Google |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>\n| class = [[Mid-size car]]\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| related = [[Rover 600 Series|Rover 600]]\n| engine = 1.8 L ''[[Honda F engine#F18B|F18A3]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.0 L ''[[Honda F engine#F20Z1|F20Z]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.2 L ''[[Honda F engine#F22B|F22Z2]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.3 L ''[[Honda H engine#H23A3|H23A3]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.0 L ''[[Rover L-Series engine|Rover 20T2N]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] diesel\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2720|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4675|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1715|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1380|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1240|-|1375|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n[[File:Honda Accord rear 20080205.jpg|thumb|left|1997 European-spec Accord]]\n\nThe fifth-generation Accord for the European market was unveiled in 1993 and was not related directly to the North American 'CD' Accord. It was in fact the Japanese-market [[Honda Ascot#Ascot Innova (CB3/4)|Honda Ascot Innova]] which was based on the previous fourth-generation 'CB' Accord. It was the result of a joint effort with the [[Rover Group]] that provided Rover with the 600 series. The exterior was designed by Shigeo Ueno in 1989.\n\nIn 1996, the European Accord received a minor facelift and was given a new front end (new headlamps, bumper, hood and grill) and slightly different taillamps (see images). The styling of the facelifted Accord remained identical to the styling of the Ascot Innova (although the frameless doors were replaced with conventional items) and featured the design language first introduced on the fifth-generation [[Honda Civic]]. The styling of the European Accord differed dramatically from the North American which featured a more conventional sedan styling compared to the European model's low slung, fastback inspired look which also incorporated rear quarter windows. The facelifted Accord was also equipped with two airbags as standard.\n\nHowever, the European Accord did not spawn an station wagon nor a coupe version, Honda instead opting to import the coupe and station wagon (Aerodeck) versions of the North American Accord.\n\nThe diesel model of the Accord was fitted with the direct injection Rover L-Series diesel engine, as also fitted in the Rover 600.\n\n==== Rover 600 ====\n[[File:Rover 600 01.jpg|thumb|left|Rover 600]]\nAs part of the tie-up with the [[Rover Group]] the European Accord spawned Rover's replacement for the [[Austin Montego]] in 1993. Called the [[Rover 600 Series|600]], the car shared its platform with the European Accord and, with the exception of the front doors, lower rear doors and windscreen, sported unique styling which dispensed with the rear quarter windows. The interior design of the 600 was very similar to the Accord's however, while the dashboard design was identical.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Sixth generation (1997\u20132002) ==\n{{Main|Honda Accord (sixth generation)}}\n[[File:1997-2001 Honda Accord V6 sedan (2011-04-02) 01.jpg|thumb|left|Honda Accord (Australia)]]\n[[File:1997-2001 Honda Accord V6 sedan (2011-04-02) 02.jpg|thumb|right|Honda Accord (Australia)]]\n[[File:2002 Honda Accord VTEC S 1.9 Front.jpg|thumb|left|Honda Accord (Europe)]]\n[[File:2002 Honda Accord VTEC S 1.9 Rear.jpg|thumb|right|Honda Accord (Europe)]]\n\nFor the sixth generation, Honda split the Accord into three separate models, designed for the Japanese, North American, and European markets.

The Accord nameplate has been applied to a variety of vehicles worldwide, including [[coupe]]s, [[station wagon]]s, [[hatchback]]s and a [[Honda Crosstour]] crossover.\n\nSince initiation, Honda has offered several different [[car body style]]s and versions of the Accord, and often vehicles marketed under the Accord nameplate concurrently in different regions differ quite substantially. It debuted in 1976, as a [[compact car|compact]] hatchback, though this style only lasted through 1989, as the lineup was expanded to include a sedan, coupe and wagon. By the [[Honda Accord (sixth generation)|sixth-generation Accord]] at the end of the 1990s, it evolved into an [[mid-size car|intermediate]] vehicle, with one basic platform but with different bodies and proportions to increase its competitiveness against its rivals in different international markets.

In 2012, the [[Honda Accord (ninth generation)|ninth-generation Accord]] sedan, with smaller exterior dimensions, was once again classified as a mid-size car at {{convert|119|cuft|m3}}, falling just shy of the \"Large Car\" classification. However, the tenth-generation Accord sedan, with similar exterior dimensions, returned to full-size car status with its combined interior space of {{convert|123|cuft|m3}}; the coupe was discontinued in 2017.\n\nIn 1982, the Accord became the first car from a Japanese manufacturer to be produced in the United States when production commenced in [[Marysville, Ohio]] at Honda's [[Marysville Auto Plant]]. The Accord has achieved considerable success, especially in the United States, where it was the best-selling Japanese car for sixteen years (1982\u201397), topping its class in sales in 1991 and 2001, with around ten million vehicles sold.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0710_2008_honda_accord_vs_2007_toyota_camry/index.html |title=2008 Honda Accord vs. 2007 Toyota Camry \u2013 Head to Head |magazine=[[Motor Trend]] |accessdate=12 December 2010}}</ref> Numerous road tests, past and present, rate the Accord as one of the world's most reliable vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/go/5657/ |title=The 100 most reliable cars of the last decade (in order) |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=21 May 2006 |accessdate=28 April 2009}}</ref> The Accord has been on the [[Car and Driver 10Best|''Car and Driver'' 10Best]] list a record 30 times.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Siler |first1=Steve |title=2016 Honda Accord Sedan |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/honda/accord |website=[[Car and Driver]] |accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the Accord was the first vehicle sold under an import brand to become the best-selling automobile in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Honda Accord Beats Ford Taurus as Top Selling Car of 1989 IN U.S. |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/83806/HONDA-ACCORD-BEATS-FORD-TAURUS-AS-TOP-SELLING-CAR-OF-1989-IN-US.html?pg=all |date=26 January 1990 |work=[[Deseret News]] |accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nHonda, after establishing itself as a leading manufacturer of motorcycles during the 1950s, began production of automobiles in 1963.<ref name=\"S360/T360\">{{cite web |title=Launching the S360 and T360 / 1962 |url=https://global.honda/heritage/episodes/1962autoproduction.html |website=global.honda |publisher=Honda Global |accessdate=14 October 2019}}</ref>  Honda introduced its [[Honda N360|N360]] minicar, compliant with [[Kei car]] specifications for the Japanese market, for the 1967 model year.

Honda's original concept for a larger, quieter, more powerful and comfortable car was a four-door sedan powered by a 2000cc inline six engine, designated Project 653.<ref name= \"development\">{{cite web |title=Introducing the Accord(1976) |url=http://www.sydfynmc.dk/indexdele/mcdatamenu/hondaaargange/historie/1970erne/1976.html |accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref>  Information on that project has been interpreted as designating a V-6 powered competitor to the [[Ford Mustang]],<ref name=CurbsideClassic>{{cite web |last=Niedermeyer |first=Paul |title=Curbside Classic: 1976 Honda Accord \u2013 Modern Architecture |url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-asian/curbside-classic-1976-honda-accord-modern-architecture/ |work=Curbside Classics |accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> however that appears to be a confused interpretation of the Project 653 design concept.  For reasons including managing development costs, leveraging the technology of their Civic, and ability to adapt production facilities to the new model, Honda changed their focus to build upon the Civic's successful formula in a larger package, designated Project 671.<ref name=\"development\" />  The body design of the new model was finalized in the fall of 1973, as reported in the December 1975 issue of [[Motor Trend]] magazine,<ref name=\"Motor Trend\">{{cite web |last=Markus |first=Frank |title=Feature Flashback: 1976 Honda Accord |url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/1976-honda-accord-feature-flashback/ |work=[[Motor Trend]] |accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref> which suggests that work under Project 671 had been advancing in the months prior. However, one account of the timeline reports that the mechanical engineering under Project 671 got underway in 1974.<ref name=\"development\" />  Until production of the new model, intensive engineering efforts were carried out to make the CVCC engine quieter and more suited to higher cruising speeds, to refine the suspension for better ride and handling, to develop a power steering system suitable for a lightweight compact car, and to improve noise damping in the body and frame.  Extensive pre-production testing was performed under a wide variety of conditions, to assure the Accord's suitability for the varied uses an export model would be subjected to.<ref name=\"development\" />\n\nFor the new model, Honda chose the name \"Accord\", reflecting \"Honda's desire for accord and harmony between people, society and the automobile.\"<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Honda |date=4 September 1997 |title=Accord\u2014Accord, Torneo, Accord Wagon |url=https://global.honda/newsroom/worldnews/1997/4970904a.html |accessdate=12 December 2010}}</ref> German manufacturer [[Opel]] unsuccessfully sued Honda, claiming that the name was too similar to their [[Opel Rekord|Rekord]].<ref name=DaiRede>{{citation | ref = DaiKi | title = Daihatsu Automobile: Erfahrung f\u00fcr die Zukunft | last = Kie\u00dfler | first = Bernd-Wilfried | language = de | page = 92 | isbn = 9783517012254 | publisher = S\u00fcdwest | date = 1992 }}</ref>\n\nThe Accord's final form, with an extended nose and extended coupe cabin with a sloping hatchback rear, was a logical derivation of the stubby hatchback design of the Civic and it provided ample leeway for use of Civic-derived components.  It showed similarity to the [[Volkswagen Scirocco]], which had been introduced in January 1974, leading to speculation that the form of the Accord was copied from the Scirocco.

The Accord sold well due to its moderate size and great fuel economy. It was one of the first Japanese sedans with features like cloth seats, a tachometer, intermittent wipers, and an AM/FM radio as standard equipment. In 1978 an LX version of the hatchback was added which came with air conditioning, a digital clock, and power steering. Until the Accord, and the closely related [[Honda Prelude#First generation (1979\u20131982)|Prelude]], power steering had not been available to cars under two liters.<ref>{{cite journal |last=von Fersen |first=Olaf |title=Automobiltechnik an der Zeitenwende/La technique de l'automobile \u00e0 un tournant | trans-title = Automobile technology at a turning point |journal=Automobil Revue '80 |publisher=Hallwag, AG |language=German, French |location=Berne, Switzerland |volume=75 |page=105 |date=6 March 1980}}</ref> Japanese buyers were liable for slightly more annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] over the smaller Civic, which had a smaller engine.\n\nOn 14 October 1977 (a year later in the U.S. market), a four-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] was added to the lineup, and power went to {{convert|72|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} when the {{convert|1599|cc|CID|abbr=on|lk=out}}<ref name=Autocar1967>{{cite journal |title=News |issue=147 |journal=Autocar |volume=4228 |pages=16\u201317 |date=19 November 1977}}</ref> EF1 engine was supplemented and in certain markets replaced by the {{convert|1751|cc|CID|abbr=on|lk=out}} an EK-1 unit.

In 1980 the optional two-speed semi-automatic transmission of previous years became a three-speed fully automatic gearbox (a four-speed automatic transaxle was not used in the Accord until the 1983 model year). The North American versions had slightly redesigned bumper trim. Other changes included new grilles and taillamps and remote mirrors added on the four-door (chrome) and the LX (black plastic) models.

In Europe, the Accord was available as a fairly well equipped (for the time) standard version, as well as a very luxurious EX model at a modest upcharge.<ref name=TV178229/>\n\nIn the United States, Federal lighting regulations required [[headlamp]]s of [[sealed beam]] construction and standard size and shape on all vehicles, so Accords in North America were equipped with four rectangular headlamp units rather than the aerodynamic composite replaceable-bulb units used on Accords sold outside North America (note European specification imagery). Other [[Automotive lighting]] variations included amber front and red rear side marker lights and reflectors in North America, and headlamp washers and a red rear fog lamp for European markets.

This quickly filtered through to export markets, where the outdated Hondamatic was soon superseded entirely. The manual five-speed transmission remained unchanged. A new 120&nbsp;mph speedometer replaced the earlier 88&nbsp;mph unit. The Special Edition (SE) featured Novillo leather seating, power windows, power sunroof and door locks. Gray was added as a color option. A slightly modified EK-2 engine was introduced, replacing the earlier EK-1, albeit still carbureted.\n\n=== 1983 refresh ===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1985 Honda Accord EX sedan (2015-07-09) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1985 Honda Accord EX sedan (2015-07-09) 02.jpg\n| caption2 = European Specification Sedan (facelift)\n| image3 = 1984-1985 Honda Accord hatchback 02.jpg\n| caption3 =  Hatchback (facelift)\n| image4 = Honda Accord EX 09-08-2019 1.jpg\n| image5 = Honda Accord EX 09-08-2019 2.jpg\n| caption5 = North American Specification Sedan (facelift)\n}}\n\nBy 1983, Accords sold in the eastern United States were produced at the new [[Marysville, Ohio|Marysville]] plant, with quality considered equal to those produced in Japan. In June 1983, for the 1984 model year, the Accord body was restyled with a slightly downward beveled nose and a new series of 12-valve CVCC powerplants.<ref>''[[#JAMA30|Automobile Guide Book 1983-84]]'', p. 159</ref> Globally there was a 1.6 (EY) and also the slightly more powerful ES2 {{convert|1829|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}}, yielding {{convert|86|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} in federal trim. Honda integrated rear side marker lights and reflectors into the side of the tail light units. European Accords now included a side turn signal repeater just behind each front wheel well. The U.S. requirement for standardized headlamps was rescinded in late 1983, but North American Accords continued to use sealed beams until the fourth-generation models were released in 1989.\n\nThe LX offered velour upholstery, auto-reverse cassette stereo, air conditioning, cruise control, power brakes, power steering, power windows and power door locks (sedan only), a digital clock, roof pillar antenna, along with thick black belt moldings, integrated bumpers and flush plastic mock-alloy style wheels covers that resembled the trend-setting [[Audi 5000]]. Supplies were tight, as in the Eastern states, the wait was months for a Graphite Gray sedan, a then-popular color. The LX hatchback was the only 1984 version of the Accord to include dual side view mirrors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe 1984 sedan was available in four exterior colors, Greek White and three metallic options: Columbus Gray, Regency Red (burgundy), and Stratos Blue (steel). The regular hatchback was available in Greek White, Dominican Red, and the metallic Stratos Blue. The 1984 LX hatchback came in three metallic colors only: Graphite Gray, Regency Red, and Copper Brown.\n\nIt was one of the first Japanese engineered vehicles to offer computer controlled, fuel-injection with one injector per cylinder, also known as multiple port fuel injection. This arrived on 24 May 1984 on the ES series 1.8 L engine, and was known as Honda's Programmed Fuel Injection, or [[PGM-FI]].<ref name=Catvol31>{{citation | ref = JAMA31 | title = \u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af | trans-title = Japanese Motor Vehicles Guide Book 1984~'85 | language = Japanese | volume = 31 | date = 1984-10-20 | publisher = [[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]] | location = Japan | page = 112 | id = 0053-840031-3400 }}</ref> This option was not offered until 1985 in the United States market.

A fuel-injected, {{convert|110|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} non-CVCC ES3 engine was exclusive to this model. The moniker, SE-i, was adapted from the SE trim, but included the \"-i\" to signify the higher trim level's fuel-injected engine. This 12-valve, {{convert|1829|cc|L cuin||abbr=on}} engine was the first non-CVCC engine used in an Accord, and was the same basic engine design used by Honda until 1989. Like the previous SE trim in 1983, the SE-i featured [[Calfskin|Novillo]] leather seating, power moonroof, bronze tinted glass, a premium sound system with cassette, and 13-inch alloy wheels. The level of luxury equipment on the SE-i was essentially items that were installed on the [[Honda Vigor]] VTL-i, that was only sold in Japan.\n\nAvailable options differed from market to market. The 1.8-liter engine, updated four-speed automatic transmission, and 'EX' trim level options were first made available in New Zealand during the 1984 model year refresh alongside the 1.6-liter 'LX' model.\n\nJapan generally received more options earlier than the rest of the world. In 1981, the Accord offered an adjustable ride height air suspension in the Japanese market. From 1983 in Japan and 1984 in Europe, the second-generation Accord was available with anti-lock brakes (called ALB) as an option. This braking system was the first time that an Accord used four-wheel disc brakes. Fuel injection became available in 1984 in the Japan market with the earlier introduction of the ES3 engine in the SE-i. Models took a year to arrive in North American and European markets with less stringent emissions laws continuing, using carburetors throughout second-generation production.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|third|1985|CA|CA1/2/3/4/5/6}} Third generation (1985\u20131989) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation<br />series CA1/2/3/4/5/6\n| image = 1986-1989 Honda Accord sedan -- 03-16-2012.JPG\n| caption = Accord DX sedan\n| aka = [[Honda Vigor#Second generation (CA1-CA2-CA3)|Honda Vigor]] (Japan)\n| production = 1985\u20131989\n| model_years = 1986\u20131989\n| assembly = [[Sayama, Saitama]], Japan<br />[[Marysville, Ohio]], USA ([[Marysville Auto Plant]])<br />[[Alliston, Ontario]], Canada ([[Honda of Canada Manufacturing|HCM]])<br />[[Petone]]/[[Nelson, New Zealand]] (New Zealand Motor Corporation/Honda New Zealand)<br />[[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayuthaya]], [[Thailand]] (Honda Cars (Thailand) Co.)<br/>[[North Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] (PT.

It had a very striking exterior design styled by Toshi Oshika in 1983, that resonated well with buyers internationally. One notable feature was the [[hidden headlamps]]. Because this generation was also sold as the Honda Vigor, the Accord received the hidden headlamps. Honda's Japanese dealership channel called ''Honda Verno'' all had styling elements that helped identify products only available at ''[[Honda Verno]]''. As a result, Japanese market Accords had a ''Honda Verno'' styling feature, but were sold at newly established Japanese dealerships ''Honda Clio'' with the all-new, luxury [[Honda Legend]] sedan, and international Accords were now visually aligned with the Prelude, the CR-X, and the new Integra.\n\nThe retractable headlamps of the third generation Accord sedan were in Japan, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, KY region (Arabian countries) and on cars in Taiwan that were imported from the United States. In other countries, the Accord sedan had conventional headlamps, including in Japan from July 1987, on \"'''Accord CA'''\", with CA standing for \"Continental Accord\". Accords in all other bodies (hatchback, AeroDeck, coupe) had only retractable headlamps worldwide.\n\nAt its introduction in 1985, it won the [[Car of the Year Japan]] Award.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe third-generation Accord became the first Honda to employ [[double wishbone]]s at both the front and rear ends. While more expensive than competitors' [[MacPherson strut]] systems, this setup provided better stability and sharper handling for the vehicle. All had front sway bars and upper models had rear sway bars as well. Brakes were either small all-wheel discs with twin-piston calipers (only available on the Japanese-market 2.0-Si model), larger all-wheel discs with single piston calipers, or a front disc/rear drum system. ABS was available as an option on the 4-wheel disc brake models, though not in North America. Base model Accords rode on 13-inch steel wheels with hubcaps with more expensive models having the option of 14-inch alloy wheels.\n\nThe Accord's available engines varied depending on its market: Japan received the [[Honda A engine#A18A|A18A]], [[Honda A engine#A20|A20A]], [[Honda B20A engine|B18A]], [[Honda B20A engine|B20A]] and A20A3 (US imported cars); Europe received the [[Honda A engine#A16A1|A16A1]], A20A1, [[Honda A engine#A20|A20A2]], A20A3, [[Honda A engine#A20|A20A4]], [[Honda B20A engine#B20A2|B20A2]], and [[Honda B20A engine#B20A8|B20A8]]; Australia and New Zealand received A20A2 and A20A4; other regions received A20A2 and/or A16A1; while United States, Canada and Taiwan (US imported cars) received the [[Honda A engine#A20|A20A1]] and [[Honda A engine#A20|A20A3]]. On Accord 1986 model year engine block was marked as BS and BT in the United States, BS1 and BT1 in Canada, this cars had chassis code BA. Since 1987 the engine block in Indonesia was marked as NA instead of A20A2. The engine block in Thailand was marked as A.\n\nIn Japan, the introduction of a 2.0 liter engine obligated Japanese drivers to pay a higher amount of annual [[road tax]] compared to the last two previous generations, pushing the Accord into the luxury category in Japan.\n\nThe Accord's trim levels ranged from spartan to luxurious. In the Japanese home market, the Accord was available with a full power package, heated mirrors (optional), a digital instrument cluster (optional), sunroof (optional), cruise control, and climate control (which was also optional). Some North European export models also had heated front seats and head light washers. North American and Australian Accords were not available with most of these options, presumably (and in the U.S. in particular) because Honda was seen as a builder of economy cars, and not to cannibalize sales from the recently introduced{{when?|date=October 2019}} [[Acura]] line.\n\nThroughout the different markets, in addition to the sedan model the Accord was available with different bodystyles which included a three-door hatchback, a three-door [[shooting-brake]] called [[:ja:\u30db\u30f3\u30c0\u30fb\u30a2\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30a8\u30a2\u30ed\u30c7\u30c3\u30ad|Accord AeroDeck]], and a two-door coupe which was added in 1987 for the 1988 model year. The coupe, which was built exclusively in Honda's Marysville, Ohio factory, was \"reverse exported\" back to Japan where it was known as the US-coupe CA6.\n\n=== Accord AeroDeck ===\n[[File:1988 Honda Accord Aerodeck 2.0 EX (15243647990).jpg|thumb|left|Accord AeroDeck]]\n\nThe third-generation Accord was sold in Japan, Europe and New Zealand as a three-door hatchback with a flat roof over the rear seats, known in Europe as a [[shooting-brake]]. The bodystyle of a flat roof hatchback was also used on the third-generation [[Honda Civic (third generation)]] subcompact, the second-generation [[Honda City]] [[supermini]] and the first-generation [[Honda Today]] ''[[kei car]]''. The [[Honda CR-X]] was the only three-door hatchback that adopted a fastback, sloping rear hatch \"[[kammback]]\" appearance, demonstrating a performance car appearance identified with ''Honda Verno'' products during the mid-1980s.\n\nIn North America, the Accord coupe and hatchback models were offered instead. The \"AeroDeck\" name was reused on the [[Honda Orthia|Honda Civic 5-door station wagon]], sold in the UK from 1996 to 2000. In parts of Continental Europe, the Accord five-door station wagon was also called the Accord AeroDeck from 1990 until 2008, when the name of the station wagon was renamed the \"Accord Tourer\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnOvCnpfvw4 Japanese television commercial for the AeroDeck.]</ref> The AeroDeck was only available in Japan at [[Honda Clio]] dealerships as a variation of the Accord.\n\nThe cargo handling abilities of the AeroDeck were ceded to the fourth-generation Accord station wagon in 1990. The AeroDeck was unique to the Accord model line, as the AeroDeck was not available as a [[Honda Vigor]], as the Accord and Vigor were mechanically identical. The AeroDeck returned an aerodynamic value of .34, and the {{convert|2600|mm|in|1|abbr=on|}} wheelbase returned a spacious interior for both front and rear passengers, on par with a mid-size sedan. Unfortunately, the appearance was not well received in Japan, as the introduction of the Accord Coupe was more well-liked. The appearance was more popular in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe AeroDeck was equipped with a four-wheel double wishbone suspension, which gave both a comfortable ride and cornering performance. In addition, speed-sensitive power steering is included, which gives the car easy turning assistance at speeds below {{convert|40|km/h}} during operation, such as parallel parking. Note that the top model in Japan \"2.0Si\" is to 4w-ALB (4-wheel ABS) are standard equipment (with option to upgrade in other trim packages).\n\nVisibility from the driver's seat and passenger seat was better due to the lower instrument panel design of the front window and a large windshield. And switches are arranged efficiently and at the time was the driving position can be fine-tuned adjustments.\n\nBecause of the shape of the vehicle and the flat roof that continued to the rear of the vehicle, opening the rear hatch had some drawbacks in low clearance environments. The lower part of the hatch was not like one used on a station wagon that went all the way down to the rear bumper, so loading cargo into the back wasn't as convenient as a conventional station wagon with a one piece hatchback. The rear hatch also wrapped into the rear roof, similar to a [[gull wing door]] so that the rear glass was in two pieces, one for the back window, and another partially on the rear roof. When open, the hatch rose above the roof at a right angle, providing additional overhead clearance when the hatch was open.\n\nMoreover, because of the emphasis on aiding rear-seat passenger entry, a longer front door was installed, and because power windows were not installed on the lower trim packages \"LX\", \"LX-S\" and as such, the window regulator opening felt heavy.\n\n{{gallery | width = 195 |title=| height = 133\n|File:1987-1988 Honda Accord Si hatchback 02.jpg|Accord Si hatchback\n|File:'89 Honda Accord Coupe.jpg|Accord coupe\n|File:Honda Accord rear 20080121.jpg|Accord EX sedan\n|File:89 SE-i - Dash.jpg|Interior\n}}\n\n=== Chassis code configurations ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | CODE !!

Although much larger than its predecessor the sedan's styling was evolutionary, featuring the same low slung design and wraparound rear window as the third-generation Accord. For the first time a 3-door hatchback was no longer available internationally.\n\nThis was one of the first U.S. production cars to feature optic reflectors with completely clear lenses on the headlamps.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} The styling reflected influences from the flagship [[Honda Legend]] (sold in North America as an [[Acura Legend|Acura]]), as Japanese Accords were now sold at ''Honda Clio'' dealerships, where the Legend, and the [[Honda Inspire#First generation series CB5, CC2 & CC3 (1989\u20131995)|Honda Inspire]], were sold. The growing popularity of the Accord internationally was evident in the ever-increasing dimensions, which now matched almost exactly with the first-generation Legend introduced in 1985.\n\nFor this fourth-generation Accord, Honda made significant engineering design improvements. All Accords sold in North America came with a completely new all aluminum 2.2-liter 16-valve electronic fuel-injected engine standard, replacing the previous 2.0-liter 12-valve model from the past generation. Also noteworthy, all Accords equipped with automatic transmissions used an electronically controlled rear engine mount to reduce low frequency noise and vibration. The mount contained two fluid filled chambers separated by a computer controlled valve. At low engine speeds, fluid is routed through the valve damping vibration. Above 850 rpm, fluid is routed around the valve making the engine mount stiffer.\n\nIn the U.S., the LX-i and SE-i designations were dropped, being replaced with the DX, LX and EX trim levels. The Canadian Accord trim levels varied slightly from the U.S. models with LX, EX and EX-R roughly corresponding to the American DX, LX and EX, respectively. Fourth-generation Japanese-assembled EXi Accords sold in Australia offered the same [[Four wheel steering#Four-wheel steering|4-wheel steering]] technology as was available optionally on the U.S. Honda Prelude, but was not included on the New Zealand-assembled versions. The four-wheel steering system was also available on the Accord's Japanese platform mate, called the [[Honda Ascot]] FTBi. U.S. Accord Coupes were available in the same DX, LX and EX trims as the U.S. Accord Sedan (LX, EX and EX-R in Canada).\n\nA 125-horsepower (93&nbsp;kW) 4-cylinder engine was offered in the DX and LX models (F22A1), while the 1990 and 1991 model year EX received a 130&nbsp;hp (97&nbsp;kW) version (F22A4). Cruise control was dropped from the DX sedan, with air conditioning remaining a dealer-installed option. The LX kept the same features as the previous generation including air conditioning, power windows, door locks, and mirrors. The 90\u201391 EX added 5 horsepower due to a different exhaust manifold design, slightly larger exhaust piping and a twin outlet muffler. 15-inch machined aluminum-alloy wheels, sunroof, upgraded upholstery, rear stabilizer bar and a high-power 4-speaker stereo cassette were standard on all EX models. Some models though rare were special ordered with an [[anti-lock braking system]] (at that time abbreviated as ALB, now all automakers refer to it as ABS). A redesigned manual transmission with a hydraulic clutch was standard equipment in all trims while an all-new electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission was optional for all models.\n\nSome new dealer-installed accessories were now offered including a single-disc in-dash CD player or trunk mounted 6-disc CD changer, stereo equalizer, fog lights, security system, rear wing spoiler, trunk lip spoiler, luggage rack, full and half nose mask, center armrest, window visors, sunroof visor, car cover, and a cockpit cover.\n\nBecause of tightening auto safety regulations from the NHTSA, all 1990 and 1991 model year Accords sold in the United States came equipped with motorized shoulder belts for front passengers to comply with passive restraint mandates. These semi-automatic restraints were a two component system; a motorized shoulder belt along with a non-integrated and manually operated seatbelt. The shoulder belts automatically raced around each window frame encircling both the driver and front seat passenger whenever the front door closed. The process reversed to release them when opened. The lap belts however, still required manual fastening.\n\n[[File:CB9 HAM Plate.jpg|thumb|left|Honda of America badge (installed on the \"C\" pillar)]]\n\nIn early 1990 for the 1991 model year, Honda unveiled the Accord wagon, manufactured at the Marysville, Ohio plant. The Ohio plant exported right-hand drive wagons and coupes to Europe and Japan, and in Europe the station wagon (station wagon) was called the \"Aerodeck\" (in reference to the 1985\u20131989 2-door vehicle). All station wagons sold outside the United States were affixed with a small badge on the [[pillar (car)|\"C\" pillar]] denoting the vehicle was built at the Ohio facility. European and Japanese vehicles had options not available within the U.S. including automatic climate control systems, power seats and several other minor features. The Accord Wagons were available from November 1990, only in LX and EX trim in North America or just 2.2i in Japan. They had larger front brakes to compensate for the added weight and unlike other U.S. Accords, included a driver's side airbag as standard equipment. Other than a retractable tonneau cover in the rear cargo area and keyless entry on EX models, the wagons were equipped the same as their coupe and sedan counterparts.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1990/09/10/73991/ |publisher=[[CNN Money]] |first=Alex |last=Taylor III |title=Japan's new U.S. car strategy |date=10 September 1990 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416192821/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1990/09/10/73991/ |archivedate=16 April 2014 |accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Return of the SE (1991) ===\nHonda reintroduced the SE (previously SE-i) sedan for 1991. It returned to the lineup without the traditional Bose high powered audio system but with an AM/FM stereo cassette 4x20 watt EX audio system; leather-trimmed steering wheel, leather seats and door panels, a fuel-injected {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, and 4-Wheel disc brakes w/ ABS as standard equipment. For the first time, a manual transmission was not offered in the SE. Two colors were available: Solaris Silver Metallic with Graphite Black interior and Brittany Blue Metallic with Ivory interior. Unlike previous editions, the 1991 SE was not equipped with uniquely styled alloy wheels but instead carried the EX model wheels.\n\n=== Update (1992\u20131993) ===\nAccords received a minor facelift in 1991 for the 1992 model year. The SE trim was dropped again but left behind its {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} F22A6 engine for use in the EX models. This engine added 15&nbsp;hp over the DX and LX trims and 10&nbsp;hp over the 90\u201391 EX trim due to a further revised exhaust system. The system used the same EX-SE twin outlet muffler, a revised air intake tract, a revised camshaft and a revised intake manifold using IAB butterfly valves which open at 4600 rpm to increase air intake breathing at high rpm. It was similar in design to the 92\u201396 Prelude Si and VTEC models. For the 1992 and 1993 model years, the motorized shoulder belt system were replaced with a standard driver-side [[airbag]] and conventional shoulder/seatbelt arrangement for all but the center rear passenger. Anti-lock 4-wheel disc brakes became standard on the EX. The front and rear [[Fascia (car)|facias]] received a more rounded and updated look. Coupe and sedan models received a new grille, new headlamps, amber parking lights, slightly thinner [[body side molding]], updated wheel designs and for the first time, the EX coupe used wheels different from the EX sedan. The sedans received restyled shortened taillamps with inverted amber turn signal and backup light positions. The wagon taillamps though still resembled those from the 1990\u20131991 Accord. The coupe used the new revised inverted positioning of the signal and backup lights but the wagon taillamps however remained the same as the 90\u201391 models. EX trim levels included a radio anti-theft function to deter stereo theft. A front driver's seat armrest was now standard on LX and EX models. Some dealer-installed accessories were dropped including the luggage rack, trunk-lip spoiler and cockpit cover. A gold finish kit was added.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:1993 Honda Accord SE coupe 02.jpg|Coupe (1991 facelift)\nFile:1994 Honda Accord Coupe 2.0.jpg|Coupe (1991 facelift)\nFile:1993 Honda Accord 2.2 Rear.jpg|Sedan (1991 facelift)\nFile:1992-1993 Honda Accord wagon -- 03-16-2012.JPG|Wagon (1991 facelift)\n</gallery>\n\n=== 10th Anniversary Edition and return of the SE (1993) ===\nIn 1992, Honda introduced the 10th Anniversary Edition sedan to commemorate the 10th year of U.S. Accord production. The 10th Anniversary Edition was based on the Accord LX sedan but came equipped with several features not available in the LX trim. The upgrades included ABS, 4-wheel disc brakes, 15\" EX coupe six spoke alloy wheels, body colored side moldings, chin spoiler, and standard automatic transmission. Three colors were offered for the 10th Anniversary Edition: Frost White, Granada Black Pearl, and Arcadia Green Pearl. The 10th Anniversary models also included the same premium seat fabric found in EX models. The Frost White and Arcadia Green cars were paired with the same interior color as their LX/EX counterparts, Blue and Ivory, respectively. The Granada Black cars were paired with Gray interior, while the Granada Black EX had Ivory interior.\n\nThe SE returned in late 1992 as both a sedan, and for the first time since the 1989 SE-i, as a coupe. The SE sedan featured standard dual front airbags; the first Accord to do so. An 8-button, 4-speaker Honda-Bose audio system, automatic transmission, leather trim, body colored bumper and body side moldings were standard. The SE coupe included a factory rear wing spoiler which differed slightly in design from the already available dealer installed accessory rear wing spoiler. In Canada, the SE came with heated front seats and heated side view mirrors. Both the sedan and coupe received distinctive 15-inch alloy wheels as well. All SE sedans during 1990\u20131991 (1991 MY) and 1992\u20131993 (1993 MY) were manufactured in Japan, while all SE coupes were produced in the U.S. The 1993 MY sedan was available in two colors: Cashmere Silver Metallic and Geneva Green Pearl, both with Ivory interior. The coupe was offered with two colors as well: Cashmere Silver Metallic and Atlantis Blue Pearl, both again with Ivory interior. Sadly, 1993 would be the swan song for the SE as an exclusive, high content, limited edition Accord model. Later generations would use a \"Special Edition\" designation rather than the previously used \"SE\" designation. These models were a combination of an Accord LX with several EX features similar to the 1993 10th Anniversary Edition LX.\n\nAt the end of the model life of the CB Accord, a \"pillared [[hardtop]]\" model called the [[Honda Ascot Innova]] was launched in Japan, based on the CB Accord chassis, but with a different, much more modern-styled body, taking cues from the 1992 [[Honda Prelude]].\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Honda Ascot ===\n{{main|Honda Ascot}}\n[[File:CB Honda Ascot.jpg|thumb|left|Japan-spec series CB Honda Ascot]]\n\nThe fourth-generation Accord spawned a sister model in 1989, called the Honda Ascot which, while mechanically identical to the Accord, featured unique sedan bodywork, although it bore a resemblance to the Accord. The Ascot was sold through the ''[[Honda Primo]]'' network in Japan while the Accord was distributed through the ''[[Honda Clio]]'' network.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Honda Vigor and Honda Inspire ===\n{{main|Honda Vigor|Honda Inspire}}\n[[File:Honda Accord Inspire 001.JPG|thumb|left|1989 Inspire]]\n[[File:1st gereneration Honda Inspire rear.jpg|thumb|right|1989 Inspire]]\nUnlike previous generations of the Honda Vigor, which were simply upmarket versions of the Accord, the third generation 'CB5' model was spun off as a model in its own right and was based on a different platform which featured a longitudinal engine layout compared to the transverse set-up of the Accord. A sister model to the Vigor, the Honda Inspire, was also unveiled in 1989 and, bar a different front grille, front and rear lights and bumpers, sported identical bodywork. The Vigor was available in the United States and Canada under the [[Acura]] brand.\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|fifth|1993|CD|CD3/4/5/6/7/9}} Fifth generation (1993\u20131997) ==\n\nFor the first time in the model's history, Honda developed two distinct versions of the Accord when the fifth-generation model was launched in fall of 1993; one version for the European market and one for the North American and Japanese market. Honda and the [[Rover Group]] created the European Accord and the [[Rover 600 series|Rover 600]], a reflection of the past success they had with the [[Honda Legend]] and the [[Rover 800 Series|Rover 800]]. This generation Accord was also [[badge engineered|sold]] in Japan as the [[Isuzu Aska]], while some Isuzu products were sold as Honda products there also.\n\nAt its introduction in 1993, it won the [[Car of the Year Japan]] Award for the second time.\n\n=== North America, Japan and Asia Pacific ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Fifth generation<br />Japan, North America, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France and Switzerland<br />series CD3/4/5/6/7/9\n| image = 1993-1995 Honda Accord EXi sedan (2011-06-15).jpg\n| aka = [[Isuzu Aska]]<br />Datong Accord (China; [[Joint venture|JV]])<br />Xinkai HXK6360 (China; [[Joint venture|JV]])\n| production = September 1993\u20131997\n| model_years = 1994\u20131997\n| assembly = {{ubl\n  |[[Marysville, Ohio]], U.S. ([[Marysville Auto Plant]])\n  |[[Sayama]], Japan\n  |[[Jalisco]], Mexico (Honda De M\u00e9xico)\n  |[[Nelson, New Zealand]] (Honda New Zealand)\n  |[[North Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]] (PT.

Larger than its predecessor, primarily to better suit the requirements of the North American market, the new model grew in width but shrunk in length, leaving it classified as a [[mid-size car]] in North America. It thus became too wide to fit within the [[Vehicle size class#Japan|favorable tax bracket]] in Japan, where its role was to be partially taken over by the slightly narrower second-generation [[Honda Ascot]] (sold at ''Honda Primo'' Japanese dealerships) and [[Honda Rafaga]] (sold at ''Honda Verno''). Previous generations of the Accord sold in Japan were limited to a width dimension of {{convert|1695|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} while international models were slightly wider, however this generation no longer complied. The engines offered with the Accord also exceeded the maximum limit of 2000cc to remain in the favorable \"compact\" tax bracket. The installation of a 2.0 liter engine in Japanese models made buyers liable for more annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] over the smaller 1.8-liter engine, which affected sales.\n\nDevelopment began in September 1989, along with the design process in June 1990. The final design was selected by an early date of 18 December 1990 and frozen by mid-1991. Design inconsistencies in early 1992, caused several alterations to be made until April 1992, when a secondary design freeze took place, ahead of scheduled 1993 production. Design patents were later filed in the United States on 16 December 1992 for the \"CD\".

The Japanese-spec Accord models were marketed as the following: EF, EX, 2.0EX, 2.0EXL, 2.2VTE, 2.2VTL, 2.2VTS and SiR.

The 5-speed manual transmission remained mostly unchanged, while the 4-speed automatic noted for its hard shifts, now included Honda's \"Grade-Logic\" shift program, which would prevent \"gear-hunting\" by holding the current gear while driving on a sloped incline. All Accord models received a more ergonomic interior with standard safety features such as dual airbags and reinforced side-impact beams. Exclusive to the EX was the F22B1 SOHC VTEC version of previous generation 2.2-liter 4-cylinder (making {{convert|145|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} up from {{convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} on the previous generation EX), anti-lock brakes (now an option for the LX), 4-wheel disc brakes, 15-inch alloy wheels, and a rear stabilizer bar. Leather was an option in the EX trim with leather equipped models now being referred to as EX-L. DX and LX models came equipped similarly to the previous generation and were fitted with a revised version of the previous generation's 2.2-liter non-VTEC 4-cylinder engine. This F22B2 engine was rated at {{convert|130|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} up from {{convert|125|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} the previous generation. The Accord was again named [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|''Motor Trend'' Import Car of the Year]] for 1994. The Accord coupe as in the previous generation looked almost exactly like the sedan, and was the last generation of the Accord to offer a wagon variant in North America until the introduction of the Accord Crosstour in 2009.\n\n[[File:Honda Accord wagon -- 04-10-2011.jpg|thumb|left|Accord Wagon LX (rear)]]\n\nIn 1994, the 1995 Accord debuted a [[V6 engine]], the 2.7&nbsp;L ''[[Honda C engine#C27|C27]]'' borrowed from the first-generation [[Acura Legend]], in the U.S. market. The V6 was offered in both the LX and EX versions of the sedan, LX models being referred to as LX-V6 and EX models as EX-V6. EX-V6 models came equipped similarly to the EX-L with leather seats being the only option in the EX-V6. Addition of the taller C27 engine required substantial alterations to the CD platform, with V6 models sporting a redesigned engine layout, taller front fenders, and a different hood than I4 models; however, these differences are difficult to spot without both models parked side-by-side. Both versions of the V6 received a dual-outlet exhaust, a 4-speed automatic transmission, 15-inch machined aluminum alloy wheels on the EX-V6 and 15-inch steel wheels with full covers on the LX-V6, and a slightly updated front grille (which would be later used in all 96\u201397 Accords). The Accord saw very few other changes for 1995 with the exception of a few different exterior and interior color combinations.\n\nIn 1995, the Accord underwent the usual mid-generation facelift for 1996. More rounded bumpers, a slightly modified front fascia (which was originally exclusive in the V6 models in 1995) with new signal lights and rear taillamps gave the Accord a softer look. All Hondas now complied with the federal government's requirement of OBD II engine diagnostics though all three engine choices remained the same. In order to increase the Accord's competitiveness against its rivals in different international markets, Honda CEO [[Nobuhiko Kawamoto]] decided on one basic platform for the sixth-generation Accord, but with different bodies and proportions for local markets. In the U.S., the 1996 model lineup included the 25th Anniversary Edition, a model positioned between the DX and LX. The Special Edition trim package was introduced.\n\nFor the 1997 model year, Honda released the \"Special Edition\" version of the Accord (not to be confused with the SE). It was offered in three colors: Heather Mist Metallic, San Marino Red and Dark Currant Pearl. The Special Edition received a factory installed security system with keyless entry, single-disc CD player, body colored side molding, distinctive alloy wheels and a sunroof. It was offered in an automatic transmission only and was fitted with the same engine as the LX. Acclaimed for its handling, the 1996 Accord has been known{{by whom|date=June 2014}} as one of the best handling Japanese midsized sedans of all time, posting impressive lateral g figures of up to .89 g's.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn New Zealand, the fifth-generation Accord was assembled at Honda's manufacturing site in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and was released in March 1994. It was available in LXi, EXi and EXi-S trim levels. A facelift was released in December 1995, which coincided with the release of VTEC engines in the upper-spec models. Trim levels were LXi, VTi, and VTi-S. These were the first NZ-market Accords to have airbags \u2013 two in the VTi-S, one in the VTi.\n\nU.S.-built coupe and wagon models of this generation were shipped to Europe with both left and right hand drive but there was no V6 option.\n\nThis generation of the Accord is one of the most frequently stolen cars in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nicb.org/theft_and_fraud_awareness/top-vehicles-stolen-by-state |title=Hot Wheels |publisher=nicb.org/ |accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref> \n\n==== Honda Accord SiR ====\n[[File:1996-1997 Accord SiR Wagon Rear (Imported Japanese Model) 2.JPG|thumb|left|1996 Accord SiR Wagon]]\nHonda of Japan produced three high-performance models of the Accord for the [[Japanese domestic market]] referred to as the '''SiR''', which was available for sale at ''[[Honda Clio]]'' dealerships in Japan. The sports car approach to the Accord SiR was aimed at aligning the Accord with the ''Honda Verno'' sports sedan that replaced the Vigor, called the [[Honda Saber]] a platform mate shared with the [[Honda Inspire]]. The compact sedan role the Accord previously filled was now relegated to the Honda Rafaga and Ascot. The Accord SiR models came equipped with the Japan-spec H22A DOHC VTEC engine instead of the F22B1 SOHC VTEC engine found in the EX. The Japan-spec H22A DOHC VTEC engine specs were {{convert|190|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 6800 rpm; peak torque {{convert|152|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 5500 rpm with a compression ratio of 10.6:1.

It came with cloth sport seats styled similar to the Prelude or optional leather seats, both exclusive to the SiR. The SiR also had some power options found on the Accord EX. The Accord SiR coupe (94\u201397) and the Accord SiR wagon (1997) were exclusively available for the Japanese market. SiR chassis codes for the sedan were the CD6, the coupe-CD8 and the 1997 wagon-CF2 (production began in September 1996 for the 1997 SiR wagons which lasted for almost one year). The Accord SiR Coupe and the Accord SiR wagon (1997), which were exclusively built in the United States at Honda's Marysville Ohio plant (HAM) but were marketed for Japan export only for this particular model, was not offered in North America.<ref>Yamaguchi, Jack; ''[[Road & Track]]'', July 1994 Ampersand \"Eagles are landing in Japan\" p64-67</ref>\n\nThe Accord SiR Coupe and then Accord SiR wagon were built with the Japan-spec H22A DOHC VTEC powertrains which were shipped from Japan and were installed into the HAM-built Accord SiR models. The 1994\u20131997 \"CD\" Accord chassis was designed for the H22A DOHC VTEC powertrain to be installed; because the firewall was curved at the top to allow more space for the tilting backwards of the H22A DOHC VTEC engine near the middle of the firewall. The H22A DOHC VTEC engine was the most powerful inline four-cylinder engine Honda built for the Prelude and the Accord before the 1995 U.S.-spec V6 sedan. The Accord SiR suspension was improved with stiffer front sway bar (27.2&nbsp;mm x 4.0&nbsp;mm), stiffer rear sway bar (16&nbsp;mm), stiffer front coil springs and stiffer rear coil springs.\n\nFeatures for the 94\u201395 Accord SiR models (sedans and coupes) included the following items: cruise control, automatic climate control (Similar to the first-generation Acura CL), Bose stereo system, 7,400 redline tachometer, optional electronic traction control and optional limited slip differential for automatic transmission, optional SRS and airbags, factory installed driving lights, optional factory installed \"pop up\" navigation radio head unit, sound insulation liner under front hood, black-housing headlamps, no side molding was available on the Accord SiR sedan, optional rear sunscreen, optional sunroof and power retractable outside mirrors. Features for the 96\u201397 Accord SiR models (sedans, coupes and wagons) included the same as above while adding; optional cruise control, rear window wiper on the sedan, optional leather interior and a colored side molding for the sedan as well.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== European model ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Fifth generation<br />Europe\n| image = Honda Accord 1995.jpg\n| aka = [[Honda Ascot Innova]]\n| production = 1993\u20131998\n| assembly = [[Swindon]], England ([[Honda of the UK Manufacturing|HUKM]])\n| designer = Shigeo Ueno (1989)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD347805 |title=Patent USD347805 \u2013 Automobile \u2013 Google Patents |publisher=Google |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>\n| class = [[Mid-size car]]\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| related = [[Rover 600 Series|Rover 600]]\n| engine = 1.8 L ''[[Honda F engine#F18B|F18A3]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.0 L ''[[Honda F engine#F20Z1|F20Z]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.2 L ''[[Honda F engine#F22B|F22Z2]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.3 L ''[[Honda H engine#H23A3|H23A3]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />2.0 L ''[[Rover L-Series engine|Rover 20T2N]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] diesel\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2720|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4675|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1715|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1380|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1240|-|1375|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n[[File:Honda Accord rear 20080205.jpg|thumb|left|1997 European-spec Accord]]\n\nThe fifth-generation Accord for the European market was unveiled in 1993 and was not related directly to the North American 'CD' Accord. It was in fact the Japanese-market [[Honda Ascot#Ascot Innova (CB3/4)|Honda Ascot Innova]] which was based on the previous fourth-generation 'CB' Accord. It was the result of a joint effort with the [[Rover Group]] that provided Rover with the 600 series. The exterior was designed by Shigeo Ueno in 1989.\n\nIn 1996, the European Accord received a minor facelift and was given a new front end (new headlamps, bumper, hood and grill) and slightly different taillamps (see images). The styling of the facelifted Accord remained identical to the styling of the Ascot Innova (although the frameless doors were replaced with conventional items) and featured the design language first introduced on the fifth-generation [[Honda Civic]]. The styling of the European Accord differed dramatically from the North American which featured a more conventional sedan styling compared to the European model's low slung, fastback inspired look which also incorporated rear quarter windows. The facelifted Accord was also equipped with two airbags as standard.\n\nHowever, the European Accord did not spawn an station wagon nor a coupe version, Honda instead opting to import the coupe and station wagon (Aerodeck) versions of the North American Accord.\n\nThe diesel model of the Accord was fitted with the direct injection Rover L-Series diesel engine, as also fitted in the Rover 600.\n\n==== Rover 600 ====\n[[File:Rover 600 01.jpg|thumb|left|Rover 600]]\nAs part of the tie-up with the [[Rover Group]] the European Accord spawned Rover's replacement for the [[Austin Montego]] in 1993. Called the [[Rover 600 Series|600]], the car shared its platform with the European Accord and, with the exception of the front doors, lower rear doors and windscreen, sported unique styling which dispensed with the rear quarter windows. The interior design of the 600 was very similar to the Accord's however, while the dashboard design was identical.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Sixth generation (1997\u20132002) ==\n{{Main|Honda Accord (sixth generation)}}\n[[File:1997-2001 Honda Accord V6 sedan (2011-04-02) 01.jpg|thumb|left|Honda Accord (Australia)]]\n[[File:1997-2001 Honda Accord V6 sedan (2011-04-02) 02.jpg|thumb|right|Honda Accord (Australia)]]\n[[File:2002 Honda Accord VTEC S 1.9 Front.jpg|thumb|left|Honda Accord (Europe)]]\n[[File:2002 Honda Accord VTEC S 1.9 Rear.jpg|thumb|right|Honda Accord (Europe)]]\n\nFor the sixth generation, Honda split the Accord into three separate models, designed for the Japanese, North American, and European markets. However, the wagon was discontinued in North America while the coup\u00e9 was discontinued in Japan.

It established many core ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' gameplay concepts. The brothers Mario and Luigi live in the Mushroom Kingdom, where they must rescue Princess Toadstool (later called Princess Peach) from Bowser/King Koopa. The game consists of eight [[Level (video games)|worlds]] of four levels each, totaling 32 levels altogether. Though the worlds differ in themes, the fourth level is always a fortress or castle that ends with a fight against [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] (or one of his minions disguised as him).<ref name=\"TMKTheBad\">{{cite web |url= http://themushroomkingdom.net/smb_breakdown.shtml#bad |title=The Bad |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |work=TMK Super Mario Bros.

It uses the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' engine, with additions such as weather, character movements, and more complex levels, altogether yielding a much higher difficulty. The game follows the same style of level progression as ''Super Mario Bros.'', with eight initial worlds of four levels each. The last level of the eight worlds is a [[lava]]-filled castle that culminates in a battle against Bowser. At that time, this sequel was not released outside Japan since Nintendo of America did not want the Mario series to be known to players outside of Japan for frustrating difficulty. It remained inaccessible to a steadily broadening market of American video game players, becoming stylistically outdated by the time the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' could be eventually delivered to America.<ref name=\"History of SMB at IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/14/ign-presents-the-history-of-super-mario-bros|title=IGN Presents The History of Super Mario Bros.|last=McLaughlin|first=Rus| publisher=IGN | date=September 14, 2010 | accessdate=April 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe game later debuted outside Japan in 1993 as \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\" in the compilation cartridge titled ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES). The original [[Famicom]] version was released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in September 2007, listed as \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\" outside Japan. A later ''Super Mario All-Stars'' Wii [[Porting#Porting in gaming|port]], titled ''[[Super Mario All-Stars#25th Anniversary Edition|Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition]]'', features the SNES gameplay and adds [[Wii Remote]], [[Classic Controller]], and [[GameCube]] controller compatibility.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Bros. 2}}\nIn ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' (''Super Mario USA'' in Japan), Mario and his companions are out to stop the evil frog [[Wart (Nintendo)|Wart]] in the Subcon dreamland.

Characters here also can pluck vegetables from the ground to throw at enemies. This is also the first ''Super Mario'' game to use a life meter, which allows Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad to be hit up to four times before dying. Mushrooms count for two lives, and coins are used for inter-level [[slot machine]] minigame.<ref name=\"History of SMB at IGN\" />\n\n=== ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Bros. 3}}\n''Super Mario Bros. 3'' is divided into eight themed worlds, each with 6\u201312 levels and several bonus stages displayed as locations on a mapped [[overworld]]. These locations are not necessarily in a linear order, and the player is occasionally permitted to skip levels or play the game out of order. Completed levels cannot be replayed. A world's final level is a [[boss stage]]. The penultimate boss stage is a side-scrolling level atop an [[airship]] (\"Doom Ship\") with a fight against one of Bowser's seven [[Koopalings]]. The game introduced a diverse array of new power-ups, including flight as Raccoon Mario or the level-long ''P-Wing'' allowing permanent flight through a whole level. Bowser is again the final boss.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Land'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Land}}\n''Super Mario Land'' was the first handheld ''Super Mario'' title after the Game & Watch port of ''Super Mario Bros.'', and was released for the [[Game Boy]]. As with other games in the series, it is a sidescrolling platformer in which Mario sets out to save [[Princess Daisy]] by defeating a mysterious spaceman named [[Tatanga]]. Power-ups include hearts, which gives Mario an extra life (similar to a 1-up mushroom) and small bouncing ball which Mario throws referred to as \"superballs\". The game consists of twelve levels split across four worlds.\n\n=== ''Super Mario World'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario World}}\n''Super Mario World'' was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and consists of nine worlds displayed via a world map overworld. Unlike ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', where each world map is individual, the world map here is unique and covers the whole game. Most of the 72 levels have one exit, though some have hidden second exits. Mario's new moves include a spin jump and the rideable [[Yoshi]] who can eat enemies and either swallow or spit them out. Power-ups include the returning Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star, and the new Cape Feather, based on ''Super Mario Bros. 3'''s Super Leaf, which lets Mario and Luigi fly with a cape. The game was followed by the prequel ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', which is also considered the first game in the [[Yoshi series]].\n\n=== ''Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins}}\n''Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins'' introduces Mario's rival, [[Wario]], who had taken over Mario's castle during the events of ''Super Mario Land'' and forces Mario to collect the six golden coins in order to reenter and reclaim his castle. While its predecessor is similar to the original ''Super Mario Bros.'', ''Super Mario Land 2'' has more in common with later games. The player is no longer restricted to only moving towards the right. A bell at each level's end activates a [[minigame]], where the player can try to get [[1-Up|extra lives]]. There are 32 levels, based on several themed worlds each with its own boss. Three power-ups return: the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Super Star. The game introduces the Carrot power-up, which gives Mario large rabbit ears that let him glide when falling for a limited time. Its story was continued in ''[[Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3]]'', which retroactively became the first of a spin-off series, ''[[Wario (series)#Wario Land series|Wario Land]]''.\n\n=== ''Super Mario 64'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario 64}}\n''Super Mario 64'' was the first [[3D computer graphics|3D]] and [[open world]] game in the series, and a [[launch game|launch title]] for the [[Nintendo 64]] home console. Each level is an enclosed environment where the player is free to explore in all directions without time limits. The player collects Power Stars that appear after completing tasks to unlock later courses and areas.<ref name=\"NP88\">{{Cite journal| date=September 1996 | title= Full Coverage&nbsp;\u2014 Super Mario 64| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 88| pages= 14\u201323}}</ref> The Nintendo 64's [[analog stick]] makes an extensive repertoire of precise movements in all directions possible. The game introduced moves such as punching, triple jumping, and using a Wing Cap to fly. It is the first ''Super Mario'' series game to feature [[Charles Martinet]]'s voice acting for Mario. Mario must once again save Princess Peach from Bowser, and collect up to 120 Power Stars from the paintings and return them to her castle, the overworld. There are a total of 105 Power Stars in the paintings, with 15 hidden in the castle. The game's power-ups differ from previous games, now being three different hats with temporary powers: the Wing Cap, allowing Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, turning him into metal; and the Vanish Cap, allowing him to walk through obstacles.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Sunshine'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Sunshine}}\n''Super Mario Sunshine'', the second 3D ''Super Mario'' title. It was released in 2002 for the [[GameCube]]. In it, Mario and Peach travel to Isle Delfino for a vacation when a Mario [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], going by the name of [[Shadow Mario]], appears and vandalizes the entire island. Mario is sentenced to clean the island with a water-squirting accessory called F.L.U.D.D. ''Super Mario Sunshine'' shares many similar gameplay elements with its predecessor ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', yet introduces moves, like spinning while jumping, and several other actions through the use of F.L.U.D.D. The game contains a number of independent levels, which can be reached from the hub, Delfino Plaza. Mario collects Shine Sprites by completing tasks in the levels, which in return unlock levels in Delfino Plaza by way of abilities and plot-related events.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamingworldx.com/gcn/SuperMarioSunshineJPN.shtml |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070716082934/http://www.gamingworldx.com/gcn/SuperMarioSunshineJPN.shtml|archivedate=July 16, 2007|title=Super Mario Sunshine (JPN) Review|publisher=GamingWorld X|author=Mackie, Joe|accessdate=November 22, 2007}}</ref> ''Sunshine'' introduces the last of Bowser's eight children, [[Bowser Jr.]] , as an antagonist. Yoshi also appears again for Mario to ride in certain sections.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros.'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros.}}\n''New Super Mario Bros.'' was released on the [[Nintendo DS]] in 2006. In it, Mario and Luigi set out to save Princess Peach from [[Bowser Jr]]. The gameplay is 2D, but most of the characters and objects are 3D on [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] backgrounds, resulting in a [[2.5D]] effect. The game uses an overworld map similar to those of ''Super Mario Bros. Deluxe''. Some levels have multiple exits. The classic power-ups (Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star) return alongside the Mega Mushroom, Blue Shell, and Mini Mushroom. The Mega Mushroom briefly turns Mario (or Luigi) into an invincible giant that destroys everything in his path, enemies as pipes and blocks. The Blue Shell protects Mario from harm and allows him to slide (depending on speed), where the Mini Mushroom shrinks Mario to a much smaller size, allowing him to fit through tight spaces and access places normally unreachable.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Galaxy'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Galaxy}}\n''Super Mario Galaxy'' was launched in 2007 for the [[Wii]]. It is set in [[outer space]], where [[Mario]] travels between \"[[Galaxy|galaxies]]\" to collect Power Stars, earned by completing quests or defeating enemies. Each galaxy contains a number of [[planet]]s and other space objects for the player to explore. The game's physics system gives each celestial object its own [[Gravitation|gravitational force]], which lets the player circumnavigate rounded or irregular planetoids by walking sideways or upside down. The player is usually able to jump from one independent object and fall towards another close object. Though the main gameplay and physics are in [[3D computer graphics|3D]], there are several points in the game where the player's movements are restricted into a 2D axis. Several new power-ups appear following the new game mechanics, and many of these return in its sequel, ''Super Mario Galaxy2''\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. Wii}}\nIn ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'', Princess Peach is captured by Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings during her birthday party in her castle, and Mario, Luigi, and two Toads (blue and yellow) spring into action to save her. The game features 4-player co-op and new power-ups: the Propeller Mushroom, the Ice Flower, and the Penguin Suit. The Propeller Mushroom allows the player to launch its character high into the air through shaking the [[Wii Remote]]. The Penguin Suit enhances sliding traction, speed and agility of swimming abilities, in addition to the ice ball projectiles that are provisioned by the Ice Flower. All characters can ride [[Yoshi]]. The levels are organised into individually themed open-worlds reminiscent of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. Like in its predecessor, there are three hidden Star Coins to find in each level, which can be used to unlock movies with gameplay tips. It was released in November 2009 to an important commercial success, and won several awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/objects/143/14354229.html |title=IGN: New Super Mario Bros.

It retains the basic premise of its predecessor and includes its items and power-ups. These include the Cloud Flower, which allows Mario to create platforms in mid-air, and the Rock Mushroom, which turns Mario into a rolling boulder. Mario can also ride Yoshi along. It was released to widespread critical acclaim.\n\n=== ''Super Mario 3D Land'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario 3D Land}}\n''Super Mario 3D Land'' was released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in November and December 2011. It is the first original 3D ''Super Mario'' game on a handheld console, since all previous games were either 2D or re-edits of former games. As an attempt to translate the gameplay of the 2D games into a 3D environment, it tried to simplify the control scheme of the 3D games through using more linear levels. It also brought back several older gameplay features, including the Super Leaf power-up last seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. This game was released to critical acclaim.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. 2'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. 2}}\n''New Super Mario Bros. 2'', the direct sequel of ''New Super Mario Bros.'' for the DS, was released in July and August 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS. The player, as Mario or Luigi, tries to save Princess Peach from Bowser and the Koopalings, with the game's secondary goal  to collect one million coins. Several gameplay elements were introduced to help achieve this goal, such as the Gold Flower, a rarer variant of the Fire Flower that turns items into coins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5903941/new-super-mario-bros-2-hits-japan-3dses-this-august/|title=New Super Mario Bros. 2 Hits 3DSes This August|work=Kotaku|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tinycartridge.com/post/25460539710/new-super-mario-bros-2-artwork-featuring-smb|title=New Super Mario Bros. 2 artwork, featuring SMB|work=Tiny Cartridge 3DS|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. U'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. U}}\n''New Super Mario Bros. U'', the [[Wii U]] follow-up to ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'', was released in November 2012, in North America. It plays similarly to the previous ''New Super Mario Bros.'' titles, and introduces both a Flying Squirrel suit that lets the players glide through the air, and [[asymmetric gameplay]] that allows the player holding the [[Wii U GamePad|GamePad]] to influence the environment. On June 20, 2013, ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' was released as a downloadable content (DLC) package for the game, featuring shorter but more difficult levels, starring Luigi as the main protagonist instead of his brother. Subsequently released as a standalone retail game on August 25, 2013, in North America.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kubba |first=Sinan |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/05/17/super-luigi/ |title=Super Luigi U arrives as DLC June 20, packaged standalone August 25 |publisher=Joystiq |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> Unlike the downloadable content version, the standalone retail version of ''New Super Luigi U'' does not require having ''New Super Mario Bros.

Like ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', it features Princess Peach and Toad as playable characters in addition to Mario and Luigi. Rosalina from ''Super Mario Galaxy'' is also unlocked later in the game.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Maker'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Maker}}\n''Super Mario Maker'' is a creation tool released for the Wii U in September 2015<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Mario Maker Release Date Announced at E3 2015|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-maker-release-date-announced-at-e3-201/1100-6428205/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}</ref> which allows players to create their own levels based on the gameplay and style of ''Super Mario Bros.'', ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', ''Super Mario World'', and ''New Super Mario Bros. U'', as well as to share their creations online. Based on existing games, several gameplay mechanics were introduced for the game, with existing ones also available to be used together in new ways. A Nintendo 3DS version of the game called ''Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS'', was released in December 2016. It features a few new pre-installed levels, but no online level sharing.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Run'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Run}}\n''Super Mario Run'' is a side-scrolling and [[Endless running game|auto-scrolling]] video game released in December 2016 on the [[iOS]] platform, then in March 2017 on [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. It is the first official ''Mario'' game developed for non-Nintendo hardware (since previous attempts all faced cancellation) , as well as the first official Super Mario game developed for [[mobile game|mobile devices]]. As such, it features simplified controls that allow it to be played with only one hand.\n\nIn this game, Mario runs automatically, and the player's in charge of controlling the jumping action so that Mario avoids all hazards. This is achieved by touching the tactile screens these devices are built with, and the longer the player touches the jump button, the higher Mario jumps. Collecting all coins in a precise level unlocks a set of 5 pink coins in said level for Mario (the player) to collect, allowing extended replayability. Collecting these 5 coins unlocks another set of 5 purple coins, which upon collecting unlocks another set of 5 coins, black this time and much harder to collect. This further multiplies the game's length, through requiring the player to beat a single level 4 times to fully complete it.\n\nThis game also includes a \"Toad Rally\" mode, quite similar to the \"VS Boo\" mode of ''Super Mario Bros Deluxe'', in which players have to complete a level faster than a computer-controlled Toad. Success in this mode earns the player access to in-game money to spend in customization options for it to create its own \"Mushroom Kingdom\" map, using mechanics similar to ''[[FarmVille|Farmville]]'', into ''Super Mario Run''<nowiki/>'s third gameplay mode.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Odyssey'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Odyssey}}\nReleased on October 27, 2017 for [[Nintendo Switch]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Mario Odyssey|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/Super-Mario-Odyssey-1173332.html|website=Nintendo UK|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}</ref> ''Super Mario Odyssey'' is a return to the open-world \"sandbox\" 3D style of game last seen in ''Super Mario Sunshine''. After Mario's cap is possessed by a spirit named Cappy, he is able to use it to temporarily \"capture\" enemies, harmless life forms and objects and utilize their powers. Like previous sandbox 3D games, the game's worlds contain a large variety of objectives that can be achieved in a non-linear order before progressing. ''Super Mario Odyssey'' was critically acclaimed, and earned multiple awards. This game adventures through many different kingdoms, in addition to the standard Mushroom Kingdom Mario's adventures usually take place in ; and is the very first one to include a vocal theme song, \"Jump Up, Super Star!\".\n\n=== ''Super Mario Maker 2'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Maker 2}}\nOn February 13, 2019 during a Nintendo Direct presentation, ''Super Mario Maker 2'' was announced. ''Super Mario Maker 2'' is very similar in design to its predecessor, ''Super Mario Maker''. It introduced many new items, themes, and enemies, as well as an online multiplayer mode. The game was released on June 28, 2019 for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n== Remakes ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title\n! System\n! Year\n!

Power-up use is integral to the series. The series has installments featuring both two and three-dimensional gameplay.\nIn the [[2D computer graphics|2D]] games, the [[player character]] (usually Mario) jumps on platforms and enemies while avoiding their attacks and moving to the right of the scrolling screen. 2D ''Super Mario'' game levels have single-exit objectives, which must be reached within a time limit and lead to the next sequential level.

When hit by an enemy, Mario reverts to his smaller size instead of losing a life.<ref name=\"SuperMushroom\" /> When Mario is in his \"Super\" form, most blocks that would contain a Super Mushroom instead offer a more powerful power-up such as the Fire Flower. The Super Mushroom is similar in appearance to the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', with an ivory stalk below a most commonly red and white (originally red and orange) spotted cap. Created by chance, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] stated in an interview that beta tests of ''Super Mario Bros.'' proved Mario too tall, so the development team implemented mushrooms to grow and shrink Mario.<ref name=\"worldrecord\">{{cite web | author = O'Connell, Patricia | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_45/b3958127.htm | title = Meet Mario's Papa | publisher = BusinessWeek online | date = November 7, 2005 | accessdate =November 26, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Poison Mushroom'', first introduced in the Japanese ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', is a mushroom that causes damage when touched. In later games, the Poison Mushroom looks almost exactly like the Super Mushroom with a red cap but has a meaner-looking face.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe ''Mini Mushroom'' is a small blue mushroom, a recurring item in the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series, which shrinks Mario into miniature size, allowing him access areas and pipes that Mario normally cannot reach. Mini Mario also jumps higher, floats midair, bounces off enemies without hurting them except by ground pounding, and can run across the surface of the water and then jump from it as if he was on land. Mario is more vulnerable in this form and loses a life upon receiving one hit in miniature form. The Mini Mushroom in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' allows Mario to run up walls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5942967/its-impossible-to-hate-the-new-new-super-mario-bros-u|title=It's Impossible to Hate the New New Super Mario Bros. U|work=Kotaku|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Mega Mushroom'', introduced in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and further appearing in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is a more recent addition to the series that grows Mario into a towering, invulnerable giant who destroys enemies and the environment by running through them. It has an orange-yellow cap with red spots, like the ''Super Mario Bros.'' Super Mushroom, but with an inflated cap. ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'' features an item simply called \"Mushroom\"<ref name=\"Super Mario 64 DS Instruction Booklet\">{{ cite book | date=2005 | title=Super Mario 64 DS Instruction Booklet (PAL version) | publisher=Nintendo }}</ref> that grants the same abilities as the Mega Mushroom.\n\nIn the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' franchise, the Bee Mushroom gives Mario the Bee Suit, and the Spring Mushroom puts Mario inside a metallic coil. The Mystery Mushroom in ''Super Mario Maker'' (though not in its [[Super Mario Maker 2|2019 sequel]]) provides a \"costume\" based on one of many characters in addition to the abilities of the Super Mushroom.\n\n===== 1-Ups =====\nThe ''[[1-Up]]'' is a common item shown as a green and white mushroom that gives Mario an [[extra life]]. The 1-Up was introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'', sometimes hidden in invisible item blocks, and displayed as having an orange cap with green spots. In ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Land 2]]'', the 1-Up is shown as a heart. 1-Ups can take other forms, such as the 3-Up Moon from ''Super Mario World'' and ''New Super Mario Bros. U''.\n\n==== Projectile flowers ====\nThe flower power-ups let Mario shoot projectiles. The Fire Flower, introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'', transforms Mario into Fire Mario, who can throw bouncing fireballs at enemies. ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' was the first 3D Mario platformer game to have the Fire Flower. In ''Super Mario Land'' and ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]'', the Superball is a [[bouncing ball]] obtained from a Super Flower, which Mario can use to defeat enemies and collect coins. The Ice Flower transforms Mario into Ice Mario, where he can shoot balls of ice as projectiles similar to that of the Fire Flower; it freezes enemies in a block of ice, to be used as platforms or as thrown projectiles, as seen in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]''.<ref name=\"nsmbw\" /> In ''Super Mario Galaxy'', the Ice Flower turns Mario into ice and lets him walk on lava or water for a limited time by freezing the surface. Lastly, ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]''{{'}}s Gold Flower lets Mario turn bricks into coins and earn bonus coins for defeating enemies.\n\n==== Invincibility ====\nInvincibility is an effect first appearing in the three ''Super Mario Bros.'' games, where it is granted by a \"Starman\",<ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario'' manual|url=http://legendsoflocalization.com/media/super-mario-bros/manuals/Super-Mario-Bros-Manual-US.pdf|accessdate=January 12, 2017|website=legendsoflocalization}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario Bros. 2'' Manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_NES/Manual/formated/Super_Mario_Bros._2_-_1986_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario Bros. 3'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//media/system/nintendo_nes/manual/formated/super_mario_bros._3_-_1990_-_nintendo.pdf|accessdate=January 12, 2017|website=gamesdatabase|date=1990}}</ref> an anthropomorphized, flashing star. The star has also been named the \"Super Star\" in the two ''Super Mario World'' games<ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario World'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES/manual/Formated/Super_Mario_World_-_1991_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES/Manual/formated/Super_Mario_World_2-_Yoshi-s_Island_-_1995_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1995}}</ref> and the \"Rainbow Star\" in the two ''Super Mario Galaxy'' games. Picking up the star makes Mario temporarily [[Glossary of video game terms#God mode|invincible]], able to resist any harm. Use of the item is accompanied by a distinctive music track that appears consistently across most of the games. The player character flickers a variety of colors \u2014 and in some titles, moves with increased speed and enhanced jumping ability \u2014 while under the Star's influence. While invincible, Mario kills any enemy upon contact with it. In ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', the star gives the normally immobile baby Mario the ability to run as well as become invincible. In ''Super Mario 64'', invincibility is provided when Mario wears the metal cap or the vanish cap. The Mega Mushroom provides temporary invincibility with the addition of giant size and environment destruction (see [[Super Mario#Mushrooms|Mushrooms]]).\n\n==== Power Stars and course tokens ====\nThe games often feature [[collectible]]s found in levels in order to progress in the overworld, most frequently with the visual motif of a star. They are typically situated in locations that are not readily found or reached, or awarded for completing stunts, or objectives given by [[Non-player character|NPCs]]. They include the Power Stars in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' games, Shine Sprites in ''Super Mario Sunshine'', Star Coins in the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series and ''Super Mario 3D Land'', Green Stars in the ''Galaxy'' games and ''Super Mario 3D World'', and Power Moons in ''Super Mario Odyssey''. In ''Super Mario Land 2'', there are six Golden Coin tokens that must be collected to finish the game.\n\n==== Flying ====\nFlight is a common theme throughout the series, first enabled with the [[magic carpet]] item in the international ''Super Mario Bros. 2''. The Super Leaf and Tanooki Suit items, first appearing in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' provide Mario with an animal-suited tail, which in turn acts as a flight propeller. The Tanooki Suit returns in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'', and the Super Leaf returns in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and the ''Super Mario Maker'' series. In the ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' series and ''Super Mario Maker'' series, the Propeller Block and the Propeller Mushroom let Mario spin up into the air and slowly descend. In ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', Mario pilots a yellow airplane with unlimited ammunition called the Sky Pop. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduces various forms of flight: the feather item provides a cape, the P Balloon puffs Mario into a floating balloon figure, and Yoshi can carry a blue Koopa shell which gives him wings. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', flight that is granted by a Winged Cap. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', Mario has limited flight provided by the Propeller Cap.  In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', Mario has limited flight and gliding capabilities in a Flying Squirrel suit and can also command a pink Baby Yoshi to puff up into the form of a floating balloon. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Mario can obtain a special red star that transforms him into Flying Mario for a limited time. [[Lakitu]]'s cloud can be commandeered in several of the side-scrolling games.\n\n==== Power-up suits ====\nSeveral suits work as power-ups, many of which are based on animals.  Debuting in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', the Raccoon Suit (provisioned by a Super Leaf) and the Tanooki Suit each provide Mario with a tail which acts as a flight propeller.  In addition, the Tanooki Suit lets Mario spontaneously change into an invincible statue for about five seconds. In ''Super Mario 3D Land'', the Raccoon Suit reappears and is accompanied by a silver-colored variation called a Statue Leaf.<ref name=GT>{{cite web| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = May 21, 2010| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/review-super-mario/100404| accessdate =May 22, 2010}}</ref> ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' includes a [[Hammer Bros.]] suit, which allows Mario to throw hammers as projectiles, to defeat enemies at a distance, taking what the Hammer Bros does to Mario and turning it around. While wearing the suit and ducking, Mario is invulnerable to fire attacks. The Hammer Suit was so powerful that in later games, it was downgraded. ''Super Mario 3D Land'' features a \"Boomerang Suit\" which provisions long-distance boomerang projectiles. Other animal suits include the Frog Suit, Tanooki Suit, Penguin Suit, Cat Suit and Bee Suit.\n\n==== Coins ====\n''Super Mario'' level design traditionally incorporates many distributed coins as puzzles and rewards.  Most ''Super Mario'' games award the player an extra life once a certain amount of yellow coins are collected, commonly 50 or 100.  Several coin variants exist, such as silver coins, dragon coins, star coins, and more.\n\nIn ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', coins replenish health (and air, when Mario is underwater). In ''Super Mario 64'' and ''Super Mario Sunshine'', collecting 100 coins in a level results in a Power Star or Shine Sprite respectively. There are also stages in that game reward a Power Star for collecting eight red coins in a level, worth two normal coins each. In ''Super Mario 64'', a blue coin is worth five normal coins. In ''Super Mario Sunshine'', blue coins act as a side quest when brought to the Delfino Bank.\n\nIn the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' series, after finishing each game once, stages unlock where Mario can collect 100 purple coins to earn a Power Star. In ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'', they can also be used to feed some hungry \"Luma\" characters that can turn into either an item or another planet.\n\n=== Luigi and other playable characters ===\n\nThe series often features the option to play as other characters, Luigi in the most instances. Earlier games have offered an alternating multiplayer mode in which the second player controls Luigi on their turn. Luigi is often only playable by player one in a second, more challenging iteration of the base game, such as in ''The Lost Levels'', ''Galaxy 2'', ''New Super Luigi U'' and the special worlds in ''3D Land''; these feature lower gravity and reduced friction for Luigi. Later games allow four player simultaneous play. Playable characters other than Mario and Luigi have included Toads, Peach, Rosalina, [[Mii|Miis]] and Nabbit. Characters are sometimes differentiated by special abilities. ''Super Mario Maker'' (though not ''Super Mario Maker 2'') includes costumes that depict many more characters.\n\n=== Warp Pipes and Warp Cannons ===\n{{See also|Warp (gaming)}}\nThe Warp Pipe is a common method of transportation used in many of the ''Mario'' series games. Warp Pipes are most often green but also appear in other colors (early games included silver pipes, newer games have introduced red, green, blue and yellow pipes), and have many uses in the series. Warp Pipes can also contain enemies, usually Piranha Plants, and sometimes launch the player into the air (most commonly seen in the ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' series). In early ''Mario'' games such as ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', special, well-hidden areas known as [[Warp Zone]]s contain pipes that allow players to skip several worlds (handfuls of levels) at once.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cuddy |first1=Luke |date= August 2013|title=The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy: I Link Therefore I Am |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_UefdMONDLIC&dq=cucco+legend+of+zelda |publisher= Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9691-2 |accessdate=November 16, 2014}}</ref> In the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series, pipe-shaped Warp Cannons work similarly to the Warp Zones of the earlier games and are unlocked by finding secret exits in levels. [[Cannons]] appear in most of the 3D games in the series starting with ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. Mario uses the cannon by jumping into the barrel, aiming himself and being fired at a distant target. This allows Mario to progress through a level or reach otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\n=== Yoshi ===\nMario's dinosaur friend [[Yoshi]] has appeared as a mount to the player character in several ''Super Mario'' games since ''[[Super Mario World]]''. In the sequel, ''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'', a tribe of Yoshis finds Mario and helps him to save Baby Luigi. In this game and ''Super Mario 64 DS'', instead of the player merely riding on Yoshi's back, Yoshi is the player character. Yoshis generally have abilities including eating enemies, flying, and breathing fire. Miyamoto had originally wished for Mario to be able to ride a dinosaur in ''Super Mario Bros.'', but this wasn't possible due to the technical restraints of the system.\n\n== Settings ==\n* The {{nihongo foot|'''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u738b\u56fd|Kinoko \u014ckoku|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the primary ''Super Mario'' series setting, having been introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'' The Mushroom Kingdom is also the setting for the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' games, ''Super Mario 3D Land'' and ''Super Mario Run''. It is a monarchy and its heir is [[Princess Peach]]. Though Princess Peach, Mario and Luigi are human, most citizens of this area are the mushroom-like [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toads]]. While the main characters of the series reside in the Mushroom Kingdom, their adventures have extended to other settings.\n* ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' introduced '''Subcon''', a mysterious world issued from Mario's dream. It was taken over by the frog king [[Wart (character)|Wart]].\n* ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' is set in the '''Mushroom World''', a collection of eight kingdoms. Seven of these are \"Mushroom Kingdoms\", ruled by their own kings. The different kingdoms are Grass Land (a plains kingdom), Desert Land (a desert kingdom), Water Land (an ocean kingdom), Giant Land (a kingdom where everything is larger), Sky Land (a kingdom which consists of a peninsula at ground level, and a large plain amidst the sky), Ice Land (an arctic kingdom), and Pipe Land (a small island kingdom filled with a maze of Warp Pipes). The eighth world is Dark Land and is ruled by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]: King of the Koopas. The instruction manual for the game states that the Mushroom Kingdom is a gateway to the Mushroom World.\n* ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' takes place in '''Sarasaland'''. It is ruled by [[Princess Daisy]]. The species in Sarasaland are range from [[tiki]] monsters to aliens to gigantic [[sphinx]]es, as well as enemies similar to enemies from other games in the series. The kingdoms that make up Sarasaland include Birabuto (an [[Ancient Egypt]]-like kingdom), Muda (an ocean kingdom), Easton (an [[Easter Island]]-like kingdom), and Chai (an Ancient [[China]]-like kingdom).\n* ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduced '''Dinosaur Land''', a separate continent where Mario, Luigi, and Princess Toadstool vacation after the events of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.<ref>Super Mario World instruction manual</ref> '''Yoshi's Island''', the setting of ''[[Yoshi's Island|Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', is located within Dinosaur Land. The other areas consist of Donut Plains, Vanilla Dome, Twin Bridges, Forest of Illusion, Chocolate Island, Valley of Bowser, Star World, and the Special Zone.\n* ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'' introduced '''Mario Land''', a region which apparently belongs to Mario.\n* ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' introduced '''Peach's Castle''', which serves as a [[overworld|hub world]]. The worlds in the game are reached by jumping into paintings, which are portals to imaginary worlds created by Bowser. As such, the game is largely not set in the Mushroom Kingdom. However, Peach's Castle itself is located in the Mushroom Kingdom as shown in games like ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its sequel.\n* ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' introduced '''Isle Delfino''', a tropical island somewhere outside the Mushroom Kingdom. It contains several harbors, beaches, hotels, parks, and villages. Instead of Toads or humans, most of the residents on Isle Delfino are tropical creatures called Nokis and Piantas. Its main village Delfino Plaza serves as the central hub world in ''Super Mario Sunshine''. Different areas of the island can be accessed through portals created by spray paint in different parts of the plaza. Besides Delfino Plaza, the different locations of Delfino Island are Delfino Airstrip, Bianco Hills, Ricco Harbor, Gelato Beach, Pinna Park, Sirena Beach, Noki Bay, Pianta Village, and Corona Mountain. While Isle Delfino has only appeared in one game in the ''Super Mario'' series, it has been commonly used in ''Mario'' spin-off games, especially the [[Mario Kart|''Mario Kart'' series]].\n* ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'' are set in outer space and contain various galaxies and planets.\n* ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' takes place in the '''Sprixie Kingdom''', where the Sprixies live.\n* ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' has Mario traveling across the globe in a hat-shaped airship called the Odyssey; thus, several new regions known as \"kingdoms\" are introduced in the game, including a New York-inspired urban area called the '''Metro Kingdom''', a dry desert land called the '''Sand Kingdom''', and a food-filled world called the '''Luncheon Kingdom'''.\n\n== Development and history ==\n{{See also|Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong Jr.|Mario Bros.|Super Mario Bros}}\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2013}}\nMuch of the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' music and sound effects have become iconic to the series and incorporated into modern games. The original [[Super Mario Bros. theme]], composed by [[Koji Kondo]], has become one of the most well known video game themes around the world.<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web |title=GDC 2007: Mario Maestro Shares His Secrets |url=http://www.1up.com/news/gdc-2007-mario-maestro-shares |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |access-date=February 16, 2009 |date=March 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710232628/http://www.1up.com/news/gdc-2007-mario-maestro-shares |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The theme from the underwater levels of ''Super Mario Bros.'' frequently appears as [[title screen]] music in the series, including in ''Super Mario Sunshine'', the main intros and titles of all four ''Super Mario Advance'' titles, and the ''Super Mario All-Stars'' versions of the four NES games.\n\n== Reception ==\n<!-- WARNING - Only include original title.

''Odyssey'' was praised for successfully reviving the sandbox-style gameplay last seen in ''Super Mario 64'' and ''Sunshine'' and its introduction of the \"capture\" mechanic. [[GameRankings]], a website that aggregates game scores and rankings from well-established video game critics, gave ''Super Mario Galaxy'' an aggregate ranking of 97.64%,<ref name=\"odyssey\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/wii/915692-super-mario-galaxy/index.html |title=''Super Mario Galaxy'' Reviews |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=April 16, 2014}}</ref> making it the best-ranked game on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html |title=Reviews and News Articles |publisher=GameRankings |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n''Super Mario 3D Land'' was also highly commercially and critically successful, being the third-best-selling game for the Nintendo 3DS. Its sequel, ''Super Mario 3D World'', received similar critical praise and is among the Wii U's best-selling titles.\n\n=== Sales ===\nGames in the ''Super Mario'' series have had consistently strong sales. ''Super Mario Bros.'' is the second best-selling single video game (second to ''[[Wii Sports]]''), with 40.23 million units sold. It is also the best-selling [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console title, with its two sequels, ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' (18 million copies) and ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' (10 million copies), ranking in second and third place respectively.<ref name=\"ownt\" /> ''[[Super Mario World]]'' is the best-selling game for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] console, selling 20 million copies. ''Super Mario World'' is also the seventh best-selling game of all time. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' sold the most copies for the [[Nintendo 64]] (11 million), whereas ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' is the second best-selling game (5.5 million) on the [[GameCube]] (second to ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]''). ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' has sold 12.79 million units {{as of|2018|3|lc=y}}, which was the best-selling 3D title in the series until 2019, and is the ninth best-selling game for the [[Wii]].<ref name=\"WiiSales\"/> Its sequel ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'' has sold 7.41 million units, placing in twelfth.<ref name=\"supermariobestselling\"/> ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' has sold 16.59 million units as of December 2019, making it the best-selling 3D title in the series to date, and among the [[List of best-selling Nintendo Switch video games|best-selling games for the]] [[Nintendo Switch]].<ref name=\"SwitchSales\"/> ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' has sold 30.26 million copies worldwide, the fourth best-selling game on the Wii, as well as one of the best-selling video games of all time.<ref name=\"WiiSales\"/>\n\nThe ''Super Mario'' series also sold well on handheld consoles. ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' has sold 18.14 million copies, and is the fourth best-selling game for the [[Game Boy]]. Its sequel, ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'', sold 2.7 million copies, placing sixth. ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] sold 30.79 million units, making it the best-selling game for the console, and the best-selling portable entry.\n\nFor all console and handheld games that have not been bundled with a console, ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' is the fourth best-selling game, whereas ''New Super Mario Bros.'' is fifth, ''Super Mario Land'' is eleventh, and ''Super Mario 64'' is eighteenth.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links | wikt=no | c=Category:Mario_(video game series) | v=no | q=Super Mario Bros. | s=no | b=no | n =no | display=''Super Mario''}}\n*  {{Official website|mario.nintendo.com}}\n\n{{Super Mario}}\n{{Mario franchise}}\n{{Main franchises by Nintendo}}\n{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n[[Category:Mario video games]]\n[[Category:Super Mario| ]]\n[[Category:Nintendo franchises]]\n[[Category:Mario platform games]]\n[[Category:Video games about size change]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:Video games produced by Shigeru Miyamoto]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the platform video game series|the character|Mario|the entire media franchise as a whole|Mario (franchise)|other uses of \"Super Mario\"|Super Mario (disambiguation)}}\n{{Short description|platform video game series from Nintendo's Mario franchise}}\n<!-- Please DO NOT add Super Mario Bros.

He is often joined by his brother, [[Luigi]], and occasionally by other members of the ''Mario'' cast. As in platform video games, the player runs and jumps across platforms and atop enemies in themed [[level (video gaming)|levels]]. The games have simple plots, typically with Mario [[Damsel in distress|rescuing the kidnapped]] [[Princess Peach]] from the primary [[antagonist]], [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. The first title in the series, ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1985, established gameplay concepts and elements prevalent in nearly every ''Super Mario'' game released since.  These include a multitude of [[power-up]]s and [[item (gaming)|items]] that give Mario special powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing into both giant and miniature sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/5710212/nintendos-revised-history-of-super-mario-bros|title=Nintendo's Revised History Of Super Mario Bros.|first=Michael|last=McWhertor}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Super Mario'' series is part of the greater ''Mario'' franchise.

It established many core ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' gameplay concepts. The brothers Mario and Luigi live in the Mushroom Kingdom, where they must rescue Princess Toadstool (later called Princess Peach) from Bowser/King Koopa. The game consists of eight [[Level (video games)|worlds]] of four levels each, totaling 32 levels altogether. Though the worlds differ in themes, the fourth level is always a fortress or castle that ends with a fight against [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] (or one of his minions disguised as him).<ref name=\"TMKTheBad\">{{cite web |url= http://themushroomkingdom.net/smb_breakdown.shtml#bad |title=The Bad |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |work=TMK Super Mario Bros.

It uses the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' engine, with additions such as weather, character movements, and more complex levels, altogether yielding a much higher difficulty. The game follows the same style of level progression as ''Super Mario Bros.'', with eight initial worlds of four levels each. The last level of the eight worlds is a [[lava]]-filled castle that culminates in a battle against Bowser. At that time, this sequel was not released outside Japan since Nintendo of America did not want the Mario series to be known to players outside of Japan for frustrating difficulty. It remained inaccessible to a steadily broadening market of American video game players, becoming stylistically outdated by the time the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' could be eventually delivered to America.<ref name=\"History of SMB at IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/14/ign-presents-the-history-of-super-mario-bros|title=IGN Presents The History of Super Mario Bros.|last=McLaughlin|first=Rus| publisher=IGN | date=September 14, 2010 | accessdate=April 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe game later debuted outside Japan in 1993 as \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\" in the compilation cartridge titled ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES). The original [[Famicom]] version was released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service in September 2007, listed as \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\" outside Japan. A later ''Super Mario All-Stars'' Wii [[Porting#Porting in gaming|port]], titled ''[[Super Mario All-Stars#25th Anniversary Edition|Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Edition]]'', features the SNES gameplay and adds [[Wii Remote]], [[Classic Controller]], and [[GameCube]] controller compatibility.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Bros. 2}}\nIn ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' (''Super Mario USA'' in Japan), Mario and his companions are out to stop the evil frog [[Wart (Nintendo)|Wart]] in the Subcon dreamland.

This is also the first ''Super Mario'' game to use a life meter, which allows Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad to be hit up to four times before dying. Mushrooms count for two lives, and coins are used for inter-level [[slot machine]] minigame.<ref name=\"History of SMB at IGN\" />\n\n=== ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Bros. 3}}\n''Super Mario Bros. 3'' is divided into eight themed worlds, each with 6\u201310 levels and several bonus stages displayed as locations on a mapped [[overworld]]. These locations are not necessarily in a linear order, and the player is occasionally permitted to skip levels or play the game out of order. Completed levels cannot be replayed. A world's final level is a [[boss stage]]. The penultimate boss stage is a side-scrolling level atop an [[airship]] (\"Doom Ship\") with a fight against one of Bowser's seven [[Koopalings]]. The game introduced a diverse array of new power-ups, including flight as Raccoon Mario or the level-long ''P-Wing'' allowing permanent flight through a whole level. Bowser is again the final boss.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Land'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Land}}\n''Super Mario Land'' was the first handheld ''Super Mario'' title after the Game & Watch port of ''Super Mario Bros.'', and was released for the [[Game Boy]]. As with other games in the series, it is a sidescrolling platformer in which Mario sets out to save [[Princess Daisy]] by defeating a mysterious spaceman named [[Tatanga]]. Power-ups include hearts, which gives Mario an extra life (similar to a 1-up mushroom) and small bouncing ball which Mario throws referred to as \"superballs\". The game consists of twelve levels split across four worlds.\n\n=== ''Super Mario World'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario World}}\n''Super Mario World'' was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and consists of nine worlds displayed via a world map overworld. Unlike ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', where each world map is individual, the world map here is unique and covers the whole game. Most of the 72 levels have one exit, though some have hidden second exits. Mario's new moves include a spin jump and the rideable [[Yoshi]] who can eat enemies and either swallow or spit them out. Power-ups include the returning Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star, and the new Cape Feather, based on ''Super Mario Bros. 3'''s Super Leaf, which lets Mario and Luigi fly with a cape. The game was followed by the prequel ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', which is also considered the first game in the [[Yoshi series]].\n\n=== ''Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins}}\n''Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins'' introduces Mario's rival, [[Wario]], who had taken over Mario's castle during the events of ''Super Mario Land'' and forces Mario to collect the six golden coins in order to reenter and reclaim his castle. While its predecessor is similar to the original ''Super Mario Bros.'', ''Super Mario Land 2'' has more in common with later games. The player is no longer restricted to only moving towards the right. A bell at each level's end activates a [[minigame]], where the player can try to get [[1-Up|extra lives]]. There are 32 levels, based on several themed worlds each with its own boss. Three power-ups return: the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Super Star. The game introduces the Carrot power-up, which gives Mario large rabbit ears that let him glide when falling for a limited time. Its story was continued in ''[[Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3]]'', which retroactively became the first of a spin-off series, ''[[Wario (series)#Wario Land series|Wario Land]]''.\n\n=== ''Super Mario 64'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario 64}}\n''Super Mario 64'' was the first [[3D computer graphics|3D]] and [[open world]] game in the series, and a [[launch game|launch title]] for the [[Nintendo 64]] home console. Each level is an enclosed environment where the player is free to explore in all directions without time limits. The player collects Power Stars that appear after completing tasks to unlock later courses and areas.<ref name=\"NP88\">{{Cite journal| date=September 1996 | title= Full Coverage&nbsp;\u2014 Super Mario 64| journal= [[Nintendo Power]]| publisher= [[Nintendo]]| issue= 88| pages= 14\u201323}}</ref> The Nintendo 64's [[analog stick]] makes an extensive repertoire of precise movements in all directions possible. The game introduced moves such as punching, triple jumping, and using a Wing Cap to fly. It is the first ''Super Mario'' series game to feature [[Charles Martinet]]'s voice acting for Mario. Mario must once again save Princess Peach from Bowser, and collect up to 120 Power Stars from the paintings and return them to her castle, the overworld. There are a total of 105 Power Stars in the paintings, with 15 hidden in the castle. The game's power-ups differ from previous games, now being three different hats with temporary powers: the Wing Cap, allowing Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, turning him into metal; and the Vanish Cap, allowing him to walk through obstacles.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Sunshine'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Sunshine}}\n''Super Mario Sunshine'', the second 3D ''Super Mario'' title. It was released in 2002 for the [[GameCube]]. In it, Mario and Peach travel to Isle Delfino for a vacation when a Mario [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], going by the name of [[Shadow Mario]], appears and vandalizes the entire island. Mario is sentenced to clean the island with a water-squirting accessory called F.L.U.D.D. ''Super Mario Sunshine'' shares many similar gameplay elements with its predecessor ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', yet introduces moves, like spinning while jumping, and several other actions through the use of F.L.U.D.D. The game contains a number of independent levels, which can be reached from the hub, Delfino Plaza. Mario collects Shine Sprites by completing tasks in the levels, which in return unlock levels in Delfino Plaza by way of abilities and plot-related events.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamingworldx.com/gcn/SuperMarioSunshineJPN.shtml |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070716082934/http://www.gamingworldx.com/gcn/SuperMarioSunshineJPN.shtml|archivedate=July 16, 2007|title=Super Mario Sunshine (JPN) Review|publisher=GamingWorld X|author=Mackie, Joe|accessdate=November 22, 2007}}</ref> ''Sunshine'' introduces the last of Bowser's eight children, [[Bowser Jr.]] , as an antagonist. Yoshi also appears again for Mario to ride in certain sections.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros.'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros.}}\n''New Super Mario Bros.'' was released on the [[Nintendo DS]] in 2006. In it, Mario and Luigi set out to save Princess Peach from [[Bowser Jr]]. The gameplay is 2D, but most of the characters and objects are 3D on [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] backgrounds, resulting in a [[2.5D]] effect. The game uses an overworld map similar to those of ''Super Mario Bros. Deluxe''. Some levels have multiple exits. The classic power-ups (Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star) return alongside the Mega Mushroom, Blue Shell, and Mini Mushroom. The Mega Mushroom briefly turns Mario (or Luigi) into an invincible giant that destroys everything in his path, enemies as pipes and blocks. The Blue Shell protects Mario from harm and allows him to slide (depending on speed), where the Mini Mushroom shrinks Mario to a much smaller size, allowing him to fit through tight spaces and access places normally unreachable.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Galaxy'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Galaxy}}\n''Super Mario Galaxy'' was launched in 2007 for the [[Wii]]. It is set in [[outer space]], where [[Mario]] travels between \"[[Galaxy|galaxies]]\" to collect Power Stars, earned by completing quests or defeating enemies. Each galaxy contains a number of [[planet]]s and other space objects for the player to explore. The game's physics system gives each celestial object its own [[Gravitation|gravitational force]], which lets the player circumnavigate rounded or irregular planetoids by walking sideways or upside down. The player is usually able to jump from one independent object and fall towards another close object. Though the main gameplay and physics are in [[3D computer graphics|3D]], there are several points in the game where the player's movements are restricted into a 2D axis. Several new power-ups appear following the new game mechanics, and many of these return in its sequel, ''Super Mario Galaxy 2''.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. Wii}}\nIn ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'', Princess Peach is captured by Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings during her birthday party in her castle, and Mario, Luigi, and two Toads (blue and yellow) spring into action to save her. The game features 4-player co-op and new power-ups: the Propeller Mushroom, the Ice Flower, and the Penguin Suit. The Propeller Mushroom allows the player to launch its character high into the air through shaking the [[Wii Remote]]. The Penguin Suit enhances sliding traction, speed and agility of swimming abilities, in addition to the ice ball projectiles that are provisioned by the Ice Flower. All characters can ride [[Yoshi]]. The levels are organised into individually themed open-worlds reminiscent of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. Like in its predecessor, there are three hidden Star Coins to find in each level, which can be used to unlock movies with gameplay tips. It was released in November 2009 to an important commercial success, and won several awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/objects/143/14354229.html |title=IGN: New Super Mario Bros.

It retains the basic premise of its predecessor and includes its items and power-ups. These include the Cloud Flower, which allows Mario to create platforms in mid-air, and the Rock Mushroom, which turns Mario into a rolling boulder. Mario can also ride Yoshi along. It was released to widespread critical acclaim.\n\n=== ''Super Mario 3D Land'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario 3D Land}}\n''Super Mario 3D Land'' was released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in November and December 2011. It is the first original 3D ''Super Mario'' game on a handheld console, since all previous games were either 2D or re-edits of former games. As an attempt to translate the gameplay of the 2D games into a 3D environment, it tried to simplify the control scheme of the 3D games through using more linear levels. It also brought back several older gameplay features, including the Super Leaf power-up last seen in ''Super Mario Bros. 3''. This game was released to critical acclaim.\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. 2'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. 2}}\n''New Super Mario Bros. 2'', the direct sequel of ''New Super Mario Bros.'' for the DS, was released in July and August 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS. The player, as Mario or Luigi, tries to save Princess Peach from Bowser and the Koopalings, with the game's secondary goal  to collect one million coins. Several gameplay elements were introduced to help achieve this goal, such as the Gold Flower, a rarer variant of the Fire Flower that turns items into coins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5903941/new-super-mario-bros-2-hits-japan-3dses-this-august/|title=New Super Mario Bros. 2 Hits 3DSes This August|work=Kotaku|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tinycartridge.com/post/25460539710/new-super-mario-bros-2-artwork-featuring-smb|title=New Super Mario Bros. 2 artwork, featuring SMB|work=Tiny Cartridge 3DS|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== ''New Super Mario Bros. U'' ===\n{{Main|New Super Mario Bros. U}}\n''New Super Mario Bros. U'', the [[Wii U]] follow-up to ''New Super Mario Bros. Wii'', was released in November 2012, in North America. It plays similarly to the previous ''New Super Mario Bros.'' titles, and introduces both a Flying Squirrel suit that lets the players glide through the air, and [[asymmetric gameplay]] that allows the player holding the [[Wii U GamePad|GamePad]] to influence the environment. On June 20, 2013, ''[[New Super Luigi U]]'' was released as a downloadable content (DLC) package for the game, featuring shorter but more difficult levels, starring Luigi as the main protagonist instead of his brother. Subsequently released as a standalone retail game on August 25, 2013, in North America.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kubba |first=Sinan |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/05/17/super-luigi/ |title=Super Luigi U arrives as DLC June 20, packaged standalone August 25 |publisher=Joystiq |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> Unlike the downloadable content version, the standalone retail version of ''New Super Luigi U'' does not require having ''New Super Mario Bros.

Like ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', it features Princess Peach and Toad as playable characters in addition to Mario and Luigi. Rosalina from ''Super Mario Galaxy'' is also unlocked later in the game.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Maker'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Maker}}\n''Super Mario Maker'' is a creation tool released for the Wii U in September 2015<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Mario Maker Release Date Announced at E3 2015|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-maker-release-date-announced-at-e3-201/1100-6428205/|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}</ref> which allows players to create their own levels based on the gameplay and style of ''Super Mario Bros.'', ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', ''Super Mario World'', and ''New Super Mario Bros. U'', as well as to share their creations online. Based on existing games, several gameplay mechanics were introduced for the game, with existing ones also available to be used together in new ways. A Nintendo 3DS version of the game called ''Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS'', was released in December 2016. It features a few new pre-installed levels, but no online level sharing.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Run'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Run}}\n''Super Mario Run'' is a side-scrolling and [[Endless running game|auto-scrolling]] video game released in December 2016 on the [[iOS]] platform, then in March 2017 on [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. It is the first official ''Mario'' game developed for non-Nintendo hardware (since previous attempts all faced cancellation) , as well as the first official Super Mario game developed for [[mobile game|mobile devices]]. As such, it features simplified controls that allow it to be played with only one hand.\n\nIn this game, Mario runs automatically, and the player's in charge of controlling the jumping action so that Mario avoids all hazards. This is achieved by touching the tactile screens these devices are built with, and the longer the player touches the jump button, the higher Mario jumps. Collecting all coins in a precise level unlocks a set of 5 pink coins in said level for Mario (the player) to collect, allowing extended replayability. Collecting these 5 coins unlocks another set of 5 purple coins, which upon collecting unlocks another set of 5 coins, black this time and much harder to collect. This further multiplies the game's length, through requiring the player to beat a single level 4 times to fully complete it.\n\nThis game also includes a \"Toad Rally\" mode, quite similar to the \"VS Boo\" mode of ''Super Mario Bros Deluxe'', in which players have to complete a level faster than a computer-controlled Toad. Success in this mode earns the player access to in-game money to spend in customization options for it to create its own \"Mushroom Kingdom\" map, using mechanics similar to ''[[FarmVille|Farmville]]'', into ''Super Mario Run''<nowiki/>'s third gameplay mode.\n\n=== ''Super Mario Odyssey'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Odyssey}}\nReleased on October 27, 2017 for [[Nintendo Switch]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Mario Odyssey|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/Super-Mario-Odyssey-1173332.html|website=Nintendo UK|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}</ref> ''Super Mario Odyssey'' is a return to the open-world \"sandbox\" 3D style of game last seen in ''Super Mario Sunshine''. After Mario's cap is possessed by a spirit named Cappy, he is able to use it to temporarily \"capture\" enemies, harmless life forms and objects and utilize their powers. Like previous sandbox 3D games, the game's worlds contain a large variety of objectives that can be achieved in a non-linear order before progressing. ''Super Mario Odyssey'' was critically acclaimed, and earned multiple awards. This game adventures through many different kingdoms, in addition to the standard Mushroom Kingdom Mario's adventures usually take place in ; and is the very first one to include a vocal theme song, \"Jump Up, Super Star!\".\n\n=== ''Super Mario Maker 2'' ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Maker 2}}\nOn February 13, 2019 during a Nintendo Direct presentation, ''Super Mario Maker 2'' was announced. ''Super Mario Maker 2'' is very similar in design to its predecessor, ''Super Mario Maker''. It introduced many new items, themes, and enemies, as well as an online multiplayer mode. The game was released on June 28, 2019 for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n== Remakes ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Title\n! System\n! Year\n!

Power-up use is integral to the series. The series has installments featuring both two and three-dimensional gameplay.\nIn the [[2D computer graphics|2D]] games, the [[player character]] (usually Mario) jumps on platforms and enemies while avoiding their attacks and moving to the right of the scrolling screen. 2D ''Super Mario'' game levels have single-exit objectives, which must be reached within a time limit and lead to the next sequential level. ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' introduced the [[overworld]], a map of nonlinear levels that branches according to the player's choice.<ref name=\"NP-10-Preview\">{{Cite journal| journal = [[Nintendo Power]]| title = Previews: ''Super Mario Bros. 3''| author= Nintendo Power Staff| issue = 10| date=January\u2013February 1990 | pages = 56\u201359| publisher = [[Nintendo]]}}</ref> ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduced levels with multiple exits.\n\n3D installments in the series have had two subgenres: [[open world]] exploration based games and more linear 3D games with a predetermined path.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Osborn|first1=Alex|title=Miyamoto Offers a Few New Super Mario Odyssey Details|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/13/miyamoto-offers-a-few-new-super-mario-odyssey-details|accessdate=January 15, 2017|work=IGN|date=January 13, 2017}}</ref> Levels in the open world games, ''[[Super Mario 64|64]]'', ''[[Super Mario Sunshine|Sunshine]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Odyssey|Odyssey]]'', allow the player to freely explore multiple enclosed environments in 360 degree movement.

When hit by an enemy, Mario reverts to his smaller size instead of losing a life.<ref name=\"SuperMushroom\" /> When Mario is in his \"Super\" form, most blocks that would contain a Super Mushroom instead offer a more powerful power-up such as the Fire Flower. The Super Mushroom is similar in appearance to the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', with an ivory stalk below a most commonly red and white (originally red and orange) spotted cap. Created by chance, [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] stated in an interview that beta tests of ''Super Mario Bros.'' proved Mario too tall, so the development team implemented mushrooms to grow and shrink Mario.<ref name=\"worldrecord\">{{cite web | author = O'Connell, Patricia | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_45/b3958127.htm | title = Meet Mario's Papa | publisher = BusinessWeek online | date = November 7, 2005 | accessdate =November 26, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Poison Mushroom'', first introduced in the Japanese ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', is a mushroom that causes damage when touched. In later games, the Poison Mushroom looks almost exactly like the Super Mushroom with a red cap but has a meaner-looking face.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe ''Mini Mushroom'' is a small blue mushroom, a recurring item in the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series, which shrinks Mario into miniature size, allowing him access areas and pipes that Mario normally cannot reach. Mini Mario also jumps higher, floats midair, bounces off enemies without hurting them except by ground pounding, and can run across the surface of the water and then jump from it as if he was on land. Mario is more vulnerable in this form and loses a life upon receiving one hit in miniature form. The Mini Mushroom in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' allows Mario to run up walls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5942967/its-impossible-to-hate-the-new-new-super-mario-bros-u|title=It's Impossible to Hate the New New Super Mario Bros. U|work=Kotaku|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Mega Mushroom'', introduced in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and further appearing in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is a more recent addition to the series that grows Mario into a towering, invulnerable giant who destroys enemies and the environment by running through them. It has an orange-yellow cap with red spots, like the ''Super Mario Bros.'' Super Mushroom, but with an inflated cap. ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'' features an item simply called \"Mushroom\"<ref name=\"Super Mario 64 DS Instruction Booklet\">{{ cite book | date=2005 | title=Super Mario 64 DS Instruction Booklet (PAL version) | publisher=Nintendo }}</ref> that grants the same abilities as the Mega Mushroom.\n\nIn the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' franchise, the Bee Mushroom gives Mario the Bee Suit, and the Spring Mushroom puts Mario inside a metallic coil. The Mystery Mushroom in ''Super Mario Maker'' (though not in its [[Super Mario Maker 2|2019 sequel]]) provides a \"costume\" based on one of many characters in addition to the abilities of the Super Mushroom.\n\n===== 1-Ups =====\nThe ''[[1-Up]]'' is a common item shown as a green and white mushroom that gives Mario an [[extra life]]. The 1-Up was introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'', sometimes hidden in invisible item blocks, and displayed as having an orange cap with green spots. In ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Land 2]]'', the 1-Up is shown as a heart. 1-Ups can take other forms, such as the 3-Up Moon from ''Super Mario World'' and ''New Super Mario Bros. U''.\n\n==== Projectile flowers ====\nThe flower power-ups let Mario shoot projectiles. The Fire Flower, introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'', transforms Mario into Fire Mario, who can throw bouncing fireballs at enemies. ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' was the first 3D Mario platformer game to have the Fire Flower. In ''Super Mario Land'' and ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]'', the Superball is a [[bouncing ball]] obtained from a Super Flower, which Mario can use to defeat enemies and collect coins. The Ice Flower transforms Mario into Ice Mario, where he can shoot balls of ice as projectiles similar to that of the Fire Flower; it freezes enemies in a block of ice, to be used as platforms or as thrown projectiles, as seen in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'' and ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]''.<ref name=\"nsmbw\" /> In ''Super Mario Galaxy'', the Ice Flower turns Mario into ice and lets him walk on lava or water for a limited time by freezing the surface. Lastly, ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]''{{'}}s Gold Flower lets Mario turn bricks into coins and earn bonus coins for defeating enemies.\n\n==== Invincibility ====\nInvincibility is an effect first appearing in the three ''Super Mario Bros.'' games, where it is granted by a \"Starman\",<ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario'' manual|url=http://legendsoflocalization.com/media/super-mario-bros/manuals/Super-Mario-Bros-Manual-US.pdf|accessdate=January 12, 2017|website=legendsoflocalization}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario Bros. 2'' Manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_NES/Manual/formated/Super_Mario_Bros._2_-_1986_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario Bros. 3'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//media/system/nintendo_nes/manual/formated/super_mario_bros._3_-_1990_-_nintendo.pdf|accessdate=January 12, 2017|website=gamesdatabase|date=1990}}</ref> an anthropomorphized, flashing star. The star has also been named the \"Super Star\" in the two ''Super Mario World'' games<ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario World'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES/manual/Formated/Super_Mario_World_-_1991_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'' manual|url=http://www.gamesdatabase.org//Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_SNES/Manual/formated/Super_Mario_World_2-_Yoshi-s_Island_-_1995_-_Nintendo.pdf|website=gamesdatabase|accessdate=January 12, 2017|date=1995}}</ref> and the \"Rainbow Star\" in the two ''Super Mario Galaxy'' games. Picking up the star makes Mario temporarily [[Glossary of video game terms#God mode|invincible]], able to resist any harm. Use of the item is accompanied by a distinctive music track that appears consistently across most of the games. The player character flickers a variety of colors \u2014 and in some titles, moves with increased speed and enhanced jumping ability \u2014 while under the Star's influence. While invincible, Mario kills any enemy upon contact with it. In ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', the star gives the normally immobile baby Mario the ability to run as well as become invincible. In ''Super Mario 64'', invincibility is provided when Mario wears the metal cap or the vanish cap. The Mega Mushroom provides temporary invincibility with the addition of giant size and environment destruction (see [[Super Mario#Mushrooms|Mushrooms]]).\n\n==== Power Stars and course tokens ====\nThe games often feature [[collectible]]s found in levels in order to progress in the overworld, most frequently with the visual motif of a star. They are typically situated in locations that are not readily found or reached, or awarded for completing stunts, or objectives given by [[Non-player character|NPCs]]. They include the Power Stars in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' games, Shine Sprites in ''Super Mario Sunshine'', Star Coins in the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series and ''Super Mario 3D Land'', Green Stars in the ''Galaxy'' games and ''Super Mario 3D World'', and Power Moons in ''Super Mario Odyssey''. In ''Super Mario Land 2'', there are six Golden Coin tokens that must be collected to finish the game.\n\n==== Flying ====\nFlight is a common theme throughout the series, first enabled with the [[magic carpet]] item in the international ''Super Mario Bros. 2''. The Super Leaf and Tanooki Suit items, first appearing in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' provide Mario with an animal-suited tail, which in turn acts as a flight propeller. The Tanooki Suit returns in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'', and the Super Leaf returns in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and the ''Super Mario Maker'' series. In the ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' series and ''Super Mario Maker'' series, the Propeller Block and the Propeller Mushroom let Mario spin up into the air and slowly descend. In ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', Mario pilots a yellow airplane with unlimited ammunition called the Sky Pop. ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduces various forms of flight: the feather item provides a cape, the P Balloon puffs Mario into a floating balloon figure, and Yoshi can carry a blue Koopa shell which gives him wings. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', flight that is granted by a Winged Cap. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', Mario has limited flight provided by the Propeller Cap.  In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', Mario has limited flight and gliding capabilities in a Flying Squirrel suit and can also command a pink Baby Yoshi to puff up into the form of a floating balloon. In ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', Mario can obtain a special red star that transforms him into Flying Mario for a limited time. [[Lakitu]]'s cloud can be commandeered in several of the side-scrolling games.\n\n==== Power-up suits ====\nSeveral suits work as power-ups, many of which are based on animals.  Debuting in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', the Raccoon Suit (provisioned by a Super Leaf) and the Tanooki Suit each provide Mario with a tail which acts as a flight propeller.  In addition, the Tanooki Suit lets Mario spontaneously change into an invincible statue for about five seconds. In ''Super Mario 3D Land'', the Raccoon Suit reappears and is accompanied by a silver-colored variation called a Statue Leaf.<ref name=GT>{{cite web| title = Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = May 21, 2010| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/review-super-mario/100404| accessdate =May 22, 2010}}</ref> ''Super Mario Bros. 3'' includes a [[Hammer Bros.]] suit, which allows Mario to throw hammers as projectiles, to defeat enemies at a distance, taking what the Hammer Bros does to Mario and turning it around. While wearing the suit and ducking, Mario is invulnerable to fire attacks. The Hammer Suit was so powerful that in later games, it was downgraded. ''Super Mario 3D Land'' features a \"Boomerang Suit\" which provisions long-distance boomerang projectiles. Other animal suits include the Frog Suit, Tanooki Suit, Penguin Suit, Cat Suit and Bee Suit.\n\n==== Coins ====\n''Super Mario'' level design traditionally incorporates many distributed coins as puzzles and rewards.  Most ''Super Mario'' games award the player an extra life once a certain amount of yellow coins are collected, commonly 50 or 100.  Several coin variants exist, such as silver coins, dragon coins, star coins, and more.\n\nIn ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'', coins replenish health (and air, when Mario is underwater). In ''Super Mario 64'' and ''Super Mario Sunshine'', collecting 100 coins in a level results in a Power Star or Shine Sprite respectively. There are also stages in that game reward a Power Star for collecting eight red coins in a level, worth two normal coins each. In ''Super Mario 64'', a blue coin is worth five normal coins. In ''Super Mario Sunshine'', blue coins act as a side quest when brought to the Delfino Bank.\n\nIn the ''Super Mario Galaxy'' series, after finishing each game once, stages unlock where Mario can collect 100 purple coins to earn a Power Star. In ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'', they can also be used to feed some hungry \"Luma\" characters that can turn into either an item or another planet.\n\n=== Luigi and other playable characters ===\n\nThe series often features the option to play as other characters, Luigi in the most instances. Earlier games have offered an alternating multiplayer mode in which the second player controls Luigi on their turn. Luigi is often only playable by player one in a second, more challenging iteration of the base game, such as in ''The Lost Levels'', ''Galaxy 2'', ''New Super Luigi U'' and the special worlds in ''3D Land''; these feature lower gravity and reduced friction for Luigi. Later games allow four player simultaneous play. Playable characters other than Mario and Luigi have included Toads, Peach, Rosalina, [[Mii|Miis]] and Nabbit. Characters are sometimes differentiated by special abilities. ''Super Mario Maker'' (though not ''Super Mario Maker 2'') includes costumes that depict many more characters.\n\n=== Warp Pipes and Warp Cannons ===\n{{See also|Warp (gaming)}}\nThe Warp Pipe is a common method of transportation used in many of the ''Mario'' series games. Warp Pipes are most often green but also appear in other colors (early games included silver pipes, newer games have introduced red, green, blue and yellow pipes), and have many uses in the series. Warp Pipes can also contain enemies, usually Piranha Plants, and sometimes launch the player into the air (most commonly seen in the ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' series). In early ''Mario'' games such as ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', special, well-hidden areas known as [[Warp Zone]]s contain pipes that allow players to skip several worlds (handfuls of levels) at once.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cuddy |first1=Luke |date= August 2013|title=The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy: I Link Therefore I Am |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_UefdMONDLIC&dq=cucco+legend+of+zelda |publisher= Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9691-2 |accessdate=November 16, 2014}}</ref> In the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series, pipe-shaped Warp Cannons work similarly to the Warp Zones of the earlier games and are unlocked by finding secret exits in levels. [[Cannons]] appear in most of the 3D games in the series starting with ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. Mario uses the cannon by jumping into the barrel, aiming himself and being fired at a distant target. This allows Mario to progress through a level or reach otherwise inaccessible areas.\n\n=== Yoshi ===\nMario's dinosaur friend [[Yoshi]] has appeared as a mount to the player character in several ''Super Mario'' games since ''[[Super Mario World]]''. In the sequel, ''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'', a tribe of Yoshis finds Mario and helps him to save Baby Luigi. In this game and ''Super Mario 64 DS'', instead of the player merely riding on Yoshi's back, Yoshi is the player character. Yoshis generally have abilities including eating enemies, flying, and breathing fire. Miyamoto had originally wished for Mario to be able to ride a dinosaur in ''Super Mario Bros.'', but this wasn't possible due to the technical restraints of the system.\n\n== Settings ==\n* The {{nihongo foot|'''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u30b3\u738b\u56fd|Kinoko \u014ckoku|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the primary ''Super Mario'' series setting, having been introduced in ''Super Mario Bros.'' The Mushroom Kingdom is also the setting for the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' games, ''Super Mario 3D Land'' and ''Super Mario Run''. It is a monarchy and its heir is [[Princess Peach]]. Though Princess Peach, Mario and Luigi are human, most citizens of this area are the mushroom-like [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toads]]. While the main characters of the series reside in the Mushroom Kingdom, their adventures have extended to other settings.\n* ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' introduced '''Subcon''', a mysterious world issued from Mario's dream. It was taken over by the frog king [[Wart (character)|Wart]].\n* ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' is set in the '''Mushroom World''', a collection of eight kingdoms. Seven of these are \"Mushroom Kingdoms\", ruled by their own kings. The different kingdoms are Grass Land (a plains kingdom), Desert Land (a desert kingdom), Water Land (an ocean kingdom), Giant Land (a kingdom where everything is larger), Sky Land (a kingdom which consists of a peninsula at ground level, and a large plain amidst the sky), Ice Land (an arctic kingdom), and Pipe Land (a small island kingdom filled with a maze of Warp Pipes). The eighth world is Dark Land and is ruled by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]: King of the Koopas. The instruction manual for the game states that the Mushroom Kingdom is a gateway to the Mushroom World.\n* ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' takes place in '''Sarasaland'''. It is ruled by [[Princess Daisy]]. The species in Sarasaland are range from [[tiki]] monsters to aliens to gigantic [[sphinx]]es, as well as enemies similar to enemies from other games in the series. The kingdoms that make up Sarasaland include Birabuto (an [[Ancient Egypt]]-like kingdom), Muda (an ocean kingdom), Easton (an [[Easter Island]]-like kingdom), and Chai (an Ancient [[China]]-like kingdom).\n* ''[[Super Mario World]]'' introduced '''Dinosaur Land''', a separate continent where Mario, Luigi, and Princess Toadstool vacation after the events of ''Super Mario Bros. 3''.<ref>Super Mario World instruction manual</ref> '''Yoshi's Island''', the setting of ''[[Yoshi's Island|Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'', is located within Dinosaur Land. The other areas consist of Donut Plains, Vanilla Dome, Twin Bridges, Forest of Illusion, Chocolate Island, Valley of Bowser, Star World, and the Special Zone.\n* ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'' introduced '''Mario Land''', a region which apparently belongs to Mario.\n* ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' introduced '''Peach's Castle''', which serves as a [[overworld|hub world]]. The worlds in the game are reached by jumping into paintings, which are portals to imaginary worlds created by Bowser. As such, the game is largely not set in the Mushroom Kingdom. However, Peach's Castle itself is located in the Mushroom Kingdom as shown in games like ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its sequel.\n* ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' introduced '''Isle Delfino''', a tropical island somewhere outside the Mushroom Kingdom. It contains several harbors, beaches, hotels, parks, and villages. Instead of Toads or humans, most of the residents on Isle Delfino are tropical creatures called Nokis and Piantas. Its main village Delfino Plaza serves as the central hub world in ''Super Mario Sunshine''. Different areas of the island can be accessed through portals created by spray paint in different parts of the plaza. Besides Delfino Plaza, the different locations of Delfino Island are Delfino Airstrip, Bianco Hills, Ricco Harbor, Gelato Beach, Pinna Park, Sirena Beach, Noki Bay, Pianta Village, and Corona Mountain. While Isle Delfino has only appeared in one game in the ''Super Mario'' series, it has been commonly used in ''Mario'' spin-off games, especially the [[Mario Kart|''Mario Kart'' series]].\n* ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]'' are set in outer space and contain various galaxies and planets.\n* ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'' takes place in the '''Sprixie Kingdom''', where the Sprixies live.\n* ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' has Mario traveling across the globe in a hat-shaped airship called the Odyssey; thus, several new regions known as \"kingdoms\" are introduced in the game, including a New York-inspired urban area called the '''Metro Kingdom''', a dry desert land called the '''Sand Kingdom''', and a food-filled world called the '''Luncheon Kingdom'''.\n\n== Development and history ==\n{{See also|Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong Jr.|Mario Bros.|Super Mario Bros}}\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2013}}\nMuch of the original ''Super Mario Bros.'' music and sound effects have become iconic to the series and incorporated into modern games.
