It was founded in 1892 as the '''New Zealand Rugby Football Union''' ('''NZRFU'''), 12 years after the first provincial unions in New Zealand. In 1949 it became an affiliate to the International Rugby Football Board, now known as [[World Rugby]], the governing body of rugby union for the world. It dropped the word \"Football\" from its name in 2006. The brand name ''New Zealand Rugby'' was adopted in 2013.<ref name=NZH_20130326>{{cite news |title=NZ rugby targets Auckland's Asian population |first=Patrick |last=McKendry |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10873793 |agency=APNZ |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=26 March 2013 |accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> Officially, it is an [[incorporated society]] with the name '''New Zealand Rugby Union Incorporated'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://app.businessregisters.govt.nz/sber-businesses/viewInstance/view.html?id=229a78e05307b6d8bf1b29667f00cb17c4de35515d1bbff4&_timestamp=1174713503630789|title=NEW ZEALAND RUGBY UNION INCORPORATED (215355) (NZBN: 9429042872061) [Incorporated Society] Registered|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://files.allblacks.com/NZRugby-website/NZRU-Constitution-Oct-2017.pdf|title=New Zealand Rugby Union Incorporated: Constitution|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe organisation's main objectives, as displayed in the NZR Constitution,<ref>[http://www.nzru.co.nz/AboutUs/Constitution/tabid/1185/Default.aspx NZRU Constitution]</ref> are to promote and develop rugby throughout New Zealand; arrange and participate in matches and tours in New Zealand and overseas; represent New Zealand in World Rugby; form and manage New Zealand representative teams; and encourage participation in the sport. NZR Headquarters are located in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, with an office in [[Auckland]].\n\n==Structure==\nNew Zealand Rugby has a staff of approximately 90 people, mostly based in Wellington and Auckland but also working in locations all around New Zealand.\n\nNZR was initially governed by a committee of delegates from the provincial unions until replaced in 1894 by a seven-member Wellington-based management committee. Administrative responsibilities were initially held by honorary secretaries, and then secretaries, from 1907. This was expanded 43 years later to create two entities, the ruling NZRU Council and an executive committee. In 1986, three geographical zones were formed to elect the members of the ruling council, and the executive committee was replaced by an administration committee. Since 1990, the NZRU has been managed by a CEO.\n\nIn 1996, the NZRU's ruling council was replaced by an expanded board to include independent members and an elected Maori representative. In 2015, the geographical zones were abolished so that vacant elective seats on the board could be contested by nominees from any provincial union in New Zealand without restriction on place of residence.<ref name = nzru-board/>\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; margin-left:10px; font-size:90%;\" width=40%\n|+ &nbsp;\n|- \n|colspan=2 width=\"100%\"|\n{| width=\"100%\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border: 1px solid darkgray; background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!style=\"border:1px solid darkgray; background:#ccc;\"|Patron\n|-\n|''vacant''\n|}\n|- \n|colspan=2 width=\"100%\"|\n{| width=\"100%\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border: 1px solid darkgray; background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!style=\"border:1px solid darkgray; background:#000; color:#fff;\"|Officers\n|-\n|'''[[Bill Osborne]]'''<br /><sup>President</sup>\n|-\n|'''Max Spence'''<br /><sup>Vice President</sup>\n|}\n|- valign=top\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{|width=\"100%\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border: 1px solid darkgray; background:#f9f9f9; text-align:center;\"\n!style=\"border:1px solid darkgray; background:#000; color:#fff; width:16em;\"|Board\n|-\n|'''Brent Impey'''<br /><sup>Chairman</sup>\n|-\n|'''Richard Dellabarca'''<br /><sup>Board Member</sup>\n|-\n|'''Andrew Golightly'''<br /><sup>Board Member*</sup>\n|-\n|'''Peter Kean'''<br /><sup>Board Member</sup>\n|-\n|'''Stewart Mitchell'''<br /><sup>Board Member*</sup>\n|-\n|'''Shaun Nixon'''<br /><sup>Board Member*</sup>\n|-\n|'''[[Farah Palmer]]'''<br /><sup>Maori Representative*</sup>\n|-\n|'''[[Michael Jones (rugby union)|Michael Jones]]'''<br /><sup>Board Member*<br /></sup>\n|-\n|&nbsp;<br /><sup>* Elected members</sup>\n|}\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{| width=\"100%\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border: 1px solid darkgray; background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!style=\"border:1px solid darkgray; background:#000; color:#fff; width:16em;\"|Executive\n|-\n|'''[[Mark Robinson (rugby union, born 1974)|Mark Robinson]]'''<br /><sup>Chief Executive Officer</sup>\n|-\n|'''Nicki Nicol'''<br /><sup>Chief Operating Officer</sup>\n|-\n|'''Nigel Cass'''<br /><sup>Chief Strategy and Operations</sup>\n|-\n|'''Richard Thomas'''<br /><sup>Chief Commercial Officer</sup>\n|-\n|'''Darren Shand'''<br /><sup>All Blacks Manager</sup>\n|-\n|'''{{0|Name}}'''<br /><sup>{{0|Title}}</sup>\n|-\n|'''{{0|Name}}'''<br /><sup>{{0|Title}}</sup>\n|-\n|'''{{0|Name}}'''<br /><sup>{{0|Title}}</sup>\n|-\n|&nbsp;<br /><sup>Updated: 5 February 2020</sup>\n|}\n|-\n|colspan=2 width=\"100%\"|{{resize|85%|Sources:[http://www.nzrugby.co.nz/about-us NZRU]}}<ref name = nzru-board/><ref name = nzru-office-hold/><ref name = nzru-exec/>\n|}\n\n===Patron and officers===\nNew Zealand Rugby's Patron fills an honorary role as the figurehead for the organisation. The position of Patron is currently vacant following the death of  [[Brian Lochore|Sir Brian Lochore]] in August 2019.\n\nThe President and Vice President are the Union's two officers who represent New Zealand Rugby at functions and events. Unlike the Patron, the President and Vice President may attend board meetings of New Zealand Rugby, although they are not entitled to vote on board matters. The President and Vice President are elected for two years each. The current President is [[Bill Osborne]] and the current Vice President is Max Spence.<ref name = nzru-office-hold/>\n\n===Board===\nThe Board is charged with setting strategy, direction and policy for the New Zealand Rugby Union, and is ultimately responsible for the decisions and actions of NZRU management and staff. Many of the decisions concerning New Zealand's national teams, domestic competitions, financial management and rugby traditions are made by the Board.\n\nAs of September 2018, the Board has nine members: six elected members (including one Maori representative) and three independent members. Any provincial union in New Zealand may nominate candidates for vacant elective positions.<ref name = nzru-board/> Nominations are passed to an Appointments and Remuneration Committee (ARC) which recommends two candidates per vacancy, to be voted on by delegates at the Annual General Meeting. The Maori representative is automatically appointed as New Zealand Rugby's representative on and Chairman of the New Zealand Maori Rugby Board.<ref name = nzru-board/>\n\nThe independent board members must be independent of any provincial union and are not nominated for the role. Instead, independent members must apply for the position and are selected on the basis of their professional qualifications and experience by a committee from the Board of New Zealand Rugby.<ref name = nzru-board/>\n\n===Executive management team and staff===\nNew Zealand Rugby's management and staff reports to an executive team headed by the Chief Executive Officer. This team includes various managers for all aspects of New Zealand Rugby ranging from community and provincial rugby to the All Blacks teams.<ref name = nzru-exec/> The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), working with the Board, is responsible for the establishment of the vision and strategy for the organisation, and acts as the key link between the Board and the staff. The CEO is ultimately responsible for the administrative and operational aspects of New Zealand Rugby. The current CEO is [[Mark Robinson (rugby union, born 1974)|Mark Robinson]], who took up the post in January 2020, succeeding [[Steve Tew]].\n\n==History==\nThe New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) was formed in 1892 to administer the game of rugby union at the national level. At that time, the national union was known as the New Zealand Rugby Football Union or NZRFU. The name was officially shortened in 2006 with the removal of the word \"Football\". The brand name New Zealand Rugby was adopted in 2013 for \"everyday\" use because it was seen as less \"stuffy\"<ref name=NZH_20130326/> and the word \"Union\" had some negative connotations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.workcommunications.co.nz/ |title=Work book |publisher=Work Communications |accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first rugby match to be played in New Zealand took place in Nelson in May 1870, between Nelson College and Nelson Football Club. The game spread quickly and in September 1875 the first interprovincial match took place in Dunedin, between Auckland Clubs and Dunedin Clubs. In 1879, the first provincial unions were formed in Canterbury and Wellington.\n\n===Formation and early years===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:10px;\" width=35%\n|-\n! <small>'''[[Ernest Hoben]]'''</small>\n|-\n| align=center|<small>The NZRU's strongest advocate and first secretary, [[Ernest Hoben]], was a driving force behind the formation of the national union. In recognition of Hoben's contribution, the \"''Ernest Hoben Room''\" at the NZRU's offices in Wellington now displays all 26 provincial jerseys alongside photos of past All Blacks teams and the names of every All Black in New Zealand rugby history.</small>\n|}\nOn Saturday 16 April 1892, in a meeting held in [[Wellington]], the New Zealand Rugby Union was formed. Inaugural members were the provincial unions of [[Auckland Rugby Football Union|Auckland]], [[Hawke's Bay Rugby Union|Hawke's Bay]], [[Manawatu Rugby Union|Manawatu]], [[Marlborough Rugby Union|Marlborough]], [[Nelson Bays Rugby Union|Nelson]], [[South Canterbury Rugby Football Union|South Canterbury]], [[Taranaki Rugby Football Union|Taranaki]], [[Wairarapa Bush Rugby Football Union|Waiararapa]], [[Wanganui Rugby Football Union|Wanganui]] and [[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington]]. At the time, three major South Island provincial unions \u2013 [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]], [[Otago Rugby Football Union|Otago]] and [[Southland Rugby Football Union|Southland]] \u2013 resisted the central authority of the NZRU.\n\nIn 1893, the NZRU formally adopted the black jersey as the national playing strip and selected the first NZRU-sanctioned national team, for a tour of Australia. However, the earlier New Zealand team selected to tour New South Wales in 1884 is recognised as a New Zealand team and its players recognised as All Blacks.\n\nBy 1895, with the additions of the Bush, Canterbury, Horowhenua, Otago, Poverty Bay, Southland and West Coast unions, the NZRU was considered to be a complete and united collection of all New Zealand rugby players. However, the New Zealand rugby map<ref>[http://files.allblacks.com/Comms/Provincial_Unions_Map_2007.pdf New Zealand Rugby Map] as of 2005</ref> would be repeatedly redrawn in the following decades.\n\nAt the Annual Meeting in 1921, the NZRU elected its first Life Member, George Dixon, manager of the 1905 \u201c[[The Original All Blacks|Originals]]\u201d All Blacks and the NZRU's first Chairman, appointed in 1904. In another innovation, provincial delegates met prior to the Annual Meeting to arrange representative fixtures for the season ahead, introducing a new level of national coordination.\n\n===Provincial rugby===\nIn 1976, the National Provincial Championship was formed to help organise matches between provincial unions, it had two divisions in its first year of play but the format was repeatedly reorganized throughout its 30-year history, notably in 1992 the [[rugby union bonus points system|bonus points system]] was brought in to determine the top placed team. [[Auckland representative rugby union team|Auckland]] have been the most successful team in the NPC's history with 16 championships including the last in 2005.\n\nAt the conclusion of the NPC there were three divisions and 27 unions under the NZRU's jurisdiction, it was replaced by the [[Mitre 10 Cup|Air New Zealand Cup]] and [[Heartland Championship]] in 2006 with 14 teams in the top competition, including the new Tasman Makos, who formed with the amalgamation of the Marlborough and Nelson Bays Rugby Unions, and 12 teams in the amateur Heartland Championship. After changes in sponsorship in 2010 and 2016, the Air New Zealand Cup first became the ITM Cup and is now the Mitre 10 Cup.\n\n===All Blacks===\nThe All Blacks are New Zealand's number one national rugby side and have rated among the best in the world for well over 100 years. Their name and distinctive all black playing strip have become well known to rugby and non-rugby fans worldwide.\n\nThe first New Zealand team was selected in 1884, for a tour to [[New South Wales]]. The team played its first match at home, against a Wellington XV, before recording eight wins in eight matches in Australia. [[Otago Rugby Football Union|Otago]] prop [[James Allan (rugby)|James Allan]], who played eight matches for the 1884 team, has the title of All Black No 1.\n\nIn 1893, the first official NZRU-sanctioned New Zealand team was selected, for an 11-match tour to [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]]. The team lost just once, to [[New South Wales Waratahs|New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]].\n\nIn 1894, an official New Zealand team hosted visiting opposition on home soil for the first time, in a match against New South Wales at [[Christchurch]] won 8\u20136 by the visitors, two years later, New Zealand beat [[Queensland Reds|Queensland]] at [[Wellington]] to record its first home win against visiting opposition.\n\nNew Zealand's 1905\u201306 tour to the United Kingdom, France and North America might be considered the most important in New Zealand rugby history. The team played 35 matches in total, the only team to beat them was Wales. In the United Kingdom especially, the team's largely confident, attractive and comfortable wins made a strong statement about the quality of rugby in the colonies and New Zealand in particular. Moreover, the 1905\u201306 tour gave rise to the famous \u201cAll Blacks\u201d moniker, as the fame surrounding the black-clad team spread. Nowadays, this team is known as \u201c[[The Original All Blacks|the Originals]]\u201d \u2013 they were the first team to demonstrate the power and skill of New Zealand rugby, the first to make rugby a part of New Zealand's cultural identity, and the first to be known as All Blacks.\n\nIn 1924\u201325, the All Blacks embarked on a 32-match tour to the United Kingdom, France and Canada. Going one better than the 1905\u201306 Originals, this team won all 32 matches, including Test wins over Ireland, Wales, England and France, and earned the nickname \u201cthe Invincibles\u201d.\n\nIn 1956, the All Blacks won a Test series against South Africa for the first time. The Springboks were the All Blacks\u2019 greatest traditional rivals and had delivered some of the All Blacks\u2019 worst defeats.\n\nIn 1978, the All Blacks achieved a Grand Slam for the first time. For southern hemisphere sides like New Zealand, a Grand Slam includes victories over the four Home Unions \u2013 [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] \u2013 in the course of a single tour. The team achieved a second Grand Slam in 2005 and a third in 2008<ref name=\"NZ_Herald_10545766\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/all-blacks-grand-slam-tour/news/article.cfm?c_id=1502781&objectid=10545766 |title=All Blacks conquer England to complete Grand Slam |author=Gregor Paul |date=30 November 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, the All Blacks won the inaugural [[1987 Rugby World Cup|Rugby World Cup]] against France, hosted by New Zealand and Australia.\n\nNew Zealand also won the Rugby World Cup Finals\u2014 in [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]], after an [[2011 Rugby World Cup Final|8\u20137 victory]] over France in front of a home crowd, and in [[2015 Rugby World Cup Final|34\u201317 victory]] over Australia at Twickenham in [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]]. The latter win made the All Blacks the first side ever to successfully defend a Rugby World Cup title.\n\n===Professional era===\nIn 1995, following the [[1995 Rugby World Cup|Rugby World Cup tournament]] in [[South Africa]], international rugby turned professional with the IRB's repeal of all amateurism regulations. For the first time, the NZRU negotiated with and contracted New Zealand rugby players.\n\nThe NZRU also joined with the national unions of [[Australian Rugby Union|Australia]] and [[South African Rugby Union|South Africa]] to form [[SANZAAR|SANZAR]], which sold the television rights for major southern hemisphere rugby competitions and helped to build the commercial foundation on which professional rugby is based. SANZAR, renamed SANZAAR with the 2016 entry of [[Argentine Rugby Union|Argentina]] as a full member of the body, remains an important rugby organisation and organises [[The Rugby Championship]] (originally the Tri Nations) and the [[Super Rugby]] competition.\n\n==National teams==\nThe NZRU has several teams under its control.\n\n===Men===\n*'''[[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]]''' \u2013 the national men's rugby union team of New Zealand\n*'''[[Junior All Blacks]]''' \u2013 the second national team behind the All Blacks and not an age graded side.\n*'''[[New Zealand national rugby sevens team|Sevens]]''' \u2013 the national [[Rugby Sevens|rugby sevens]] team of New Zealand.

Currently the country's top age-grade side, and also sometimes referred to as the \"Baby Blacks.\"\n*'''[[New Zealand national under-21 rugby union team|Under 21s]]''' \u2013 an age graded side that has developed some of today's current All Blacks, also sometimes referred to as the \"Baby Blacks.\"\n*'''[[New Zealand Heartland XV|Heartland XV]]''' \u2013 established in 1988 to expose players from Divisions Two and Three in the Air New Zealand NPC to rugby at a higher level. After the 2006 reorganisation of the NPC into the fully professional Air New Zealand Cup, now [[Mitre 10 Cup]], and the nominally amateur [[Heartland Championship]], the team now consists solely of players from the Heartland Championship.\n*'''[[New Zealand Schools Rugby Team|NZ Schools]]''' \u2013 a development team of school players who move up to the Under 20s and ultimately the All Blacks.\n\n===Women===\n*'''[[Black Ferns]]''' \u2013 the national women's rugby union team of New Zealand.\n*'''[[New Zealand women's national rugby sevens team|Sevens]]''' \u2013 the national women's  [[Rugby Sevens|rugby sevens]] team of New Zealand.\n\n===Referees===\nThe New Zealand Rugby Union have a number of contracted referees who officiated in levels from Heartland matches to ITM Cup and Super Rugby. The system in which referees are selected, appointed to matches and progress through to the next stage is very structured with a number of referee coaches, viewers and managers assisting them with their performances. However, only 5 referees are on professional contracts, [[Glen Jackson (rugby union)|Glen Jackson]], [[Brendon Pickerill]], [[Ben O'Keeffe]], [[Paul Williams (rugby referee)|Paul Williams]], [[Nick Briant]] and [[Mike Fraser (rugby referee)|Mike Fraser]]. The professionals are appointed to refereeing Super Rugby matches by [[SANZAAR]] with some refereeing test rugby.\n\n==Provincial unions==\nThe NZRU comprises 17 North Island provincial unions and 9 South Island provincial unions.\n\n===North Island===\nThe North Island provincial unions are:\n{|border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n*[[Auckland Rugby Football Union|Auckland]]\n*[[Bay of Plenty Rugby Union|Bay of Plenty]]\n*[[Counties Manukau Rugby Union|Counties-Manukau]]\n*[[East Coast Rugby Football Union|East Coast]]\n*[[Hawke's Bay Rugby Union|Hawke's Bay]]\n|\n*[[Horowhenua-Kapiti Rugby Football Union|Horowhenua-Kapiti]]\n*[[King Country Rugby Football Union|King Country]]\n*[[Manawatu Rugby Union|Manawatu]]\n*[[North Harbour Rugby Union|North Harbour]]\n*[[Northland Rugby Union|Northland]]\n|\n*[[Poverty Bay Rugby Football Union|Poverty Bay]]\n*[[Taranaki Rugby Football Union|Taranaki]]\n*[[Thames Valley Rugby Football Union|Thames Valley]]\n*[[Waikato Rugby Union|Waikato]]\n*[[Wairarapa Bush Rugby Football Union|Wairarapa Bush]]\n|\n*[[Wanganui Rugby Football Union|Wanganui]]\n*[[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington]]\n|}\n\n===South Island===\nThe South Island provincial unions are:\n{|border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n*[[Buller Rugby Football Union|Buller]]\n*[[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]]\n*[[Mid Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Mid-Canterbury]]\n*[[North Otago Rugby Football Union|North Otago]]\n*[[Otago Rugby Football Union|Otago]]\n|\n*[[South Canterbury Rugby Football Union|South Canterbury]]\n*[[Southland Rugby|Southland]]\n*[[Tasman Rugby Union|Tasman]]\n*[[West Coast Rugby Football Union|West Coast]]\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|New Zealand}}\n* [[List of New Zealand rugby union teams]]\n* [[New Zealand Rugby Museum]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name = nzru-board>{{cite web \n |date= 1 May 2016\n |title= Our Board\n |website= New Zealand Rugby\n |accessdate= 24 July 2016\n |url= http://www.nzru.co.nz/about-us/our-people/our-board\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name = nzru-exec>{{cite web \n |date= \n |title= Management\n |website= New Zealand Rugby\n |accessdate= 5 February 2020\n |url= http://www.nzrugby.co.nz/about-us/our-people/management\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name = nzru-office-hold>{{cite web \n |date= 1 May 2016\n |title= Officers and Patrons\n |website= New Zealand Rugby\n |accessdate= 24 July 2016\n |url= http://www.nzrugby.co.nz/about-us/our-people/officers-and-patrons\n}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nzru.co.nz/ Official organisational website of the NZRU]\n\n{{Rugby union in New Zealand}}\n{{New Zealand national rugby union team}}\n{{IRB Unions}}\n{{NZ Sport}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Sports organizations established in 1892]]\n[[Category:New Zealand rugby union governing bodies| ]]\n[[Category:Sports governing bodies in New Zealand|Rugby Union]]\n[[Category:Rugby union governing bodies in Oceania]]\n[[Category:World Rugby members]]\n[[Category:1892 establishments in New Zealand]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|NZRU|the airbase with ICAO code NZRU|Waiouru Airbase}}\n{{Distinguish|New Zealand Rugby League}}\n{{Use New Zealand English|date=February 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{National rugby union \n| unionname     = New Zealand Rugby\n| nativename    = \n| logo          = New Zealand Rugby Union logo.svg\n| logosize      = 150px\n| founded       = 1892\n| IRB           = 1949\n| region        = [[Oceania Rugby|Oceania]]\n| regionyear    = 2000\n| president     = [[Bill Osborne]]\n| leadertitle   = [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]]\n| leadername    = [[Mark Robinson (rugby union, born 1974)|Mark Robinson]]\n| coach         = [[Ian Foster (rugby union)|Ian Foster]]\n| womenscoach   = [[Glenn Moore (rugby union)|Glenn Moore]]\n| sevenscoach   = '''Men's''': Clark Laidlaw<br>'''Women's''': Allan Bunting / Cory Sweeney\n| countryflag   = New Zealand\n| url           = [http://www.nzru.co.nz/ www.nzru.co.nz]\n}}\n'''New Zealand Rugby''' ('''NZR''') is the [[Sports governing body|governing body]] of [[rugby union]] in [[New Zealand]].

NZR Headquarters are located in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, with an office in [[Auckland]].\n\n==Structure==\nNew Zealand Rugby has a staff of approximately 90 people, mostly based in Wellington and Auckland but also working in locations all around New Zealand.\n\nNZR was initially governed by a committee of delegates from the provincial unions until replaced in 1894 by a seven-member Wellington-based management committee. Administrative responsibilities were initially held by honorary secretaries, and then secretaries, from 1907. This was expanded 43 years later to create two entities, the ruling NZRU Council and an executive committee. In 1986, three geographical zones were formed to elect the members of the ruling council, and the executive committee was replaced by an administration committee. Since 1990, the NZRU has been managed by a CEO.\n\nIn 1996, the NZRU's ruling council was replaced by an expanded board to include independent members and an elected Maori representative. In 2015, the geographical zones were abolished so that vacant elective seats on the board could be contested by nominees from any provincial union in New Zealand without restriction on place of residence.<ref name = nzru-board/>\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; margin-left:10px; font-size:90%;\" width=40%\n|+ &nbsp;\n|- \n|colspan=2 width=\"100%\"|\n{| width=\"100%\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border: 1px solid darkgray; background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!style=\"border:1px solid darkgray; background:#ccc;\"|Patron\n|-\n|''vacant''\n|}\n|- \n|colspan=2 width=\"100%\"|\n{| width=\"100%\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border: 1px solid darkgray; background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!style=\"border:1px solid darkgray; background:#000; color:#fff;\"|Officers\n|-\n|'''[[Bill Osborne]]'''<br /><sup>President</sup>\n|-\n|'''Max Spence'''<br /><sup>Vice President</sup>\n|}\n|- valign=top\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{|width=\"100%\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border: 1px solid darkgray; background:#f9f9f9; text-align:center;\"\n!style=\"border:1px solid darkgray; background:#000; color:#fff; width:16em;\"|Board\n|-\n|'''Brent Impey'''<br /><sup>Chairman</sup>\n|-\n|'''Richard Dellabarca'''<br /><sup>Board Member</sup>\n|-\n|'''Andrew Golightly'''<br /><sup>Board Member*</sup>\n|-\n|'''Peter Kean'''<br /><sup>Board Member</sup>\n|-\n|'''Stewart Mitchell'''<br /><sup>Board Member*</sup>\n|-\n|'''Shaun Nixon'''<br /><sup>Board Member*</sup>\n|-\n|'''[[Farah Palmer]]'''<br /><sup>Maori Representative*</sup>\n|-\n|'''[[Michael Jones (rugby union)|Michael Jones]]'''<br /><sup>Board Member*<br /></sup>\n|-\n|&nbsp;<br /><sup>* Elected members</sup>\n|}\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{| width=\"100%\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; border: 1px solid darkgray; background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!style=\"border:1px solid darkgray; background:#000; color:#fff; width:16em;\"|Executive\n|-\n|'''[[Mark Robinson (rugby union, born 1974)|Mark Robinson]]'''<br /><sup>Chief Executive Officer</sup>\n|-\n|'''Nicki Nicol'''<br /><sup>Chief Operating Officer</sup>\n|-\n|'''Nigel Cass'''<br /><sup>Chief Strategy and Operations</sup>\n|-\n|'''Richard Thomas'''<br /><sup>Chief Commercial Officer</sup>\n|-\n|'''Darren Shand'''<br /><sup>All Blacks Manager</sup>\n|-\n|'''{{0|Name}}'''<br /><sup>{{0|Title}}</sup>\n|-\n|'''{{0|Name}}'''<br /><sup>{{0|Title}}</sup>\n|-\n|'''{{0|Name}}'''<br /><sup>{{0|Title}}</sup>\n|-\n|&nbsp;<br /><sup>Updated: 5 February 2020</sup>\n|}\n|-\n|colspan=2 width=\"100%\"|{{resize|85%|Sources:[http://www.nzrugby.co.nz/about-us NZRU]}}<ref name = nzru-board/><ref name = nzru-office-hold/><ref name = nzru-exec/>\n|}\n\n===Patron and officers===\nNew Zealand Rugby's Patron fills an honorary role as the figurehead for the organisation. The position of Patron is currently vacant following the death of  [[Brian Lochore|Sir Brian Lochore]] in August 2019.\n\nThe President and Vice President are the Union's two officers who represent New Zealand Rugby at functions and events. Unlike the Patron, the President and Vice President may attend board meetings of New Zealand Rugby, although they are not entitled to vote on board matters. The President and Vice President are elected for two years each. The current President is [[Bill Osborne]] and the current Vice President is Max Spence.<ref name = nzru-office-hold/>\n\n===Board===\nThe Board is charged with setting strategy, direction and policy for the New Zealand Rugby Union, and is ultimately responsible for the decisions and actions of NZRU management and staff. Many of the decisions concerning New Zealand's national teams, domestic competitions, financial management and rugby traditions are made by the Board.\n\nAs of September 2018, the Board has nine members: six elected members (including one Maori representative) and three independent members. Any provincial union in New Zealand may nominate candidates for vacant elective positions.<ref name = nzru-board/> Nominations are passed to an Appointments and Remuneration Committee (ARC) which recommends two candidates per vacancy, to be voted on by delegates at the Annual General Meeting. The Maori representative is automatically appointed as New Zealand Rugby's representative on and Chairman of the New Zealand Maori Rugby Board.<ref name = nzru-board/>\n\nThe independent board members must be independent of any provincial union and are not nominated for the role. Instead, independent members must apply for the position and are selected on the basis of their professional qualifications and experience by a committee from the Board of New Zealand Rugby.<ref name = nzru-board/>\n\n===Executive management team and staff===\nNew Zealand Rugby's management and staff reports to an executive team headed by the Chief Executive Officer. This team includes various managers for all aspects of New Zealand Rugby ranging from community and provincial rugby to the All Blacks teams.<ref name = nzru-exec/> The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), working with the Board, is responsible for the establishment of the vision and strategy for the organisation, and acts as the key link between the Board and the staff. The CEO is ultimately responsible for the administrative and operational aspects of New Zealand Rugby. The current CEO is [[Mark Robinson (rugby union, born 1974)|Mark Robinson]], who took up the post in January 2020, succeeding [[Steve Tew]].\n\n==History==\nThe New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) was formed in 1892 to administer the game of rugby union at the national level. At that time, the national union was known as the New Zealand Rugby Football Union or NZRFU. The name was officially shortened in 2006 with the removal of the word \"Football\". The brand name New Zealand Rugby was adopted in 2013 for \"everyday\" use because it was seen as less \"stuffy\"<ref name=NZH_20130326/> and the word \"Union\" had some negative connotations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.workcommunications.co.nz/ |title=Work book |publisher=Work Communications |accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first rugby match to be played in New Zealand took place in Nelson in May 1870, between Nelson College and Nelson Football Club. The game spread quickly and in September 1875 the first interprovincial match took place in Dunedin, between Auckland Clubs and Dunedin Clubs. In 1879, the first provincial unions were formed in Canterbury and Wellington.\n\n===Formation and early years===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:10px;\" width=35%\n|-\n! <small>'''[[Ernest Hoben]]'''</small>\n|-\n| align=center|<small>The NZRU's strongest advocate and first secretary, [[Ernest Hoben]], was a driving force behind the formation of the national union. In recognition of Hoben's contribution, the \"''Ernest Hoben Room''\" at the NZRU's offices in Wellington now displays all 26 provincial jerseys alongside photos of past All Blacks teams and the names of every All Black in New Zealand rugby history.</small>\n|}\nOn Saturday 16 April 1892, in a meeting held in [[Wellington]], the New Zealand Rugby Union was formed. Inaugural members were the provincial unions of [[Auckland Rugby Football Union|Auckland]], [[Hawke's Bay Rugby Union|Hawke's Bay]], [[Manawatu Rugby Union|Manawatu]], [[Marlborough Rugby Union|Marlborough]], [[Nelson Bays Rugby Union|Nelson]], [[South Canterbury Rugby Football Union|South Canterbury]], [[Taranaki Rugby Football Union|Taranaki]], [[Wairarapa Bush Rugby Football Union|Waiararapa]], [[Wanganui Rugby Football Union|Wanganui]] and [[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington]]. At the time, three major South Island provincial unions \u2013 [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]], [[Otago Rugby Football Union|Otago]] and [[Southland Rugby Football Union|Southland]] \u2013 resisted the central authority of the NZRU.\n\nIn 1893, the NZRU formally adopted the black jersey as the national playing strip and selected the first NZRU-sanctioned national team, for a tour of Australia. However, the earlier New Zealand team selected to tour New South Wales in 1884 is recognised as a New Zealand team and its players recognised as All Blacks.\n\nBy 1895, with the additions of the Bush, Canterbury, Horowhenua, Otago, Poverty Bay, Southland and West Coast unions, the NZRU was considered to be a complete and united collection of all New Zealand rugby players. However, the New Zealand rugby map<ref>[http://files.allblacks.com/Comms/Provincial_Unions_Map_2007.pdf New Zealand Rugby Map] as of 2005</ref> would be repeatedly redrawn in the following decades.\n\nAt the Annual Meeting in 1921, the NZRU elected its first Life Member, George Dixon, manager of the 1905 \u201c[[The Original All Blacks|Originals]]\u201d All Blacks and the NZRU's first Chairman, appointed in 1904. In another innovation, provincial delegates met prior to the Annual Meeting to arrange representative fixtures for the season ahead, introducing a new level of national coordination.\n\n===Provincial rugby===\nIn 1976, the National Provincial Championship was formed to help organise matches between provincial unions, it had two divisions in its first year of play but the format was repeatedly reorganized throughout its 30-year history, notably in 1992 the [[rugby union bonus points system|bonus points system]] was brought in to determine the top placed team. [[Auckland representative rugby union team|Auckland]] have been the most successful team in the NPC's history with 16 championships including the last in 2005.\n\nAt the conclusion of the NPC there were three divisions and 27 unions under the NZRU's jurisdiction, it was replaced by the [[Mitre 10 Cup|Air New Zealand Cup]] and [[Heartland Championship]] in 2006 with 14 teams in the top competition, including the new Tasman Makos, who formed with the amalgamation of the Marlborough and Nelson Bays Rugby Unions, and 12 teams in the amateur Heartland Championship. After changes in sponsorship in 2010 and 2016, the Air New Zealand Cup first became the ITM Cup and is now the Mitre 10 Cup.\n\n===All Blacks===\nThe All Blacks are New Zealand's number one national rugby side and have rated among the best in the world for well over 100 years. Their name and distinctive all black playing strip have become well known to rugby and non-rugby fans worldwide.\n\nThe first New Zealand team was selected in 1884, for a tour to [[New South Wales]]. The team played its first match at home, against a Wellington XV, before recording eight wins in eight matches in Australia. [[Otago Rugby Football Union|Otago]] prop [[James Allan (rugby)|James Allan]], who played eight matches for the 1884 team, has the title of All Black No 1.\n\nIn 1893, the first official NZRU-sanctioned New Zealand team was selected, for an 11-match tour to [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]]. The team lost just once, to [[New South Wales Waratahs|New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]].\n\nIn 1894, an official New Zealand team hosted visiting opposition on home soil for the first time, in a match against New South Wales at [[Christchurch]] won 8\u20136 by the visitors, two years later, New Zealand beat [[Queensland Reds|Queensland]] at [[Wellington]] to record its first home win against visiting opposition.\n\nNew Zealand's 1905\u201306 tour to the United Kingdom, France and North America might be considered the most important in New Zealand rugby history. The team played 35 matches in total, the only team to beat them was Wales. In the United Kingdom especially, the team's largely confident, attractive and comfortable wins made a strong statement about the quality of rugby in the colonies and New Zealand in particular. Moreover, the 1905\u201306 tour gave rise to the famous \u201cAll Blacks\u201d moniker, as the fame surrounding the black-clad team spread. Nowadays, this team is known as \u201c[[The Original All Blacks|the Originals]]\u201d \u2013 they were the first team to demonstrate the power and skill of New Zealand rugby, the first to make rugby a part of New Zealand's cultural identity, and the first to be known as All Blacks.\n\nIn 1924\u201325, the All Blacks embarked on a 32-match tour to the United Kingdom, France and Canada. Going one better than the 1905\u201306 Originals, this team won all 32 matches, including Test wins over Ireland, Wales, England and France, and earned the nickname \u201cthe Invincibles\u201d.\n\nIn 1956, the All Blacks won a Test series against South Africa for the first time. The Springboks were the All Blacks\u2019 greatest traditional rivals and had delivered some of the All Blacks\u2019 worst defeats.\n\nIn 1978, the All Blacks achieved a Grand Slam for the first time. For southern hemisphere sides like New Zealand, a Grand Slam includes victories over the four Home Unions \u2013 [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] \u2013 in the course of a single tour. The team achieved a second Grand Slam in 2005 and a third in 2008<ref name=\"NZ_Herald_10545766\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/all-blacks-grand-slam-tour/news/article.cfm?c_id=1502781&objectid=10545766 |title=All Blacks conquer England to complete Grand Slam |author=Gregor Paul |date=30 November 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, the All Blacks won the inaugural [[1987 Rugby World Cup|Rugby World Cup]] against France, hosted by New Zealand and Australia.\n\nNew Zealand also won the Rugby World Cup Finals\u2014 in [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]], after an [[2011 Rugby World Cup Final|8\u20137 victory]] over France in front of a home crowd, and in [[2015 Rugby World Cup Final|34\u201317 victory]] over Australia at Twickenham in [[2015 Rugby World Cup|2015]]. The latter win made the All Blacks the first side ever to successfully defend a Rugby World Cup title.\n\n===Professional era===\nIn 1995, following the [[1995 Rugby World Cup|Rugby World Cup tournament]] in [[South Africa]], international rugby turned professional with the IRB's repeal of all amateurism regulations. For the first time, the NZRU negotiated with and contracted New Zealand rugby players.\n\nThe NZRU also joined with the national unions of [[Australian Rugby Union|Australia]] and [[South African Rugby Union|South Africa]] to form [[SANZAAR|SANZAR]], which sold the television rights for major southern hemisphere rugby competitions and helped to build the commercial foundation on which professional rugby is based. SANZAR, renamed SANZAAR with the 2016 entry of [[Argentine Rugby Union|Argentina]] as a full member of the body, remains an important rugby organisation and organises [[The Rugby Championship]] (originally the Tri Nations) and the [[Super Rugby]] competition.\n\n==National teams==\nThe NZRU has several teams under its control.\n\n===Men===\n*'''[[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]]''' \u2013 the national men's rugby union team of New Zealand\n*'''[[Junior All Blacks]]''' \u2013 the second national team behind the All Blacks and not an age graded side.\n*'''[[New Zealand national rugby sevens team|Sevens]]''' \u2013 the national [[Rugby Sevens|rugby sevens]] team of New Zealand.

The system in which referees are selected, appointed to matches and progress through to the next stage is very structured with a number of referee coaches, viewers and managers assisting them with their performances. However, only 5 referees are on professional contracts, [[Glen Jackson (rugby union)|Glen Jackson]], [[Brendon Pickerill]], [[Ben O'Keeffe]], [[Paul Williams (rugby referee)|Paul Williams]], [[Nick Briant]] and [[Mike Fraser (rugby referee)|Mike Fraser]]. The professionals are appointed to refereeing Super Rugby matches by [[SANZAAR]] with some refereeing test rugby.\n\n==Provincial unions==\nThe NZRU comprises 17 North Island provincial unions and 9 South Island provincial unions.\n\n===North Island===\nThe North Island provincial unions are:\n{|border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n*[[Auckland Rugby Football Union|Auckland]]\n*[[Bay of Plenty Rugby Union|Bay of Plenty]]\n*[[Counties Manukau Rugby Union|Counties-Manukau]]\n*[[East Coast Rugby Football Union|East Coast]]\n*[[Hawke's Bay Rugby Union|Hawke's Bay]]\n|\n*[[Horowhenua-Kapiti Rugby Football Union|Horowhenua-Kapiti]]\n*[[King Country Rugby Football Union|King Country]]\n*[[Manawatu Rugby Union|Manawatu]]\n*[[North Harbour Rugby Union|North Harbour]]\n*[[Northland Rugby Union|Northland]]\n|\n*[[Poverty Bay Rugby Football Union|Poverty Bay]]\n*[[Taranaki Rugby Football Union|Taranaki]]\n*[[Thames Valley Rugby Football Union|Thames Valley]]\n*[[Waikato Rugby Union|Waikato]]\n*[[Wairarapa Bush Rugby Football Union|Wairarapa Bush]]\n|\n*[[Wanganui Rugby Football Union|Wanganui]]\n*[[Wellington Rugby Football Union|Wellington]]\n|}\n\n===South Island===\nThe South Island provincial unions are:\n{|border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n*[[Buller Rugby Football Union|Buller]]\n*[[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]]\n*[[Mid Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Mid-Canterbury]]\n*[[North Otago Rugby Football Union|North Otago]]\n*[[Otago Rugby Football Union|Otago]]\n|\n*[[South Canterbury Rugby Football Union|South Canterbury]]\n*[[Southland Rugby|Southland]]\n*[[Tasman Rugby Union|Tasman]]\n*[[West Coast Rugby Football Union|West Coast]]\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|New Zealand}}\n* [[List of New Zealand rugby union teams]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name = nzru-board>{{cite web \n |date= 1 May 2016\n |title= Our Board\n |website= New Zealand Rugby\n |accessdate= 24 July 2016\n |url= http://www.nzru.co.nz/about-us/our-people/our-board\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name = nzru-exec>{{cite web \n |date= \n |title= Management\n |website= New Zealand Rugby\n |accessdate= 5 February 2020\n |url= http://www.nzrugby.co.nz/about-us/our-people/management\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name = nzru-office-hold>{{cite web \n |date= 1 May 2016\n |title= Officers and Patrons\n |website= New Zealand Rugby\n |accessdate= 24 July 2016\n |url= http://www.nzrugby.co.nz/about-us/our-people/officers-and-patrons\n}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nzru.co.nz/ Official organisational website of the NZRU]\n\n{{Rugby union in New Zealand}}\n{{New Zealand national rugby union team}}\n{{IRB Unions}}\n{{NZ Sport}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Sports organizations established in 1892]]\n[[Category:New Zealand rugby union governing bodies| ]]\n[[Category:Sports governing bodies in New Zealand|Rugby Union]]\n[[Category:Rugby union governing bodies in Oceania]]\n[[Category:World Rugby members]]\n[[Category:1892 establishments in New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "ToddyOC", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Rugby"}

In [[classical antiquity]], including the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] world of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], historians and archaeologists view the public and private rituals associated with [[religion]] as part of everyday life. Examples of this phenomenon are found in the various state and cult [[ancient Greek temple|temples]], Jewish [[synagogue]]s, and [[church (building)|churches]].

Circe is presented as being in the form of a beautiful woman (a temptress) when Odysseus encounters her on an island. In this encounter Circe uses her wand to change Odysseus\u2019 companions into swine. This may suggest that magic was associated (in this time) with practices that went against the natural order, or against wise and good forces (Circe is called a witch by a companion of Odysseus).<ref name=odyssey />{{rp|X:43}} In this mode it is worth noting that Circe is representative of a power (the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]) that had been conquered by the younger [[Olympian gods]] such as [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]] and [[Hades]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Hesiod|title=Theogony|trans-title=Birth of the Gods|translator = S.

Many of these references representing a more positive conceptualisation of magic. Among the most famous of these Greek magoi, between Homer and the Hellenistic period, are the figures of [[Orpheus]], [[Pythagoras]], and [[Empedocles]].\n\n====Orpheus====\nOrpheus is a mythical figure, said to have lived in [[Thrace]] \"a generation before Homer\" (though he is in fact depicted on 5th-century ceramics in Greek costume).<ref name=drury>{{cite book|last=Drury|first=Nevill|title=Magic and Witchcraft: From Shamanism to the Technopagans|location=London|publisher=Thames & Hudson|date=2003}}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=September 2008}} Orphism, or the Orphic Mysteries, seems also to have been central to the personages of Pythagoras and Empedocles who lived in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE.

Individuals might have the gift of healing, or the gift of prophecy, but are not usually credited with a wide range of supernatural powers as are magoi like Orpheus, Pythagoras and Empedocles. Plato reflects such an attitude in his Laws (933a-e) where he takes healers, prophets and [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] for granted. He acknowledges that these practitioners existed in Athens (and thus presumably in other Greek cities), and they had to be reckoned with and controlled by laws; but one should not be afraid of them, their powers are real, but they themselves represent a rather low order of humanity. An early Christian analogy is found in the 1st century CE writings of the Apostle Paul. Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians conceptualizes the idea of a limitation of spiritual gifts.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Bible|volume=1 Corinthians|chapter=12:7\u201311}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}</ref>{{Original research inline|date=September 2008}}\n\n===Magic in the Hellenistic period===\nThe Hellenistic period (roughly the last three centuries BCE) is characterized by an avid interest in magic, though this may simply be because from this period a greater abundance of texts, both literary and some from actual practitioners, in Greek and in Latin remains. In fact many of the [[Greek Magical Papyri|magical papyri]] that are extant were written in the 1st centuries of the [[Common Era]], but their concepts, formulas and rituals reflect the earlier Hellenistic period, that is, a time when the systematization of magic in the Greco-Roman world seems to have taken place\u2014particularly in the \u2018melting pot\u2019 of varying cultures that was Egypt under the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] and under Rome.{{Original research inline|date=September 2008}}\n\nThe ascendancy of Christianity by the fifth century had much to do with this. This is reflected by the [[Acts of the Apostles]], where [[Paul the Apostle]] convinces many [[Ephesus|Ephesians]] to bring out their magical books and burn them.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Bible|volume=Acts|chapter=19:18\u201320}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}</ref> The language of the magical papyri reflects various levels of literary skill, but generally they are standard Greek, and in fact they may well be closer to the spoken language of the time than to poetry or artistic prose left to us in literary texts.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|first = Hans Dieter|last=Betz|authorlink=Hans Dieter Betz|title= The Greek Magical Papyri in Translation, Including the Demotic Spells|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1992|edition=2nd}}</ref> Many terms are borrowed, in the papyri, it would seem, from the mystery cults; thus magical formulas are sometimes called teletai (literally, \"celebration of mysteries\"), or the magician himself is called ''mystagogos'' (the priest who leads the candidates for initiation).<ref name=hull>{{cite journal|journal=Studies in Biblical Theology|last=Hull|first=John M.|title=Hellenistic Magic and the Synoptic Tradition|location=London|publisher=SCM PRESS|date=1974}}</ref>{{rp|23ff.}} Much Jewish lore and some of the names for [[God]] also appear in the magical papyri.

Various versions of the \"Eighth Book of Moses\" appear in PGM XIII.1\u2013343; 343\u2013646; 646\u2013734, followed by a \"Tenth (?)

So in other words the magic requires certain ingredients, much as Odysseus required the herb Moly to defeat the magic of Circe. But it is not just as simple as knowing how to put a recipe together. Appropriate gestures, at certain points in the magical ritual, are required to accompany the ingredients, different gestures it would seem produce various effects. A magical ritual done in the right way can guarantee the revealing of dreams and the rather useful talent of interpreting them correctly. In other cases certain spells allow one to send out a daemon or daemons to harm one's enemies or even to break up someone's marriage.\n\nThis self-defined negative aspect to magic (as opposed to other groups defining your practices as negative even if you don\u2019t) is found in various \u2018[[curse tablet]]s,\u2019 (tabellae defixionum) left to us from the Greco-Roman world.<ref name=\"Crawley\">{{cite encyclopedia|first=A.E.|last=Crawley|title=Curses|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of religion and Ethics|volume=4|page=367ff}}</ref> The term defixio is derived from the Latin verb defigere, which means literally \"to pin down,\" but which was also associated with the idea of delivering someone to the powers of the underworld.<ref name=\"Crawley\" /> It was also possible to curse an enemy through a spoken word, either in his presence or behind his back. But due to numbers of curse tablets that have been found it would seem that this type of magic was considered more effective. The process involved writing the victim's name on a thin sheet of lead along with varying magical formulas or symbols, then burying the tablet in or near a tomb, a place of execution, or a battlefield, to give spirits of the dead power over the victim. Sometimes the curse tablets were even transfixed with various items \u2013 such as nails, which were believed to add magical potency.<ref name=\"Crawley\" />\n\nFor most magic acts or rituals, there existed magics to counter the effects. [[Amulet]]s were one of the most common protections (or counter-magics) used in the Greco-Roman world as protection against such fearful things as curses and the [[evil eye]]; which were seen as very real by most of its inhabitants.<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XXVIII:38, XXIX:66, XXX:138}} While amulets were often made of cheap materials, precious stones were believed to have special efficacy.

The scholarly consensus strongly suggests that although many testimonies about magic are relatively late, the practices they reveal are almost certainly much older. However the level of credence or efficacy given to magical practices in the early Greek and Roman worlds by comparison to the late Hellenistic period is not well known.\n\n== High and low magic ==\nMagical operations largely fall into two categories: [[theurgy]] ({{lang|grc|\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1}}) and [[goetia]] ({{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1}}).

However Barry Crawford, currently Co-Chair of the Society of Biblical Literature's Consultation on Redescribing Christian Origins, in his 1979 review of the book states that \"Smith exhibits an intricate knowledge of the magical papyri, but his ignorance of current Gospel research is abysmal\", concluding that the work has traits of a conspiracy theory.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Barry|last=Crawford|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|date=1979|pages=321\u201322}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\nSimon is the name of a magus mentioned in the canonical book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 8:9ff, in apocryphal texts and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite book|first=R.S.|last=Casey|title=Beginnings of Christianity|chapter=5|pages=151ff}}</ref> In the Book of Acts Simon the Magus is presented as being deeply impressed by the apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]]'s cures and [[exorcisms]] and by the gift of the Spirit that came from the apostles\u2019 laying on of hands; therefore, he \"believed and was baptized\". But Simon asks the apostles to sell him their special gift so that he can practice it too. This seems to represent the attitude of a professional magician. In other words, for Simon, the power of this new movement is a kind of magic that can be purchased \u2013 perhaps a common practice for magicians in parts of the Greco-Roman world. The Apostles response to Simon was emphatic in its rejection. The early church drew a strong line of demarcation between what it practiced and the practices of magic users.<ref group=notes>There is a parallel story in Acts 13:6\u201312.

But whether magic is viewed negatively or positively the substance of it as a practice can be drawn out. That is, that magic was a practice aimed at trying to locate and control the secret forces of the cosmos, and the sympathies and antipathies that were seen to make up these forces.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n== Authors of the Roman Empire ==\nThe ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] (CE 23/24-79)<ref name=pliny /> is a voluminous survey of knowledge of the late Hellenistic era, based according to Pliny on a hundred or so earlier authorities. This rather extensive work deals with an amazing variety of issues: cosmology, geography, anthropology, zoology, botany, pharmacology, mineralogy, metallurgy and many others. Pliny was convinced of the powers of certain herbs or roots as revealed to humanity by the gods. Pliny argued that the divine powers in their concern for the welfare of humanity wish for humanity to discover the secrets of nature. Pliny indeed argues that in their wisdom the gods sought to bring humans gradually closer to their status; which certainly many magical traditions seek \u2013 that is by acquiring knowledge one can aspire to gain knowledge even from the gods. Pliny expresses a firm concept is firmly being able to understand this \"cosmic sympathy\" that, if properly understood and used, operates for the good of humanity.<ref name=pliny />{{rp|II:62}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Dodds|first=E.

Pliny argues that the claims of the professional magicians were either exaggerated or simply false.<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XXV:59, XXIX:20, XXVII:75}} Pliny expresses an interesting concept when he states that those sorcerers who had written down their spells and recipes despised and hated humanity (for spreading their lies perhaps?).<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XXVII:40}} To show this Pliny link arts of the magicians of Rome with the emperor Nero (who is often portrayed negatively), whom Pliny claims had studied magic with the best teachers and had access to the best books, but was unable to do anything extraordinary.<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XXX:5\u20136}}\n\nPliny's conclusion, however, is cautious: though magic is ineffective and infamous, it nevertheless contains \"shadows of truth\", particularly of the \"arts of making poisons\". Yet, Pliny states, \"there is no one who is not afraid of spells\" (including himself presumably).<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XXVIII:4}} The amulets and charms that people wore as a kind of preventive medicine he neither commends or condemns, but instead suggests that it is better to err on the side of caution, for, who knows, a new kind of magic, a magic that really works, may be developed at any time.<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XXVIII:4}}\n\nIf such an attitude prevailed in the Greco-Roman world this may explain why professional magicians, such as [[Simon Magus]], were on the lookout for new ideas.

Hanson, Metamorphoses (Cambridge, London: Harvard University Press, 1989).{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref> gives us a substantial amount of information on contemporary beliefs in magic, though perhaps through no initial choice of his own. Apuleius was accused of practicing magic, something outlawed under Roman law. The speech he delivered in his own defense against the charge of magic, in c. 160 CE, remains and it is from this Apologia that we learn how easy it was, at that time, for a philosopher to be accused of magical practices.<ref name=\"Apuleius\"/>{{rp|loc=Introduction}} Perhaps in a turn of irony or even a tacit admission of guilt, Apuleius, in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (or ''[[The Golden Ass]]''), which perhaps has autobiographical elements, allows the hero, Lucius, to dabble in magic as a young man, get into trouble, be rescued by the goddess Isis, and then finds true knowledge and happiness in her mysteries.<ref name=\"Tatum_28_29\">{{cite book|first=J.|last=Tatum|title=Apuleius and the Golden Ass|url=https://archive.org/details/apuleiusgoldenas0000tatu|url-access=registration|location=Ithaca, New York|publisher= Cornell University Press|date=1979|pages=[https://archive.org/details/apuleiusgoldenas0000tatu/page/28 28\u201329]}}</ref>\n\nLike Plutarch, Apuleius seems to take for granted the existence of daemons. They populate the air and seem to, in fact, be formed of air. They experience emotions just like human beings, and despite this their minds are rational.<ref name=\"Tatum_28_29\" /> In light of Apuleuis\u2019 experience it is worth noting that when magic is mentioned in Roman laws, it is always discussed in a negative context. A consensus was established quite early in Roman history for the banning of anything viewed as harmful acts of magic. The laws of the [[Twelve Tables]] (451\u2013450 BCE) for example expressly forbid anyone from enticing his neighbors\u2019 crops into his fields by magic.<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Cavendish|title=History of Magic|location=London|publisher=Arkana|date=1987|page= 8}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=September 2008}} An actual trial for alleged violation of these laws was held before [[Spurius Albinus]] in 157 BCE.<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XVIII:41\u201343}} It is also recorded that [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Hispanus|Cornelius Hispanus]] expelled the [[Chaldea]]n [[astrologers]] from Rome in 139 BCE ostensibly on the grounds that they were magicians.<ref name=\"Tavenner_13\">{{cite book|first=Eugene|last=Tavenner|title=Studies in Magic from Latin Literature|page=13}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 33 BCE, astrologers and magicians are explicitly mentioned as having been driven from Rome.<ref name=\"Tavenner_13\" /> Twenty years later, [[Augustus]] ordered all books on the magical arts to be burned. In 16 CE magicians and astrologers were expelled from Italy, and this was reinstated by edicts of [[Vespasian]] in 69 CE and Domitian in 89 CE. The emperor [[Constantine I]] in the 4th century CE issued a ruling to cover all charges of magic. In it he distinguished between helpful charms, not punishable, and antagonistic spells.<ref>{{cite book|last=Liebeschuetz|title=Continuity and Change in Roman Religion|pages=126\u201339}}</ref> In these cases Roman authorities specifically decided what forms of magic were acceptable and which were not. Those that were not acceptable were termed \"magic\"; those that were acceptable were usually defined as traditions of the state or practices of the state's religions.\n\n== Summary ==\nJohn Middleton argues in his article \"Theories of Magic\"\" in the ''Encyclopaedia of Religion'' that:\n\n''Magic is usually defined subjectively rather than by any agreed upon content. But there is a wide consensus as to what this content is. Most peoples in the world perform acts by which they intend to bring about certain events or conditions, whether in nature or among people, that they hold to be the consequences of those acts.''<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=John|last=Middleton|title= Theories of Magic|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Religion|volume=9|page=82}}</ref>\n\nUnder this view, the various aspects of magic that described, despite how the term \"magic\" may be defined by various groupings within the Greco-Roman world, is in fact part of a broader cosmology shared by most people in the ancient world. But it is important to seek an understanding of the way that groups separate power from power, thus \"magic\" often describes an art or practices that are much more specific. This art is probably best described, as being the manipulation of physical objects and cosmic forces, through the recitation of formulas and incantations by a specialist (that is a magus) on behalf of him/herself or a client to bring about control over or action in the divine realms. The Magical texts examined in this article, then, are ritual texts designed to manipulate divine powers for the benefit of either the user or clients. Because this was something done in secret or with foreign methods these texts represent an art that was generally looked upon as illegitimate by official or mainstream magical cults in societies.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Curse tablet]]\n* [[Ephesia Grammata]]\n* [[Folk religion]]\n* [[Greek Magical Papyri]]\n* [[Magi]]\n* [[Magic and religion]]\n* [[Ancient Greek religion]]\n* [[Religion in ancient Rome]]\n* [[Sex magic]]\n* [[Theurgy]]\n* [[Alchemy]]\n** [[Hermes Trismegistus]]\n* [[Goetia]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n== References ==\n; Citations\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Disputed list|date=September 2008}}\n{{colbegin}}\n* Apollonius, Rhodius, and Peter Green.

Circe is presented as being in the form of a beautiful woman (a temptress) when Odysseus encounters her on an island. In this encounter Circe uses her wand to change Odysseus\u2019 companions into swine. This may suggest that magic was associated (in this time) with practices that went against the natural order, or against wise and good forces (Circe is called a witch by a companion of Odysseus).<ref name=odyssey />{{rp|X:43}} In this mode it is worth noting that Circe is representative of a power (the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]) that had been conquered by the younger [[Olympian gods]] such as [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]] and [[Hades]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Hesiod|title=Theogony|trans-title=Birth of the Gods|translator = S.

Many of these references representing a more positive conceptualisation of magic. Among the most famous of these Greek magoi, between Homer and the Hellenistic period, are the figures of [[Orpheus]], [[Pythagoras]], and [[Empedocles]].\n\n====Orpheus====\nOrpheus is a mythical figure, said to have lived in [[Thrace]] \"a generation before Homer\" (though he is in fact depicted on 5th-century ceramics in Greek costume).<ref name=drury>{{cite book|last=Drury|first=Nevill|title=Magic and Witchcraft: From Shamanism to the Technopagans|location=London|publisher=Thames & Hudson|date=2003}}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=September 2008}} Orphism, or the Orphic Mysteries, seems also to have been central to the personages of Pythagoras and Empedocles who lived in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE.

Individuals might have the gift of healing, or the gift of prophecy, but are not usually credited with a wide range of supernatural powers as are magoi like Orpheus, Pythagoras and Empedocles. Plato reflects such an attitude in his Laws (933a-e) where he takes healers, prophets and [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] for granted. He acknowledges that these practitioners existed in Athens (and thus presumably in other Greek cities), and they had to be reckoned with and controlled by laws; but one should not be afraid of them, their powers are real, but they themselves represent a rather low order of humanity. An early Christian analogy is found in the 1st century CE writings of the Apostle Paul. Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians conceptualizes the idea of a limitation of spiritual gifts.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Bible|volume=1 Corinthians|chapter=12:7\u201311}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}</ref>{{Original research inline|date=September 2008}}\n\n===Magic in the Hellenistic period===\nThe Hellenistic period (roughly the last three centuries BCE) is characterized by an avid interest in magic, though this may simply be because from this period a greater abundance of texts, both literary and some from actual practitioners, in Greek and in Latin remains. In fact many of the [[Greek Magical Papyri|magical papyri]] that are extant were written in the 1st centuries of the [[Common Era]], but their concepts, formulas and rituals reflect the earlier Hellenistic period, that is, a time when the systematization of magic in the Greco-Roman world seems to have taken place\u2014particularly in the \u2018melting pot\u2019 of varying cultures that was Egypt under the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] and under Rome.{{Original research inline|date=September 2008}}\n\nThe ascendancy of Christianity by the fifth century had much to do with this.

Various versions of the \"Eighth Book of Moses\" appear in PGM XIII.1\u2013343; 343\u2013646; 646\u2013734, followed by a \"Tenth (?)

So in other words the magic requires certain ingredients, much as Odysseus required the herb Moly to defeat the magic of Circe. But it is not just as simple as knowing how to put a recipe together. Appropriate gestures, at certain points in the magical ritual, are required to accompany the ingredients, different gestures it would seem produce various effects. A magical ritual done in the right way can guarantee the revealing of dreams and the rather useful talent of interpreting them correctly. In other cases certain spells allow one to send out a daemon or daemons to harm one's enemies or even to break up someone's marriage.\n\nThis self-defined negative aspect to magic (as opposed to other groups defining your practices as negative even if you don\u2019t) is found in various \u2018[[curse tablet]]s,\u2019 (tabellae defixionum) left to us from the Greco-Roman world.<ref name=\"Crawley\">{{cite encyclopedia|first=A.E.|last=Crawley|title=Curses|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of religion and Ethics|volume=4|page=367ff}}</ref> The term defixio is derived from the Latin verb defigere, which means literally \"to pin down,\" but which was also associated with the idea of delivering someone to the powers of the underworld.<ref name=\"Crawley\" /> It was also possible to curse an enemy through a spoken word, either in his presence or behind his back. But due to numbers of curse tablets that have been found it would seem that this type of magic was considered more effective. The process involved writing the victim's name on a thin sheet of lead along with varying magical formulas or symbols, then burying the tablet in or near a tomb, a place of execution, or a battlefield, to give spirits of the dead power over the victim. Sometimes the curse tablets were even transfixed with various items \u2013 such as nails, which were believed to add magical potency.<ref name=\"Crawley\" />\n\nFor most magic acts or rituals, there existed magics to counter the effects. [[Amulet]]s were one of the most common protections (or counter-magics) used in the Greco-Roman world as protection against such fearful things as curses and the [[evil eye]]; which were seen as very real by most of its inhabitants.<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XXVIII:38, XXIX:66, XXX:138}} While amulets were often made of cheap materials, precious stones were believed to have special efficacy.

The scholarly consensus strongly suggests that although many testimonies about magic are relatively late, the practices they reveal are almost certainly much older. However the level of credence or efficacy given to magical practices in the early Greek and Roman worlds by comparison to the late Hellenistic period is not well known.\n\n== High and low magic ==\nMagical operations largely fall into two categories: [[theurgy]] ({{lang|grc|\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1}}) and [[goetia]] ({{lang|grc|\u03b3\u03bf\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1}}).

However Barry Crawford, currently Co-Chair of the Society of Biblical Literature's Consultation on Redescribing Christian Origins, in his 1979 review of the book states that \"Smith exhibits an intricate knowledge of the magical papyri, but his ignorance of current Gospel research is abysmal\", concluding that the work has traits of a conspiracy theory.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Barry|last=Crawford|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|date=1979|pages=321\u201322}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\nSimon is the name of a magus mentioned in the canonical book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 8:9ff, in apocryphal texts and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite book|first=R.S.|last=Casey|title=Beginnings of Christianity|chapter=5|pages=151ff}}</ref> In the Book of Acts Simon the Magus is presented as being deeply impressed by the apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]]'s cures and [[exorcisms]] and by the gift of the Spirit that came from the apostles\u2019 laying on of hands; therefore, he \"believed and was baptized\". But Simon asks the apostles to sell him their special gift so that he can practice it too. This seems to represent the attitude of a professional magician. In other words, for Simon, the power of this new movement is a kind of magic that can be purchased \u2013 perhaps a common practice for magicians in parts of the Greco-Roman world. The Apostles response to Simon was emphatic in its rejection. The early church drew a strong line of demarcation between what it practiced and the practices of magic users.<ref group=notes>There is a parallel story in Acts 13:6\u201312. (though in this case perhaps an insider being chastised).{{Original research inline|date=September 2008}}</ref> As the church continued to develop this demarcation Simon comes under even greater scrutiny in later Christian texts. The prominent Christian author [[Justin Martyr]] for example, claims that Simon was a magus of [[Samaria]], and that his followers committed the [[blasphemy]] of worshiping Simon as God.<ref>{{cite book|first=Justin|last=Martyr|title=Dialogue with Trypho|chapter=120}}</ref> The veracity of this is not certain, but proves the desire of the early Christians to escape an association with magic.\n\nThe third magus of interest in the period of the Roman Empire is [[Apollonius of Tyana]] (c. 40 AD-c. 120 AD).<ref name=maria>{{cite book|first=Maria|last=Dzielska|authorlink=Maria Dzielska|title=Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History|location=Rome|date=1986}}</ref>{{rp|30\u201338}} Between 217 and 238 Flavius [[Philostratus]] wrote his ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'', a lengthy, but unreliable novelistic source.<ref name=maria />{{rp|12\u201349, 140\u2013142}} Philostratus was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the empress [[Julia Domna]], mother of the emperor [[Caracalla]]. According to him, she owned the memoirs of one [[Damis]], an alleged disciple of Apollonius, and gave these to Philostratus as the raw material for a literary treatment. Some scholars believe the memoirs of Damis are an invention of Philostratus, others think it was a real book forged by someone else and used by Philostratus. The latter possibility is more likely. In any case it is a literary fake.<ref name=maria />{{rp|12\u201313, 19\u201349, 141}}<ref>{{cite book|first=Jaap-Jan|last= Flinterman|title=Power, Paideia and Pythagoreanism|location=Amsterdam|date=1995|pages=79\u201388}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}</ref> From Philostratus\u2019 biography Apollonius emerges as an ascetic traveling teacher. He is usually labeled a new Pythagoras, and at the very least he does represent the same combination of philosopher and magus that Pythagoras was. According to Philostratus Apollonius traveled far and wide, as far as India, teaching ideas reasonably consistent with traditional Pythagorean doctrine; but in fact, it is most likely that he never left the [[Greek East]] of the Roman Empire.<ref name=maria />{{rp|19\u201384}} In Late Antiquity [[Amulet|talismans]] allegedly made by Apollonius appeared in several Greek cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, as if they were sent from heaven.

Some Talmudic teachers (and many Greeks and Romans) considered Jesus a magician, and magical books such as the ''Testament of Solomon'' and the ''Eighth Book of Moses'' were ascribed to Solomon and Moses in antiquity.<ref name=luck />{{rp|57}} The ''[[Wisdom of Solomon]]'', a book considered [[apocryphal]] by many contemporary Jews and Christians (probably composed in the first century BCE) claims that\n{{quote|God... gave me true knowledge of things, as they are: an understanding of the structure of the world and the way in which elements work, the beginning and the end of eras and what lies in-between... the cycles of the years and the constellations... the thoughts of men... the power of spirits... the virtue of roots...

The author of this apocryphal book was clearly familiar with Middle Platonism and may have belonged to the circle of Philo of Alexandria. {{Original research inline|date=September 2008}}</ref><ref name=mills />}}\nThus Solomon was seen as the greatest scientist, but also the greatest occultist of his time, learned in astrology, plant magic, daemonology, divination, and ''physika'' ({{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae}} \"science\").<ref name=luck />{{rp|58}}\nThese are the central aims of magic as an independent tradition \u2013 knowledge and power and control of the mysteries of the cosmos. Such aims can be viewed negatively or positively by ancient authors. The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] for example, writes that: \"God gave him [Solomon] knowledge of the art that is used against daemons, in order to heal and benefit men\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Josephus|first=Flavius|translator=William Whiston|title=The Works of Josephus : Complete and Unabridged|edition=New updated|location=Peabody, Mass|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|date=1987|chapter=: Antiq.

But whether magic is viewed negatively or positively the substance of it as a practice can be drawn out. That is, that magic was a practice aimed at trying to locate and control the secret forces of the cosmos, and the sympathies and antipathies that were seen to make up these forces.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n== Authors of the Roman Empire ==\nThe ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] (CE 23/24-79)<ref name=pliny /> is a voluminous survey of knowledge of the late Hellenistic era, based according to Pliny on a hundred or so earlier authorities. This rather extensive work deals with an amazing variety of issues: cosmology, geography, anthropology, zoology, botany, pharmacology, mineralogy, metallurgy and many others. Pliny was convinced of the powers of certain herbs or roots as revealed to humanity by the gods. Pliny argued that the divine powers in their concern for the welfare of humanity wish for humanity to discover the secrets of nature. Pliny indeed argues that in their wisdom the gods sought to bring humans gradually closer to their status; which certainly many magical traditions seek \u2013 that is by acquiring knowledge one can aspire to gain knowledge even from the gods. Pliny expresses a firm concept is firmly being able to understand this \"cosmic sympathy\" that, if properly understood and used, operates for the good of humanity.<ref name=pliny />{{rp|II:62}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Dodds|first=E. R.|title=The Ancient Concept of Progress and Other Essays on Greek Literature and Belief|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientconceptof0000dodd|url-access=registration|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|date=1973|page=[https://archive.org/details/ancientconceptof0000dodd/page/23 23]}}</ref>\n\nWhile here lies expressed the central tenets of magic Pliny is by means averse to using the term \"magic\" in a negative sense. Pliny argues that the claims of the professional magicians were either exaggerated or simply false.<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XXV:59, XXIX:20, XXVII:75}} Pliny expresses an interesting concept when he states that those sorcerers who had written down their spells and recipes despised and hated humanity (for spreading their lies perhaps?).<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XXVII:40}} To show this Pliny link arts of the magicians of Rome with the emperor Nero (who is often portrayed negatively), whom Pliny claims had studied magic with the best teachers and had access to the best books, but was unable to do anything extraordinary.<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XXX:5\u20136}}\n\nPliny's conclusion, however, is cautious: though magic is ineffective and infamous, it nevertheless contains \"shadows of truth\", particularly of the \"arts of making poisons\". Yet, Pliny states, \"there is no one who is not afraid of spells\" (including himself presumably).<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XXVIII:4}} The amulets and charms that people wore as a kind of preventive medicine he neither commends or condemns, but instead suggests that it is better to err on the side of caution, for, who knows, a new kind of magic, a magic that really works, may be developed at any time.<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XXVIII:4}}\n\nIf such an attitude prevailed in the Greco-Roman world this may explain why professional magicians, such as [[Simon Magus]], were on the lookout for new ideas. Pliny devotes the beginning of Book 30 of his work to the magi of Persia and refers to them here and there especially in Books 28 and 29.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=W. H.

E.|last=Harrison|title=Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion|edition=3rd|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1922|pages=4ff}}</ref> Plutarch defines \"'[[superstition]]\" as \"fear of the gods.\" Specifically, he mentions that fear of the gods leads to the need to resort to magical rites and [[taboo]]s, the consultation of professional sorcerers and witches, [[amulet]]s and [[incantation]]s, and unintelligible language in prayers addressed to the gods.<ref name=\"Brenk\">{{cite book|first=E.|last=Brenk|title=In Mist Apparelled: Religious Themes in Plutarch's \"Moralia\" and \"Lives\" |url=https://archive.org/details/inmistapparelled0000bren|url-access=registration|location=Leiden|publisher=E.J. Brill|date=1977|page= [https://archive.org/details/inmistapparelled0000bren/page/59 59]}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Plutarch himself takes [[dream]]s and [[omen]]s seriously, he reserves superstition for those who have excessive or exclusive faith in such phenomena.<ref name=\"Brenk\" /> Clearly, it is a matter of discrimination. He also takes for granted other magical practices, such as hurting someone by the evil eye.<ref name=\"Brenk\" /> He also believes in daemons that serve as agents or links between gods and human beings and are responsible for many supernatural events in human life that are commonly attributed to divine intervention.<ref name=\"Brenk\" /> Thus, a daemon, not [[Apollo]] himself, is the everyday power behind the [[Pythia]]. Some daemons are good, some are evil, but even the good ones, in moments of anger, can do harmful acts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dillon|title=Middle Platonists|pages= 216ff}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref> In general then, Plutarch actually accepts much of what we today might define as superstition in itself.  So what he is really defining as superstition are those practices not compatible with his own philosophical doctrine.\n\nA later [[Platonist]], [[Apuleius]] (born c. 125),<ref name=\"Apuleius\">Apuleius. and John A. Hanson, Metamorphoses (Cambridge, London: Harvard University Press, 1989).{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref> gives us a substantial amount of information on contemporary beliefs in magic, though perhaps through no initial choice of his own. Apuleius was accused of practicing magic, something outlawed under Roman law. The speech he delivered in his own defense against the charge of magic, in c. 160 CE, remains and it is from this Apologia that we learn how easy it was, at that time, for a philosopher to be accused of magical practices.<ref name=\"Apuleius\"/>{{rp|loc=Introduction}} Perhaps in a turn of irony or even a tacit admission of guilt, Apuleius, in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (or ''[[The Golden Ass]]''), which perhaps has autobiographical elements, allows the hero, Lucius, to dabble in magic as a young man, get into trouble, be rescued by the goddess Isis, and then finds true knowledge and happiness in her mysteries.<ref name=\"Tatum_28_29\">{{cite book|first=J.|last=Tatum|title=Apuleius and the Golden Ass|url=https://archive.org/details/apuleiusgoldenas0000tatu|url-access=registration|location=Ithaca, New York|publisher= Cornell University Press|date=1979|pages=[https://archive.org/details/apuleiusgoldenas0000tatu/page/28 28\u201329]}}</ref>\n\nLike Plutarch, Apuleius seems to take for granted the existence of daemons. They populate the air and seem to, in fact, be formed of air. They experience emotions just like human beings, and despite this their minds are rational.<ref name=\"Tatum_28_29\" /> In light of Apuleuis\u2019 experience it is worth noting that when magic is mentioned in Roman laws, it is always discussed in a negative context. A consensus was established quite early in Roman history for the banning of anything viewed as harmful acts of magic. The laws of the [[Twelve Tables]] (451\u2013450 BCE) for example expressly forbid anyone from enticing his neighbors\u2019 crops into his fields by magic.<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Cavendish|title=History of Magic|location=London|publisher=Arkana|date=1987|page= 8}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=September 2008}} An actual trial for alleged violation of these laws was held before [[Spurius Albinus]] in 157 BCE.<ref name=pliny />{{rp|XVIII:41\u201343}} It is also recorded that [[Cornelius Hispallus]] expelled the [[Chaldea]]n [[astrologers]] from Rome in 139 BCE ostensibly on the grounds that they were magicians.<ref name=\"Tavenner_13\">{{cite book|first=Eugene|last=Tavenner|title=Studies in Magic from Latin Literature|page=13}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 33 BCE, astrologers and magicians are explicitly mentioned as having been driven from Rome.<ref name=\"Tavenner_13\" /> Twenty years later, [[Augustus]] ordered all books on the magical arts to be burned. In 16 CE magicians and astrologers were expelled from Italy, and this was reinstated by edicts of [[Vespasian]] in 69 CE and Domitian in 89 CE. The emperor [[Constantine I]] in the 4th century CE issued a ruling to cover all charges of magic. In it he distinguished between helpful charms, not punishable, and antagonistic spells.<ref>{{cite book|last=Liebeschuetz|title=Continuity and Change in Roman Religion|pages=126\u201339}}</ref> In these cases Roman authorities specifically decided what forms of magic were acceptable and which were not. Those that were not acceptable were termed \"magic\"; those that were acceptable were usually defined as traditions of the state or practices of the state's religions.\n\n== Summary ==\nJohn Middleton argues in his article \"Theories of Magic\"\" in the ''Encyclopaedia of Religion'' that:\n\n''Magic is usually defined subjectively rather than by any agreed upon content. But there is a wide consensus as to what this content is. Most peoples in the world perform acts by which they intend to bring about certain events or conditions, whether in nature or among people, that they hold to be the consequences of those acts.''<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=John|last=Middleton|title= Theories of Magic|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Religion|volume=9|page=82}}</ref>\n\nUnder this view, the various aspects of magic that described, despite how the term \"magic\" may be defined by various groupings within the Greco-Roman world, is in fact part of a broader cosmology shared by most people in the ancient world. But it is important to seek an understanding of the way that groups separate power from power, thus \"magic\" often describes an art or practices that are much more specific. This art is probably best described, as being the manipulation of physical objects and cosmic forces, through the recitation of formulas and incantations by a specialist (that is a magus) on behalf of him/herself or a client to bring about control over or action in the divine realms. The Magical texts examined in this article, then, are ritual texts designed to manipulate divine powers for the benefit of either the user or clients. Because this was something done in secret or with foreign methods these texts represent an art that was generally looked upon as illegitimate by official or mainstream magical cults in societies.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Curse tablet]]\n* [[Ephesia Grammata]]\n* [[Folk religion]]\n* [[Greek Magical Papyri]]\n* [[Magi]]\n* [[Magic and religion]]\n* [[Ancient Greek religion]]\n* [[Religion in ancient Rome]]\n* [[Sex magic]]\n* [[Theurgy]]\n* [[Alchemy]]\n** [[Hermes Trismegistus]]\n* [[Goetia]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n== References ==\n; Citations\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Disputed list|date=September 2008}}\n{{colbegin}}\n* Apollonius, Rhodius, and Peter Green.

There he was head of the department of physics (1964\u20131987) and college Vice President (1976\u20131987). He also served as chair of the School of Cosmic Physics at the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] (1970 to 1995).\n\n==Early life==\nFrank, as he was always known, was born on 8 June 1922 in [[Mallow, County Cork]] in the newly independent [[Republic of Ireland|Irish State]], the youngest son of John Wall Fahy (from Kilcrea, [[County Cork|Cork]]) and Nora O\u2019Sullivan (from Carigeen, Cork), who had settled in Mallow in 1915.<ref name=mathIreland>[http://www.mathsireland.ie/blog/2019_01_cm Physicist\u00a0Frank Fahy] Mathematics Ireland</ref> Frank attended Saint Patrick\u2019s National school and the Patrician Academy Secondary School, both in Mallow.  In 1939, he enrolled in Engineering at [[University College Cork]] (UCC), having a keen interest in mathematics.  His introduction to physics at UCC motivated a change in focus from engineering to physics, and in 1942 he graduated with a first class honours BSc in physics and mathematics.\n\n==Career==\nWith encouragement from Professor John McHenry, then head of the physics department at UCC, he went to study at [[University College Dublin]] (UCD), and in 1944 completed his MSc there, with a thesis on \"Problems on Atmospheric Electricity\" done under the direction of [[Patrick Joseph Nolan|P. J. Nolan]].   The same year, he was awarded a [[National University of Ireland]] (NUI) Travelling Studentship in physics, but due to WWII he first spent a year at [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] (DIAS).  The visiting programme gave him the opportunity to learn from many of the leading physicists of the day including [[Schr\u00f6dinger]], [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], [[Max Born|Born]] and \n[[Walter Heitler|Heitler]].  It was a productive year in which he also met his future wife, Brigid (Bridie) Lavelle, from [[County Donegal]].\n\nIn October 1945 he arrived at the [[University of Chicago]], at that time a world centre of nuclear physics where he had the opportunity to learn from [[Fermi]], [[Edward Teller|Teller]] and others.  He was particularly influenced by Fermi, and he later adopted a similar presentation style whose goal was always to simplify and demystify physics.  In 1951, he was awarded his PhD for a thesis on \"Investigations on Large Cosmic-ray Bursts\" done under [[Marcel Schein]].\n  \nIn 1950 he accepted a position as assistant professor in the physics department at [[Marquette University]] [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], where his young family settled.  In 1948 he had married Bridie Lavelle in Chicago, and by the time he returned to UCC in 1952, the couple had three children.\n\nAt UCC in the 1950s and 1960s, Frank turned his attention to expanding and enhancing the physics teaching programme there, especially at the undergraduate level.  He became Professor of Physics in 1961, and department head in 1964, a position he held until his retirement in 1987.

In 1957 he graduated from high school in stanitsa [[Tbilisskaya]], [[Krasnodar Region]] and entered the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of [[National University of Kharkiv|University of Kharkov]] in [[Kharkov]], [[Ukraine]]. After graduating from the university in 1962 he was sent to work to the theoretical division of the [[Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology]], where he worked as an intern researcher, junior researcher and researcher until 1971.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1991 he worked as a senior and leading researcher of the Department of Theoretical Physics at the [[Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics|Institute of Nuclear Physics]] of the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences, [[Novosibirsk]].\n\nFrom 1991 to 2014 he worked at the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics of the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]], [[Dubna]], in the position of master and chief scientific officer.\n\nIn 1971 he defended his doctoral thesis on \u00abThe inelastic processes of quantum electrodynamics at high energies\u00bb. In 1985 he received the diploma of senior researcher and in 2005 the title of professor.\n\n== Scientific activity ==\n\nEduard Kuraev was a well\u2013known expert in the field of quantum field theory and elementary particle physics. He is an author of over 250 scientific papers, including 2 monographs.\n\nThe main scientific results of Eduard Kuraev are:\n* Calculated the differential and total cross sections for the processes of quantum electrodynamics, reaching into an electron\u2013positron, the electron\u2013proton, electron\u2013photon and photon\u2013photon colliding beams (colliders).\n* Obtained a system of equations of the renormalization-group operators in quantum electrodynamics which is the basis of the method of structure functions to calculate radiative corrections to the cross sections of different processes with the accuracy required by modern experiments. The method is applied to a number of processes studied at colliders.\n* In the framework of QCD processes in peripheral kinematics proved fair description in terms of the gluon Regge trajectories. The equation for the amplitude of the inelastic interactions of hadrons at high energies \u2014 the equation of Balitsky, [[Victor Sergeevich Fadin|Fadin]], Kuraev, [[Lev Lipatov|Lipatov]] (BFKL equation).\n* Constructed a system of equations of evolution operators twist 2 and 3 in the various field theories \u2014 scalar and vector electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics. Developed the procedure of constructing the equations of evolution operators of arbitrary twist.\n* \u0421onducted a number of high\u2013precision calculations of the cross sections of processes and decay widths of the particles in the Standard Model of electroweak interactions.\n\nEdward Kuraev was co-leader of the project \u00abStandard Model and its extensions\u00bb in the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics at [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research|JINR]]. He was known as an expert on the calculation of radiative corrections in the framework of the Standard Model. He participated in the expert group on the formation of the scientific program of physical facilities like Panda (DESY, Germany), BES III (Beijing, China), CMD2 (Novosibirsk, Russia).\n\nFor 30 years E.A. Kuraev had an intense pedagogical activity \u2014 read lectures of theoretical physics at the Moscow Institute of Radio Electronics and Automation (Technical University) and Kuban State University, was the head of 8 postgraduates. He produced several manuals for students and postgraduates \u2014 the statistical and mathematical physics, the Standard Model, the theory of strings, the physics of low\u2013energy mesons.

Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (1971).\n\n== Biography ==\n\nEduard A. Kuraev was born in [[Apsheronsk]], [[Krasnodar region]]. In 1957 he graduated from high school in stanitsa [[Tbilisskaya]], [[Krasnodar Region]] and entered the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of [[National University of Kharkiv|University of Kharkov]] in [[Kharkov]], [[Ukraine]]. After graduating from the university in 1962 he was sent to work to the theoretical division of the [[Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology]], where he worked as an intern researcher, junior researcher and researcher until 1971.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1991 he worked as a senior and leading researcher of the Department of Theoretical Physics at the [[Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics|Institute of Nuclear Physics]] of the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences, [[Novosibirsk]].\n\nFrom 1991 to 2014 he worked at the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics of the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]], [[Dubna]], in the position of master and chief scientific officer.\n\nIn 1971 he defended his doctoral thesis on \u00abThe inelastic processes of quantum electrodynamics at high energies\u00bb. In 1985 he received the diploma of senior researcher and in 2005 the title of professor.\n\n== Scientific activity ==\n\nEduard Kuraev was a well\u2013known expert in the field of quantum field theory and elementary particle physics. He is an author of over 250 scientific papers, including 2 monographs.\n\nThe main scientific results of Eduard Kuraev are:\n* Calculated the differential and total cross sections for the processes of quantum electrodynamics, reaching into an electron\u2013positron, the electron\u2013proton, electron\u2013photon and photon\u2013photon colliding beams (colliders).\n* Obtained a system of equations of the renormalization-group operators in quantum electrodynamics which is the basis of the method of structure functions to calculate radiative corrections to the cross sections of different processes with the accuracy required by modern experiments. The method is applied to a number of processes studied at colliders.\n* In the framework of QCD processes in peripheral kinematics proved fair description in terms of the gluon Regge trajectories. The equation for the amplitude of the inelastic interactions of hadrons at high energies \u2014 the equation of Balitsky, [[Victor Sergeevich Fadin|Fadin]], Kuraev, [[Lev Lipatov|Lipatov]] (BFKL equation).\n* Constructed a system of equations of evolution operators twist 2 and 3 in the various field theories \u2014 scalar and vector electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics. Developed the procedure of constructing the equations of evolution operators of arbitrary twist.\n* \u0421onducted a number of high\u2013precision calculations of the cross sections of processes and decay widths of the particles in the Standard Model of electroweak interactions.\n\nEdward Kuraev was co-leader of the project \u00abStandard Model and its extensions\u00bb in the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics at [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research|JINR]]. He was known as an expert on the calculation of radiative corrections in the framework of the Standard Model. He participated in the expert group on the formation of the scientific program of physical facilities like Panda (DESY, Germany), BES III (Beijing, China), CMD2 (Novosibirsk, Russia).\n\nFor 30 years E.A. Kuraev had an intense pedagogical activity \u2014 read lectures of theoretical physics at the Moscow Institute of Radio Electronics and Automation (Technical University) and Kuban State University, was the head of 8 postgraduates. He produced several manuals for students and postgraduates \u2014 the statistical and mathematical physics, the Standard Model, the theory of strings, the physics of low\u2013energy mesons. He also actively participated in various schools for graduate students and young scientists are regularly presented papers and lectures at the Winter school PNPI (Saint\u2013Petersburg), Baikal Young Scientists School on Fundamental Physics (Irkutsk), schools on topical problems of physics of the microworld (Gomel, Belarus). He repeatedly performed at the Academic Council BLTP, made presentations at scientific conferences and seminars in Russia and abroad.\n\nE.A.

Founded in 1876, the [[DAX 30]] company is organized into three globally operating business units (Laundry & Home Care, Beauty Care, Adhesive Technologies) and is known for brands such as [[Loctite]], [[Persil]], and [[Fa (brand)|Fa]] amongst others.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2017, Henkel reported sales of over 20 billion euros and an operating profit of 3.055 billion euros. More than 80 percent of its 53,700 employees work outside of Germany.<ref name=\"AR2017\" />\n\n==History<!--'Hans Schwarzkopf' redirects here-->==\nThe company was founded in 1876 in [[Aachen]] as Henkel & Cie<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Henkel-KGaA-Company-History.html |title=History of Henkel KGaA \u2013 FundingUniverse |website=Fundinguniverse.com |date= |accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref> by [[Friedrich Karl Henkel]] (a 28-year-old merchant who was interested in science) and two more partners. They marketed his first product, \"Universalwaschmittel\", a universal detergent based on silicate.\n\nIn 1878, to take advantage of the better transport links and sales opportunities, Henkel relocated his company to D\u00fcsseldorf on the Rhine (its present site). D\u00fcsseldorf was the gateway to the Ruhr region, which became the most important industrial area of the German Empire from the 19th century onward. That year, the first German brand-name detergent appeared: Henkel's Bleich-Soda [Bleaching Soda], an affordably-priced product supplied in sturdy paper bags. Made from [[sodium silicate|water-glass]] and [[sodium carbonate|soda]], it was the result of Fritz Henkel's own research. The soda was obtained from Matthes & Weber in [[Duisburg]] (Henkel bought this company in 1917 and sold it in 1994).\n\nIn 1879, Fritz Henkel was entered as the sole owner in the register of companies. Sales of Henkel's Bleaching Soda increased so rapidly that within just one year the rented factory on the Sch\u00fctzenstra\u00dfe in D\u00fcsseldorf was unable to meet the demand. Fritz Henkel decided to build his own factory with a railway link.\n\nIn 1883, to improve liquidity and make better use of the company's travelling sales staff, Fritz Henkel decided to sell merchandise in addition to his detergents. Sales started in 1884. The range included the colorant [[ultramarine]] [laundry bluing agent], gloss [[starch]], a liquid [[cleaning agent]], a pomade for cleaning, [[beef extract]], and a hair [[pomade]]. Very soon Henkel developed its international presence\u2014in 1886, Henkel opened its first international sales office in Austria. Carl Pathe had gone to Vienna as a representative the year before. In 1893, Henkel established its first business links with England and Italy.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-09625-0002, Berlin, Alexanderplatz, Persil-Werbung.jpg|thumb|left|Henkel mural in [[Berlin]], 1951]]\n\nIn 1903, Schwarzkopf, founded by '''Hans Schwarzkopf'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (1874, [[Danzig]] \u2013 12 February 1921, [[Berlin]]), launched a [[head shampoo|powder shampoo]]. Persil came in 1907 as the first \"self-acting laundry detergent.\"\n\nHenkel has been a family-run business since the beginning. In 1893, Fritz Henkel, Jr. (1875\u20131930) joined the firm as an apprentice. After receiving commercial training he became his father's right-hand man in commercial matters. He put Henkel's brand-name product business on a sound footing, developed its already successful advertising still further and was responsible for the company's field service. On 25 July 1904, he became a partner in Henkel, which was transformed into a general commercial partnership. By this time, 110 people were employed at the [[D\u00fcsseldorf-Holthausen|Holthausen]] site. On 25 April 1905, Dr. [[Hugo Henkel]] (1881\u20131952), the youngest son of Fritz Henkel, Sr., joined the company as a chemist. He was in charge of Chemical Products and Technology. Over the years, he laid the foundations of systematic research and introduced advanced technologies and new raw materials. In 1908, he became a personally liable partner in the company.\n\nIn 1912, total production in D\u00fcsseldorf-Holthausen rose to 49,890 tons. At 19,750 tons, Persil laundry detergent accounted for 40 percent of this, just five years after its market launch. The number of employees increased by 89 relative to the previous year, resulting in a total workforce of 1,024. Around half were female. A first-aid center was set up in the plant and a full-time nurse was employed. In the previous year Henkel had installed ball fields and play areas to encourage exercise during break times. Female employees could attend the plant's own housekeeping school during the lunch break.\n\nOn 11 January 1923, troops from France and Belgium [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Rhineland]]. The occupation made delivery of adhesives from suppliers used for the packaging of Persil unreliable. The disruption caused Henkel to internally manufacture adhesives for its own needs. Henkel found there was a demand for adhesives on the market, and on 22 June 1923, the first adhesive shipment left the plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.henkel.com/cps/rde/xchg/henkel_com/hs.xsl/11813_COE_HTML.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505222006/http://henkel.com/cps/rde/xchg/henkel_com/hs.xsl/11813_COE_HTML.htm |archivedate=5 May 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1930 [[Hugo Henkel]] took charge of the company.

On 5 June, the British military command in D\u00fcsseldorf took over from the Americans. From 20 July, the [[Control Commission for Germany - British Element|British military government]] gradually granted permission for the production of adhesives, P3 and water-glass by Henkel, and for soaps and detergents as well as shoe polish by Thompson. In February 1946, Matthes & Weber in Duisburg was given permission to process available raw materials into soda. On 20 September 1945, five members of the Henkel family and another seven members of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board were interned.\n\nIn 1949, the launch of Schauma shampoo by Schwarzkopf marked the start of the most successful German shampoos.\n\nIn 1954, Henkel-subsidiary Dreiring launched Fa soap, a new type of toilet [[soap]].

It is a multinational company active both in the consumer and industrial sector. Founded in 1876, the [[DAX 30]] company is organized into three globally operating business units (Laundry & Home Care, Beauty Care, Adhesive Technologies) and is known for brands such as [[Loctite]], [[Persil]], and [[Fa (brand)|Fa]] amongst others.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2017, Henkel reported sales of over 20 billion euros and an operating profit of 3.055 billion euros.

They marketed his first product, \"Universalwaschmittel\", a universal detergent based on silicate.\n\nIn 1878, to take advantage of the better transport links and sales opportunities, Henkel relocated his company to D\u00fcsseldorf on the Rhine (its present site). D\u00fcsseldorf was the gateway to the Ruhr region, which became the most important industrial area of the German Empire from the 19th century onward. That year, the first German brand-name detergent appeared: Henkel's Bleich-Soda [Bleaching Soda], an affordably-priced product supplied in sturdy paper bags. Made from [[sodium silicate|water-glass]] and [[sodium carbonate|soda]], it was the result of Fritz Henkel's own research. The soda was obtained from Matthes & Weber in [[Duisburg]] (Henkel bought this company in 1917 and sold it in 1994).\n\nIn 1879, Fritz Henkel was entered as the sole owner in the register of companies. Sales of Henkel's Bleaching Soda increased so rapidly that within just one year the rented factory on the Sch\u00fctzenstra\u00dfe in D\u00fcsseldorf was unable to meet the demand. Fritz Henkel decided to build his own factory with a railway link.\n\nIn 1883, to improve liquidity and make better use of the company's travelling sales staff, Fritz Henkel decided to sell merchandise in addition to his detergents. Sales started in 1884. The range included the colorant [[ultramarine]] [laundry bluing agent], gloss [[starch]], a liquid [[cleaning agent]], a pomade for cleaning, [[beef extract]], and a hair [[pomade]]. Very soon Henkel developed its international presence\u2014in 1886, Henkel opened its first international sales office in Austria. Carl Pathe had gone to Vienna as a representative the year before. In 1893, Henkel established its first business links with England and Italy.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-09625-0002, Berlin, Alexanderplatz, Persil-Werbung.jpg|thumb|left|Henkel mural in [[Berlin]], 1951]]\n\nIn 1903, Schwarzkopf, founded by '''Hans Schwarzkopf'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (1874, [[Danzig]] \u2013 12 February 1921, [[Berlin]]), launched a [[head shampoo|powder shampoo]]. Persil came in 1907 as the first \"self-acting laundry detergent.\"\n\nHenkel has been a family-run business since the beginning. In 1893, Fritz Henkel, Jr. (1875\u20131930) joined the firm as an apprentice. After receiving commercial training he became his father's right-hand man in commercial matters. He put Henkel's brand-name product business on a sound footing, developed its already successful advertising still further and was responsible for the company's field service. On 25 July 1904, he became a partner in Henkel, which was transformed into a general commercial partnership. By this time, 110 people were employed at the [[D\u00fcsseldorf-Holthausen|Holthausen]] site. On 25 April 1905, Dr. [[Hugo Henkel]] (1881\u20131952), the youngest son of Fritz Henkel, Sr., joined the company as a chemist. He was in charge of Chemical Products and Technology. Over the years, he laid the foundations of systematic research and introduced advanced technologies and new raw materials. In 1908, he became a personally liable partner in the company.\n\nIn 1912, total production in D\u00fcsseldorf-Holthausen rose to 49,890 tons. At 19,750 tons, Persil laundry detergent accounted for 40 percent of this, just five years after its market launch. The number of employees increased by 89 relative to the previous year, resulting in a total workforce of 1,024. Around half were female. A first-aid center was set up in the plant and a full-time nurse was employed. In the previous year Henkel had installed ball fields and play areas to encourage exercise during break times. Female employees could attend the plant's own housekeeping school during the lunch break.\n\nOn 11 January 1923, troops from France and Belgium [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Rhineland]].

Electrocop's stunning visuals and sounds make it fun to watch, but whether you'd buy a game for its razzle-dazzle is a personal decision.\" Giving a final score of 7 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNec\"/>\n\n=== Legacy ===\nIn recent years, Greg Omi has stated that no sequel was ever planned to be in development.<ref name=\"GOECTttmbtC!\"/> In [[1993 in video gaming|1993]], Atari Corp. requested several Epyx titles in order to be converted and release to the then-upcoming Atari Jaguar, with ''Electrocop'' among the list of selected titles, although no actual development on a Jaguar version was ever started.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dragon|first=Lost|url=http://forums.atari.io/index.php/topic/3333-the-epyx-titles-atari-wanted-on-lynx/|title=The EPYX Titles Atari Wanted on Lynx...|website=atari.io|date=July 6, 2017|accessdate=2019-04-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320105443/http://forums.atari.io/index.php/topic/3333-the-epyx-titles-atari-wanted-on-lynx/|archivedate=20 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://atariage.com/software_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=1863 ''Electrocop''] at [[AtariAge]]\n* [https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/lynx/586944-electrocop ''Electrocop''] at [[GameFAQs]]\n* [https://www.giantbomb.com/electrocop/3030-11150/ ''Electrocop''] at [[Giant Bomb]]\n* [https://www.mobygames.com/game/electrocop ''Electrocop''] at [[MobyGames]]\n\n{{Portal bar|1980s|United States|Video games}}\n{{Atari Lynx games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electrocop}}\n[[Category:1989 video games]]\n[[Category:Action video games]]\n[[Category:Atari games]]\n[[Category:Atari Lynx games]]\n[[Category:Atari Lynx-only games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Atari 7800 games]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk video games]]\n[[Category:Epyx games]]\n[[Category:Launch titles]]\n[[Category:Minigames]]\n[[Category:Run and gun games]]\n[[Category:Science fiction video games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Third-person shooters]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Alex Rudis]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the 2060s]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the future]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Washington, D.C.]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Action video game from 1989 for the Atari Lynx}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title     = Electrocop\n|image     = Electrocop cover art.jpg\n|caption   = Cover art in all regions\n|developer = [[Epyx]]\n|publisher = {{vgrelease|[[North America|NA]]/[[Europe|EU]]|[[Atari Corporation]]|JP|Mumin Corporation}}\n|producer  = Greg Omi\n|designer  = Chuck Sommerville<br />Charlie Kellner<br />[[R.

Jung reviewed the game which was published to IGN Entertainment. In his final verdict he wrote \"This cart was a brilliant concept that didn't completely click; the race against the clock and the real-time exploration/combat elements are hampered with uninspired gameplay and little variety. Electrocop's stunning visuals and sounds make it fun to watch, but whether you'd buy a game for its razzle-dazzle is a personal decision.\" Giving a final score of 7 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNec\"/>\n\n=== Legacy ===\nIn recent years, Greg Omi has stated that no sequel was ever planned to be in development.<ref name=\"GOECTttmbtC!\"/> In [[1993 in video gaming|1993]], Atari Corp. requested several Epyx titles in order to be converted and release to the then-upcoming Atari Jaguar, with ''Electrocop'' among the list of selected titles, although no actual development on a Jaguar version was ever started.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dragon|first=Lost|url=http://forums.atari.io/index.php/topic/3333-the-epyx-titles-atari-wanted-on-lynx/|title=The EPYX Titles Atari Wanted on Lynx...|website=atari.io|date=July 6, 2017|accessdate=2019-04-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320105443/http://forums.atari.io/index.php/topic/3333-the-epyx-titles-atari-wanted-on-lynx/|archivedate=20 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://atariage.com/software_page.php?SoftwareLabelID=1863 ''Electrocop''] at [[AtariAge]]\n* [https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/lynx/586944-electrocop ''Electrocop''] at [[GameFAQs]]\n* [https://www.giantbomb.com/electrocop/3030-11150/ ''Electrocop''] at [[Giant Bomb]]\n* [https://www.mobygames.com/game/electrocop ''Electrocop''] at [[MobyGames]]\n\n{{Portal bar|1980s|United States|Video games}}\n{{Atari Lynx games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electrocop}}\n[[Category:1989 video games]]\n[[Category:Action video games]]\n[[Category:Atari games]]\n[[Category:Atari Lynx games]]\n[[Category:Atari Lynx-only games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Atari 7800 games]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk video games]]\n[[Category:Epyx games]]\n[[Category:Launch titles]]\n[[Category:Minigames]]\n[[Category:Run and gun games]]\n[[Category:Science fiction video games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Third-person shooters]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Alex Rudis]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the 2060s]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the future]]\n[[Category:Video games set in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Washington, D.C.]]\n", "name_user": "KGRAMR", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReception", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocop"}
