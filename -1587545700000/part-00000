They currently compete in the [[Premier League]], the highest level of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club play their home matches at [[Selhurst Park]].  \n\nThe historic origins of the club can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. It was here that the earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team first played as an amateur outfit in 1861. They competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. In 1895, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] inside its grounds. It was ten years later that the owners decided to form a new professional Palace club to play at the Cup Final venue. They stayed here until 1915, when the club were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.\n\nPalace joined the [[Football League]] in 1920, and have overall spent the majority of their league history competing in the top two tiers of English football. Since 1964, they have only dropped below the second tier once, for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. The club's highest ever league finish to date is third place in the old [[Football League First Division|First Division]], now known as the Premier League, achieved in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season. Palace were denied a place in Europe at the end of that season only because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club became one of the original founding members of the Premier League. Palace set two unwanted Premier League records for relegation, in [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393]] they were relegated on 49 points, which is still a record number of points for a relegated Premier League club and are the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League when finishing fourth from bottom in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], as it had been decided that the league would be reduced from 22 to 20 clubs for the following season. Palace have also been FA Cup finalists twice, losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on both occasions in [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]]. \n      \nThe club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were originally claret and blue, but in 1973 they decided to change to the red and blue vertical stripes now worn today. Palace have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], with whom they contest the [[M23 derby]] and also share rivalries with fellow [[South London derby|South London]] clubs [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}\n\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|left|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\n===Historic origins: The Exhibition Palace and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1854\u20131920)===\nIn 1854, the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. The original [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team were  an amateur outfit who first played here in 1861.<ref>The Origin of Crystal Palace FC, Volume I. Steve Martyniuk 2016.</ref> They competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]] before disappearing from historical records after a 0\u20133 defeat to [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the [[1875\u201376 FA Cup|1875\u201376]] FA Cup. In 1895, the [[Football Association]] found a new permanent venue for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] at the sports stadium situated inside the historic Palace grounds. Some years later the owners, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own professional football team to play at the stadium. The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. Although the Football Association disliked the idea of the owners of the Cup Final venue also possessing their own football team and initially rejected their proposal, a separate company was established to form and own the club.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed \"The Glaziers\", were founded on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] assistant secretary [[Edmund Goodman]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\">{{citation | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | title=History | publisher=[[CPFC]] | accessdate=14 October 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606051751/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | archive-date=6 June 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The club applied to enter the [[English Football League|Football League]] alongside another newly formed London club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

This achievement meant they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to win a championship in their first season as a league club. Palace then moved to the purpose-built stadium [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924, which is the ground the club still plays at today.<ref name=\"Business: Club History\"/><ref>King, pp.&nbsp;15\u201319</ref>\n\nThe opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], with Palace losing 0\u20131 in front of a crowd of 25,000. Finishing in twenty-first position, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before the [[Second World War]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League]]s. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]].\n\n===The Sixties: Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958\u201373)===\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]], who played for Real Madrid against Palace in 1962.  The ''Croydon Advertiser'' reported that his \"move that led to Madrid's fourth goal was conducted with effortless ease at walking pace.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=John|title=Nearly 25, 000 See Real Dazzle, But Palace Fight Back|newspaper=Croydon Advertiser|date=20 April 1962|page=24}}</ref> ]]\nThe club remained in Division Three South until [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] when the league was restructured which saw clubs in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace finished fourteenth \u2013 just below the cut \u2013 and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman [[Arthur Wait]] appointed the ex-[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1962 European Cup Final|European Cup final]]. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4\u20133. Although Rowe resigned due to health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]] and [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;19\u201320, 32\u20137</ref>\n\nPalace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5\u20130 home win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]] season. Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as manager in March 1973, with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.\n\n===Bouncing between the divisions (1973\u201384)===\nAfter the disappointment of relegation, worse was to follow for the club. Under the management of Allison, Palace were immediately relegated again finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375 season]]. It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\", and ended its association with claret and blue [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours by deciding to change to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the [[1975\u201376 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and Chelsea along the way. Allison resigned at the end of the 1975\u201376 campaign after failing to get the club out of the third tier, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace were promoted back to the top flight with successive promotions in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]] and [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]]; the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions.\n\nThat team from 1979 was dubbed \"The Team of the Eighties\", and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]] season. However financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that talented group of players, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. Palace were relegated from the First Division in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]]' takeover of the club. They struggled back in the second tier, and Noades even appointed the ex-[[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] manager [[Alan Mullery]], which was very unpopular with the Palace fans.\n\n===Steve Coppell years: FA Cup finalists and League title challengers (1984\u201393)===\nOn 4 June 1984, former Manchester United and [[England national football team|England]] player [[Steve Coppell]] who had recently retired from the game due to injury was appointed as manager, and it was under his stewardship and rebuilding that the club achieved promotion via the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] back to the First Division in [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1988\u201389]]. Palace followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3\u20133 with Manchester United after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the first match but losing the replay 0\u20131. The club were able to build on this success and the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season saw them achieve their highest ever league finish of third place in the top flight. Palace were to be denied a European place at the end of that season because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club also returned to Wembley and won the [[Full Members Cup]]. Palace beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4\u20131 after extra-time in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\"/> During the following season star striker [[Ian Wright]] left the club to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Palace finished tenth, allowing the club to become a founding member of the [[1992\u201393 FA Premier League|FA Premier League]] in 1992\u201393.<ref>King, p.&nbsp;39\u201348</ref>\n\n[[File:Selhurst Park Holmesdale Stand.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a stand adjacent to a road.|Holmesdale Road stand at Selhurst Park, constructed in 1994\u201395.]]\nThe club sold [[Mark Bright]] to Sheffield Wednesday, but failed to rebuild the squad adequately, and Palace struggled for consistency throughout the season. The club found itself relegated with a total of 49 points, which is still a Premier League record for the highest number of points for a relegated club. Coppell resigned and [[Alan Smith (manager)|Alan Smith]], his assistant at the club, took over.\n\n===The yo-yo years (1993\u201398)===\nAlan Smith's first season as manager saw the club win the First Division title and gain promotion back to the Premier League.<ref>King, p. 48</ref> Their stay on this occasion proved eventful.

They currently compete in the [[Premier League]], the highest level of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club play their home matches at [[Selhurst Park]].  \n\nThe historic origins of the club can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. It was here that the earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team first played as an amateur outfit in 1861. They competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. In 1895, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] inside its grounds. It was ten years later that the owners decided to form a new professional Palace club to play at the Cup Final venue. They stayed here until 1915, when the club were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.\n\nPalace joined the [[Football League]] in 1920, and have overall spent the majority of their league history competing in the top two tiers of English football. Since 1964, they have only dropped below the second tier once, for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. The club's highest ever league finish to date is third place in the old [[Football League First Division|First Division]], now known as the Premier League, achieved in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season. Palace were denied a place in Europe at the end of that season only because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club became one of the original founding members of the Premier League. Palace set two unwanted Premier League records for relegation, in [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393]] they were relegated on 49 points, which is still a record number of points for a relegated Premier League club and are the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League when finishing fourth from bottom in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], as it had been decided that the league would be reduced from 22 to 20 clubs for the following season. Palace have also been FA Cup finalists twice, losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on both occasions in [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]]. \n      \nThe club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were originally claret and blue, but in 1973 they decided to change to the red and blue vertical stripes now worn today. Palace have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], with whom they contest the [[M23 derby]] and also share rivalries with fellow [[South London derby|South London]] clubs [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}\n\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|left|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\n===Historic origins: The Exhibition Palace and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1854\u20131920)===\nIn 1854, the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]].

In 1895, the [[Football Association]] found a new permanent venue for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] at the sports stadium situated inside the historic Palace grounds. Some years later the owners, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own professional football team to play at the stadium. The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. Although the Football Association disliked the idea of the owners of the Cup Final venue also possessing their own football team and initially rejected their proposal, a separate company was established to form and own the club.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed \"The Glaziers\", were founded on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] assistant secretary [[Edmund Goodman]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\">{{citation | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | title=History | publisher=[[CPFC]] | accessdate=14 October 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606051751/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | archive-date=6 June 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The club applied to enter the [[English Football League|Football League]] alongside another newly formed London club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

This achievement meant they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to win a championship in their first season as a league club. Palace then moved to the purpose-built stadium [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924, which is the ground the club still plays at today.<ref name=\"Business: Club History\"/><ref>King, pp.&nbsp;15\u201319</ref>\n\nThe opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], with Palace losing 0\u20131 in front of a crowd of 25,000. Finishing in twenty-first position, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before the [[Second World War]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League]]s. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]].\n\n===The Sixties: Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958\u201373)===\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]], who played for Real Madrid against Palace in 1962.  The ''Croydon Advertiser'' reported that his \"move that led to Madrid's fourth goal was conducted with effortless ease at walking pace.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=John|title=Nearly 25, 000 See Real Dazzle, But Palace Fight Back|newspaper=Croydon Advertiser|date=20 April 1962|page=24}}</ref> ]]\nThe club remained in Division Three South until [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] when the league was restructured which saw clubs in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace finished fourteenth \u2013 just below the cut \u2013 and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman [[Arthur Wait]] appointed the ex-[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1962 European Cup Final|European Cup final]]. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4\u20133. Although Rowe resigned due to health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]] and [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;19\u201320, 32\u20137</ref>\n\nPalace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5\u20130 home win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]] season. Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as manager in March 1973, with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.\n\n===Bouncing between the divisions (1973\u201384)===\nAfter the disappointment of relegation, worse was to follow for the club. Under the management of Allison, Palace were immediately relegated again finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375 season]]. It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\", and ended its association with claret and blue [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours by deciding to change to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the [[1975\u201376 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and Chelsea along the way. Allison resigned at the end of the 1975\u201376 campaign after failing to get the club out of the third tier, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace were promoted back to the top flight with successive promotions in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]] and [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]]; the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions.\n\nThat team from 1979 was dubbed \"The Team of the Eighties\", and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]] season. However financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that talented group of players, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. Palace were relegated from the First Division in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]]' takeover of the club. They struggled back in the second tier, and Noades even appointed the ex-[[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] manager [[Alan Mullery]], which was very unpopular with the Palace fans.\n\n===Steve Coppell years: FA Cup finalists and League title challengers (1984\u201393)===\nOn 4 June 1984, former Manchester United and [[England national football team|England]] player [[Steve Coppell]] who had recently retired from the game due to injury was appointed as manager, and it was under his stewardship and rebuilding that the club achieved promotion via the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] back to the First Division in [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1988\u201389]]. Palace followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3\u20133 with Manchester United after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the first match but losing the replay 0\u20131. The club were able to build on this success and the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season saw them achieve their highest ever league finish of third place in the top flight. Palace were to be denied a European place at the end of that season because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club also returned to Wembley and won the [[Full Members Cup]]. Palace beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4\u20131 after extra-time in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\"/> During the following season star striker [[Ian Wright]] left the club to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Palace finished tenth, allowing the club to become a founding member of the [[1992\u201393 FA Premier League|FA Premier League]] in 1992\u201393.<ref>King, p.&nbsp;39\u201348</ref>\n\n[[File:Selhurst Park Holmesdale Stand.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a stand adjacent to a road.|Holmesdale Road stand at Selhurst Park, constructed in 1994\u201395.]]\nThe club sold [[Mark Bright]] to Sheffield Wednesday, but failed to rebuild the squad adequately, and Palace struggled for consistency throughout the season. The club found itself relegated with a total of 49 points, which is still a Premier League record for the highest number of points for a relegated club. Coppell resigned and [[Alan Smith (manager)|Alan Smith]], his assistant at the club, took over.\n\n===The yo-yo years (1993\u201398)===\nAlan Smith's first season as manager saw the club win the First Division title and gain promotion back to the Premier League.<ref>King, p. 48</ref> Their stay on this occasion proved eventful.

It began with [[Bakhtiar Khilji]]'s conquest of Gauda between 1202 and 1204 during the reign of [[Muhammad of Ghor]]. The Delhi Sultan [[Iltumish]] declared Bengal as a province of Delhi in 1225. The Delhi Sultans attempted to govern Bengal through appointed governors, however Delhi could not succeed given the considerable overland distance with Bengal. Ambitious governors rebelled and ruled as independent rulers until being suppressed militarily by the Delhi Sultanate. However, there were capable rulers among the rebels, including Yuzbak Shah (1257), Tughral Khan (1271-1282), and [[Shamsuddin Firoz Shah]] (1301-1322). The latter achieved the [[Conquest of Sylhet]] and established a strong administration in eastern and south-western Bengal. In 1325, the Delhi Sultan [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] reorganized the province into three administrative regions, with [[Sonargaon]] ruling eastern Bengal; [[Gauda (city)|Gauda]] ruling northern Bengal; and [[Satgaon]] ruling southern Bengal. Even this arrangement broke down. By 1338, the three administrative regions had separatist [[Sultan]]s, including [[Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah]] in Sonargaon; [[Alauddin Ali Shah]] in Gauda, and [[Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah]] in Satgaon.<ref name=\"Kunal Chakrabarti 2013 p. 12\">Kunal Chakrabarti; Shubhra Chakrabarti (22 August 2013).

Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah (or just ''Ilyas Shah'') defeated Alauddin Ali Shah and secured control of Gauda. He then defeated Ikhtiyaruddin of Sonargaon. By 1352, Ilyas Shah emerged victorious among the Bengali triad.\n\n===Early Bengal Sultanate (14th and 15th centuries) ===\n[[File:Adina Mosque at Malda district of West Bengal 07.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of [[Adina Mosque]], the largest mosque in the Indian subcontinent, in [[Pandua, Malda|Pandua]], the first capital of the Bengal Sultanate.]]\n[[File:DG 36 - 08 GRAVE YARD OF SULTAN GIAS UDDIN AZAM SHAH 14 CENTURY MUGRA PARA SONARGAON IMG 5650.jpg|thumb|The 14th-century tomb of Sultan Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah in [[Sonargaon]]]]\nIlyas Shah established his capital in [[Pandua, Malda|Pandua]]. He unified the [[Bengal delta|delta]] of Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna Rivers into the Sultanate of Bengal. Ilyas Shah waged wars and raids against several city-states and kingdoms in the eastern subcontinent. He conquered eastern Bengal and northern Bihar.

Bengal agreed to pay a tribute to the Delhi Sultan. Despite losing control of many conquered areas, Ilyas Shah remained in firm control of Bengal.<ref name=\"Kunal Chakrabarti 2013 p. 12\"/>\n\nIlyas Shah founded the Indo-Turkic [[Ilyas Shahi dynasty]] which ruled Bengal for fifteen decades. His son and successor [[Sikandar Shah]] defeated Delhi Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluq during the second Siege of Ekdala Fort in 1359. A peace treaty was signed between Delhi and Bengal, with the former recognizing the independence of the latter. Firuz Shah Tughluq gave a golden [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] estimated to be worth 80,000 [[History of the taka|taka]] to Sikandar Shah.

In 1406, Ma Huan found Sonargaon as a large metropolis. Other Chinese envoys provided descriptions of a fortified walled city. Sonargaon was a center of [[Sufi]] education and Persian literature. Sultan Ghiyasuddin invited Hafez to settle in Sonargaon.

The Mughals became determined to bring an end to Bengali imperialism. The [[Battle of Tukaroi]] in Orissa saw Mughal forces led by [[Akbar]] overwhelm Bengali forces led by the last Sultan [[Daud Khan Karrani]], resulting in the Treaty of [[Cuttack]]. Mughal rule formally began with the [[Battle of Raj Mahal]] when the last reigning Sultan of Bengal was defeated by the forces of Akbar. The Mughal province of [[Bengal Subah]] was created. The eastern deltaic [[Bhati (region)|Bhati]] region remained outside of Mughal control until being absorbed in the early 17th-century. The delta was controlled by a confederation of twelve aristocrats of the former sultanate, who became known as the Twelve Bhuiyans. Their leader was [[Isa Khan]], a former nobleman of the sultanate. The confederation was made up of [[petty kingdoms]].

The following illustrates the most notable vassal states.\n\n====Arakan====\n[[File:Muhghazi.jpg|thumb|Coinage from Arakan during its vassalage to the Bengal Sultanate]]\nIn the southeast, [[Arakan]] was a prominent vassal of the Bengal Sultanate. In 1430, the Bengal Sultanate restored the Arakanese throne in [[Mrauk U]] after driving out Burmese invaders who came from [[Bagan]].

Due to the riverine geography and climate, it was not feasible to use cavalry throughout the year in Bengal. The cavalry was probably the weakest component of the Bengal Sultanate's army, as the horses had to be imported from foreign countries. The artillery was an important section. Portuguese historian [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] opined that the military supremacy of Bengal over Arakan and Tripura was due to its efficient artillery.

Apart from carrying war materials, elephants were also used for the movement of the armed personnel. In riverine Bengal the usefulness of elephants, though very slow, could not be minimised. The navy was of prime necessity in riverine Bengal. In fact, the cavalry could ensure the hold over this country for a period of six months whereas the boats backed by the paiks could command supremacy over the other half of the year. Since the time of Iwaz Khalji, who first organised a naval force in Islamic Bengal, the war boats played an important role in the political affairs of the country. The chief of the admiralty had various responsibilities, including [[Shipbuilding in Bangladesh|shipbuilding]], river transport, to fit out strong boats for transporting war elephants; to recruit seamen; to patrol the rivers and to collect tolls at ghats. The efficiency of the navy eroded during the Hussain Shahi dynasty. The Sultans also built forts, including temporary mud walled forts.<ref name=\"banglapedia2\"/>\n[[File:Defeat of the last Bengal Sultan by Akbar.jpg|thumb|Akbar leads his army into battle against Daud Khan Karrani, the last Sultan of Bengal]]\n====Bengal-Delhi Wars====\n{{Main|Bengal Sultanate-Delhi Sultanate War}}\nIn 1353, the Sultan of Delhi attacked the newly formed Bengal Sultanate. After the siege of Ekdala Fort, Bengal agreed to pay a tribute to the Sultan of Delhi. In 1359, Delhi again invaded Bengal after the previous peace treaty collapsed.

During the Hussain Shahi dynasty, Bengali control over Assam reached its zenith. Alauddin Hussain Shah overthrew the Hindu [[Khen dynasty]] during a war against the Kamata Kingdom. Eventually, the [[Ahom kingdom]] re-asserted Assamese independence.\n\n====Campaigns in Arakan====\n{{Main|Reconquest of Arakan|Bengal Sultanate-Kingdom of Mrauk U War of 1512-1516}}\nThe Bengal Sultanate defeated Burmese forces in Arakan and restored the Arakanese throne in 1430. Later, Bengal and Arakan fought several wars for control of Chittagong. Arakan asserted its independence as a coastal power. During the Hussain Shahi dynasty, Bengali sovereignty was restored in Chittagong and northern Arakan. However, the Arakanese allied with Portuguese pirates to reduce Bengali control over Chittagong.  \n\n====Sher Shah Suri's invasion====\n{{See also|Suri Empire}}\nBengal was overwhelmed during the pan-Indian invasion of [[Sher Shah Suri]] and became part of the Suri Empire. The invasion prompted the Mughal Empire to occupy parts of Bengal. Both the Mughals and Bengal Sultanate were overrun by the Suri forces. Bengal regained its independence after Suri governors rebelled and re-established the sultanate.  \n\n====Bengal-Mughal Wars====\n{{Main|Battle of Ghaghra|Battle of Tukaroi|Battle of Raj Mahal}}\nThe first Mughal emperor Babur turned his sights on Bengal after the Battle of Panipat in 1526. At the Battle of Ghaghra in 1529, Bengal reached a peace treaty with Babur. During the invasion of Sher Shah Suri, the second Mughal emperor Humayun occupied [[Gauda (city)|Gaur]].

The expansion of [[muslin]] production, [[sericulture]] and the emergence of several other crafts were indicated in Ma Huan's list of items exported from Bengal to China. Bengali shipping co-existed with Chinese shipping until the latter withdrew from the Indian Ocean in the mid-15th-century.

The shipbuilding tradition is evidenced in the sultanate's naval campaigns in the Ganges delta. The trade between Bengal and the Maldives, based on rice and cowry shells, was probably done on Arab-style [[baghlah]] ships. Chinese accounts point to Bengali ships being prominent in Southeast Asian waters. A vessel from Bengal, probably owned by the Sultan of Bengal, could accommodate three tribute missions- from Bengal, [[Brunei]] and Sumatra- and was evidently the only vessel capable of such a task.

Vegetables included ginger, mustard, onions, and garlic among others. There were four types of wines, including coconut, rice, ''tarry'' and ''kajang''.

Records show that the Bengal Sultanate exchanged embassies with states in China, Europe, Africa, Central Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia. Diplomatic allies helped Bengal to fend off invasions from neighbouring kingdoms. For example, the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] ruler of [[Herat]] and the [[Ming]] emperor of [[China]] helped bring an end to the [[Bengal Sultanate-Jaunpur Sultanate War]]. Bengal was also active in regional diplomacy. For example, the ship of the Bengali embassy to China also transported the envoys of [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] and [[Aceh Sultanate|Aceh]] ([[Sumatra]]) to China.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Bengal gave consent to envoys from [[Portuguese India]] for setting up Portuguese trading posts in coastal areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Portuguese,_The|title=Portuguese, The |website=Banglapedia|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401131309/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Portuguese,_The|archivedate=1 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other European visitors included [[Niccolo De Conti]], [[Ludovico di Varthema]] and Caeser Fredrick from the [[Republic of Venice]] and [[Bologna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Conti,_Nicolo_de|title=Conti, Nicolo de |website=Banglapedia|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304211223/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Conti,_Nicolo_de|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Frederick,_Caeser|title=Frederick, Caeser |website=Banglapedia|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406101718/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Frederick,_Caeser|archivedate=6 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the Islamic world, the sultanate pledged allegiance to the contemporary [[Abbasid Caliphate]], which was at the time held by the [[Mamluk Egypt|Mamluk Sultan]] of [[Cairo]].

For the Bengali Sultans, relations with the caliphate provided legitimacy among the Muslim clergy.

The large number of mosques built during the Bengal Sultanate indicates the rapidity with which the local population converted to Islam. The period between 1450 and 1550 was an intensive mosque building era. These mosques dotted the countryside, ranged from small to medium sizes and were used for daily devotion. [[Ponds]] were often located beside a mosque. Arabic inscriptions in the mosques often include the name of the patron or builder. The most commonly cited verse from the Quran in inscriptions was Surah 72 ([[Al-Jinn]]).<ref name=\"Grabar1989\">{{cite book|author=Oleg Grabar|title=Muqarnas: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0NCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA58|year=1989|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=978-90-04-09050-7|pages=58\u201372|author-link=Oleg Grabar}}</ref> The buildings were made of brick or stone. The brick mosque with terracotta decoration represented a grand structure in the Bengal Sultanate. They were often the gift of a wealthy patron and the fruit of extraordinary effort, which would not be found in every Muslim neighborhood.<ref name=\"Grabar1989\"/> Mosques were built across the length and breadth of the Bengal Sultanate. The highest concentration of mosques from the Bengal Sultanate can be found in the [[North Bengal]] regions of Bangladesh and Indian West Bengal. A [[Mosque City of Bagerhat|mosque city]] developed near the southwestern Bengali Sundarbans forest as a result of the patronization of Governor Khan Jahan Ali. In 1985, UNESCO designated the city as a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/321/|title=Historic Mosque City of Bagerhat|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> In central areas, the [[Pathrail Mosque]] in [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]] is one of the best-preserved sultanate-era structures. In the northeast, the [[Shankarpasha Shahi Masjid]] in [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] is a well-preserved structure of the Bengal Sultanate. In the northeastern Indian state of [[Assam]], the [[Panbari Mosque]] was built during the reign of Sultan Alauddin Hussain Shah. Other mosques can be found in southern West Bengal and the Indian state of [[Bihar]], such as the [[Sayed Jamaluddin Mosque]]. In the southeast, the Santikan Mosque (built in the 1430s) stands in ruins in Rakhine State (formerly [[Arakan]]) of [[Myanmar]] (formerly Burma).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/06/150625-myanmar-burma-rohingya-refugees-archaeology-world/|title=Lost Myanmar Empire Is Stage for Modern Violence|date=2015-06-26|website=National Geographic News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> \n\nImperial mosques had an in-built throne for the Sultan.

For example, the tomb of Sultan Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah in Sonargaon has features similar to the architecture of Adina Mosque built by his father Sultan Sikandar Shah. An indigenous Islamic mausolea style developed with the [[Eklakhi Mausoleum]], which is the royal tomb chamber of Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah.

It began with [[Bakhtiar Khilji]]'s conquest of Gauda between 1202 and 1204 during the reign of [[Muhammad of Ghor]]. The Delhi Sultan [[Iltumish]] declared Bengal as a province of Delhi in 1225. The Delhi Sultans attempted to govern Bengal through appointed governors, however Delhi could not succeed given the considerable overland distance with Bengal. Ambitious governors rebelled and ruled as independent rulers until being suppressed militarily by the Delhi Sultanate.

Apart from carrying war materials, elephants were also used for the movement of the armed personnel. In riverine Bengal the usefulness of elephants, though very slow, could not be minimised. The navy was of prime necessity in riverine Bengal. In fact, the cavalry could ensure the hold over this country for a period of six months whereas the boats backed by the paiks could command supremacy over the other half of the year. Since the time of Iwaz Khalji, who first organised a naval force in Islamic Bengal, the war boats played an important role in the political affairs of the country. The chief of the admiralty had various responsibilities, including [[Shipbuilding in Bangladesh|shipbuilding]], river transport, to fit out strong boats for transporting war elephants; to recruit seamen; to patrol the rivers and to collect tolls at ghats. The efficiency of the navy eroded during the Hussain Shahi dynasty. The Sultans also built forts, including temporary mud walled forts.<ref name=\"banglapedia2\"/>\n[[File:Defeat of the last Bengal Sultan by Akbar.jpg|thumb|Akbar leads his army into battle against Daud Khan Karrani, the last Sultan of Bengal]]\n====Bengal-Delhi Wars====\n{{Main|Bengal Sultanate-Delhi Sultanate War}}\nIn 1353, the Sultan of Delhi attacked the newly formed Bengal Sultanate.

During the Hussain Shahi dynasty, Bengali control over Assam reached its zenith. Alauddin Hussain Shah overthrew the Hindu [[Khen dynasty]] during a war against the Kamata Kingdom. Eventually, the [[Ahom kingdom]] re-asserted Assamese independence.\n\n====Campaigns in Arakan====\n{{Main|Reconquest of Arakan|Bengal Sultanate-Kingdom of Mrauk U War of 1512-1516}}\nThe Bengal Sultanate defeated Burmese forces in Arakan and restored the Arakanese throne in 1430. Later, Bengal and Arakan fought several wars for control of Chittagong. Arakan asserted its independence as a coastal power. During the Hussain Shahi dynasty, Bengali sovereignty was restored in Chittagong and northern Arakan. However, the Arakanese allied with Portuguese pirates to reduce Bengali control over Chittagong.  \n\n====Sher Shah Suri's invasion====\n{{See also|Suri Empire}}\nBengal was overwhelmed during the pan-Indian invasion of [[Sher Shah Suri]] and became part of the Suri Empire. The invasion prompted the Mughal Empire to occupy parts of Bengal. Both the Mughals and Bengal Sultanate were overrun by the Suri forces. Bengal regained its independence after Suri governors rebelled and re-established the sultanate.  \n\n====Bengal-Mughal Wars====\n{{Main|Battle of Ghaghra|Battle of Tukaroi|Battle of Raj Mahal}}\nThe first Mughal emperor Babur turned his sights on Bengal after the Battle of Panipat in 1526. At the Battle of Ghaghra in 1529, Bengal reached a peace treaty with Babur. During the invasion of Sher Shah Suri, the second Mughal emperor Humayun occupied [[Gauda (city)|Gaur]]. The third Mughal emperor Akbar  launched a war against Bengal at the Battle of Tukaroi in 1575.

There were three sources of silver. The first source was the leftover silver reserve of previous kingdoms. The second source was the tribute payments of subordinate kingdoms which were paid in silver bullion. The third source was during military campaigns when Bengali forces sacked neighboring states.<ref>John H Munro (6 October 2015).

[[Ma Huan]]'s testimony of a flourishing shipbuilding industry was part of the evidence that Bengal enjoyed significant seaborne trade. The expansion of [[muslin]] production, [[sericulture]] and the emergence of several other crafts were indicated in Ma Huan's list of items exported from Bengal to China. Bengali shipping co-existed with Chinese shipping until the latter withdrew from the Indian Ocean in the mid-15th-century. The testimony of European travelers such as [[Ludovico di Varthema]], [[Duarte Barbosa]] and [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] attest to the presence of a large number of wealthy Bengali merchants and shipowners in [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]].<ref name=\"Habib2011\">{{cite book |author=Irfan Habib |title=Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&pg=PA185 |year=2011 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=978-81-317-2791-1 |page=185 |author-link=Irfan Habib}}</ref> Historian Rila Mukherjee wrote that ports in Bengal may have been [[entrepot]]s, importing goods and re-exporting them to China.<ref name=\"Mukherjee2011\">{{cite book |author=Rila Mukherjee |year=2011 |title=Pelagic Passageways: The Northern Bay of Bengal Before Colonialism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xeqhnYtrKcC&pg=PA30 |publisher=Primus Books |page=30 |isbn=978-93-80607-20-7 |quote=\"some of them [items exported from Bengal to China] were probably re-exports.

The shipbuilding tradition is evidenced in the sultanate's naval campaigns in the Ganges delta. The trade between Bengal and the Maldives, based on rice and cowry shells, was probably done on Arab-style [[baghlah]] ships. Chinese accounts point to Bengali ships being prominent in Southeast Asian waters. A vessel from Bengal, probably owned by the Sultan of Bengal, could accommodate three tribute missions- from Bengal, [[Brunei]] and Sumatra- and was evidently the only vessel capable of such a task.

Due to the fertile land, there was an abundance of agricultural commodities, including bananas, jackfruits, pomegranate, sugarcane, and honey. Native crops included rice and sesame. Vegetables included ginger, mustard, onions, and garlic among others. There were four types of wines, including coconut, rice, ''tarry'' and ''kajang''. Bengali streets were well provided with eating establishments, drinking houses and bathhouses. At least six varieties of fine muslin cloth existed. Silk fabrics were also abundant.

Records show that the Bengal Sultanate exchanged embassies with states in China, Europe, Africa, Central Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia. Diplomatic allies helped Bengal to fend off invasions from neighbouring kingdoms. For example, the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] ruler of [[Herat]] and the [[Ming]] emperor of [[China]] helped bring an end to the [[Bengal Sultanate-Jaunpur Sultanate War]]. Bengal was also active in regional diplomacy. For example, the ship of the Bengali embassy to China also transported the envoys of [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] and [[Aceh Sultanate|Aceh]] ([[Sumatra]]) to China.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Bengal gave consent to envoys from [[Portuguese India]] for setting up Portuguese trading posts in coastal areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Portuguese,_The|title=Portuguese, The |website=Banglapedia|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401131309/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Portuguese,_The|archivedate=1 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other European visitors included [[Niccolo De Conti]], [[Ludovico di Varthema]] and Caeser Fredrick from the [[Republic of Venice]] and [[Bologna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Conti,_Nicolo_de|title=Conti, Nicolo de |website=Banglapedia|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304211223/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Conti,_Nicolo_de|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Frederick,_Caeser|title=Frederick, Caeser |website=Banglapedia|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406101718/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Frederick,_Caeser|archivedate=6 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the Islamic world, the sultanate pledged allegiance to the contemporary [[Abbasid Caliphate]], which was at the time held by the [[Mamluk Egypt|Mamluk Sultan]] of [[Cairo]]. The Abbasid caliph was still considered to be the symbolic leader of Sunni Islam at the time, despite dwindling territory under direct caliphate rule. For the Bengali Sultans, relations with the caliphate provided legitimacy among the Muslim clergy. For example, the [[religious conversion|converted Sultan]] Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah received recognition from [[Al-Mu'tadid II]], which strengthened Jalaluddin's legitimacy in the eyes of the clergy.<ref name=\"banglapedia.org1\"/> Many coins minted by the Bengal Sultanate bore the names of both the Bengali Sultans and the Abbasid Caliphs.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Coins|chapter=Coins| title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh|author=Muhammad Rezaul Karim|publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref>\n[[File:Tribute Giraffe with Attendant.jpg|thumb|200px|Chinese manuscript ''Tribute Giraffe with Attendant'', depicting a giraffe presented by Bengali envoys to the Ming court (Philadelphia Museum of Art)]]\nSultan Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah sponsored the construction of [[madrasa]]s (Islamic theological schools) in the pilgrimage cities of [[Makkah]] and [[Madinah]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard M.

By the turn of the 16th century, a vernacular literature based on concepts of [[Sufism]] and [[Islamic cosmology]] flourished in the region.

It was the preferred language of the aristocracy and the [[Sufi]]s. Thousands of Persian books and manuscripts were published in Bengal. The earliest Persian work compiled in Bengal was a translation of Amrtakunda from Sanskrit by Qadi Ruknu'd-Din Abu Hamid Muhammad bin Muhammad al-'Amidi of Samarqand, a famous Hanafi jurist and Sufi. During the reign of Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah, the city of [[Sonargaon]] became an important centre of [[Persian literature]], with many publications of prose and poetry. The period is described as the \"[[golden age]] of Persian literature in Bengal\". Its stature is illustrated by the Sultan's own correspondence with the Persian poet [[Hafez]]. When the Sultan invited Hafez to complete an incomplete [[ghazal]] by the ruler, the renowned poet responded by acknowledging the grandeur of the king's court and the literary quality of Bengali-Persian poetry.<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Persian|author=Abu Musa Mohammad Arif Billah}}</ref>\n\nManuscript paintings depict the fashion and architecture of the Bengal Sultanate. Persian manuscripts with paintings are a key artistic hallmark of the Bengal Sultanate. One of the best-known examples of this heritage is the ''Sharafnama'' published by Sultan [[Nasiruddin Nasrat Shah|Nusrat Shah]] in the middle of the 16th-century. It includes epic poetry by [[Nizami Ganjavi]] about the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]].<ref name=\"Grabar1989\">{{cite book|author=Oleg Grabar|title=Muqarnas: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0NCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA58|year=1989|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=978-90-04-09050-7|pages=58\u201372|author-link=Oleg Grabar}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama|title=ESKANDAR-N\u0100MA \u2013 Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=www.iranicaonline.org|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn the 15th century, the Sufi poet Nur Qutb Alam pioneered [[Bengali Muslim]] poetry by establishing the [[Dobhashi]] tradition, which saw poems written half in Persian and half in colloquial Bengali. The invocation tradition saw Islamic figures replacing the invocation of Hindu gods and goddesses in Bengali texts. The literary romantic tradition saw poems by [[Shah Muhammad Sagir]] on [[Yusuf and Zulaikha]], as well as works of Bahram Khan and Sabirid Khan. The ''[[Dobhashi]]'' culture featured the use of [[Arabic]] and Persian words in Bengali texts to illustrate Muslim stories. [[Epic poetry]] included ''Nabibangsha'' by [[Syed Sultan]], ''Janganama'' by [[Abdul Hakim (poet)|Abdul Hakim]] and ''Rasul Bijay'' by Shah Barid. Sufi literature flourished with a dominant theme of [[cosmology]].

[[Ponds]] were often located beside a mosque. Arabic inscriptions in the mosques often include the name of the patron or builder.

I know it sounds strange, but if you ask an artist what they do they're going to say that they rap, they sing, they do rock, a lot of people are multi-talented. They get looked at confused, but I don't think that they're confused. I feel that they're just talented, swavey artists.

Jacquees took Lanez' emoji response as an assault, and he went on to call Lanez a \"peasant\" and \"watermelon head ass\".

The tweet wasn't convincing to Lanez, who responded to Jacquees with two choice emojis. Jacquees took Lanez' emoji response as an assault, and he went on to call Lanez a \"peasant\" and \"watermelon head ass\".

{"title_page": "Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[File:Oliver St John.jpg|thumb|Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison, 1st Baron Tregoz]]\n\n'''Sir Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison''' (1559 \u2013 30 December 1630) was an English soldier  and  politician who became [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]].\n\n==Early years==\nHe was the second son of [[Nicholas St John]] (ca. 1526 \u2013 8 November 1589) of [[Lydiard Park]] in Wiltshire and [[Purley Park]] in Berkshire, by his wife Elizabeth (bef. 1542 \u2013 1587), daughter of Sir Richard Blount of [[Mapledurham House]] in Oxfordshire, and Elizabeth Lister. His mother was distantly related to [[Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy]], and on his father's side he was descended through a female line from the Grandisons, and was related to the [[Margaret Beauchamp of Bletso|St Johns, Barons of Bletso]]. He seems to have grown up mostly at [[Purley-on-Thames|Purley]],<ref>[http://www.berkshirehistory.com/villages/purley.html Royal Berkshire History: Purley]</ref>  and was educated at Oxford, matriculating from [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]] on 20 December 1577, and graduating B.A. on 26 June 1578.  Knowing that his father, who expected him to make his own way,  would leave him very little money, he decided on a career in the law. In 1580 he was admitted a student of [[Lincoln's Inn]]; but about March 1584 he killed the  well-known  [[explorer]]  [[George Best (chronicler)|George Best]] in a [[duel]] and was compelled to flee the country. The motive for the duel  is unclear, although St John's violent temper no doubt contributed to it: by his own  later admission he was \"by nature the child of wrath\".\n\n==Career==\nSt John now sought his fortunes as a soldier abroad, and served in [[Flanders]] and in France. Before 1591 he had attained the rank of captain, and in the autumn of that year commanded [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Essex's]] horse at the siege of [[Rouen]]. In 1592 he returned to England, and was elected member for [[Cirencester (UK Parliament constituency)|Cirencester]] in the parliament summoned to meet on 19 February 1593. In March he was placed on a commission for the relief of maimed soldiers and mariners, and made several speeches during the session; but parliament was dissolved in April, and soon afterwards Essex recommended St John to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] as a cavalryman. He again sought service in the Netherlands, and was present at the [[battle of Nieuport]] on 2 July 1600.\n\n===Ireland===\n\n[[Tyrone's rebellion]] took experienced English soldiers to Ireland, and St John accompanied Mountjoy there in February 1601; he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by Mountjoy at Dublin on 28 February, and was given command of two hundred men. He took a prominent part in the [[siege of Kinsale]] in the autumn, repulsing a night attack of the Spanish on 2 December, when he was wounded. On 13 December he left the camp to carry despatches to Queen Elizabeth. In November 1602 he was back in Ireland commanding twenty-five horse and 150-foot in [[Connacht|Connaught]], under [[George Carew, 1st Earl of Totnes|Sir George Carew]], and in the same year he was recommended by Cecil for the office of vice-president of that province (but the arrangement does not seem to have been carried out). From 1604 to 1607 he sat in the English parliament as member for [[Portsmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Portsmouth]]. On 12 December 1605 he was made master of the ordnance in Ireland, and sworn of the Irish privy council.\n\nFrom this time St John was [[Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester|Sir Arthur Chichester]]'s most trusted adviser. Early in 1608 he was named a commissioner for the [[plantation of Ulster]]. He drew up a scheme for the plantation of the province, and accompanied Chichester in his progress through Ulster in 1609. As an undertaker he had grants of fifteen hundred acres in [[Ballymore, County Armagh|Ballymore]], [[co. Armagh]], and a thousand acres (4&nbsp;km\u00b2) in 'Keernan. He advised that no grants of the lands of the  [[Flight of the Earls| banished Earls]]  should be made, but that they should be let to the  native Irish at a high rent. Early in 1609 Chichester sent him to England, and he drew up a report of the commissioners' proceedings for Salisbury's benefit.\n\n===Member of the Irish Parliament===\n\nIn 1613 he was elected member of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]  for [[County Roscommon (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Roscommon]], and took an important part in the dispute about the speakership,  which descended into pantomime after the  rival factions  chose Sir [[John Everard (MP)|John Everard]]  and Sir [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]].  Speaking from his experience of the English House of Commons, St John  urged that the first business of the house was to elect a speaker, and that the proper method of voting was to leave the house and be counted in a lobby. Everard's supporters, however, placed Everard in the chair, from which he was only ejected by the majority after  Davies, a very fat man, actually sat on him.  St John was one of the members sent to lay the matter before James I: as a result Everard was summoned before the  Privy Council and  briefly imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]], before being sent home with an admonition.  In December 1614 St John resigned the mastership of the ordnance; he was in England during October 1615, when the [[Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset|Earl of Somerset]] was committed to his custody, in connection with the [[murder]]  of [[Sir  Thomas  Overbury]].\n\n===Lord Deputy of Ireland===\n\nIn 1615 he was appointed [[Vice-Admiral of Connaught]] for life and confirmed in the position by [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham]] in 1619. He surrendered the position in 1627.<ref> {{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930074029/http://www.history.ac.uk/office/viceadmirals2.html#ac|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/office/viceadmirals2.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 November 2016|title=Vice Admirals of the Coasts 1558\u20131660|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|accessdate=15 February 2019}} </ref>\n\nOn 2 July 1616 St John was appointed [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]]; he received the sword of state on 30 August. His appointment was partly due to his close  family connection with the Duke of Buckingham, by then the prime Royal Favourite, and his administration, like Chichester's was marked by persecution of [[recusants]]. He banished, by proclamation, all [[monks]]  and friars educated abroad. He also pushed on the colonisation of Ulster, and the plantation of [[co. Longford]] in 1618 was followed next year by that of [[co. Leitrim]]. His severity against the recusants created enemies, and the fact that he owed his appointment to Villiers made him unpopular with many of his council. Early in 1621 they urged his recall; and, though James commended him and protested against involving him in disgrace, he was finally commanded to deliver up the sword of state to  [[Adam Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus|Lord Chancellor  Loftus]]  on 18 April 1622. He left Ireland on 4 May.\n\nSt John still remained in favour at court. On 28 June 1622 he was sworn of the English privy council, on 23 June 1623 he was created '''[[Viscount Grandison]]''' of Limerick in the [[peerage of Ireland]], on 16 August 1625 he was made [[Lord High Treasurer of Ireland]], and on 20 May 1626 was raised to the [[English peerage]] as '''Baron Tregoz''' of Highworth, Wiltshire.\n\nIn 1624 St John was placed on the Council of War, and served on other commissions. He also interested himself in foreign and colonial affairs, frequently corresponding with his nephew, [[Sir Thomas Roe]]. In 1627 he bought the manors of [[Wandsworth]] and [[Battersea]], where he had had a house since 1600. His health failing, he sought the advice of [[Sir Theodore Turquet de Mayerne]]. After a visit to Ireland in 1630 to settle his estates there, he returned to Battersea, where he died on 30 December in the same year, being buried there on 12 January 1631.\n\n==Family==\nSt John married Joan, daughter and heiress of John Roydon of [[Battersea]], and widow of Sir William Holcroft; she was buried at Battersea on 10 March 1631; by her he had no issue. The barony of Tregoz became extinct. Grandison's manors, [[Wandsworth]] and Battersea, passed to his nephew [[Sir John St John, 1st Baronet|Sir John St John]]. The viscounty of Grandison passed to his grand-nephew, [[William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison|William Villiers]], son of [[Edward Villiers (Master of the Mint)|Sir Edward Villiers]] (who was the Duke of Buckingham's brother)  by his wife Barbara, younger daughter of Sir John St John, Grandison's elder brother.\n\n==References==\n*{{DNB|wstitle=St. John, Oliver (1559-1630)}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grandison, Oliver Saint John, 1st Viscount}}\n[[Category:1559 births]]\n[[Category:1630 deaths]]\n[[Category:English soldiers]]\n[[Category:Lords Lieutenant of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Viscounts in the Peerage of Ireland]]\n[[Category:People from Swindon]]\n[[Category:People from Battersea]]\n[[Category:People from West Berkshire District]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Roscommon constituencies]]\n[[Category:Irish MPs 1613\u20131615]]\n[[Category:St John family]]\n[[Category:Duellists]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1593]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1604\u20131611]]\n[[Category:Knights Bachelor]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[File:Oliver St John.jpg|thumb|Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison, 1st Baron Tregoz]]\n\n'''Sir Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison''' (1559 \u2013 30 December 1630) was an English soldier  and  politician who became [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]].\n\n==Early years==\nHe was the second son of [[Nicholas St John]] (ca. 1526 \u2013 8 November 1589) of [[Lydiard Park]] in Wiltshire and [[Purley Park]] in Berkshire, by his wife Elizabeth (bef. 1542 \u2013 1587), daughter of Sir Richard Blount of [[Mapledurham House]] in Oxfordshire, and Elizabeth Lister.

In December 1614 St. John resigned the mastership of the ordnance; he was in England during October 1615, when the [[Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset|Earl of Somerset]] was committed to his custody, in connection with the [[murder]]  of [[Sir  Thomas  Overbury]].\n\n===Lord Deputy of Ireland===\n\nIn 1615 he was appointed [[Vice-Admiral of Connaught]] for life and confirmed in the position by [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham]] in 1619. He surrendered the position in 1627.<ref> {{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930074029/http://www.history.ac.uk/office/viceadmirals2.html#ac|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/office/viceadmirals2.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 November 2016|title=Vice Admirals of the Coasts 1558\u20131660|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|accessdate=15 February 2019}} </ref>\n\nOn 2 July 1616 St John was appointed [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]]; he received the sword of state on 30 August. His appointment was partly due to his close  family connection with the Duke of Buckingham, by then the prime Royal Favourite, and his administration, like Chichester's was marked by persecution of [[recusants]]. He banished, by proclamation, all [[monks]]  and friars educated abroad. He also pushed on the colonisation of Ulster, and the plantation of [[co. Longford]] in 1618 was followed next year by that of [[co. Leitrim]]. His severity against the recusants created enemies, and the fact that he owed his appointment to Villiers made him unpopular with many of his council. Early in 1621 they urged his recall; and, though James commended him and protested against involving him in disgrace, he was finally commanded to deliver up the sword of state to  [[Adam Loftus, 1st Viscount Loftus|Lord Chancellor  Loftus]]  on 18 April 1622. He left Ireland on 4 May.\n\nSt John still remained in favour at court. On 28 June 1622 he was sworn of the English privy council, on 23 June 1623 he was created '''[[Viscount Grandison]]''' of Limerick in the [[peerage of Ireland]], on 16 August 1625 he was made [[Lord High Treasurer of Ireland]], and on 20 May 1626 was raised to the [[English peerage]] as '''Baron Tregoz''' of Highworth, Wiltshire.\n\nIn 1624 St John was placed on the Council of War, and served on other commissions. He also interested himself in foreign and colonial affairs, frequently corresponding with his nephew, [[Sir Thomas Roe]]. In 1627 he bought the manors of [[Wandsworth]] and [[Battersea]], where he had had a house since 1600. His health failing, he sought the advice of [[Sir Theodore Turquet de Mayerne]]. After a visit to Ireland in 1630 to settle his estates there, he returned to Battersea, where he died on 30 December in the same year, being buried there on 12 January 1631.\n\n==Family==\nSt John married Joan, daughter and heiress of John Roydon of [[Battersea]], and widow of Sir William Holcroft; she was buried at Battersea on 10 March 1631; by her he had no issue. The barony of Tregoz became extinct. Grandison's manors, [[Wandsworth]] and Battersea, passed to his nephew [[Sir John St John, 1st Baronet|Sir John St John]]. The viscounty of Grandison passed to his grand-nephew, [[William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison|William Villiers]], son of [[Edward Villiers (Master of the Mint)|Sir Edward Villiers]] (who was the Duke of Buckingham's brother)  by his wife Barbara, younger daughter of Sir John St John, Grandison's elder brother.\n\n==References==\n*{{DNB|wstitle=St. John, Oliver (1559-1630)}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grandison, Oliver Saint John, 1st Viscount}}\n[[Category:1559 births]]\n[[Category:1630 deaths]]\n[[Category:English soldiers]]\n[[Category:Lords Lieutenant of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Viscounts in the Peerage of Ireland]]\n[[Category:People from Swindon]]\n[[Category:People from Battersea]]\n[[Category:People from West Berkshire District]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Roscommon constituencies]]\n[[Category:Irish MPs 1613\u20131615]]\n[[Category:St John family]]\n[[Category:Duellists]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1593]]\n[[Category:English MPs 1604\u20131611]]\n[[Category:Knights Bachelor]]\n", "name_user": "Julia H.

Later [[Zasechnaya cherta]], a chain of fortification lines, was created to protect [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia]] from the [[Crimean\u2013Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe|Crimean-Nogai Raids]]. It was south of the original line along the Oka River.\n\nThe river gave its name to the [[Upper Oka Principalities]], situated upstream from [[Tarusa]]. In 1221 Grand Duke [[Yuri II of Vladimir]] founded [[Nizhny Novgorod]], later to become one of largest Russian cities, to protect the Oka's confluence with the Volga. The [[Qasim Khanate]], a Muslim polity, occupied the middle reaches of the Oka (around the city of [[Kasimov]]) in the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nBefore the construction of the railways in the mid-19th century and the building of the [[Moscow Canal]] in the 1930s, the Oka, along with its tributary [[Moscow River|Moskva]], served as an important transportation route connecting [[Moscow]] with the Volga River. Due to the Oka's and Moskva's meandering courses, travel was not particularly fast: for example, it took [[Cornelis de Bruijn]] around 10 days to sail from Moscow down these two rivers to Nizhny Novgorod in 1703.<ref>{{citation\n|first=Cornelis de |last=Bruin\n|title=Voyage au Levant: c'est-\u00e0-dire, dans les principaux endroits de l'Asie Mineure, dans les isles de Chio, Rhodes, Chypre, etc., de m\u00eame que dans les plus consid\u00e9rables villes d'Egypte, de Syrie, et Terre Sainte.\n|volume=3\n|publisher=J.-B.-C.

Later [[Zasechnaya cherta]], a chain of fortification lines, was created to protect [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia]] from the [[Crimean\u2013Nogai slave raids in Eastern Europe|Crimean-Nogai Raids]]. It was south of the original line along the Oka River.\n\nThe river gave its name to the [[Upper Oka Principalities]], situated upstream from [[Tarusa]]. In 1221 Grand Duke [[Yuri II of Vladimir]] founded [[Nizhny Novgorod]], later to become one of largest Russian cities, to protect the Oka's confluence with the Volga. The [[Qasim Khanate]], a Muslim polity, occupied the middle reaches of the Oka (around the city of [[Kasimov]]) in the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nBefore the construction of the railways in the mid-19th century and the building of the [[Moscow Canal]] in the 1930s, the Oka, along with its tributary [[Moscow River|Moskva]], served as an important transportation route connecting [[Moscow]] with the Volga River. Due to the Oka's and Moskva's meandering courses, travel was not particularly fast: for example, it took [[Cornelis de Bruijn]] around 10 days to sail from Moscow down these two rivers to Nizhny Novgorod in 1703.<ref>{{citation\n|first=Cornelis de |last=Bruin\n|title=Voyage au Levant: c'est-\u00e0-dire, dans les principaux endroits de l'Asie Mineure, dans les isles de Chio, Rhodes, Chypre, etc., de m\u00eame que dans les plus consid\u00e9rables villes d'Egypte, de Syrie, et Terre Sainte.\n|volume=3\n|publisher=J.-B.-C.

It is located on the northern end of [[Sumatra]], with [[Banda Aceh]] being its capital and largest city. Granted a special [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous]] status, Aceh is a religiously [[Conservatism|conservative]] territory and the only Indonesian province practicing [[Sharia]] law officially. There are ten indigenous ethnic groups in this region, the largest being the [[Acehnese people]], accounting for approximately 80% to 90% of the region's population.\n\nAceh is the place where the [[spread of Islam in Indonesia]] began, and was a key factor of the [[spread of Islam in Southeast Asia]]. Islam reached Aceh (Kingdoms of [[Barus|Fansur]] and [[Lamuri]]) around 1250 AD. In the early seventeenth century the [[Sultanate of Aceh]] was the most wealthy, powerful and cultivated state in the [[Malacca Straits]] region. Aceh has a history of political independence and resistance to control by outsiders, including the former [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonists]] and later the Indonesian government.\n\nAceh has substantial [[natural resource]]s of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1590162,00.html ''How An Escape Artist Became Aceh's Governor''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803235400/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1590162,00.html |date=3 August 2008 }}, [[Time Magazine]], 15 February 2007</ref> Aceh was the closest point of land to the [[epicenter]] of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], which devastated much of the western coast of the province.

For example, the head of a stone sculpture of [[Avalokiteshvara]] [[Boddhisattva]] was discovered in Aceh. Images of [[Amitabha]] Buddhas adorn his crown in front and on each side. [[Srivijaya]]n art estimated 9th century CE collection of [[National Museum of Indonesia]], Jakarta.\n\nHistoric names such as Indrapurba, Indrapurwa, Indrapatra, and Indrapuri, which refer to Hindu god [[Indra]], gave some hint of Indian influence on this region. However, unlike Jambi and South Sumatra, there are no significant archaeological sites and findings such as [[Candi of Indonesia|temples]], that link this region with Hindu-Buddhist culture.\n\nChinese sources from this time mention that there was a settlement in northernmost Sumatra (Aceh) which was called P'o-lu. Many scholars believe that P'o-lu was near what is now modern day [[Banda Aceh]]. These same sources also state that the regular people of this land wore cotton clothing while the ruling elite wore silk clothing. The king of P'o-lu was said to use elephants to pull his personal wagon. The Chinese annals also claim that the people were Buddhist.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=1-57958-468-3|editor-last=Skutsch|editor-first=Carl|volume=1|location=New York|pages=4, 5}}</ref>\n\n===Beginnings of Islam in Southeast Asia===\n{{See also|Spread of Islam in Indonesia}}\n[[File:Pasai.jpg|thumb|Map of [[Pasai]], the first Islamic kingdom in [[South East Asia]]|left]]\n\nEvidence concerning the initial coming and subsequent establishment of Islam in Southeast Asia is thin and inconclusive. The historian Anthony Reid has argued that the region of the Cham people on the south-central coast of Vietnam was one of the earliest Islamic centers in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, as the Cham people fled the Vietnamese, one of the earliest locations that they established a relationship was with Aceh.<ref>Reid (1988 and 1993)</ref> Furthermore, it is thought that one of the earliest centers of Islam was in the Aceh region. When [[Venice|Venetian]] traveller [[Marco Polo]] passed by Sumatra on his way home from China in 1292 he found that [[Perlak, Aceh|Peureulak]] was a Muslim town while nearby 'Basma(n)' and 'Samara' were not. 'Basma(n)' and 'Samara' are often said to be [[Pasai|Pasai and Samudra]] but evidence is inconclusive. The gravestone of Sultan Malik as-Salih, the first Muslim ruler of Samudra, has been found and is dated [[Hijri year|AH]] 696 (AD 1297). This is the earliest clear evidence of a Muslim dynasty in the Indonesia-Malay area and more gravestones from the thirteenth century show that this region continued under Muslim rule. [[Ibn Batutah]], a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] traveller, passing through on his way to China in 1345 and 1346, found that the ruler of Samudra was a follower of the [[Shafi'i]] school of Islam.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 4</ref>\n\nThe name Aceh began to appear around the sixteenth century when its name was used to refer to the port at the northern tip of Sumatra. Aceh soon became a cultural and scholastic Islamic center throughout Southeast Asia around this period. It also became wealthy because it was a center of extensive trade.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=1-57958-468-3|editor-last=Skutsch|editor-first=Carl|volume=1|location=New York|pages=5}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese apothecary [[Tome Pires]] reported in his early 16th-century book ''Suma Oriental'' that most of the kings of Sumatra from Aceh through [[Palembang]] were Muslim. At Pasai, in what is now the [[North Aceh Regency]], there was a thriving international port. Pires attributed the establishment of Islam in Pasai to the 'cunning' of the Muslim merchants. The ruler of Pasai, however, had not been able to convert the people of the interior.<ref>Ricklefs (1991),\n page 7</ref>\n\n===Sultanate of Aceh===\n{{Main|Aceh Sultanate}}The Sultanate of Aceh was established by Sultan [[Ali Mughayat Syah]] in 1511.\n\nIn 1584\u201388 the Bishop of [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], D. Jo\u00e3o Ribeiro Gaio, based on information provided by a former captive called Diogo Gil, wrote the \"Roteiro das Cousas do Achem\" (Lisboa 1997) \u2013 a description of the Sultanate.\n\nLater, during its [[golden era]], in the 17th century, its [[wikt:Special:Search/territory|territory]] and political influence expanded as far as [[Satun]] in southern [[Thailand]], [[Johor]] in [[Malay Peninsula]], and Siak in what is today the province of [[Riau]]. As was the case with most non-Javan pre-colonial states, [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] power expanded outward by sea rather than inland. As it expanded down the Sumatran coast, its main competitors were [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]] and [[Portuguese Malacca]] on the other side of the [[Straits of Malacca]]. It was this seaborne trade focus that saw Aceh rely on rice imports from north [[Java]] rather than develop [[self sufficiency]] in rice production.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 17</ref>[[File:Aceh Sultanate en.svg|thumb|Map of Aceh Sultanate during the reign of Sultan Iskandar Muda|left]]\n\nAfter the Portuguese occupation of [[Malacca]] in 1511, many Islamic traders passing the [[Malacca Straits]] shifted their trade to [[Banda Aceh]] and increased the [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] rulers' wealth. During the reign of [[Sultan Iskandar Muda]] in the 17th century, Aceh's influence extended to most of [[Sumatra]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Aceh allied itself with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Dutch East India Company]] in their struggle against the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and the [[Johor Sultanate]]. Acehnese military power waned gradually thereafter, and Aceh ceded its territory of [[Pariaman]] in [[Sumatra]] to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in the 18th century.<ref>*D. G. E. Hall, ''A History of South-east Asia''. London: Macmillan, 1955.</ref>\n\nBy the early nineteenth century, however, Aceh had become an increasingly influential power due to its strategic location for controlling regional trade. In the 1820s it was the producer of over half the world's supply of black pepper. The pepper trade produced new wealth for the Sultanate and for the rulers of many smaller nearby ports that had been under Aceh's control, but were now able to assert more independence. These changes initially threatened Aceh's integrity, but a new sultan [[Alauddin Ibrahim Mansur Syah|Tuanku Ibrahim]], who controlled the kingdom from 1838 to 1870, reasserted power over nearby ports.<ref name=\"ricklefs2001p185\">Ricklefs, M.C.

In the treaty, the British described Aceh as one of their possessions, although they had no actual control over the Sultanate. Initially, under the agreement the Dutch agreed to respect Aceh's independence. In 1871, however, the British dropped previous opposition to a Dutch invasion of Aceh, possibly to prevent [[France]] or the United States from gaining a foothold in the region. Although neither the Dutch nor the British knew the specifics, there had been rumors since the 1850s that Aceh had been in communication with the rulers of France and of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"ricklefs2001p185\"/>\n\n===Aceh War===\n{{Main|Aceh War}}\n\n[[File:Generaal Kohler sneuvelt in de Mesigit.jpg|thumb|[[Johan K\u00f6hler|General K\u00f6hler]], commandant of Dutch troops, died from a shot by an Acehnese sniper during the first attack on Aceh]]\nPirates operating from Aceh threatened commerce in the [[Strait of Malacca]]; the sultan was unable to control them. Britain was a protector of Aceh and gave the Netherlands permission to eradicate the pirates.

An expedition under Major General [[Johan Harmen Rudolf K\u00f6hler]] in 1873 occupied most of the coastal areas. K\u00f6hler's strategy was to attack and take the Sultan's palace. It failed. The Dutch then tried a naval blockade, reconciliation, concentration within a line of forts, and lastly passive containment. They had scant success. Reaching 15 to 20 million guilders a year, the heavy spending for failed strategies nearly bankrupted the colonial government.<ref>E.H.

Since the disaster, the Acehnese rebel movement GAM, which had been fighting for independence against the Indonesian authorities for 29 years, has signed a peace deal (15 August 2005). The perception that the tsunami was punishment for insufficient piety in this proudly Muslim province is partly behind the increased emphasis on the importance of religion post-tsunami. This has been most obvious in the increased implementation of [[Sharia]] law, including the introduction of the controversial 'WH' or Syariah police.

Persistent inflation means that Aceh's [[consumer price index]] (CPI) remains the highest in Indonesia. As a result, Aceh's cost competitiveness has declined as reflected in both inflation and wage data. Although inflation has slowed down, CPI has registered steady increases since the tsunami. Using 2002 as a base, Aceh's CPI increased to 185.6 (June 2007) while the national\nCPI increased to 148.2. There have been relatively large nominal wage increases in particular sectors, such as construction where, on average, workers' nominal wages have risen to almost Rp.60,000 per day, from Rp.29,000 pre-tsunami. This is also reflected in Aceh's minimum regional wage (UMR, or Upah Minimum Regional), which increased by 55% from Rp.550,000 pre-tsunami to Rp.850,000 in 2007, compared with an increase of 42% in neighboring [[North Sumatra]], from Rp.537,000 to Rp.761,000.\n\n[[Poverty]] levels increased slightly in Aceh in 2005 after the tsunami, but by less than expected.<ref>World Bank, Jakarta, [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINDONESIA/Resources/Publication/280016-1200376036925/acehpoverty2008_en.pdf Aceh Poverty Assessment 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228013215/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINDONESIA/Resources/Publication/280016-1200376036925/acehpoverty2008_en.pdf |date=28 February 2008 }}.</ref> The poverty level then fell in 2006 to below the pre-tsunami level, suggesting that the rise in tsunami-related poverty was short lived and reconstruction activities and the end of the conflict most probably facilitated this decline.

According to the most recent censuses, the total population of Aceh in 2010 was 4,486,570 and in 2015 was 4,993,385; the latest official estimate (as at 1 July 2019) was 5,316,320.<ref name=\"Badan Pusat Statistik 2019\">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2019.</ref>\n\n===Ethnic and cultural groups===\nAceh is a diverse region occupied by several ethnic and language groups. The major ethnic groups are the [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] (who are distributed throughout Aceh), [[Gayo people|Gayo]] (in central and eastern part), [[Alas people|Alas]] (in [[Southeast Aceh Regency]]), [[Malay people|Tamiang-Malays]] (in [[Aceh Tamiang Regency]]), [[Aneuk Jamee people|Aneuk Jamee]] (descendant from [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], concentrated in southern and southwestern), [[Kluet people|Kluet]] (in [[South Aceh Regency]]), and [[Simeulue people|Simeulue]] (on [[Simeulue]] Island). There is also a significant population of [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], Among the present day Acehnese can be found some individuals of [[Arab]], [[Turkish People|Turkish]], and [[India]]n descent.\n\nThe [[Acehnese language]] is widely spoken within the Acehnese population. This is a member of the [[Aceh-Chamic languages|Aceh-Chamic]] group of languages, whose other representatives are mostly found in Vietnam and Cambodia, and is also closely related to the [[Malay language|Malay]] group of languages. Acehnese also has many words borrowed from Malay and [[Arabic]] and traditionally was written using [[Jawi script|Arabic script]]. Acehnese is also used as local language in Langkat and Asahan ([[North Sumatra]]), and Kedah (Malaysia), and once dominated Penang. Alas and Kluet are closely related languages within the [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] group. The Jamee language originated from [[Minangkabau language]] in [[West Sumatra]], with just a few variations and differences.\n\n===Religion===\n{{bar box\n|title=Religion in Aceh (2010 census)<ref name=\"BPS\u0320Religion\u03202010\">{{cite web | title = Population by Region and Religion in Indonesia | work = [[Badan Pusat Statistik|BPS]] | year = 2010 | url = http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&wid=0 | access-date = 22 June 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171114104051/http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&wid=0 | archive-date = 14 November 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=religion\n|right1=percent\n|float=right\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|Islam|green|98.19}}\n{{bar percent|Christianity|Blue|1.19}}\n{{bar percent|other, asked or not stated|gray|0.46}}\n{{bar percent|Buddhism|orange|0.16}}\n}}\nAccording to 2010 census of the Central Statistics Agency, Muslims dominate Aceh with more than 98% or 4,413,200 followers and only 50,300 Protestants and 3,310 Catholics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/13/regent-orders-churches-closed-destroyed-aceh.html |title=Regent orders churches closed, destroyed in Aceh |accessdate=13 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617063940/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/13/regent-orders-churches-closed-destroyed-aceh.html |archive-date=17 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nReligious issues are often sensitive in Aceh.

It is located on the northern end of [[Sumatra]], with [[Banda Aceh]] being its capital and largest city. Granted a special [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous]] status, Aceh is a religiously [[Conservatism|conservative]] territory and the only Indonesian province practicing [[Sharia]] law officially. There are ten indigenous ethnic groups in this region, the largest being the [[Acehnese people]], accounting for approximately 80% to 90% of the region's population.\n\nAceh is the place where the [[spread of Islam in Indonesia]] began, and was a key factor of the [[spread of Islam in Southeast Asia]]. Islam reached Aceh (Kingdoms of [[Barus|Fansur]] and [[Lamuri]]) around 1250 AD. In the early seventeenth century the [[Sultanate of Aceh]] was the most wealthy, powerful and cultivated state in the [[Malacca Straits]] region. Aceh has a history of political independence and resistance to control by outsiders, including the former [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonists]] and later the Indonesian government.\n\nAceh has substantial [[natural resource]]s of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1590162,00.html ''How An Escape Artist Became Aceh's Governor''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803235400/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1590162,00.html |date=3 August 2008 }}, [[Time Magazine]], 15 February 2007</ref> Aceh was the closest point of land to the [[epicenter]] of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], which devastated much of the western coast of the province.

For example, the head of a stone sculpture of [[Avalokiteshvara]] [[Boddhisattva]] was discovered in Aceh. Images of [[Amitabha]] Buddhas adorn his crown in front and on each side. [[Srivijaya]]n art estimated 9th century CE collection of [[National Museum of Indonesia]], Jakarta.\n\nHistoric names such as Indrapurba, Indrapurwa, Indrapatra, and Indrapuri, which refer to Hindu god [[Indra]], gave some hint of Indian influence on this region. However, unlike Jambi and South Sumatra, there are no significant archaeological sites and findings such as [[Candi of Indonesia|temples]], that link this region with Hindu-Buddhist culture.\n\nChinese sources from this time mention that there was a settlement in northernmost Sumatra (Aceh) which was called P'o-lu. Many scholars believe that P'o-lu was near what is now modern day [[Banda Aceh]]. These same sources also state that the regular people of this land wore cotton clothing while the ruling elite wore silk clothing. The king of P'o-lu was said to use elephants to pull his personal wagon. The Chinese annals also claim that the people were Buddhist.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=1-57958-468-3|editor-last=Skutsch|editor-first=Carl|volume=1|location=New York|pages=4, 5}}</ref>\n\n===Beginnings of Islam in Southeast Asia===\n{{See also|Spread of Islam in Indonesia}}\n[[File:Pasai.jpg|thumb|Map of [[Pasai]], the first Islamic kingdom in [[South East Asia]]|left]]\n\nEvidence concerning the initial coming and subsequent establishment of Islam in Southeast Asia is thin and inconclusive. The historian Anthony Reid has argued that the region of the Cham people on the south-central coast of Vietnam was one of the earliest Islamic centers in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, as the Cham people fled the Vietnamese, one of the earliest locations that they established a relationship was with Aceh.<ref>Reid (1988 and 1993)</ref> Furthermore, it is thought that one of the earliest centers of Islam was in the Aceh region. When [[Venice|Venetian]] traveller [[Marco Polo]] passed by Sumatra on his way home from China in 1292 he found that [[Perlak, Aceh|Peureulak]] was a Muslim town while nearby 'Basma(n)' and 'Samara' were not. 'Basma(n)' and 'Samara' are often said to be [[Pasai|Pasai and Samudra]] but evidence is inconclusive. The gravestone of Sultan Malik as-Salih, the first Muslim ruler of Samudra, has been found and is dated [[Hijri year|AH]] 696 (AD 1297). This is the earliest clear evidence of a Muslim dynasty in the Indonesia-Malay area and more gravestones from the thirteenth century show that this region continued under Muslim rule. [[Ibn Batutah]], a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] traveller, passing through on his way to China in 1345 and 1346, found that the ruler of Samudra was a follower of the [[Shafi'i]] school of Islam.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 4</ref>\n\nThe name Aceh began to appear around the sixteenth century when its name was used to refer to the port at the northern tip of Sumatra. Aceh soon became a cultural and scholastic Islamic center throughout Southeast Asia around this period. It also became wealthy because it was a center of extensive trade.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=1-57958-468-3|editor-last=Skutsch|editor-first=Carl|volume=1|location=New York|pages=5}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese apothecary [[Tome Pires]] reported in his early 16th-century book ''Suma Oriental'' that most of the kings of Sumatra from Aceh through [[Palembang]] were Muslim. At Pasai, in what is now the [[North Aceh Regency]], there was a thriving international port. Pires attributed the establishment of Islam in Pasai to the 'cunning' of the Muslim merchants. The ruler of Pasai, however, had not been able to convert the people of the interior.<ref>Ricklefs (1991),\n page 7</ref>\n\n===Sultanate of Aceh===\n{{Main|Aceh Sultanate}}The Sultanate of Aceh was established by Sultan [[Ali Mughayat Syah]] in 1511.\n\nIn 1584\u201388 the Bishop of [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], D. Jo\u00e3o Ribeiro Gaio, based on information provided by a former captive called Diogo Gil, wrote the \"Roteiro das Cousas do Achem\" (Lisboa 1997) \u2013 a description of the Sultanate.\n\nLater, during its [[golden era]], in the 17th century, its [[wikt:Special:Search/territory|territory]] and political influence expanded as far as [[Satun]] in southern [[Thailand]], [[Johor]] in [[Malay Peninsula]], and Siak in what is today the province of [[Riau]]. As was the case with most non-Javan pre-colonial states, [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] power expanded outward by sea rather than inland. As it expanded down the Sumatran coast, its main competitors were [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]] and [[Portuguese Malacca]] on the other side of the [[Straits of Malacca]]. It was this seaborne trade focus that saw Aceh rely on rice imports from north [[Java]] rather than develop [[self sufficiency]] in rice production.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 17</ref>[[File:Aceh Sultanate en.svg|thumb|Map of Aceh Sultanate during the reign of Sultan Iskandar Muda|left]]\n\nAfter the Portuguese occupation of [[Malacca]] in 1511, many Islamic traders passing the [[Malacca Straits]] shifted their trade to [[Banda Aceh]] and increased the [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] rulers' wealth. During the reign of [[Sultan Iskandar Muda]] in the 17th century, Aceh's influence extended to most of [[Sumatra]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Aceh allied itself with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Dutch East India Company]] in their struggle against the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and the [[Johor Sultanate]]. Acehnese military power waned gradually thereafter, and Aceh ceded its territory of [[Pariaman]] in [[Sumatra]] to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in the 18th century.<ref>*D. G. E. Hall, ''A History of South-east Asia''. London: Macmillan, 1955.</ref>\n\nBy the early nineteenth century, however, Aceh had become an increasingly influential power due to its strategic location for controlling regional trade. In the 1820s it was the producer of over half the world's supply of black pepper. The pepper trade produced new wealth for the Sultanate and for the rulers of many smaller nearby ports that had been under Aceh's control, but were now able to assert more independence. These changes initially threatened Aceh's integrity, but a new sultan [[Alauddin Ibrahim Mansur Syah|Tuanku Ibrahim]], who controlled the kingdom from 1838 to 1870, reasserted power over nearby ports.<ref name=\"ricklefs2001p185\">Ricklefs, M.C. (2001) ''A history of modern Indonesia since c.1200''. Stanford: Stanford University Press. p&nbsp;185\u2013188.</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] the [[United Kingdom|British]] ceded their colonial possessions on Sumatra to the Dutch. In the treaty, the British described Aceh as one of their possessions, although they had no actual control over the Sultanate. Initially, under the agreement the Dutch agreed to respect Aceh's independence. In 1871, however, the British dropped previous opposition to a Dutch invasion of Aceh, possibly to prevent [[France]] or the United States from gaining a foothold in the region. Although neither the Dutch nor the British knew the specifics, there had been rumors since the 1850s that Aceh had been in communication with the rulers of France and of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"ricklefs2001p185\"/>\n\n===Aceh War===\n{{Main|Aceh War}}\n\n[[File:Generaal Kohler sneuvelt in de Mesigit.jpg|thumb|[[Johan K\u00f6hler|General K\u00f6hler]], commandant of Dutch troops, died from a shot by an Acehnese sniper during the first attack on Aceh]]\nPirates operating from Aceh threatened commerce in the [[Strait of Malacca]]; the sultan was unable to control them. Britain was a protector of Aceh and gave the Netherlands permission to eradicate the pirates. The campaign quickly drove out the sultan but the local leaders mobilized and fought the Dutch in four decades of guerrilla war, with high levels of atrocities.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Nicholas Tarling|editorlink=Nicholas Tarling|title=The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia: Volume 2, the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBfsaw64rjMC&pg=PA104|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=104|isbn=978-0-521-35506-3|access-date=15 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423234134/https://books.google.com/books?id=pBfsaw64rjMC&pg=PA104|archive-date=23 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The Dutch colonial government declared war on Aceh on 26 March 1873. Aceh sought American help but Washington rejected the request.<ref name=\"ricklefs2001p185\"/>\n\nThe Dutch tried one strategy after another over the course of four decades. An expedition under Major General [[Johan Harmen Rudolf K\u00f6hler]] in 1873 occupied most of the coastal areas. K\u00f6hler's strategy was to attack and take the Sultan's palace. It failed. The Dutch then tried a naval blockade, reconciliation, concentration within a line of forts, and lastly passive containment. They had scant success. Reaching 15 to 20 million guilders a year, the heavy spending for failed strategies nearly bankrupted the colonial government.<ref>E.H. Kossmann, ''The Low Countries 1780\u20131940'' (1978) pp&nbsp;400\u2013401</ref>\n\nThe Aceh army was rapidly modernized, and Aceh soldiers managed to kill K\u00f6hler (a monument to this achievement has been built inside Grand Mosque of Banda Aceh). K\u00f6hler made some grave tactical errors and the reputation of the Dutch was severely harmed.

Alleged unequal distribution of profits between central government and the native people of Aceh induced Dr. [[Hasan Muhammad di Tiro]], former ambassador of Darul Islam,<ref name=\"ibrahimy\"/> to call for an independent Aceh. He proclaimed independence in 1976.\n\nThe movement had a small number of followers initially, and Dr. Hasan Muhammad di Tiro himself had to live in exile in Sweden. Meanwhile, the province followed [[Suharto]]'s policy of economic development and industrialization. During the late 1980s several security incidents prompted the Indonesian central government to take repressive measures and to send troops to Aceh. Human rights abuse was rampant for the next decade, resulting in many grievances on the part of the Acehnese toward the Indonesian central government. In 1990, the Indonesian government initiated [[1990\u201398 Indonesian military operations in Aceh|military operations against GAM]] by deploying more than 12.000 Indonesian army in the region.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nDuring the late 1990s, chaos in Java and an ineffective central government gave an advantage to the Free Aceh Movement and resulted in the second phase of the rebellion, this time with large support from the Acehnese people. This support was demonstrated during the 1999 plebiscite in Banda Aceh which was attended by nearly half a million people (of four million population of the province). Indonesian central government responded in 2001 by broadening Aceh's autonomy, giving its government the right to apply Sharia law more broadly and the right to receive direct foreign investment. This was again accompanied by repressive measures, however, and in 2003 [[2003-2004 Indonesian offensive in Aceh|an offensive began]] and a [[state of emergency]] was proclaimed in the Province.

Since the disaster, the Acehnese rebel movement GAM, which had been fighting for independence against the Indonesian authorities for 29 years, has signed a peace deal (15 August 2005). The perception that the tsunami was punishment for insufficient piety in this proudly Muslim province is partly behind the increased emphasis on the importance of religion post-tsunami. This has been most obvious in the increased implementation of [[Sharia]] law, including the introduction of the controversial 'WH' or Syariah police. As homes are being built and people's basic needs are met, the people are also looking to improve the quality of [[education]], increase tourism, and develop responsible, sustainable industry. Well-qualified educators are in high demand in Aceh.\n\n[[File:US Navy 050101-O-XXXXB-054 Boats washed ashore near local businesses in down town Aceh, Sumatra following a massive Tsunami that struck the area on the 26th of December 2004.jpg|thumb|left|Boats washed ashore near local businesses in down town Aceh, Sumatra following a massive tsunami that struck the area on 26 December 2004]]\n\nWhile parts of the capital [[Banda Aceh]] were unscathed, the areas closest to the water, especially the areas of Kampung Jawa and Meuraxa, were completely destroyed. Most of the rest of the western coast of Aceh was severely damaged. Many towns completely disappeared. Other towns on Aceh's west coast hit by the disaster included [[Lhoknga]], [[Leupung]], Lamno, [[Patek]], [[Calang]], [[Teunom]], and the island of [[Simeulue]]. Affected or destroyed towns on the region's north and east coasts were [[Pidie Regency]], [[Samalanga]], and [[Lhokseumawe]].\n\nThe area was slowly rebuilt after the disaster. The government initially proposed the creation of a two-kilometer [[buffer zone]] along low-lying coastal areas within which permanent construction was not permitted. This proposal was unpopular among some local inhabitants and proved impractical in most situations, especially [[fishing]] families that are dependent on living near to the sea.\n\nThe Indonesian government set up a special agency for Aceh reconstruction, the [[Badan Rehabilitasi dan Rekonstruksi]] (BRR) headed by [[Kuntoro Mangkusubroto]], a former Indonesian Minister. This agency had ministry level of authority and incorporated officials, professionals and community leaders from all backgrounds.

Five qanuns enacted between 2002 and 2004 contained criminal penalties for violations of Sharia: Qanun 11/2002 on \"belief, ritual, and promoting Islam,\" which contains the Islamic attire requirement; Qanun 12/2003 prohibiting the consumption and sale of alcohol; Qanun 13/2003 prohibiting gambling; Qanun 14 /2003 prohibiting \"seclusion\"; and Qanun 7/2004 on the payment of Islamic alms. With the exception of gambling, none of the offenses are prohibited outside of Aceh.<ref name=shariapolicing/>\n\nResponsibility for enforcement of the qanuns rests both with the National Police and with a special Sharia police force unique to Aceh, known as the [[Wilayatul Hisbah]] (Sharia Authority). All of the qanuns provide for penalties including fines, imprisonment, and [[caning]], the latter a punishment unknown in most parts of Indonesia. Between mid-2005 and early 2007, at least 135 people were caned in Aceh for transgressing the qanuns.<ref name=shariapolicing/> In April 2016, a 60-year-old non-Muslim woman was sentenced to 30 lashes for selling alcohol drinks.

Persistent inflation means that Aceh's [[consumer price index]] (CPI) remains the highest in Indonesia. As a result, Aceh's cost competitiveness has declined as reflected in both inflation and wage data. Although inflation has slowed down, CPI has registered steady increases since the tsunami. Using 2002 as a base, Aceh's CPI increased to 185.6 (June 2007) while the national\nCPI increased to 148.2. There have been relatively large nominal wage increases in particular sectors, such as construction where, on average, workers' nominal wages have risen to almost Rp.60,000 per day, from Rp.29,000 pre-tsunami. This is also reflected in Aceh's minimum regional wage (UMR, or Upah Minimum Regional), which increased by 55% from Rp.550,000 pre-tsunami to Rp.850,000 in 2007, compared with an increase of 42% in neighboring [[North Sumatra]], from Rp.537,000 to Rp.761,000.\n\n[[Poverty]] levels increased slightly in Aceh in 2005 after the tsunami, but by less than expected.<ref>World Bank, Jakarta, [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINDONESIA/Resources/Publication/280016-1200376036925/acehpoverty2008_en.pdf Aceh Poverty Assessment 2008] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228013215/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINDONESIA/Resources/Publication/280016-1200376036925/acehpoverty2008_en.pdf |date=28 February 2008 }}.</ref> The poverty level then fell in 2006 to below the pre-tsunami level, suggesting that the rise in tsunami-related poverty was short lived and reconstruction activities and the end of the conflict most probably facilitated this decline.

An estimated 170,000 people died in Aceh in the 2004 tsunami which further complicates the task of careful demographic analysis. According to the most recent censuses, the total population of Aceh in 2010 was 4,486,570 and in 2015 was 4,993,385; the latest official estimate (as at 1 July 2019) was 5,316,320.<ref name=\"Badan Pusat Statistik 2019\">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2019.</ref>\n\n===Ethnic and cultural groups===\nAceh is a diverse region occupied by several ethnic and language groups. The major ethnic groups are the [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] (who are distributed throughout Aceh), [[Gayo people|Gayo]] (in central and eastern part), [[Alas people|Alas]] (in [[Southeast Aceh Regency]]), [[Malay people|Tamiang-Malays]] (in [[Aceh Tamiang Regency]]), [[Aneuk Jamee people|Aneuk Jamee]] (descendant from [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], concentrated in southern and southwestern), [[Kluet people|Kluet]] (in [[South Aceh Regency]]), and [[Simeulue people|Simeulue]] (on [[Simeulue]] Island). There is also a significant population of [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], Among the present day Acehnese can be found some individuals of [[Arab]], [[Turkish People|Turkish]], and [[India]]n descent.\n\nThe [[Acehnese language]] is widely spoken within the Acehnese population. This is a member of the [[Aceh-Chamic languages|Aceh-Chamic]] group of languages, whose other representatives are mostly found in Vietnam and Cambodia, and is also closely related to the [[Malay language|Malay]] group of languages. Acehnese also has many words borrowed from Malay and [[Arabic]] and traditionally was written using [[Jawi script|Arabic script]]. Acehnese is also used as local language in Langkat and Asahan ([[North Sumatra]]), and Kedah (Malaysia), and once dominated Penang. Alas and Kluet are closely related languages within the [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] group. The Jamee language originated from [[Minangkabau language]] in [[West Sumatra]], with just a few variations and differences.\n\n===Religion===\n{{bar box\n|title=Religion in Aceh (2010 census)<ref name=\"BPS\u0320Religion\u03202010\">{{cite web | title = Population by Region and Religion in Indonesia | work = [[Badan Pusat Statistik|BPS]] | year = 2010 | url = http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&wid=0 | access-date = 22 June 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171114104051/http://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site/tabel?tid=321&wid=0 | archive-date = 14 November 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=religion\n|right1=percent\n|float=right\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|Islam|green|98.19}}\n{{bar percent|Christianity|Blue|1.19}}\n{{bar percent|other, asked or not stated|gray|0.46}}\n{{bar percent|Buddhism|orange|0.16}}\n}}\nAccording to 2010 census of the Central Statistics Agency, Muslims dominate Aceh with more than 98% or 4,413,200 followers and only 50,300 Protestants and 3,310 Catholics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/13/regent-orders-churches-closed-destroyed-aceh.html |title=Regent orders churches closed, destroyed in Aceh |accessdate=13 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617063940/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/13/regent-orders-churches-closed-destroyed-aceh.html |archive-date=17 June 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nReligious issues are often sensitive in Aceh.

The standard [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754 design rationale|addressed many problems]] found in the diverse floating-point implementations that made them difficult to use reliably and [[Software portability|portably]]. Many hardware [[floating-point unit]]s use the IEEE 754 standard.\n\nThe standard defines:\n* ''arithmetic formats:'' sets of [[Binary code|binary]] and [[decimal]] floating-point data, which consist of finite numbers (including [[signed zero]]s and [[subnormal number]]s), [[infinity|infinities]], and special \"not a number\" values ([[NaN]]s)\n* ''interchange formats:'' encodings (bit strings) that may be used to dddddddddddddddddddexchange floating-point data in an efficient and compact form\n* ''rounding rules:'' properties to be satisfied when rounding numbers during arithmetic and conversions\n* ''operations:'' arithmetic and other operations (such as [[trigonometric functions]]) on arithmetic formats\n* ''exception handling:'' indications of exceptional conditions (such as [[division by zero]], overflow, ''etc.'')\n\n[[IEEE 754-2008 revision|IEEE 754-2008]], published in August 2008, includes nearly all of the original [[IEEE 754-1985]] standard, plus the [[IEEE 854-1987|IEEE 854-1987 Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point Arithmetic]].  {{anchor|2019}}The current version, IEEE 754-2019, was published in July 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/754-2019.html|title=IEEE 754-2019 - IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic|website=standards.ieee.org|accessdate=23 July 2019}}</ref> It is a minor revision of the previous version, incorporating mainly clarifications, defect fixes and new recommended operations.\n\n==Standard development==\nThe first standard for floating-point arithmetic, [[IEEE 754-1985]], was published in 1985.

A format may also include how the set is encoded.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a72.1.27}}.</ref>\n\nA floating-point format is specified by:\n* a base (also called ''radix'') ''b'', which is either 2 (binary) or 10 (decimal) in IEEE 754;\n* a precision ''p'';\n* an exponent range from ''emin'' to ''emax'', with ''emin'' = 1 \u2212 ''emax'' for all IEEE 754 formats.\n\nA format comprises:\n* Finite numbers, which can be described by three integers: ''s''&nbsp;= a ''sign'' (zero or one), ''c''&nbsp;= a ''[[significand]]'' (or ''coefficient'') having no more than ''p'' digits when written in base ''b'' (i.e., an integer in the range through 0 to ''b''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1), and ''q''&nbsp;= an ''exponent'' such that ''emin'' \u2264 ''q''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 \u2264 ''emax''. The numerical value of such a finite number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>''s''</sup> \u00d7 ''c'' \u00d7 ''b''<sup>''q''</sup>}}.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">For example, if the base is 10, the sign is 1 (indicating negative), the significand is 12345, and the exponent is \u22123, then the value of the number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>1</sup> \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>}} = {{nowrap|\u22121 \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 0.001}} = \u221212.345.</ref> Moreover, there are two zero values, called [[signed zero]]s: the sign bit specifies whether a zero is +0 (positive zero) or \u22120 (negative zero).\n* Two infinities: +\u221e and \u2212\u221e.\n* Two kinds of [[NaN]] (not-a-number): a quiet NaN (qNaN) and a signaling NaN (sNaN).\n\nFor example, if ''b'' = 10, ''p'' = 7, and ''emax'' = 96, then ''emin'' = \u221295, the significand satisfies 0 \u2264 ''c'' \u2264 {{val|9999999}}, and the exponent satisfies \u2212101 \u2264 ''q'' \u2264 90. Consequently, the smallest non-zero positive number that can be represented is 1\u00d710<sup>\u2212101</sup>, and the largest is 9999999\u00d710<sup>90</sup> (9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>), so the full range of numbers is \u22129.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup> through 9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>. The numbers \u2212''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> and ''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> (here, \u22121\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup> and 1\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup>) are the smallest (in magnitude) ''normal numbers''; non-zero numbers between these smallest numbers are called [[subnormal number]]s.\n\n=== Representation and encoding in memory ===\nSome numbers may have several possible exponential format representations. For instance, if ''b''\u00a0=\u00a010, and ''p''\u00a0=\u00a07, then \u221212.345 can be represented by \u221212345\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>, \u2212123450\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>, and \u22121234500\u00d710<sup>\u22125</sup>. However, for most operations, such as arithmetic operations, the result (value) does not depend on the representation of the inputs.\n\nFor the decimal formats, any representation is valid, and the set of these representations is called a ''cohort''. When a result can have several representations, the standard specifies which member of the cohort is chosen.\n\nFor the binary formats, the representation is made unique by choosing the smallest representable exponent allowing the value to be represented exactly. Further, the exponent is not represented directly, but a bias is added so that the smallest representable exponent is represented as 1, with 0 used for subnormal numbers. For numbers with an exponent in the normal range (the exponent field being not all ones or all zeros), the leading bit of the significand will always be 1. Consequently, a leading 1 can be implied rather than explicitly present in the memory encoding, and under the standard the explicitly represented part of the significand will lie between 0 and 1. This rule is called ''leading bit convention'', ''implicit bit convention'', or ''hidden bit convention''. This rule allows the binary format to have an extra bit of precision. The leading bit convention cannot be used for the subnormal numbers as they have an exponent outside the normal exponent range and scale by the smallest represented exponent as used for the smallest normal numbers.\n\nDue to the possibility of multiple encodings (at least in formats called ''interchange formats''), a NaN may carry other information: a sign bit (which has no meaning, but may be used by some operations) and a ''payload'', which is intended for diagnostic information indicating the source of the NaN (but the payload may have other uses, such as ''NaN-boxing''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Internals |title=SpiderMonkey Internals |website=developer.mozilla.org |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Klemens |first1=Ben |title=21st Century C: C Tips from the New School |date=September 2014 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Incorporated |page=160 |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=ASuiBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=11 March 2018|isbn=9781491904442 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://github.com/zuiderkwast/nanbox |title=zuiderkwast/nanbox: NaN-boxing in C |website=[[GitHub]] |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref>).\n\n=== Basic and interchange formats ===\n\nThe standard defines five basic formats that are named for their numeric base and the number of bits used in their interchange encoding. There are three binary floating-point basic formats (encoded with 32, 64 or 128 bits) and two decimal floating-point basic formats (encoded with 64 or 128 bits). The [[binary32]] and [[binary64]] formats are the ''single'' and ''double'' formats of [[IEEE 754-1985]] respectively. A conforming implementation must fully implement at least one of the basic formats.\n\nThe standard also defines ''[[#Interchange formats|interchange formats]]'', which generalize these basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.6}}.</ref> For the binary formats, the leading bit convention is required. The following table summarizes the smallest interchange formats (including the basic ones).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Name                                                   !! Common name        !!

For example, the smallest positive number that can be represented in binary64 is 2<sup>\u22121074</sup>; contributions to the \u22121074 figure include the E&nbsp;min value \u22121022 and all but one of the 53 significand bits (2<sup>\u22121022&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;(53&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>\u22121074</sup>).\n\nDecimal digits is ''digits'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate precision in number of decimal digits.\n\nDecimal E max is ''Emax'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate value of the maximum decimal exponent.\n\nThe binary32 (single) and binary64 (double) formats are two of the most common formats used today. The figure below shows the absolute precision for both formats over a range of values. This figure can be used to select an appropriate format given the expected value of a number and the required precision.\n\n[[File:IEEE754.svg|thumb|none|frame|550px|Precision of binary32 and binary64 in the range 10<sup>\u221212</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup>]]\n\n\nAn example of a layout for [[Single-precision floating-point format|32-bit floating point]] is\n[[File:Float example.svg|none]]\n \nand the [[Double-precision floating-point format|64 bit layout is similar]].\n\n=== Extended and extendable precision formats ===\nThe standard specifies optional [[Extended precision|extended]] and extendable precision formats, which provide greater precision than the basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}}.</ref> An extended precision format extends a basic format by using more precision and more exponent range. An extendable precision format allows the user to specify the precision and exponent range. An implementation may use whatever internal representation it chooses for such formats; all that needs to be defined are its parameters (''b'', ''p'', and ''emax''). These parameters uniquely describe the set of finite numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent for the given radix) that it can represent.\n\nThe standard recommends that language standards provide a method of specifying ''p'' and ''emax'' for each supported base ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards should define mechanisms supporting extendable precision for each supported radix.\"</ref><!-- extendable recommendation does not apply to \"implementations\". --> The standard recommends that language standards and implementations support an extended format which has a greater precision than the largest basic format supported for each radix ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards or implementations should support an extended precision format that extends the widest basic format that is supported in that radix.\"</ref> For an extended format with a precision between two basic formats the exponent range must be as great as that of the next wider basic format. So for instance a 64-bit extended precision binary number must have an 'emax' of at least 16383. The [[x87]] [[Extended precision#x86 extended precision format|80-bit extended format]] meets this requirement.\n\n=== Interchange formats ===\nInterchange formats are intended for the exchange of floating-point data using a bit string of fixed length for a given format. \n\n====Binary====\nFor the exchange of binary floating-point numbers, interchange formats of length 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits, and any multiple of 32 bits \u2265 128<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Contrary to decimal, there is no binary interchange format of 96-bit length. Such a format is still allowed as a non-interchange format, though.</ref> are defined.  The 16-bit format is intended for the exchange or storage of small numbers (e.g., for graphics).\n\nThe encoding scheme for these binary interchange formats is the same as that of IEEE 754-1985: a sign bit, followed by ''w'' exponent bits that describe the exponent offset by a ''[[Exponent bias|bias]]'', and ''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 bits that describe the significand.  The width of the exponent field for a ''k''-bit format is computed as ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;round(4&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''k''))&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;13.  The existing 64- and 128-bit formats follow this rule, but the 16- and 32-bit formats have more exponent bits (5 and 8 respectively) than this formula would provide (3 and 7 respectively).\n\nAs with IEEE 754-1985, the biased-exponent field is filled with all 1 bits to indicate either infinity (trailing significand field = 0) or a NaN (trailing significand field \u2260 0).  For NaNs, quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs are distinguished by using the most significant bit of the trailing significand field exclusively,{{efn|The standard recommends 0 for signaling NaNs, 1 for quiet NaNs, so that a signaling NaNs can be quieted by changing only this bit to 1, while the reverse could yield the encoding of an infinity.}} and the payload is carried in the remaining bits.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n====Decimal====\nFor the exchange of decimal floating-point numbers, interchange formats of any multiple of 32 bits are defined.\n\nThe encoding scheme for the decimal interchange formats similarly encodes the sign, exponent, and significand, but two different bit-level representations are defined.  Interchange is complicated by the fact that some external indicator of the representation in use is required.  The two options allow the significand to be encoded as a compressed sequence of decimal digits (using [[densely packed decimal]]) or alternatively as a binary integer.  The former is more convenient for direct hardware implementation of the standard, while the latter is more suited to software emulation on a binary computer.  In either case the set of numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent) that may be encoded is identical, and [[Floating point#Special values|special values]] (\u00b1zero, \u00b1infinity, quiet NaNs, and signaling NaNs) have identical binary representations.\n\n== Rounding rules ==\nThe standard defines five rounding rules.  The first two rules round to a nearest value; the others are called ''[[directed rounding]]s'':\n\n=== Roundings to nearest ===\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half to even|Round to nearest, ties to even]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value with an even least significant digit; this is the default for binary floating point and the recommended default for decimal.\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half away from zero|Round to nearest, ties away from zero]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value above (for positive numbers) or below (for negative numbers); this is intended as an option for decimal floating point.\n\n=== Directed roundings ===\n* '''Round toward 0'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards zero (also known as ''truncation'').\n* '''Round toward +\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards positive infinity (also known as ''rounding up'' or ''ceiling'').\n* '''Round toward \u2212\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards negative infinity (also known as ''rounding down'' or ''floor'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of rounding to integers using the IEEE 754 rules\n!rowspan=2| Mode ||colspan=4| Example value\n|-\n! +11.5\n! +12.5\n! \u221211.5\n! \u221212.5\n|-\n| to nearest, ties to even\n| +12.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| to nearest, ties away from zero\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|-\n| toward 0\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward +\u221e\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward \u2212\u221e\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|}\n\nUnless specified otherwise, the floating-point result of an operation is determined by applying the rounding function on the infinitely precise (mathematical) result. The operation is said to be ''correctly rounded''.  This requirement is called ''correct rounding''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a72.1}}</ref>\n\n== Required operations ==\n\nRequired operations for a supported arithmetic format (including the basic formats) include:\n\n* Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, [[Multiply\u2013accumulate operation|fused multiply\u2013add]], remainder)<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.1}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.1}}</ref>\n* Conversions (between formats, to and from strings, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.3}}</ref>\n* Scaling and (for decimal) quantizing<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.3}}</ref>\n* Copying and manipulating the sign (abs, negate, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.5.1}}</ref>\n* Comparisons and total ordering<ref name=total-ordering>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref>\n* Classification and testing for NaNs, ''etc.''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.2}}</ref>\n* Testing and setting flags<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.4}}</ref>\n* Miscellaneous operations.\n\n=== Comparison predicates ===\n\nThe standard provides comparison predicates to compare one floating-point datum to another in the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref> Any comparison with a NaN is treated as unordered. \u22120 and +0 compare as equal.\n\n=== Total-ordering predicate ===\n\nThe standard provides a predicate ''totalOrder'', which defines a [[total order]]ing on canonical members of the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> The predicate agrees with the comparison predicates when one floating-point number is less than the other. The ''totalOrder'' predicate does not impose a total ordering on all encodings in a format. In particular, it does not distinguish among different encodings of the same floating-point representation, as when one or both encodings are non-canonical.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> IEEE 754-2019 incorporates clarifications of ''totalOrder''.\n\n== Exception handling ==\nThe standard defines five exceptions, each of which returns a default value and has a corresponding status flag that (except in certain cases of underflow) is raised when the exception occurs.  No other exception handling is required, but additional non-default alternatives are recommended (see below).\n\nThe five possible exceptions are:\n* Invalid operation: mathematically undefined, ''e.g.'', the square root of a negative number. By default, returns qNaN.\n* Division by zero: an operation on finite operands gives an exact infinite result, ''e.g.'', 1/0 or log(0). By default, returns \u00b1infinity.\n* Overflow: a result is too large to be represented correctly (''i.e.'', its exponent with an unbounded exponent range would be larger than ''emax''). By default, returns \u00b1infinity for the round-to-nearest modes (and follows the rounding rules for the directed rounding modes).\n* Underflow: a result is very small (outside the normal range) and is inexact. By default, returns a [[Denormal number|subnormal]] or zero (following the rounding rules).\n* Inexact: the exact (''i.e.'', unrounded) result is not representable exactly. By default, returns the correctly rounded result.\n\nThese are the same five exceptions as were defined in IEEE 754-1985, but the ''division by zero'' exception has been extended to operations other than the division.\n\nFor decimal floating point, there are additional exceptions along with the above:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html#signals|title=9.4. decimal \u2014 Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic \u2014 Python 3.6.5 documentation|website=docs.python.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daexcep.html|title=Decimal Arithmetic - Exceptional conditions|website=speleotrove.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Clamped: a result's exponent is too large for the destination format. By default, trailing zeros will be added to the coefficient to reduce the exponent to the largest usable value.

By contrast, the previous [[IEEE 754-1985|1985]] version of the standard left aspects of the language interface unspecified, which led to inconsistent behavior between compilers, or different optimization levels in a single compiler.\n\nProgramming languages should allow a user to specify a minimum precision for intermediate calculations of expressions for each radix. This is referred to as \"preferredWidth\" in the standard, and it should be possible to set this on a per block basis. Intermediate calculations within expressions should be calculated, and any temporaries saved, using the maximum of the width of the operands and the preferred width, if set. Thus, for instance, a compiler targeting [[x87]] floating-point hardware should have a means of specifying that intermediate calculations must use the [[Extended precision#IEEE 754 extended precision formats|double-extended format]]. The stored value of a variable must always be used when evaluating subsequent expressions, rather than any precursor from before rounding and assigning to the variable.\n\n=== Reproducibility ===\nThe IEEE 754-1985 allowed many variations in implementations (such as the encoding of some values and the detection of certain exceptions). IEEE 754-2008 has strengthened up many of these, but a few variations still remain (especially for binary formats).  The reproducibility clause recommends that language standards should provide a means to write reproducible programs (i.e., programs that will produce the same result in all implementations of a language) and describes what needs to be done to achieve reproducible results.\n\n== Character representation ==\nThe standard requires operations to convert between basic formats and ''external character sequence'' formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12}}.</ref> Conversions to and from a decimal character format are required for all formats. Conversion to an external character sequence must be such that conversion back using rounding to even will recover the original number. There is no requirement to preserve the payload of a quiet NaN or signaling NaN, and conversion from the external character sequence may turn a signaling NaN into a quiet NaN.\n\nThe original binary value will be preserved by converting to decimal and back again using:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12.2}}.</ref>\n* 5 decimal digits for binary16,\n* 9 decimal digits for binary32,\n* 17 decimal digits for binary64,\n* 36 decimal digits for binary128.\n\nFor other binary formats, the required number of decimal digits is\n\n: <math>1 + \\lceil p\\log_{10}(2)\\rceil,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the number of significant bits in the binary format, e.g. 237 bits for binary256.\n\n(Note: as an implementation limit, correct rounding is only guaranteed for the number of decimal digits above plus 3 for the largest supported binary format. For instance, if binary32 is the largest supported binary format, then a conversion from a decimal external sequence with 12 decimal digits is guaranteed to be correctly rounded when converted to binary32; but conversion of a sequence of 13 decimal digits is not; however, the standard recommends that implementations impose no such limit.)\n\nWhen using a decimal floating-point format, the decimal representation will be preserved using:\n* 7 decimal digits for decimal32,\n* 16 decimal digits for decimal64,\n* 34 decimal digits for decimal128.\n\nAlgorithms, with code, for correctly rounded conversion from binary to decimal and decimal to binary are discussed by Gay,<ref>{{Cite journal |first=David M. |last=Gay |title=Correctly rounded binary-decimal and decimal-binary conversions |series=Numerical Analysis Manuscript |id=90-10 |publisher=AT&T Laboratories |location=Murry Hill, NJ, USA |date=November 30, 1990 |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.31.4049 |doi= |ref=harv }}</ref> and for testing{{snd}} by Paxson and Kahan.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=A Program for Testing IEEE Decimal\u2013Binary Conversion |publisher= |series=Manuscript |first1=Vern |last1=Paxson |first2=William |last2=Kahan |author2-link=William Kahan |date=May 22, 1991 |doi= |ref=harv |citeseerx = 10.1.1.144.5889}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Binade]]\n* [[Coprocessor]]\n* [[C99#IEEE.C2.A0754 floating point support|C99]] for code examples demonstrating  access and use of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754: floating point in modern computers|Floating-point arithmetic]], for history, design rationale and example usage of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Fixed-point arithmetic]], for an alternative approach at computation with rational numbers (especially beneficial when the mantissa range is known, fixed, or bound at compile time).\n* [[IBM System z9]], the first CPU to implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic (using hardware microcode).\n* [[IBM z10 (microprocessor)|IBM z10]], [[IBM z196]], [[IBM zEC12 (microprocessor)|IBM zEC12]], and [[IBM z13 (microprocessor)|IBM z13]], CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008  decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[ISO/IEC 10967]], language-independent arithmetic (LIA).\n* [[Minifloat]], low-precision binary floating-point formats following IEEE 754 principles.\n* [[POWER6]], [[POWER7]], and [[POWER8]] CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[strictfp]], a keyword in the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] that restricts arithmetic to IEEE 754 single and double precision to ensure reproducibility across common hardware platforms.\n* [[Rounding#Table-maker's dilemma|The table-maker's dilemma]] for more about the correct rounding of functions.\n* [[Standard Apple Numerics Environment]]\n* [[Tapered floating point]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Standards ===\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2008 |pages=1\u201370 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=August 29, 2008 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2008 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935 |ref=CITEREFIEEE_7542008 |isbn=978-0-7381-5753-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2019 |pages=1\u201384 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=July 22, 2019 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2019 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2019.8766229  |isbn=978-1-5044-5924-2 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 \u2014 Information technology \u2014 Microprocessor Systems \u2014 Floating-Point arithmetic |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/57469.html |publisher=Iso.org |pages=1\u201358 |date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Secondary references ===\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal Decimal floating-point] arithmetic, FAQs, bibliography, and links\n* [http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm Comparing binary floats]\n* [http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/IEEE-754.old/References.xhtml IEEE 754 Reference Material]\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal/854mins.html IEEE 854-1987]&nbsp;\u2013 History and minutes\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171230124220/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/reading.html Supplementary readings for IEEE 754].

The standard [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754 design rationale|addressed many problems]] found in the diverse floating-point implementations that made them difficult to use reliably and [[Software portability|portably]].

The numerical value of such a finite number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>''s''</sup> \u00d7 ''c'' \u00d7 ''b''<sup>''q''</sup>}}.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">For example, if the base is 10, the sign is 1 (indicating negative), the significand is 12345, and the exponent is \u22123, then the value of the number is {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>1</sup> \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>}} = {{nowrap|\u22121 \u00d7 12345 \u00d7 0.001}} = \u221212.345.</ref> Moreover, there are two zero values, called [[signed zero]]s: the sign bit specifies whether a zero is +0 (positive zero) or \u22120 (negative zero).\n* Two infinities: +\u221e and \u2212\u221e.\n* Two kinds of [[NaN]] (not-a-number): a quiet NaN (qNaN) and a signaling NaN (sNaN).\n\nFor example, if ''b'' = 10, ''p'' = 7, and ''emax'' = 96, then ''emin'' = \u221295, the significand satisfies 0 \u2264 ''c'' \u2264 {{val|9999999}}, and the exponent satisfies \u2212101 \u2264 ''q'' \u2264 90. Consequently, the smallest non-zero positive number that can be represented is 1\u00d710<sup>\u2212101</sup>, and the largest is 9999999\u00d710<sup>90</sup> (9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>), so the full range of numbers is \u22129.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup> through 9.999999\u00d710<sup>96</sup>. The numbers \u2212''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> and ''b''<sup>1\u2212''emax''</sup> (here, \u22121\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup> and 1\u00d710<sup>\u221295</sup>) are the smallest (in magnitude) ''normal numbers''; non-zero numbers between these smallest numbers are called [[subnormal number]]s.\n\n=== Representation and encoding in memory ===\nSome numbers may have several possible exponential format representations. For instance, if ''b''\u00a0=\u00a010, and ''p''\u00a0=\u00a07, then \u221212.345 can be represented by \u221212345\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>, \u2212123450\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>, and \u22121234500\u00d710<sup>\u22125</sup>. However, for most operations, such as arithmetic operations, the result (value) does not depend on the representation of the inputs.\n\nFor the decimal formats, any representation is valid, and the set of these representations is called a ''cohort''. When a result can have several representations, the standard specifies which member of the cohort is chosen.\n\nFor the binary formats, the representation is made unique by choosing the smallest representable exponent allowing the value to be represented exactly. Further, the exponent is not represented directly, but a bias is added so that the smallest representable exponent is represented as 1, with 0 used for subnormal numbers. For numbers with an exponent in the normal range (the exponent field being not all ones or all zeros), the leading bit of the significand will always be 1. Consequently, a leading 1 can be implied rather than explicitly present in the memory encoding, and under the standard the explicitly represented part of the significand will lie between 0 and 1. This rule is called ''leading bit convention'', ''implicit bit convention'', or ''hidden bit convention''. This rule allows the binary format to have an extra bit of precision. The leading bit convention cannot be used for the subnormal numbers as they have an exponent outside the normal exponent range and scale by the smallest represented exponent as used for the smallest normal numbers.\n\nDue to the possibility of multiple encodings (at least in formats called ''interchange formats''), a NaN may carry other information: a sign bit (which has no meaning, but may be used by some operations) and a ''payload'', which is intended for diagnostic information indicating the source of the NaN (but the payload may have other uses, such as ''NaN-boxing''<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Internals |title=SpiderMonkey Internals |website=developer.mozilla.org |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Klemens |first1=Ben |title=21st Century C: C Tips from the New School |date=September 2014 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Incorporated |page=160 |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=ASuiBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=11 March 2018|isbn=9781491904442 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://github.com/zuiderkwast/nanbox |title=zuiderkwast/nanbox: NaN-boxing in C |website=[[GitHub]] |accessdate=11 March 2018}}</ref>).\n\n=== Basic and interchange formats ===\n\nThe standard defines five basic formats that are named for their numeric base and the number of bits used in their interchange encoding. There are three binary floating-point basic formats (encoded with 32, 64 or 128 bits) and two decimal floating-point basic formats (encoded with 64 or 128 bits). The [[binary32]] and [[binary64]] formats are the ''single'' and ''double'' formats of [[IEEE 754-1985]] respectively. A conforming implementation must fully implement at least one of the basic formats.\n\nThe standard also defines ''[[#Interchange formats|interchange formats]]'', which generalize these basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.6}}.</ref> For the binary formats, the leading bit convention is required. The following table summarizes the smallest interchange formats (including the basic ones).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Name                                                   !! Common name        !!

For example, the smallest positive number that can be represented in binary64 is 2<sup>\u22121074</sup>; contributions to the \u22121074 figure include the E&nbsp;min value \u22121022 and all but one of the 53 significand bits (2<sup>\u22121022&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;(53&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>\u22121074</sup>).\n\nDecimal digits is ''digits'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate precision in number of decimal digits.\n\nDecimal E max is ''Emax'' \u00d7 log<sub>10</sub> ''base''. This gives an approximate value of the maximum decimal exponent.\n\nThe binary32 (single) and binary64 (double) formats are two of the most common formats used today. The figure below shows the absolute precision for both formats over a range of values. This figure can be used to select an appropriate format given the expected value of a number and the required precision.\n\n[[File:IEEE754.svg|thumb|none|frame|550px|Precision of binary32 and binary64 in the range 10<sup>\u221212</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup>]]\n\n\nAn example of a layout for [[Single-precision floating-point format|32-bit floating point]] is\n[[File:Float example.svg|none]]\n \nand the [[Double-precision floating-point format|64 bit layout is similar]].\n\n=== Extended and extendable precision formats ===\nThe standard specifies optional [[Extended precision|extended]] and extendable precision formats, which provide greater precision than the basic formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}}.</ref> An extended precision format extends a basic format by using more precision and more exponent range. An extendable precision format allows the user to specify the precision and exponent range. An implementation may use whatever internal representation it chooses for such formats; all that needs to be defined are its parameters (''b'', ''p'', and ''emax''). These parameters uniquely describe the set of finite numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent for the given radix) that it can represent.\n\nThe standard recommends that language standards provide a method of specifying ''p'' and ''emax'' for each supported base ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards should define mechanisms supporting extendable precision for each supported radix.\"</ref><!-- extendable recommendation does not apply to \"implementations\". --> The standard recommends that language standards and implementations support an extended format which has a greater precision than the largest basic format supported for each radix ''b''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a73.7}} states: \"Language standards or implementations should support an extended precision format that extends the widest basic format that is supported in that radix.\"</ref> For an extended format with a precision between two basic formats the exponent range must be as great as that of the next wider basic format. So for instance a 64-bit extended precision binary number must have an 'emax' of at least 16383. The [[x87]] [[Extended precision#x86 extended precision format|80-bit extended format]] meets this requirement.\n\n=== Interchange formats ===\nInterchange formats are intended for the exchange of floating-point data using a bit string of fixed length for a given format. \n\n====Binary====\nFor the exchange of binary floating-point numbers, interchange formats of length 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits, and any multiple of 32 bits \u2265 128<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">Contrary to decimal, there is no binary interchange format of 96-bit length. Such a format is still allowed as a non-interchange format, though.</ref> are defined.  The 16-bit format is intended for the exchange or storage of small numbers (e.g., for graphics).\n\nThe encoding scheme for these binary interchange formats is the same as that of IEEE 754-1985: a sign bit, followed by ''w'' exponent bits that describe the exponent offset by a ''[[Exponent bias|bias]]'', and ''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 bits that describe the significand.  The width of the exponent field for a ''k''-bit format is computed as ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;round(4&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''k''))&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;13.  The existing 64- and 128-bit formats follow this rule, but the 16- and 32-bit formats have more exponent bits (5 and 8 respectively) than this formula would provide (3 and 7 respectively).\n\nAs with IEEE 754-1985, the biased-exponent field is filled with all 1 bits to indicate either infinity (trailing significand field = 0) or a NaN (trailing significand field \u2260 0).  For NaNs, quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs are distinguished by using the most significant bit of the trailing significand field exclusively,{{efn|The standard recommends 0 for signaling NaNs, 1 for quiet NaNs, so that a signaling NaNs can be quieted by changing only this bit to 1, while the reverse could yield the encoding of an infinity.}} and the payload is carried in the remaining bits.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n====Decimal====\nFor the exchange of decimal floating-point numbers, interchange formats of any multiple of 32 bits are defined.\n\nThe encoding scheme for the decimal interchange formats similarly encodes the sign, exponent, and significand, but two different bit-level representations are defined.  Interchange is complicated by the fact that some external indicator of the representation in use is required.  The two options allow the significand to be encoded as a compressed sequence of decimal digits (using [[densely packed decimal]]) or alternatively as a binary integer.  The former is more convenient for direct hardware implementation of the standard, while the latter is more suited to software emulation on a binary computer.  In either case the set of numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent) that may be encoded is identical, and [[Floating point#Special values|special values]] (\u00b1zero, \u00b1infinity, quiet NaNs, and signaling NaNs) have identical binary representations.\n\n== Rounding rules ==\nThe standard defines five rounding rules.  The first two rules round to a nearest value; the others are called ''[[directed rounding]]s'':\n\n=== Roundings to nearest ===\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half to even|Round to nearest, ties to even]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value with an even least significant digit; this is the default for binary floating point and the recommended default for decimal.\n* '''[[Rounding#Round half away from zero|Round to nearest, ties away from zero]]'''&nbsp;\u2013 rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway, it is rounded to the nearest value above (for positive numbers) or below (for negative numbers); this is intended as an option for decimal floating point.\n\n=== Directed roundings ===\n* '''Round toward 0'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards zero (also known as ''truncation'').\n* '''Round toward +\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards positive infinity (also known as ''rounding up'' or ''ceiling'').\n* '''Round toward \u2212\u221e'''&nbsp;\u2013 directed rounding towards negative infinity (also known as ''rounding down'' or ''floor'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of rounding to integers using the IEEE 754 rules\n!rowspan=2| Mode ||colspan=4| Example value\n|-\n! +11.5\n! +12.5\n! \u221211.5\n! \u221212.5\n|-\n| to nearest, ties to even\n| +12.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| to nearest, ties away from zero\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|-\n| toward 0\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward +\u221e\n| +12.0\n| +13.0\n| \u221211.0\n| \u221212.0\n|-\n| toward \u2212\u221e\n| +11.0\n| +12.0\n| \u221212.0\n| \u221213.0\n|}\n\nUnless specified otherwise, the floating-point result of an operation is determined by applying the rounding function on the infinitely precise (mathematical) result. The operation is said to be ''correctly rounded''.  This requirement is called ''correct rounding''.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a72.1}}</ref>\n\n== Required operations ==\n\nRequired operations for a supported arithmetic format (including the basic formats) include:\n\n* Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, [[Multiply\u2013accumulate operation|fused multiply\u2013add]], remainder)<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.1}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.1}}</ref>\n* Conversions (between formats, to and from strings, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.4.3}}</ref>\n* Scaling and (for decimal) quantizing<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.2}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.3.3}}</ref>\n* Copying and manipulating the sign (abs, negate, ''etc.'')<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.5.1}}</ref>\n* Comparisons and total ordering<ref name=total-ordering>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref>\n* Classification and testing for NaNs, ''etc.''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.2}}</ref>\n* Testing and setting flags<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.7.4}}</ref>\n* Miscellaneous operations.\n\n=== Comparison predicates ===\n\nThe standard provides comparison predicates to compare one floating-point datum to another in the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.11}}</ref> Any comparison with a NaN is treated as unordered. \u22120 and +0 compare as equal.\n\n=== Total-ordering predicate ===\n\nThe standard provides a predicate ''totalOrder'', which defines a [[total order]]ing on canonical members of the supported arithmetic format.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> The predicate agrees with the comparison predicates when one floating-point number is less than the other. The ''totalOrder'' predicate does not impose a total ordering on all encodings in a format. In particular, it does not distinguish among different encodings of the same floating-point representation, as when one or both encodings are non-canonical.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a75.10}}</ref> IEEE 754-2019 incorporates clarifications of ''totalOrder''.\n\n== Exception handling ==\nThe standard defines five exceptions, each of which returns a default value and has a corresponding status flag that (except in certain cases of underflow) is raised when the exception occurs.  No other exception handling is required, but additional non-default alternatives are recommended (see below).\n\nThe five possible exceptions are:\n* Invalid operation: mathematically undefined, ''e.g.'', the square root of a negative number. By default, returns qNaN.\n* Division by zero: an operation on finite operands gives an exact infinite result, ''e.g.'', 1/0 or log(0). By default, returns \u00b1infinity.\n* Overflow: a result is too large to be represented correctly (''i.e.'', its exponent with an unbounded exponent range would be larger than ''emax''). By default, returns \u00b1infinity for the round-to-nearest modes (and follows the rounding rules for the directed rounding modes).\n* Underflow: a result is very small (outside the normal range) and is inexact. By default, returns a [[Denormal number|subnormal]] or zero (following the rounding rules).\n* Inexact: the exact (''i.e.'', unrounded) result is not representable exactly. By default, returns the correctly rounded result.\n\nThese are the same five exceptions as were defined in IEEE 754-1985, but the ''division by zero'' exception has been extended to operations other than the division.\n\nFor decimal floating point, there are additional exceptions along with the above:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html#signals|title=9.4. decimal \u2014 Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic \u2014 Python 3.6.5 documentation|website=docs.python.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://speleotrove.com/decimal/daexcep.html|title=Decimal Arithmetic - Exceptional conditions|website=speleotrove.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Clamped: a result's exponent is too large for the destination format. By default, trailing zeros will be added to the coefficient to reduce the exponent to the largest usable value. If this is not possible (because this would cause the number of digits needed to be more than the destination format) then overflow occurs.\n* Rounded: a result's coefficient requires more digits than the destination format provides. The inexact is signaled if any non-zero digits are discarded.\n\nAdditionally, operations like quantize when either operand is infinite, or when the result does not fit the destination format, will also signal invalid operation exception.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=&sect;7.2(h)}}</ref>\n\n== Recommendations ==\n\n=== Alternate exception handling ===\nThe standard recommends optional exception handling in various forms, including presubstitution of user-defined default values, and traps (exceptions that change the flow of control in some way) and other exception handling models which interrupt the flow, such as try/catch.  The traps and other exception mechanisms remain optional, as they were in IEEE 754-1985.\n\n=== Recommended operations ===\nClause 9 in the standard recommends additional mathematical operations<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}</ref> that language standards should define.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=Clause 9}}.</ref>  These are all optional (not required in order to conform to the standard).\n\nRecommended arithmetic operations, which must round correctly:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.2}}.</ref>\n* [[e\u02e3|<math>e^x</math>]], <math>2^x</math>, <math>10^x</math>\n* [[e\u02e3\u22121|<math>e^x - 1</math>]], <math>2^x - 1</math>, <math>10^x - 1</math>\n* [[Natural logarithm|<math>\\ln x</math>]], [[Binary logarithm|<math>\\log_{2} x</math>]], [[Common logarithm|<math>\\log_{10} x</math>]]\n* [[ln(1+x)|<math>\\ln (1 + x)</math>]], <math>\\log_{2} (1 + x)</math>, <math>\\log_{10} (1 + x)</math>\n* [[Hypot|<math>\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</math>]]\n* [[Square root|<math>\\sqrt{x}</math>]]\n* <math>(1 + x)^n</math>\n* [[nth root|<math>x^{\\frac{1}{n}}</math>]]\n* [[Exponentiation#Integer exponents|<math>x^n</math>]], [[Exponentiation|<math>x^y</math>]]\n* [[sin (trigonometry)|<math>\\sin x</math>]], [[cos (trigonometry)|<math>\\cos x</math>]], [[tan (trigonometry)|<math>\\tan x</math>]]\n* [[arcsin (trigonometry)|<math>\\arcsin x</math>]], [[arccos (trigonometry)|<math>\\arccos x</math>]], [[arctan (trigonometry)|<math>\\arctan x</math>]], [[atan2|<math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)</math>]]\n* <math>\\operatorname{sinPi} x = \\sin \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{cosPi} x = \\cos \\pi x</math>, <math>\\operatorname{tanPi} x = \\tan \\pi x</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* <math>\\operatorname{asinPi} x = \\frac{\\arcsin x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{acosPi} x = \\frac{\\arccos x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atanPi} x = \\frac{\\arctan x}{\\pi}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{atan2Pi} (y, x) = \\frac{\\operatorname{atan2}(y, x)}{\\pi}</math> (see also: [[Multiples of \u03c0]])\n* [[sinh (mathematical function)|<math>\\sinh x</math>]], [[cosh (mathematical function)|<math>\\cosh x</math>]], [[tanh (mathematical function)|<math>\\tanh x</math>]]\n* [[arsinh|<math>\\operatorname{arsinh} x</math>]], [[arcosh|<math>\\operatorname{arcosh} x</math>]], [[artanh|<math>\\operatorname{artanh} x</math>]]\n\nThe {{math|asinPi}}, {{math|acosPi}} and {{math|tanPi}} functions were not part of the IEEE 754-2008 standard because the feeling was that they were less necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706053605/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/email/msg03842.html |archive-date=2017-07-06 |title=Re: Missing functions tanPi, asinPi and acosPi |website=grouper.ieee.org |access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref> The first two were at least mentioned in a paragraph, but this was regarded as an error<ref name=IEEE754-errata/> until they were added in the 2019 revision.\n\nThe operations also include setting and accessing dynamic mode rounding direction,<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.3}}.</ref> and implementation-defined vector reduction operations such as sum, scaled product, and [[dot product]], whose accuracy is unspecified by the standard.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a79.4}}.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Augmented arithmetic operation}}\nAs of 2019, ''augmented arithmetic operations''<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2019|loc=\u00a79.5}}.</ref> for the binary formats are also recommended.

By contrast, the previous [[IEEE 754-1985|1985]] version of the standard left aspects of the language interface unspecified, which led to inconsistent behavior between compilers, or different optimization levels in a single compiler.\n\nProgramming languages should allow a user to specify a minimum precision for intermediate calculations of expressions for each radix. This is referred to as \"preferredWidth\" in the standard, and it should be possible to set this on a per block basis. Intermediate calculations within expressions should be calculated, and any temporaries saved, using the maximum of the width of the operands and the preferred width, if set. Thus, for instance, a compiler targeting [[x87]] floating-point hardware should have a means of specifying that intermediate calculations must use the [[Extended precision#IEEE 754 extended precision formats|double-extended format]]. The stored value of a variable must always be used when evaluating subsequent expressions, rather than any precursor from before rounding and assigning to the variable.\n\n=== Reproducibility ===\nThe IEEE 754-1985 allowed many variations in implementations (such as the encoding of some values and the detection of certain exceptions). IEEE 754-2008 has strengthened up many of these, but a few variations still remain (especially for binary formats).  The reproducibility clause recommends that language standards should provide a means to write reproducible programs (i.e., programs that will produce the same result in all implementations of a language) and describes what needs to be done to achieve reproducible results.\n\n== Character representation ==\nThe standard requires operations to convert between basic formats and ''external character sequence'' formats.<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12}}.</ref> Conversions to and from a decimal character format are required for all formats. Conversion to an external character sequence must be such that conversion back using rounding to even will recover the original number. There is no requirement to preserve the payload of a quiet NaN or signaling NaN, and conversion from the external character sequence may turn a signaling NaN into a quiet NaN.\n\nThe original binary value will be preserved by converting to decimal and back again using:<ref>{{Harvnb|IEEE 754|2008|loc=\u00a75.12.2}}.</ref>\n* 5 decimal digits for binary16,\n* 9 decimal digits for binary32,\n* 17 decimal digits for binary64,\n* 36 decimal digits for binary128.\n\nFor other binary formats, the required number of decimal digits is\n\n: <math>1 + \\lceil p\\log_{10}(2)\\rceil,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the number of significant bits in the binary format, e.g. 237 bits for binary256.\n\n(Note: as an implementation limit, correct rounding is only guaranteed for the number of decimal digits above plus 3 for the largest supported binary format. For instance, if binary32 is the largest supported binary format, then a conversion from a decimal external sequence with 12 decimal digits is guaranteed to be correctly rounded when converted to binary32; but conversion of a sequence of 13 decimal digits is not; however, the standard recommends that implementations impose no such limit.)\n\nWhen using a decimal floating-point format, the decimal representation will be preserved using:\n* 7 decimal digits for decimal32,\n* 16 decimal digits for decimal64,\n* 34 decimal digits for decimal128.\n\nAlgorithms, with code, for correctly rounded conversion from binary to decimal and decimal to binary are discussed by Gay,<ref>{{Cite journal |first=David M. |last=Gay |title=Correctly rounded binary-decimal and decimal-binary conversions |series=Numerical Analysis Manuscript |id=90-10 |publisher=AT&T Laboratories |location=Murry Hill, NJ, USA |date=November 30, 1990 |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.31.4049 |doi= |ref=harv }}</ref> and for testing{{snd}} by Paxson and Kahan.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=A Program for Testing IEEE Decimal\u2013Binary Conversion |publisher= |series=Manuscript |first1=Vern |last1=Paxson |first2=William |last2=Kahan |author2-link=William Kahan |date=May 22, 1991 |doi= |ref=harv |citeseerx = 10.1.1.144.5889}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Binade]]\n* [[Coprocessor]]\n* [[C99#IEEE.C2.A0754 floating point support|C99]] for code examples demonstrating  access and use of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Floating-point arithmetic#IEEE 754: floating point in modern computers|Floating-point arithmetic]], for history, design rationale and example usage of IEEE 754 features.\n* [[Fixed-point arithmetic]], for an alternative approach at computation with rational numbers (especially beneficial when the mantissa range is known, fixed, or bound at compile time).\n* [[IBM System z9]], the first CPU to implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic (using hardware microcode).\n* [[IBM z10 (microprocessor)|IBM z10]], [[IBM z196]], [[IBM zEC12 (microprocessor)|IBM zEC12]], and [[IBM z13 (microprocessor)|IBM z13]], CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008  decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[ISO/IEC 10967]], language-independent arithmetic (LIA).\n* [[Minifloat]], low-precision binary floating-point formats following IEEE 754 principles.\n* [[POWER6]], [[POWER7]], and [[POWER8]] CPUs that implement IEEE 754-2008 decimal arithmetic fully in hardware.\n* [[strictfp]], a keyword in the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]] that restricts arithmetic to IEEE 754 single and double precision to ensure reproducibility across common hardware platforms.\n* [[Rounding#Table-maker's dilemma|The table-maker's dilemma]] for more about the correct rounding of functions.\n* [[Standard Apple Numerics Environment]]\n* [[Tapered floating point]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=\"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Standards ===\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2008 |pages=1\u201370 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=August 29, 2008 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2008 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935 |ref=CITEREFIEEE_7542008 |isbn=978-0-7381-5753-5 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |journal=IEEE STD 754-2019 |pages=1\u201384 |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=July 22, 2019 |publisher=IEEE |id=IEEE Std 754-2019 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2019.8766229  |isbn=978-1-5044-5924-2 }}\n* {{Cite book |title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 \u2014 Information technology \u2014 Microprocessor Systems \u2014 Floating-Point arithmetic |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/57469.html |publisher=Iso.org |pages=1\u201358 |date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Secondary references ===\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal Decimal floating-point] arithmetic, FAQs, bibliography, and links\n* [http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm Comparing binary floats]\n* [http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/IEEE-754.old/References.xhtml IEEE 754 Reference Material]\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal/854mins.html IEEE 854-1987]&nbsp;\u2013 History and minutes\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171230124220/http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/reading.html Supplementary readings for IEEE 754].

{"title_page": "Preposition and postposition", "text_new": "{{rewrite|date=April 2019}}\n{{English grammar}}\n\n'''Prepositions''' and '''postpositions''', together called '''adpositions''' (or broadly, in English, simply '''prepositions'''),<ref name=\"HP602\"/> are a [[part of speech|class of words]] used to express spatial or temporal relations (''in'', ''under'', ''towards'', ''before'') or mark various [[thematic relations|semantic roles]] (''of'', ''for'').<ref>Huddleston & Pullum (2002), chapter 7.</ref>\n\nA preposition or postposition typically combines with a [[noun]] or [[pronoun]], or more generally a [[noun phrase]], this being called its [[complement (grammar)|complement]], or sometimes [[object (grammar)|object]]. A preposition comes before its complement; a postposition comes after its complement. English generally has prepositions rather than postpositions \u2013 words such as ''in'', ''under'' and ''of'' precede their objects, such as ''in England'', ''under the table'', ''of Jane'' \u2013 although there are a few exceptions including \"ago\" and \"notwithstanding\", as in \"three days ago\" and \"financial limitations notwithstanding\". Some languages that use a different word order, have postpositions instead, or have both types. The [[phrase]] formed by a preposition or postposition together with its complement is called a [[prepositional phrase]] (or postpositional phrase, adpositional phrase, etc.) \u2013 such phrases ally play an [[adverbial]] role in a sentence.\n\nA less common type of adposition is the '''circumposition''', which consists of two parts that appear on each side of the complement. [[#Classification by position|Other terms]] sometimes used for particular types of adposition include ''ambiposition'', ''inposition'' and ''interposition''. Some linguists use the word ''preposition'' in place of ''adposition'' regardless of the applicable word order.<ref name=\"HP602\">An example is Huddleston & Pullum (2002) (\"''CGEL''\"), whose choice of terms is discussed on p. 602.</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nThe word ''preposition'' comes from {{lang-la|prae}} (\"before\") and {{lang-la|ponere}} (\"to put\"). This refers  to the situation in Latin and [[Ancient Greek grammar|Greek]] (and in [[English grammar|English]]), where such words are placed before their complement (except sometimes in Ancient Greek), and are hence \"pre-positioned\".\n\nIn some languages, including [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the same kind of words typically come after their complement. To indicate this, they are called ''postpositions'' (using the prefix ''post-'', from Latin ''post'' meaning \"behind, after\"). There are also some cases where the function is performed by two parts coming before and after the complement; this is called a ''circumposition'' (from Latin ''circum'' \"around\").\n\nIn some languages, for example [[Finnish language|Finnish]], some adpositions can be used as both prepositions and postpositions. \n\nPrepositions, postpositions and circumpositions are collectively known as ''adpositions'' (using the Latin prefix ''ad-'', meaning \"to\"). However, some linguists prefer to use the well-known and longer established term ''preposition'' in place of ''adposition'', irrespective of position relative to the complement.<ref name=\"HP602\" />\n\n==Grammatical properties==\nAn adposition typically combines with exactly one [[complement (linguistics)|complement]], most often a [[noun phrase]] (or, in a different analysis, a [[determiner phrase]]). In English, this is generally a noun (or something functioning as a noun, e.g., a [[gerund]]), together with its [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] and [[modifier (grammar)|modifiers]] such as [[article (grammar)|article]]s, [[adjective]]s, etc. The complement is sometimes called the [[object (grammar)|object]] of the adposition. The resulting [[phrase]], formed by the adposition together with its complement, is called an [[adpositional phrase]] or prepositional phrase (PP) (or for specificity, a postpositional or circumpositional phrase).\n\nAn adposition establishes a [[grammar|grammatical]] relationship that links its complement to another word or phrase in the context. It also generally establishes a [[semantic]] relationship, which may be spatial (''in'', ''on'', ''under'', ...), temporal (''after'', ''during'', ...), or of some other type (''of'', ''for'', ''via'', ...). The [[World Atlas of Language Structures]] treats a word as an adposition if it takes a noun phrase as a complement and indicates the grammatical or semantic relationship of that phrase to the verb in the containing clause.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 85: Order of Adposition and Noun Phrase|url=http://wals.info/chapter/85|work=World Atlas of Language Structures|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nSome examples of the use of English prepositions are given below. In each case, the prepositional phrase appears in ''italics'', the preposition within it appears in '''''bold''''', and the preposition's [[complement (grammar)|complement]] is <u>underlined</u>. As demonstrated in some of the examples, more than one prepositional phrase may act as an [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] to the same word.\n* As an adjunct to a noun:\n** the weather '''''in''' <u>March</u>''\n** cheese '''''from''' <u>France</u>'' '''''with''' <u>live bacteria</u>''\n* As a [[predicative expression]] (complement of a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]])\n** The key is '''''under''' <u>the stone</u>''.\n** The cricketer was given out leg '''''before''' <u>wicket</u>''.\n* As an adjunct to a verb:\n** sleep '''''throughout''' <u>the winter</u>''\n** danced '''''atop''' <u>the tables</u> '''for''' <u>hours</u>''\n** dispense '''''with''' <u>the formalities</u>'' (see [[#Semantic functions|Semantic functions]], below)\n* As an adjunct to an adjective:\n** happy '''''for''' <u>them</u>''\n** sick '''''until''' <u>recently</u>''\n\nIn the last of these examples the complement has the form of an adverb, which has been [[nominalization|nominalised]] to serve as a noun phrase; see [[#Different forms of complement|Different forms of complement]], below. Prepositional phrases themselves are sometimes nominalized:\n* '''''In''' <u>the cellar</u>'' was chosen as the best place to store the wine.\n\nAn adposition may determine the [[grammatical case]] of its complement. In English, the complements of prepositions take the [[objective case]] where available (''from him'', not *''from he''). In [[Koine Greek]], for example, certain prepositions always take their objects in a certain case (e.g., \u1f10\u03bd always takes its object in the dative), while other prepositions may take their object in one of two or more cases, depending on the meaning of the preposition (e.g., \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac takes its object in the genitive or in the accusative, depending on the meaning). Some languages have cases that are used exclusively after prepositions ([[prepositional case]]), or special forms of [[pronoun]]s for use after prepositions ([[prepositional pronoun]]).\n\nThe functions of adpositions overlap with those of case markings (for example, the meaning of the English preposition ''of'' is expressed in many languages by a [[genitive case]] ending), but adpositions are classed as [[syntactic]] elements, while case markings are [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]].\n\nAdpositions themselves are usually [[Uninflected word|non-inflecting]] (\"invariant\"): they do not have paradigms of form (such as tense, case, gender, etc.)  the same way that verbs, adjectives, and nouns can. There are exceptions, though, such as prepositions that have fused with a pronominal object to form [[inflected preposition]]s.\n\nThe following properties are characteristic of most adpositional systems:\n* Adpositions are among the most frequently occurring words in languages that have them. For example, one frequency ranking for English word forms<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordcount.org/main.php|title=Wordcount \u00b7 Tracking the Way We Use Language|publisher=}}</ref> begins as follows (prepositions in bold):\n::''the, '''of''', and, '''to''', a, '''in''', that, it, is, was, I, '''for''', '''on''', you'', \u2026\n* The most common adpositions are single, [[morpheme|monomorphemic]] words. According to the ranking cited above, for example, the most common English prepositions are ''on'', ''in'', ''to'', ''by'', ''for'', ''with'', ''at'', ''of'', ''from'', ''as'', all of which are single-syllable words and cannot be broken down into smaller units of meaning.\n* Adpositions form a [[closed class]] of lexical items and cannot be productively derived from words of other categories.\n\n==Classification by position==\nAs noted above, adpositions are referred to by various terms, depending on their position relative to the complement.\n\nWhile the term ''preposition'' is sometimes used to denote any adposition, in its stricter meaning it refers only to one which precedes its complement. Examples of this, from English, have been given above; similar examples can be found in many European and other languages, for example:\n*[[German grammar|German]]: '''''mit''' einer Frau'' (\"'''with''' a woman\")\n*[[French grammar|French]]: '''''sur''' la table'' (\"'''on''' the table\")\n*[[Polish grammar|Polish]]: '''''na''' stole'' (\"'''on''' the table\")\n*[[Russian grammar|Russian]]: '''''\u0443''' \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f'' (\"'''in the possession of''' me\" [I have])\n*[[Khmer grammar|Khmer]]: '''\u179b\u17be'''\u1780\u17d2\u178f\u17b6\u179a\u1781\u17c0\u1793 ['''l\u0259\u02d0''' kda\u02d0k\u02b0i\u0259n] (\"'''on''' (the) blackboard\")\n*[[Tigrinya grammar|Tigrinya]]: '''\u12a0\u1265 \u120d\u12d5\u120a''' \u1323\u12cd\u120b ['''ab\u02d0''' '''l:ali''' tawla] (\"'''at/on''' '''top''' table\"); '''\u12a0\u1265 \u1275\u1215\u1272''' \u1323\u12cd\u120b ['''ab\u02d0''' '''t:hti''' tawla] (\"'''at/on''' '''under''' table\")\n\nIn certain grammatical constructions, the complement of a preposition may be absent or may be moved from its position directly following the preposition. This may be referred to as [[preposition stranding]] (see also [[#Stranding|below]]), as in \"Whom did you go '''with'''?\" and  \"There's only one thing worse than being talked '''about'''.\" There are also some (mainly colloquial) expressions in which a preposition's complement may be omitted, such as \"I'm going to the park. Do you want to come '''with''' [me]?\", and the French ''Il fait trop froid, je ne suis pas habill\u00e9e '''pour''''' (\"It's too cold, I'm not dressed '''for''' [the situation].\")\nThe bolded words in these examples are generally still considered prepositions, because when they form a phrase with a complement (in more ordinary constructions) they must appear first.\n\nA ''postposition'' follows its complement to form a postpositional phrase. Examples include:\n*[[Latin language|Latin]]: ''me'''cum''''' (\"'''with''' me\", literally \"me '''with'''\")\n*[[Turkish grammar|Turkish]]: ''benim'''le''''' or ''benim '''ile''''' (\"'''with''' me\", literally \"my '''with'''\") \n*[[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u684c\u5b50'''\u4e0a''' ''zhu\u014dzi '''sh\u00e0ng''''' (lit. \"table '''on'''\"); this is a nominal form which usually requires an additional preposition to form an adverbial phrase (see [[Chinese grammar#Locative phrases|Chinese locative phrases]])\n*English:  ''ten kilometers '''away''''', ''ten months '''ago''''' (both could be considered adverbs)\n\nSome adpositions can appear either before or after their complement:\n* English: ''the evidence '''notwithstanding''''' OR '''''notwithstanding''' the evidence''\n* German: ''meiner Meinung '''nach''''' OR '''''nach''' meiner Meinung'' (\"'''in''' my opinion\")\n* German: ''die Stra\u00dfe '''entlang''''' OR '''''entlang''' der Stra\u00dfe'' (\"'''along''' the road\"; here a different [[grammatical case|case]] is used when ''entlang'' precedes the noun)\n \nAn adposition like the above, which can be either a preposition or a postposition, can be called an '''ambiposition'''.<ref>See Reindl (2001), Libert (2006).</ref> However, ''ambiposition'' may also be used to refer to a circumposition (see below),<ref>Gernot Windfuhr, ''Iranian Languages'', Routledge 2013 p. 736.</ref> or to a word that appears to function as a preposition and postposition simultaneously, as in the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] construction (noun-1) ''\u0101'' (noun-2), meaning \"from (noun-1) to (noun-2)\".<ref>V\u00edt Buben\u00edk, ''From Case to Adposition: The Development of Configurational Syntax in Indo-European Languages'', John Benjamins Publishing 2006, p. 109.</ref>\n\nWhether a language has primarily prepositions or postpositions is seen as an aspect of its [[Linguistic typology|typological]] classification, and tends to correlate with other properties related to [[head directionality]]. Since an adposition is regarded as the [[head (linguistics)|head]] of its phrase, prepositional phrases are head-initial (or right-[[branching (linguistics)|branching]]), while postpositional phrases are head-final (or left-branching). There is a tendency for languages that feature postpositions also to have other head-final features, such as [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|verbs that follow their objects]]; and for languages that feature prepositions to have other head-initial features, such as [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|verbs that precede their objects]]. This is only a tendency, however; an example of a language that behaves differently is [[Latin grammar|Latin]], which employs mostly prepositions, even though it typically places verbs after their objects.\n\nA ''circumposition'' consists of two or more parts, positioned on both sides of the complement. Circumpositions are very common in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]. The following are examples from [[Northern Kurdish]] (Kurmanji):\n* ''bi ... re'' (\"with\")\n* ''di ... de'' (\"in\", for things, not places)\n* ''di ... re'' (\"via, through\")\n* ''ji ... re'' (\"for\")\n* ''ji ... ve'' (\"since\")\n\nVarious constructions in other languages might also be analyzed as circumpositional, for example:\n* English: '''''from''' now '''on'''''\n* [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: '''''naar''' het einde '''toe''''' (\"towards the end\", lit. \"to the end to\")\n* [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]]: '''\u5f9e'''\u51b0\u7bb1'''\u88e1''' '''''c\u00f3ng''' b\u012bngxi\u0101ng '''l\u01d0''''' (\"from the inside of the refrigerator\", lit. \"from refrigerator inside\")\n* [[French language|French]]: '''''\u00e0''' un d\u00e9tail '''pr\u00e8s''''' (\"except for one detail\", lit. \"at one detail near\")\n* [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: '''''f\u00f6r''' tre timmar '''sedan''''' (\"three hours ago\", lit. \"for three hours since\")\n* [[German language|German]]: '''''aus''' dem Zimmer '''heraus''''' (\"out from the room\", lit. \"from the room out\")\n* [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]: '''''\u12ab\u1265 ''' \u1215\u1302 ''''''\u1295'''\u12f0\u1213\u122d (\"from now on\", lit. \"from now to later\")\nMost such phrases, however, can be analyzed as having a different hierarchical structure (such as a prepositional phrase modifying a following adverb). The Chinese example could be analyzed as a prepositional phrase headed by ''c\u00f3ng'' (\"from\"), taking the [[Chinese grammar#Locative phrases|locative noun phrase]] ''b\u012bngx\u012bang l\u01d0'' (\"refrigerator inside\") as its complement.\n\nAn '''inposition''' is a rare type of adposition that appears between parts of a complex complement. For example, in the native Californian [[Timbisha language]], the phrase \"from a mean cold\" can be translated using the word order \"cold from mean\"\u2014the inposition follows the noun but precedes any following [[modifier (grammar)|modifier]]s that form part of the same [[noun phrase]].<ref>Matthew S. Dryer, [http://wals.info/chapter/85 \"Order of Adposition and Noun Phrase\"], in ''The World Atlas of Language Structures Online''. Retrieved 2015-01-01.</ref> The Latin word ''cum'' is also commonly used as an inposition, as in the phrase ''[[summa cum laude]]'', meaning \"with highest praise\", lit. \"highest with praise\".\n\nThe term '''interposition''' has been used<ref>See Melis (2003), p. 22. The term is used here in French, and in reference to the French language.</ref> for adpositions in structures such as ''word '''for''' word'', (French) ''coup '''sur''' coup'' (\"one after another, repeatedly\"), (Russian) \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433 '''\u0441''' \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c (\"one with the other\"). This is not a case of an adposition appearing inside its complement, as the two nouns do not form a single phrase (there is no phrase *''word word'', for example); such uses have more of a [[coordination (linguistics)|coordinating]] character.\n\n==Stranding==\n{{Main|Preposition stranding}}\n\nPreposition stranding is a [[syntax|syntactic]] construct in which a preposition occurs somewhere other than immediately before its complement. For example, in the English sentence \"What did you sit on?\" the preposition ''on'' has ''what'' as its complement, but ''what'' is [[Wh-fronting|moved to the start]] of the sentence, because it is an [[interrogative word]]. This sentence is much more common and natural than the equivalent sentence without stranding: \"On what did you sit?\" Preposition stranding is commonly found in [[English language|English]],<ref name=\"CB1\">{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=The Power of Prepositions |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=216 |work=On Writing |publisher=Criminal Brief |location=Cairo |date=2007-09-23 }}</ref> as well as [[North Germanic languages]] such as [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Its existence in [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is debated. Preposition stranding is also found in some [[Niger\u2013Congo languages]] such as Vata and Gbadi, and in some North American varieties of [[French language|French]].\n\nSome prescriptive English grammars teach that prepositions cannot end a sentence, although there is [[List of common English usage misconceptions|no rule]] prohibiting that use.<ref name=\"Mignon Fogarty\">{{cite web |url=http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/top-ten-grammar-myths.aspx|title= Top Ten Grammar Myths|first= Mignon |last=Fogarty|date= 4 March 2010|work= Grammar Girl: Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing|accessdate= 27 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Random House\">{{cite book |title= Origins of the Specious: Myths and Misconceptions of the English Language|last1= O'Conner|first1= Patricia T.|last2= Kellerman|first2= Stewart|year= 2009|publisher= Random House|location= New York|isbn= 978-1-4000-6660-5|page=17}}</ref> Similar rules arose during the rise of classicism, when they were applied to English in imitation of classical languages such as Latin. [[Otto Jespersen]], in his ''Essentials of English Grammar'' (first published 1933), commented on this definition-derived rule: \"...nor need a preposition (Latin: ''praepositio'') stand before the word it governs (go the fools ''among'' (Sh[akespeare]); What are you laughing ''at''?). You might just as well believe that all blackguards are black or that turkeys come from Turkey; many names have either been chosen unfortunately at first or have changed their meanings in course of time.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Jespersen|first=Otto|authorlink=Otto Jespersen|title=Essentials of English Grammar|year=1962|location=London|publisher=George Allen & Unwin|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cyAhxH035RUC&pg=PT96}}</ref>\n\n==Simple ''versus'' complex==\n\n'''Simple''' adpositions consist of a single word (''on'', ''in'', ''for'', ''towards'', etc.). '''Complex''' adpositions consist of a group of words that act as one unit. Examples of complex prepositions in English include ''in spite of'', ''with respect to'', ''except for'', ''by dint of'', and ''next to''.\n\nThe distinction between simple and complex adpositions is not clear-cut. Many simple adpositions are derived from complex forms (e.g., ''with + in'' \u2192 ''within'', ''by + side'' \u2192 ''beside'') through [[grammaticalisation]]. This change takes time, and during the transitional stages the adposition acts in some ways like a single word, and in other ways like a multi-word unit. For example, current [[German orthography|German orthographic conventions]] recognize the indeterminate status of certain prepositions, allowing two spellings: ''anstelle''/''an Stelle'' (\"instead of\"), ''aufgrund''/''auf Grund'' (\"because of\"), ''mithilfe''/''mit Hilfe'' (\"by means of\"), ''zugunsten''/''zu Gunsten'' (\"in favor of\"), ''zuungunsten''/''zu Ungunsten'' (\"to the disadvantage of\"), ''zulasten/zu Lasten'' (\"at the expense of\").<ref>[[Duden]]: ''Neue Rechtschreibung Crashkurs ([http://www.duden.de/deutsche_sprache/neue_rechtschreibung/crashkurs/getrenntzusammen/regel_11.php Regel 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312003114/http://www.duden.de/deutsche_sprache/neue_rechtschreibung/crashkurs/getrenntzusammen/regel_11.php |date=2008-03-12 }})''.</ref>\n\nThe distinction between complex adpositions and free combinations of words is not a black and white issue: complex adpositions (in English, \"prepositional idioms\") can be more fossilized or less fossilized. In English, this applies to a number of structures of the form \"preposition + (article) + noun + preposition\", such as ''in front of'', ''for the sake of''.<ref>''CGEL'', p. 618ff; Pullum (2005); Huddleston and Pullum (2005), pp. 146-47.</ref> The following characteristics are good indications that a given combination is \"frozen\" enough to be considered a complex preposition in English:<ref>Quirk and Mulholland (1964).<!--Check this ref, it may not support the whole of this--></ref>\n* It contains a word that cannot be used in any other context: ''by dint of'', ''in lieu of''.\n* The first preposition cannot be replaced: ''with a view to'' but not *''for/without a view to''.\n* It is impossible to insert an article, or to use a different article: ''on account of'' but not *''on an/the account of''; ''for the sake of'' but not *''for a sake of''.\n* The range of possible adjectives is very limited: ''in great favor of'', but not *''in helpful favor of''.\n* The [[grammatical number]] of the noun cannot be changed: ''by virtue of'' but not *''by virtues of''.\n* It is impossible to use a [[possessive determiner]]: ''in spite of him'', not *''in his spite''.\n\n==Marginal prepositions==\n\nMarginal prepositions are prepositions that have affinities with other word classes, most notably verbs.<ref>Quirk, Randolph, Sidney Greenbaum, Jan Svartvik, & Geoffrey Leech. 1985. ''A comprehensive grammar of the English language''. London: Longman. 667-68.\n</ref> Marginal prepositions behave like prepositions but derive from other parts of speech. Some marginal prepositions in English include ''barring'', ''concerning'', ''considering'', ''excluding'', ''failing'', ''following'', ''including'', ''notwithstanding'', ''regarding'', and ''respecting''.\n\n==Proper ''versus'' improper==\n\nIn descriptions of some languages, prepositions are divided into '''proper''' (or ''essential'') and '''improper''' (or ''accidental''). A preposition is called improper if it is some other part of speech being used in the same way as a preposition. Examples of simple and complex prepositions that have been so classified include ''prima di'' (\"before\") and ''davanti (a)'' (\"in front of\") in [[Italian grammar|Italian]],<ref>Maria Franca Zuccarello, Edvaldo Sampaio Beliz\u00e1rio, [http://www.filologia.org.br/xiicnlf/16/07.pdf As preposi\u00e7\u00f5es acidentais (preposizioni improprie) italianas e seus termos correpondentes em portugu\u00eas], CNLF, Vol. XII No. 16, p. 72.</ref> and ''ergo'' (\"on account of\") and ''causa'' (\"for the sake of\") in [[Latin grammar|Latin]].<ref>Harm Pinkster, ''On Latin Adverbs'', Amsterdam University Press 2005, p. 148.</ref>  In reference to [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]], however, an improper preposition is one that cannot also serve as a [[prefix]] to a [[verb]].<ref>Stanley E. Porter, ''Idioms of the Greek New Testament'', A&C Black 1992, p. 140.</ref>\n\n==Different forms of complement==\nAs noted above, adpositions typically have [[noun phrase]]s as complements. This can include [[nominal clause]]s and certain types of [[non-finite verb]] phrase:\n*We can't agree '''''on''' whether to have children or not'' (complement is a nominal clause)\n*Let's think '''''about''' solving this problem'' (complement is a [[gerund]] phrase)\n*'''''pour''' encourager les autres'' (French: \"to encourage the others\", complement is an [[infinitive]] phrase)\n\nThe word ''to'' when it precedes the [[Uses of English verb forms#Infinitive|infinitive in English]] is not a preposition, but rather is a grammatical [[particle (grammar)|particle]] outside of any main [[word class]].\n\nIn other cases the complement may have the form of an adjective or [[adjective phrase]], or an adverbial. This may be regarded as a complement representing a different [[syntactic category]], or simply as an atypical form of noun phrase (see [[nominalization]]).\n*The scene went '''''from''' blindingly bright '''to''' pitch black'' (complements are adjective phrases)\n*I worked there '''''until''' recently'' (complement is an adverb)\n*Come out '''''from''' under the bed'' (complement is an adverbial)\nIn the last example, the complement of the preposition ''from'' is in fact another prepositional phrase. The resulting sequence of two prepositions (''from under'') may be regarded as a [[#Simple and complex adpositions|complex]] preposition; in some languages such a sequence may be represented by a single word, as Russian \u0438\u0437-\u043f\u043e\u0434 ''iz-pod'' (\"from under\").\n\nSome adpositions appear to combine with two complements:\n* '''''With''' Sammy president'', we can all come out of hiding again.\n* '''''For''' Sammy to become president'', they'd have to seriously modify the Constitution.\nIt is more commonly assumed, however, that ''Sammy'' and the following predicate forms a \"[[small clause]]\", which then becomes the single complement of the preposition.  (In the first example, a word such as ''as'' may be considered to have been [[elliptical construction|elided]], which, if present, would clarify the grammatical relationship.)\n\n==Semantic functions==\n\nAdpositions can be used to express a wide range of [[semantics|semantic]] relations between their complement and the rest of the context. The relations expressed may be spatial (denoting location or direction), temporal (denoting position in time), or relations expressing comparison, content, agent, instrument, means, manner, cause, purpose, reference, etc.\n\nMost common adpositions are highly [[Polysemy|polysemous]] (they have various different meanings). In many cases a primary, spatial meaning becomes extended to non-spatial uses by [[metaphor]]ical or other processes. Because of the variety of meanings, a single adposition often has many possible equivalents in another language, depending on the exact context in which it is used; this can cause significant difficulties in foreign [[language learning]]. Usage can also vary between dialects of the same language (for example, [[American English]] has ''on the weekend'', where [[British English]] uses ''at the weekend'').\n\nIn some contexts (as in the case of some [[phrasal verb]]s) the choice of adposition may be determined by another element in the construction or be fixed by the construction as a whole. Here the adposition may have little independent semantic content of its own, and there may be no clear reason why the particular adposition is used rather than another. Examples of such expressions are:\n* English: ''dispense '''with''''', ''listen '''to''''', ''insist '''on''''', ''proud '''of''''', ''good '''at'''''\n* [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''otvechat' '''na''' vopros'' (\"answer the question\", literally \"answer on the question\"), ''obvinenie '''v''' obmane'' (\"accusation of [literally: in] fraud\")\n* [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''so\u00f1ar '''con''' ganar el t\u00edtulo'' (\"dream about [lit. with] winning the title\"), ''consistir '''en''' dos grupos'' (\"consist of [lit. in] two groups\")\n\nPrepositions sometimes mark roles that may be considered largely grammatical:\n* [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]] (in a broad sense) \u2013 ''the pen '''of''' my aunt'' (sometimes marked by [[genitive]] or [[possessive]] forms)\n* the agent in [[passive voice|passive]] constructions \u2013 ''killed '''by''' a lone gunman''\n* the recipient of a transfer \u2013 ''give it '''to''' him'' (sometimes marked by a [[dative]] or an [[indirect object]])\n\nSpatial meanings of adpositions may be either ''directional'' or ''static''. A directional meaning usually involves motion in a particular direction (\"Kay went '''to''' the store\"), the direction in which something leads or points (\"A path '''into''' the woods\"), or the extent of something (\"The fog stretched '''from''' London '''to''' Paris\"). A static meaning indicates only a location (\"'''at''' the store\", \"'''behind''' the chair\", \"'''on''' the moon\"). Some prepositions can have both uses: \"he sat '''in''' the water\" (static); \"he jumped in the water\" (probably directional). In some languages, the [[grammatical case|case]] of the complement varies depending on the meaning, as with several prepositions in [[German grammar|German]], such as ''in'':\n* ''in seinem Zimmer'' (\"in his room\", static meaning, takes the [[dative]])\n* ''in sein Zimmer'' (\"into his room\", directional meaning, takes the [[accusative]])\n\nIn English and many other languages, prepositional phrases with static meaning are commonly used as [[predicative expression]]s after a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] (\"Bob is at the store\"); this may happen with some directional prepositions as well (\"Bob is from Australia\"), but this is less common. Directional prepositional phrases combine mostly with verbs that indicate movement (\"Jay is going into her bedroom\", but not *\"Jay is lying down into her bedroom\").\n\nDirectional meanings can be further divided into ''[[telicity|telic]]'' and ''atelic''. Telic prepositional phrases imply movement all the way to the endpoint (\"she ran to the fence\"), while atelic ones do not (\"she ran towards the fence\").<ref>Zwarts, Joost. 2005. \"Prepositional Aspect and the Algebra of Paths.\" ''Linguistics and Philosophy'' 28.6, 739\u2013779.</ref>\n\nStatic meanings can be divided into ''projective'' and ''non-projective'', where projective meanings are those whose understanding requires knowledge of the perspective or point of view. For example, the meaning of \"behind the rock\" is likely to depend on the position of the speaker (projective), whereas the meaning of \"on the desk\" is not (non-projective). Sometimes the interpretation is ambiguous, as in \"behind the house\", which may mean either at the natural back of the house, or on the opposite side of the house from the speaker.<ref>Creswell, Max. 1978. \"Prepositions and points of view.\" ''Linguistics and Philosophy'', 2: 1\u201341.</ref>\n\n==Overlaps with other categories==\n\n===Adverbs and particles===\nThere are often similarities in form between adpositions and [[adverb]]s. Some adverbs are derived from the fusion of a preposition and its complement (such as ''downstairs'', from ''down (the) stairs'', and ''underground'', from ''under (the) ground''). Some words can function both as adverbs and as prepositions, such as ''inside'', ''aboard'', ''underneath'' (for instance, one can say \"go inside\", with adverbial use, or \"go inside the house\", with prepositional use). Such cases are analogous to verbs that can be used either [[transitive verb|transitively]] or intransitively, and the adverbial forms might therefore be analyzed as \"intransitive prepositions\". This analysis<ref>See for example ''CGEL'', pp. 612\u201316.</ref> could also be extended to other adverbs, such as ''here'' (this place), ''there'' (that place), ''afterwards'', etc., even though these never take complements.\n\nMany English [[phrasal verb]]s contain [[Grammatical particle|particles]] that are used adverbially, even though they mostly have the form of a preposition (such words may be called [[prepositional adverb]]s). Examples are ''on'' in ''carry on'', ''get on'', etc., ''over'' in ''take over'', ''fall over'', and so on. The equivalents in [[Dutch grammar|Dutch]] and [[German grammar|German]] are [[separable prefix]]es, which also often have the same form as prepositions: for example, Dutch ''aanbieden'' and German ''anbieten'' (both meaning \"to offer\") contain the separable prefix ''aan/an'', which is also a preposition meaning \"on\" or \"to\".\n\n===Conjunctions===\n\nSome words can be used both as adpositions and as [[subordinating conjunction]]s:\n* (preposition) '''''before'''/'''after'''/'''since''' the end of the summer''\n* (conjunction) '''''before'''/'''after'''/'''since''' the summer ended''\n* (preposition) ''It looks '''like''' another rainy day''\n* (conjunction) ''It looks '''like''' it's going to rain again today''\nIt would be possible to analyze such conjunctions (or even other subordinating conjunctions) as prepositions that take an entire [[clause (grammar)|clause]] as a complement.\n\n===Verbs===\n\nIn some languages, including a number of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]], many of the words that serve as prepositions can also be used as [[verb]]s. For instance, in [[Standard Chinese]], \u5230 ''d\u00e0o'' can be used in either a prepositional or a verbal sense:\n* \u6211\u5230\u5317\u4eac\u53bb ''w\u01d2 d\u00e0o B\u011bij\u012bng q\u00f9'' (\"I go to Beijing\"; ''q\u00f9'', meaning \"to go\", is the main verb, ''d\u00e0o'' is prepositional meaning \"to\")\n* \u6211\u5230\u4e86 ''w\u01d2 d\u00e0o le'' (\"I have arrived\"; ''d\u00e0o'' is the main verb, meaning \"to arrive\")\nBecause of this overlap, and the fact that a sequence of prepositional phrase and verb phrase often resembles a [[serial verb construction]], Chinese prepositions (and those of other languages with similar grammatical structures) are often referred to as [[coverb]]s.\n\nAs noted in previous sections, Chinese can also be said to have postpositions, although these can be analyzed as nominal ([[noun]]) elements.

For example, in English the agent of a [[passive voice|passive]] construction is marked by the preposition ''by'', while in [[Russian grammar|Russian]] it is marked by use of the [[instrumental case]]. Sometimes such equivalences exist within a single language; for example, the [[genitive]] case in [[German grammar|German]] is often interchangeable with a phrase using the preposition ''von'' (just as in English, the preposition ''of'' is often interchangeable with the [[English possessive|possessive suffix]] '' 's'').\n\nAdpositions combine [[syntax|syntactically]] with their complement, whereas case markings combine with a noun [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]]. In some instances it may not be clear which applies; the following are some possible means of making such a distinction:\n* Two adpositions can usually be joined with a [[coordinating conjunction]] and share a single complement (''of and for the people''), whereas this is generally not possible with case affixes;\n* One adposition can usually combine with two coordinated complements (''of the city and the world''), whereas a case affix would need to be repeated with each noun ([[Latin language|Latin]] ''urbis et orbis'', not *urb- et orbis'');\n* Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas adpositions can combine with (nominalized) phrases of different categories;\n* A case marking usually appears directly on the noun, but an adposition can be separated from the noun by other words;\n* Within the noun phrase, determiners and adjectives may agree with the noun in case ('''case spreading'''), but an adposition only appears once;\n* A language can have hundreds of adpositions (including complex adpositions), but no language has that many distinct morphological cases.\n\nEven so, a clear distinction cannot always be made. For example, the post-nominal elements in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]] are sometimes called case particles and sometimes postpositions. Sometimes they are analysed as two different groups because they have different characteristics (e.g., the ability to combine with focus particles), but in such analysis, it is unclear which words should fall into which group.\n\n[[Turkish grammar|Turkish]] and [[Finnish grammar|Finnish]] have both extensive case-marking and postpositions, but here there is evidence to help distinguish the two:\n* Turkish: (case) ''sinema'''ya''''' (cinema-''dative'', \"to the cinema\") vs. (postposition) ''sinema '''i\u00e7in''''' (\"for the cinema\")\n* Finnish: (case) ''talo'''ssa''''' (house-''[[inessive]]'', \"in the house\") vs. (postposition) \"talon '''edess\u00e4''' (house-''genitive'' in front, \"in front of the house\")\nIn these examples, the case markings form a word with their hosts (as shown by [[vowel harmony]], other word-internal effects and agreement of adjectives in Finnish), while the postpositions are independent words. As is seen in the last example, adpositions are often used in conjunction with case affixes \u2013 in languages that have case, a given adposition usually takes a complement in a particular case, and sometimes (as has been seen [[#Grammatical properties|above]]) the choice of case helps specify the meaning of the adposition.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of English prepositions]]\n* [[Old English prepositions]]\n* [[Spanish prepositions]]\n* [[Japanese particles]]\n* [[Relational noun]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Haspelmath, Martin.

A preposition comes before its complement; a postposition comes after its complement. English generally has prepositions rather than postpositions \u2013 words such as ''in'', ''under'' and ''of'' precede their objects, such as ''in England'', ''under the table'', ''of Jane'' \u2013 although there are a few exceptions including \"ago\" and \"notwithstanding\", as in \"three days ago\" and \"financial limitations notwithstanding\". Some languages that use a different word order, have postpositions instead, or have both types. The [[phrase]] formed by a preposition or postposition together with its complement is called a [[prepositional phrase]] (or postpositional phrase, adpositional phrase, etc.) \u2013 such phrases usually play an [[adverbial]] role in a sentence.\n\nA less common type of adposition is the '''circumposition''', which consists of two parts that appear on each side of the complement. [[#Classification by position|Other terms]] sometimes used for particular types of adposition include ''ambiposition'', ''inposition'' and ''interposition''. Some linguists use the word ''preposition'' in place of ''adposition'' regardless of the applicable word order.<ref name=\"HP602\">An example is Huddleston & Pullum (2002) (\"''CGEL''\"), whose choice of terms is discussed on p. 602.</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nThe word ''preposition'' comes from {{lang-la|prae}} (\"before\") and {{lang-la|ponere}} (\"to put\"). This refers  to the situation in Latin and [[Ancient Greek grammar|Greek]] (and in [[English grammar|English]]), where such words are placed before their complement (except sometimes in Ancient Greek), and are hence \"pre-positioned\".\n\nIn some languages, including [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the same kind of words typically come after their complement. To indicate this, they are called ''postpositions'' (using the prefix ''post-'', from Latin ''post'' meaning \"behind, after\"). There are also some cases where the function is performed by two parts coming before and after the complement; this is called a ''circumposition'' (from Latin ''circum'' \"around\").\n\nIn some languages, for example [[Finnish language|Finnish]], some adpositions can be used as both prepositions and postpositions. \n\nPrepositions, postpositions and circumpositions are collectively known as ''adpositions'' (using the Latin prefix ''ad-'', meaning \"to\"). However, some linguists prefer to use the well-known and longer established term ''preposition'' in place of ''adposition'', irrespective of position relative to the complement.<ref name=\"HP602\" />\n\n==Grammatical properties==\nAn adposition typically combines with exactly one [[complement (linguistics)|complement]], most often a [[noun phrase]] (or, in a different analysis, a [[determiner phrase]]). In English, this is generally a noun (or something functioning as a noun, e.g., a [[gerund]]), together with its [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] and [[modifier (grammar)|modifiers]] such as [[article (grammar)|article]]s, [[adjective]]s, etc. The complement is sometimes called the [[object (grammar)|object]] of the adposition. The resulting [[phrase]], formed by the adposition together with its complement, is called an [[adpositional phrase]] or prepositional phrase (PP) (or for specificity, a postpositional or circumpositional phrase).\n\nAn adposition establishes a [[grammar|grammatical]] relationship that links its complement to another word or phrase in the context. It also generally establishes a [[semantic]] relationship, which may be spatial (''in'', ''on'', ''under'', ...), temporal (''after'', ''during'', ...), or of some other type (''of'', ''for'', ''via'', ...). The [[World Atlas of Language Structures]] treats a word as an adposition if it takes a noun phrase as a complement and indicates the grammatical or semantic relationship of that phrase to the verb in the containing clause.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 85: Order of Adposition and Noun Phrase|url=http://wals.info/chapter/85|work=World Atlas of Language Structures|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nSome examples of the use of English prepositions are given below. In each case, the prepositional phrase appears in ''italics'', the preposition within it appears in '''''bold''''', and the preposition's [[complement (grammar)|complement]] is <u>underlined</u>. As demonstrated in some of the examples, more than one prepositional phrase may act as an [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] to the same word.\n* As an adjunct to a noun:\n** the weather '''''in''' <u>March</u>''\n** cheese '''''from''' <u>France</u>'' '''''with''' <u>live bacteria</u>''\n* As a [[predicative expression]] (complement of a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]])\n** The key is '''''under''' <u>the stone</u>''.\n** The cricketer was given out leg '''''before''' <u>wicket</u>''.\n* As an adjunct to a verb:\n** sleep '''''throughout''' <u>the winter</u>''\n** danced '''''atop''' <u>the tables</u> '''for''' <u>hours</u>''\n** dispense '''''with''' <u>the formalities</u>'' (see [[#Semantic functions|Semantic functions]], below)\n* As an adjunct to an adjective:\n** happy '''''for''' <u>them</u>''\n** sick '''''until''' <u>recently</u>''\n\nIn the last of these examples the complement has the form of an adverb, which has been [[nominalization|nominalised]] to serve as a noun phrase; see [[#Different forms of complement|Different forms of complement]], below. Prepositional phrases themselves are sometimes nominalized:\n* '''''In''' <u>the cellar</u>'' was chosen as the best place to store the wine.\n\nAn adposition may determine the [[grammatical case]] of its complement. In English, the complements of prepositions take the [[objective case]] where available (''from him'', not *''from he''). In [[Koine Greek]], for example, certain prepositions always take their objects in a certain case (e.g., \u1f10\u03bd always takes its object in the dative), while other prepositions may take their object in one of two or more cases, depending on the meaning of the preposition (e.g., \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac takes its object in the genitive or in the accusative, depending on the meaning). Some languages have cases that are used exclusively after prepositions ([[prepositional case]]), or special forms of [[pronoun]]s for use after prepositions ([[prepositional pronoun]]).\n\nThe functions of adpositions overlap with those of case markings (for example, the meaning of the English preposition ''of'' is expressed in many languages by a [[genitive case]] ending), but adpositions are classed as [[syntactic]] elements, while case markings are [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]].\n\nAdpositions themselves are usually [[Uninflected word|non-inflecting]] (\"invariant\"): they do not have paradigms of form (such as tense, case, gender, etc.)  the same way that verbs, adjectives, and nouns can. There are exceptions, though, such as prepositions that have fused with a pronominal object to form [[inflected preposition]]s.\n\nThe following properties are characteristic of most adpositional systems:\n* Adpositions are among the most frequently occurring words in languages that have them. For example, one frequency ranking for English word forms<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordcount.org/main.php|title=Wordcount \u00b7 Tracking the Way We Use Language|publisher=}}</ref> begins as follows (prepositions in bold):\n::''the, '''of''', and, '''to''', a, '''in''', that, it, is, was, I, '''for''', '''on''', you'', \u2026\n* The most common adpositions are single, [[morpheme|monomorphemic]] words. According to the ranking cited above, for example, the most common English prepositions are ''on'', ''in'', ''to'', ''by'', ''for'', ''with'', ''at'', ''of'', ''from'', ''as'', all of which are single-syllable words and cannot be broken down into smaller units of meaning.\n* Adpositions form a [[closed class]] of lexical items and cannot be productively derived from words of other categories.\n\n==Classification by position==\nAs noted above, adpositions are referred to by various terms, depending on their position relative to the complement.\n\nWhile the term ''preposition'' is sometimes used to denote any adposition, in its stricter meaning it refers only to one which precedes its complement. Examples of this, from English, have been given above; similar examples can be found in many European and other languages, for example:\n*[[German grammar|German]]: '''''mit''' einer Frau'' (\"'''with''' a woman\")\n*[[French grammar|French]]: '''''sur''' la table'' (\"'''on''' the table\")\n*[[Polish grammar|Polish]]: '''''na''' stole'' (\"'''on''' the table\")\n*[[Russian grammar|Russian]]: '''''\u0443''' \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f'' (\"'''in the possession of''' me\" [I have])\n*[[Khmer grammar|Khmer]]: '''\u179b\u17be'''\u1780\u17d2\u178f\u17b6\u179a\u1781\u17c0\u1793 ['''l\u0259\u02d0''' kda\u02d0k\u02b0i\u0259n] (\"'''on''' (the) blackboard\")\n*[[Tigrinya grammar|Tigrinya]]: '''\u12a0\u1265 \u120d\u12d5\u120a''' \u1323\u12cd\u120b ['''ab\u02d0''' '''l:ali''' tawla] (\"'''at/on''' '''top''' table\"); '''\u12a0\u1265 \u1275\u1215\u1272''' \u1323\u12cd\u120b ['''ab\u02d0''' '''t:hti''' tawla] (\"'''at/on''' '''under''' table\")\n\nIn certain grammatical constructions, the complement of a preposition may be absent or may be moved from its position directly following the preposition. This may be referred to as [[preposition stranding]] (see also [[#Stranding|below]]), as in \"Whom did you go '''with'''?\" and  \"There's only one thing worse than being talked '''about'''.\" There are also some (mainly colloquial) expressions in which a preposition's complement may be omitted, such as \"I'm going to the park. Do you want to come '''with''' [me]?\", and the French ''Il fait trop froid, je ne suis pas habill\u00e9e '''pour''''' (\"It's too cold, I'm not dressed '''for''' [the situation].\")\nThe bolded words in these examples are generally still considered prepositions, because when they form a phrase with a complement (in more ordinary constructions) they must appear first.\n\nA ''postposition'' follows its complement to form a postpositional phrase. Examples include:\n*[[Latin language|Latin]]: ''me'''cum''''' (\"'''with''' me\", literally \"me '''with'''\")\n*[[Turkish grammar|Turkish]]: ''benim'''le''''' or ''benim '''ile''''' (\"'''with''' me\", literally \"my '''with'''\") \n*[[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u684c\u5b50'''\u4e0a''' ''zhu\u014dzi '''sh\u00e0ng''''' (lit. \"table '''on'''\"); this is a nominal form which usually requires an additional preposition to form an adverbial phrase (see [[Chinese grammar#Locative phrases|Chinese locative phrases]])\n*English:  ''ten kilometers '''away''''', ''ten months '''ago''''' (both could be considered adverbs)\n\nSome adpositions can appear either before or after their complement:\n* English: ''the evidence '''notwithstanding''''' OR '''''notwithstanding''' the evidence''\n* German: ''meiner Meinung '''nach''''' OR '''''nach''' meiner Meinung'' (\"'''in''' my opinion\")\n* German: ''die Stra\u00dfe '''entlang''''' OR '''''entlang''' der Stra\u00dfe'' (\"'''along''' the road\"; here a different [[grammatical case|case]] is used when ''entlang'' precedes the noun)\n \nAn adposition like the above, which can be either a preposition or a postposition, can be called an '''ambiposition'''.<ref>See Reindl (2001), Libert (2006).</ref> However, ''ambiposition'' may also be used to refer to a circumposition (see below),<ref>Gernot Windfuhr, ''Iranian Languages'', Routledge 2013 p. 736.</ref> or to a word that appears to function as a preposition and postposition simultaneously, as in the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] construction (noun-1) ''\u0101'' (noun-2), meaning \"from (noun-1) to (noun-2)\".<ref>V\u00edt Buben\u00edk, ''From Case to Adposition: The Development of Configurational Syntax in Indo-European Languages'', John Benjamins Publishing 2006, p. 109.</ref>\n\nWhether a language has primarily prepositions or postpositions is seen as an aspect of its [[Linguistic typology|typological]] classification, and tends to correlate with other properties related to [[head directionality]]. Since an adposition is regarded as the [[head (linguistics)|head]] of its phrase, prepositional phrases are head-initial (or right-[[branching (linguistics)|branching]]), while postpositional phrases are head-final (or left-branching). There is a tendency for languages that feature postpositions also to have other head-final features, such as [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|verbs that follow their objects]]; and for languages that feature prepositions to have other head-initial features, such as [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|verbs that precede their objects]]. This is only a tendency, however; an example of a language that behaves differently is [[Latin grammar|Latin]], which employs mostly prepositions, even though it typically places verbs after their objects.\n\nA ''circumposition'' consists of two or more parts, positioned on both sides of the complement. Circumpositions are very common in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]. The following are examples from [[Northern Kurdish]] (Kurmanji):\n* ''bi ... re'' (\"with\")\n* ''di ... de'' (\"in\", for things, not places)\n* ''di ... re'' (\"via, through\")\n* ''ji ... re'' (\"for\")\n* ''ji ... ve'' (\"since\")\n\nVarious constructions in other languages might also be analyzed as circumpositional, for example:\n* English: '''''from''' now '''on'''''\n* [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: '''''naar''' het einde '''toe''''' (\"towards the end\", lit. \"to the end to\")\n* [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]]: '''\u5f9e'''\u51b0\u7bb1'''\u88e1''' '''''c\u00f3ng''' b\u012bngxi\u0101ng '''l\u01d0''''' (\"from the inside of the refrigerator\", lit. \"from refrigerator inside\")\n* [[French language|French]]: '''''\u00e0''' un d\u00e9tail '''pr\u00e8s''''' (\"except for one detail\", lit. \"at one detail near\")\n* [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: '''''f\u00f6r''' tre timmar '''sedan''''' (\"three hours ago\", lit. \"for three hours since\")\n* [[German language|German]]: '''''aus''' dem Zimmer '''heraus''''' (\"out from the room\", lit. \"from the room out\")\n* [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]: '''''\u12ab\u1265 ''' \u1215\u1302 ''''''\u1295'''\u12f0\u1213\u122d (\"from now on\", lit. \"from now to later\")\nMost such phrases, however, can be analyzed as having a different hierarchical structure (such as a prepositional phrase modifying a following adverb). The Chinese example could be analyzed as a prepositional phrase headed by ''c\u00f3ng'' (\"from\"), taking the [[Chinese grammar#Locative phrases|locative noun phrase]] ''b\u012bngx\u012bang l\u01d0'' (\"refrigerator inside\") as its complement.\n\nAn '''inposition''' is a rare type of adposition that appears between parts of a complex complement. For example, in the native Californian [[Timbisha language]], the phrase \"from a mean cold\" can be translated using the word order \"cold from mean\"\u2014the inposition follows the noun but precedes any following [[modifier (grammar)|modifier]]s that form part of the same [[noun phrase]].<ref>Matthew S. Dryer, [http://wals.info/chapter/85 \"Order of Adposition and Noun Phrase\"], in ''The World Atlas of Language Structures Online''. Retrieved 2015-01-01.</ref> The Latin word ''cum'' is also commonly used as an inposition, as in the phrase ''[[summa cum laude]]'', meaning \"with highest praise\", lit. \"highest with praise\".\n\nThe term '''interposition''' has been used<ref>See Melis (2003), p. 22. The term is used here in French, and in reference to the French language.</ref> for adpositions in structures such as ''word '''for''' word'', (French) ''coup '''sur''' coup'' (\"one after another, repeatedly\"), (Russian) \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433 '''\u0441''' \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c (\"one with the other\"). This is not a case of an adposition appearing inside its complement, as the two nouns do not form a single phrase (there is no phrase *''word word'', for example); such uses have more of a [[coordination (linguistics)|coordinating]] character.\n\n==Stranding==\n{{Main|Preposition stranding}}\n\nPreposition stranding is a [[syntax|syntactic]] construct in which a preposition occurs somewhere other than immediately before its complement. For example, in the English sentence \"What did you sit on?\" the preposition ''on'' has ''what'' as its complement, but ''what'' is [[Wh-fronting|moved to the start]] of the sentence, because it is an [[interrogative word]]. This sentence is much more common and natural than the equivalent sentence without stranding: \"On what did you sit?\" Preposition stranding is commonly found in [[English language|English]],<ref name=\"CB1\">{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=The Power of Prepositions |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=216 |work=On Writing |publisher=Criminal Brief |location=Cairo |date=2007-09-23 }}</ref> as well as [[North Germanic languages]] such as [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Its existence in [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is debated. Preposition stranding is also found in some [[Niger\u2013Congo languages]] such as Vata and Gbadi, and in some North American varieties of [[French language|French]].\n\nSome prescriptive English grammars teach that prepositions cannot end a sentence, although there is [[List of common English usage misconceptions|no rule]] prohibiting that use.<ref name=\"Mignon Fogarty\">{{cite web |url=http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/top-ten-grammar-myths.aspx|title= Top Ten Grammar Myths|first= Mignon |last=Fogarty|date= 4 March 2010|work= Grammar Girl: Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing|accessdate= 27 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Random House\">{{cite book |title= Origins of the Specious: Myths and Misconceptions of the English Language|last1= O'Conner|first1= Patricia T.|last2= Kellerman|first2= Stewart|year= 2009|publisher= Random House|location= New York|isbn= 978-1-4000-6660-5|page=17}}</ref> Similar rules arose during the rise of classicism, when they were applied to English in imitation of classical languages such as Latin. [[Otto Jespersen]], in his ''Essentials of English Grammar'' (first published 1933), commented on this definition-derived rule: \"...nor need a preposition (Latin: ''praepositio'') stand before the word it governs (go the fools ''among'' (Sh[akespeare]); What are you laughing ''at''?). You might just as well believe that all blackguards are black or that turkeys come from Turkey; many names have either been chosen unfortunately at first or have changed their meanings in course of time.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Jespersen|first=Otto|authorlink=Otto Jespersen|title=Essentials of English Grammar|year=1962|location=London|publisher=George Allen & Unwin|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cyAhxH035RUC&pg=PT96}}</ref>\n\n==Simple ''versus'' complex==\n\n'''Simple''' adpositions consist of a single word (''on'', ''in'', ''for'', ''towards'', etc.). '''Complex''' adpositions consist of a group of words that act as one unit. Examples of complex prepositions in English include ''in spite of'', ''with respect to'', ''except for'', ''by dint of'', and ''next to''.\n\nThe distinction between simple and complex adpositions is not clear-cut. Many simple adpositions are derived from complex forms (e.g., ''with + in'' \u2192 ''within'', ''by + side'' \u2192 ''beside'') through [[grammaticalisation]]. This change takes time, and during the transitional stages the adposition acts in some ways like a single word, and in other ways like a multi-word unit. For example, current [[German orthography|German orthographic conventions]] recognize the indeterminate status of certain prepositions, allowing two spellings: ''anstelle''/''an Stelle'' (\"instead of\"), ''aufgrund''/''auf Grund'' (\"because of\"), ''mithilfe''/''mit Hilfe'' (\"by means of\"), ''zugunsten''/''zu Gunsten'' (\"in favor of\"), ''zuungunsten''/''zu Ungunsten'' (\"to the disadvantage of\"), ''zulasten/zu Lasten'' (\"at the expense of\").<ref>[[Duden]]: ''Neue Rechtschreibung Crashkurs ([http://www.duden.de/deutsche_sprache/neue_rechtschreibung/crashkurs/getrenntzusammen/regel_11.php Regel 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312003114/http://www.duden.de/deutsche_sprache/neue_rechtschreibung/crashkurs/getrenntzusammen/regel_11.php |date=2008-03-12 }})''.</ref>\n\nThe distinction between complex adpositions and free combinations of words is not a black and white issue: complex adpositions (in English, \"prepositional idioms\") can be more fossilized or less fossilized. In English, this applies to a number of structures of the form \"preposition + (article) + noun + preposition\", such as ''in front of'', ''for the sake of''.<ref>''CGEL'', p. 618ff; Pullum (2005); Huddleston and Pullum (2005), pp. 146-47.</ref> The following characteristics are good indications that a given combination is \"frozen\" enough to be considered a complex preposition in English:<ref>Quirk and Mulholland (1964).<!--Check this ref, it may not support the whole of this--></ref>\n* It contains a word that cannot be used in any other context: ''by dint of'', ''in lieu of''.\n* The first preposition cannot be replaced: ''with a view to'' but not *''for/without a view to''.\n* It is impossible to insert an article, or to use a different article: ''on account of'' but not *''on an/the account of''; ''for the sake of'' but not *''for a sake of''.\n* The range of possible adjectives is very limited: ''in great favor of'', but not *''in helpful favor of''.\n* The [[grammatical number]] of the noun cannot be changed: ''by virtue of'' but not *''by virtues of''.\n* It is impossible to use a [[possessive determiner]]: ''in spite of him'', not *''in his spite''.\n\n==Marginal prepositions==\n\nMarginal prepositions are prepositions that have affinities with other word classes, most notably verbs.<ref>Quirk, Randolph, Sidney Greenbaum, Jan Svartvik, & Geoffrey Leech. 1985. ''A comprehensive grammar of the English language''. London: Longman. 667-68.\n</ref> Marginal prepositions behave like prepositions but derive from other parts of speech. Some marginal prepositions in English include ''barring'', ''concerning'', ''considering'', ''excluding'', ''failing'', ''following'', ''including'', ''notwithstanding'', ''regarding'', and ''respecting''.\n\n==Proper ''versus'' improper==\n\nIn descriptions of some languages, prepositions are divided into '''proper''' (or ''essential'') and '''improper''' (or ''accidental''). A preposition is called improper if it is some other part of speech being used in the same way as a preposition. Examples of simple and complex prepositions that have been so classified include ''prima di'' (\"before\") and ''davanti (a)'' (\"in front of\") in [[Italian grammar|Italian]],<ref>Maria Franca Zuccarello, Edvaldo Sampaio Beliz\u00e1rio, [http://www.filologia.org.br/xiicnlf/16/07.pdf As preposi\u00e7\u00f5es acidentais (preposizioni improprie) italianas e seus termos correpondentes em portugu\u00eas], CNLF, Vol. XII No. 16, p. 72.</ref> and ''ergo'' (\"on account of\") and ''causa'' (\"for the sake of\") in [[Latin grammar|Latin]].<ref>Harm Pinkster, ''On Latin Adverbs'', Amsterdam University Press 2005, p. 148.</ref>  In reference to [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]], however, an improper preposition is one that cannot also serve as a [[prefix]] to a [[verb]].<ref>Stanley E. Porter, ''Idioms of the Greek New Testament'', A&C Black 1992, p. 140.</ref>\n\n==Different forms of complement==\nAs noted above, adpositions typically have [[noun phrase]]s as complements. This can include [[nominal clause]]s and certain types of [[non-finite verb]] phrase:\n*We can't agree '''''on''' whether to have children or not'' (complement is a nominal clause)\n*Let's think '''''about''' solving this problem'' (complement is a [[gerund]] phrase)\n*'''''pour''' encourager les autres'' (French: \"to encourage the others\", complement is an [[infinitive]] phrase)\n\nThe word ''to'' when it precedes the [[Uses of English verb forms#Infinitive|infinitive in English]] is not a preposition, but rather is a grammatical [[particle (grammar)|particle]] outside of any main [[word class]].\n\nIn other cases the complement may have the form of an adjective or [[adjective phrase]], or an adverbial. This may be regarded as a complement representing a different [[syntactic category]], or simply as an atypical form of noun phrase (see [[nominalization]]).\n*The scene went '''''from''' blindingly bright '''to''' pitch black'' (complements are adjective phrases)\n*I worked there '''''until''' recently'' (complement is an adverb)\n*Come out '''''from''' under the bed'' (complement is an adverbial)\nIn the last example, the complement of the preposition ''from'' is in fact another prepositional phrase. The resulting sequence of two prepositions (''from under'') may be regarded as a [[#Simple and complex adpositions|complex]] preposition; in some languages such a sequence may be represented by a single word, as Russian \u0438\u0437-\u043f\u043e\u0434 ''iz-pod'' (\"from under\").\n\nSome adpositions appear to combine with two complements:\n* '''''With''' Sammy president'', we can all come out of hiding again.\n* '''''For''' Sammy to become president'', they'd have to seriously modify the Constitution.\nIt is more commonly assumed, however, that ''Sammy'' and the following predicate forms a \"[[small clause]]\", which then becomes the single complement of the preposition.  (In the first example, a word such as ''as'' may be considered to have been [[elliptical construction|elided]], which, if present, would clarify the grammatical relationship.)\n\n==Semantic functions==\n\nAdpositions can be used to express a wide range of [[semantics|semantic]] relations between their complement and the rest of the context. The relations expressed may be spatial (denoting location or direction), temporal (denoting position in time), or relations expressing comparison, content, agent, instrument, means, manner, cause, purpose, reference, etc.\n\nMost common adpositions are highly [[Polysemy|polysemous]] (they have various different meanings). In many cases a primary, spatial meaning becomes extended to non-spatial uses by [[metaphor]]ical or other processes. Because of the variety of meanings, a single adposition often has many possible equivalents in another language, depending on the exact context in which it is used; this can cause significant difficulties in foreign [[language learning]]. Usage can also vary between dialects of the same language (for example, [[American English]] has ''on the weekend'', where [[British English]] uses ''at the weekend'').\n\nIn some contexts (as in the case of some [[phrasal verb]]s) the choice of adposition may be determined by another element in the construction or be fixed by the construction as a whole. Here the adposition may have little independent semantic content of its own, and there may be no clear reason why the particular adposition is used rather than another. Examples of such expressions are:\n* English: ''dispense '''with''''', ''listen '''to''''', ''insist '''on''''', ''proud '''of''''', ''good '''at'''''\n* [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''otvechat' '''na''' vopros'' (\"answer the question\", literally \"answer on the question\"), ''obvinenie '''v''' obmane'' (\"accusation of [literally: in] fraud\")\n* [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''so\u00f1ar '''con''' ganar el t\u00edtulo'' (\"dream about [lit. with] winning the title\"), ''consistir '''en''' dos grupos'' (\"consist of [lit. in] two groups\")\n\nPrepositions sometimes mark roles that may be considered largely grammatical:\n* [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]] (in a broad sense) \u2013 ''the pen '''of''' my aunt'' (sometimes marked by [[genitive]] or [[possessive]] forms)\n* the agent in [[passive voice|passive]] constructions \u2013 ''killed '''by''' a lone gunman''\n* the recipient of a transfer \u2013 ''give it '''to''' him'' (sometimes marked by a [[dative]] or an [[indirect object]])\n\nSpatial meanings of adpositions may be either ''directional'' or ''static''. A directional meaning usually involves motion in a particular direction (\"Kay went '''to''' the store\"), the direction in which something leads or points (\"A path '''into''' the woods\"), or the extent of something (\"The fog stretched '''from''' London '''to''' Paris\"). A static meaning indicates only a location (\"'''at''' the store\", \"'''behind''' the chair\", \"'''on''' the moon\"). Some prepositions can have both uses: \"he sat '''in''' the water\" (static); \"he jumped in the water\" (probably directional). In some languages, the [[grammatical case|case]] of the complement varies depending on the meaning, as with several prepositions in [[German grammar|German]], such as ''in'':\n* ''in seinem Zimmer'' (\"in his room\", static meaning, takes the [[dative]])\n* ''in sein Zimmer'' (\"into his room\", directional meaning, takes the [[accusative]])\n\nIn English and many other languages, prepositional phrases with static meaning are commonly used as [[predicative expression]]s after a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] (\"Bob is at the store\"); this may happen with some directional prepositions as well (\"Bob is from Australia\"), but this is less common. Directional prepositional phrases combine mostly with verbs that indicate movement (\"Jay is going into her bedroom\", but not *\"Jay is lying down into her bedroom\").\n\nDirectional meanings can be further divided into ''[[telicity|telic]]'' and ''atelic''. Telic prepositional phrases imply movement all the way to the endpoint (\"she ran to the fence\"), while atelic ones do not (\"she ran towards the fence\").<ref>Zwarts, Joost. 2005. \"Prepositional Aspect and the Algebra of Paths.\" ''Linguistics and Philosophy'' 28.6, 739\u2013779.</ref>\n\nStatic meanings can be divided into ''projective'' and ''non-projective'', where projective meanings are those whose understanding requires knowledge of the perspective or point of view. For example, the meaning of \"behind the rock\" is likely to depend on the position of the speaker (projective), whereas the meaning of \"on the desk\" is not (non-projective). Sometimes the interpretation is ambiguous, as in \"behind the house\", which may mean either at the natural back of the house, or on the opposite side of the house from the speaker.<ref>Creswell, Max. 1978. \"Prepositions and points of view.\" ''Linguistics and Philosophy'', 2: 1\u201341.</ref>\n\n==Overlaps with other categories==\n\n===Adverbs and particles===\nThere are often similarities in form between adpositions and [[adverb]]s. Some adverbs are derived from the fusion of a preposition and its complement (such as ''downstairs'', from ''down (the) stairs'', and ''underground'', from ''under (the) ground''). Some words can function both as adverbs and as prepositions, such as ''inside'', ''aboard'', ''underneath'' (for instance, one can say \"go inside\", with adverbial use, or \"go inside the house\", with prepositional use). Such cases are analogous to verbs that can be used either [[transitive verb|transitively]] or intransitively, and the adverbial forms might therefore be analyzed as \"intransitive prepositions\". This analysis<ref>See for example ''CGEL'', pp. 612\u201316.</ref> could also be extended to other adverbs, such as ''here'' (this place), ''there'' (that place), ''afterwards'', etc., even though these never take complements.\n\nMany English [[phrasal verb]]s contain [[Grammatical particle|particles]] that are used adverbially, even though they mostly have the form of a preposition (such words may be called [[prepositional adverb]]s). Examples are ''on'' in ''carry on'', ''get on'', etc., ''over'' in ''take over'', ''fall over'', and so on. The equivalents in [[Dutch grammar|Dutch]] and [[German grammar|German]] are [[separable prefix]]es, which also often have the same form as prepositions: for example, Dutch ''aanbieden'' and German ''anbieten'' (both meaning \"to offer\") contain the separable prefix ''aan/an'', which is also a preposition meaning \"on\" or \"to\".\n\n===Conjunctions===\n\nSome words can be used both as adpositions and as [[subordinating conjunction]]s:\n* (preposition) '''''before'''/'''after'''/'''since''' the end of the summer''\n* (conjunction) '''''before'''/'''after'''/'''since''' the summer ended''\n* (preposition) ''It looks '''like''' another rainy day''\n* (conjunction) ''It looks '''like''' it's going to rain again today''\nIt would be possible to analyze such conjunctions (or even other subordinating conjunctions) as prepositions that take an entire [[clause (grammar)|clause]] as a complement.\n\n===Verbs===\n\nIn some languages, including a number of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]], many of the words that serve as prepositions can also be used as [[verb]]s. For instance, in [[Standard Chinese]], \u5230 ''d\u00e0o'' can be used in either a prepositional or a verbal sense:\n* \u6211\u5230\u5317\u4eac\u53bb ''w\u01d2 d\u00e0o B\u011bij\u012bng q\u00f9'' (\"I go to Beijing\"; ''q\u00f9'', meaning \"to go\", is the main verb, ''d\u00e0o'' is prepositional meaning \"to\")\n* \u6211\u5230\u4e86 ''w\u01d2 d\u00e0o le'' (\"I have arrived\"; ''d\u00e0o'' is the main verb, meaning \"to arrive\")\nBecause of this overlap, and the fact that a sequence of prepositional phrase and verb phrase often resembles a [[serial verb construction]], Chinese prepositions (and those of other languages with similar grammatical structures) are often referred to as [[coverb]]s.\n\nAs noted in previous sections, Chinese can also be said to have postpositions, although these can be analyzed as nominal ([[noun]]) elements. For more information, see the article on [[Chinese grammar]], particularly the sections on [[Chinese grammar#Coverbs|coverbs]] and [[Chinese grammar#Locative phrases|locative phrases]].\n\n===Case affixes===\n\nSome [[grammatical case]] markings have a similar function to adpositions; a case affix in one language may be equivalent in meaning to a preposition or postposition in another. For example, in English the agent of a [[passive voice|passive]] construction is marked by the preposition ''by'', while in [[Russian grammar|Russian]] it is marked by use of the [[instrumental case]]. Sometimes such equivalences exist within a single language; for example, the [[genitive]] case in [[German grammar|German]] is often interchangeable with a phrase using the preposition ''von'' (just as in English, the preposition ''of'' is often interchangeable with the [[English possessive|possessive suffix]] '' 's'').\n\nAdpositions combine [[syntax|syntactically]] with their complement, whereas case markings combine with a noun [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]]. In some instances it may not be clear which applies; the following are some possible means of making such a distinction:\n* Two adpositions can usually be joined with a [[coordinating conjunction]] and share a single complement (''of and for the people''), whereas this is generally not possible with case affixes;\n* One adposition can usually combine with two coordinated complements (''of the city and the world''), whereas a case affix would need to be repeated with each noun ([[Latin language|Latin]] ''urbis et orbis'', not *urb- et orbis'');\n* Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas adpositions can combine with (nominalized) phrases of different categories;\n* A case marking usually appears directly on the noun, but an adposition can be separated from the noun by other words;\n* Within the noun phrase, determiners and adjectives may agree with the noun in case ('''case spreading'''), but an adposition only appears once;\n* A language can have hundreds of adpositions (including complex adpositions), but no language has that many distinct morphological cases.\n\nEven so, a clear distinction cannot always be made. For example, the post-nominal elements in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]] are sometimes called case particles and sometimes postpositions. Sometimes they are analysed as two different groups because they have different characteristics (e.g., the ability to combine with focus particles), but in such analysis, it is unclear which words should fall into which group.\n\n[[Turkish grammar|Turkish]] and [[Finnish grammar|Finnish]] have both extensive case-marking and postpositions, but here there is evidence to help distinguish the two:\n* Turkish: (case) ''sinema'''ya''''' (cinema-''dative'', \"to the cinema\") vs. (postposition) ''sinema '''i\u00e7in''''' (\"for the cinema\")\n* Finnish: (case) ''talo'''ssa''''' (house-''[[inessive]]'', \"in the house\") vs. (postposition) \"talon '''edess\u00e4''' (house-''genitive'' in front, \"in front of the house\")\nIn these examples, the case markings form a word with their hosts (as shown by [[vowel harmony]], other word-internal effects and agreement of adjectives in Finnish), while the postpositions are independent words. As is seen in the last example, adpositions are often used in conjunction with case affixes \u2013 in languages that have case, a given adposition usually takes a complement in a particular case, and sometimes (as has been seen [[#Grammatical properties|above]]) the choice of case helps specify the meaning of the adposition.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of English prepositions]]\n* [[Old English prepositions]]\n* [[Spanish prepositions]]\n* [[Japanese particles]]\n* [[Relational noun]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Haspelmath, Martin.

From a materialistic starting point he argued  that natural conditions are themselves conditions of eternal change. He attacked authors claim that there is  stability and equilibrium in nature. Contrariwise he claimed that evolution is quality of living creatures rather than a tendency toward a \"higher order\" of stability, and equilibrium of organisms. He criticised [[Herbert Spencer]]'s views arguing that such views when applied to the evolution of natural history focus attention on the least changeable. However, he argued that such views systematically failed to take into account the fact that equilibrium is attained only at the moment of death: for a living creature, changing forms are constantly developing. Thus Fyodorov criticised the notion that the constant and the stable are the supreme mission of life. Rather he claimed that life never finally achieves anything but always strives to achieve.

From a materialistic starting point he argued  that natural conditions are themselves conditions of eternal change. He attacked authors claim that there is  stability and equilibrium in nature. Contrariwise he claimed that evolution is quality of living creatures rather than a tendency toward a \"higher order\" of stability, and equilibrium of organisms. He criticised [[Herbert Spencer]]'s views arguing that such views when applied to the evolution of natural history focus attention on the least changeable. However, he argued that such views systematically failed to take into account the fact that equilibrium is attained only at the moment of death: for a living creature, changing forms are constantly developing. Thus Fyodorov criticised the notion that the constant and the stable are the supreme mission of life. Rather he claimed that life never finally achieves anything but always strives to achieve.

Since the word ''troubadour'' is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a [[trobairitz]].\n\nThe troubadour school or tradition began in the late 11th century in [[Occitania]], but it subsequently spread to Italy and Spain. Under the influence of the troubadours, related movements sprang up throughout Europe: the [[Minnesang]] in Germany, ''[[trovadorismo]]'' in [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]] and [[Portugal]], and that of the [[trouv\u00e8re]]s in northern France. [[Dante Alighieri]] in his ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' defined the troubadour lyric as ''fictio rethorica musicaque poita'': rhetorical, musical, and poetical fiction. After the \"classical\" period around the turn of the 13th century and a mid-century resurgence, the art of the troubadours declined in the 14th century and around the time of the [[Black Death]] (1348) it died out.\n\nThe texts of troubadour songs deal mainly with themes of [[chivalry]] and [[courtly love]]. Most were metaphysical, intellectual, and formulaic. Many were humorous or vulgar satires. Works can be grouped into three styles: the ''[[trobar leu]]'' (light), ''[[trobar ric]]'' (rich), and ''[[trobar clus]]'' (closed). Likewise there were many [[genre]]s, the most popular being the ''[[canso (song)|canso]]'', but ''[[sirventes]]'' and ''[[tenso]]s'' were especially popular in the post-classical period.\n\n==Etymology of name==\nThe English word ''troubadour'' was borrowed from the French word first recorded in 1575 in an historical context to mean \"langue d'oc poet at the court in the 12th and 13th century\" ([[Jean de Nostredame]], ''Vies des anciens Po\u00e8tes proven\u00e7aux'', p.&nbsp;14 in Gdf. Compl.).<ref name=\"cnrtl.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/troubadour|title=TROUBADOUR : Etymologie de TROUBADOUR|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nThe first use and earliest from of ''troubador'' is ''trobadors'', found in a 12th-century Occitan text by [[Cercamon]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolf|first=George|title=The Poetry of Cercamon and Jaufre Rudel.|year=1983|publisher=Garland Publishing|location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe French word itself is borrowed from the Occitan ''trobador''. It is the [[oblique case]] of the [[nominative]] ''trobaire'' \u201ccomposer\", related to ''trobar'' \u201cto compose, to discuss, to invent\" ([[Wace]], ''Brut'', editions I. Arnold, 3342). ''Trobar'' may come, in turn, from the hypothetical [[Late Latin]] *''trop\u0101re'' \u201cto compose, to invent a poem\" by regular [[phonetic change]]. This reconstructed form is based on the Latin root ''tropus'', meaning a [[Trope (music)|trope]]. In turn, the Latin word derives ultimately from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2'' (''tropos''), meaning \"turn, manner\".<ref name=chaytor>Chaytor, [http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Troubadours1.html Part 1.]</ref> B [[Intervocal]] Latin [p] shifted regularly to [b] in Occitan (cf.

It has the support of some historians, specialists of literature and musicologists to justify of the troubadours' origins in Arabic [[Andalusian classical music|Andalusian musical]] practices. According to them, the Arabic word ''\u1e6daraba'' \u201cmusic\" (from the [[triliteral]] root \u1e6c-R-B (\u0637\u0631\u0628) \u201cprovoke emotion, excitement, agitation; make music, entertain by singing\") could partly be the etymon of the verb ''trobar''.<ref>Maria Rosa Menocal (1985), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/474171 \"Pride and Prejudice in Medieval Studies: European and Oriental\"], ''Hispanic Review'', '''53''':1, 61\u201378.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The origin and meaning of courtly love: a critical study of European scholarship|author=Roger Boase|page=131|year=1977|publisher=Manchester University Press}}</ref>  Another Arabic root had already been proposed before : \u1e0c-R-B (\u0636\u0631\u0628) \u201cstrike\", by extension \u201cplay a musical instrument\".<ref>[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ahess_0395-2649_1966_num_21_5_421446 Richard Lemay, \u00ab \u00c0 propos de l'origine arabe de l'art des troubadours \u00bb, ''Annales. \u00c9conomies, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, civilisations'', vol. 21, n\u00b05, 1966, p. 991 (French)]</ref> They entertain the possibility that the nearly homophonous \u1e0c-R-B root may have contributed to the sense of the newly coined Romance verb ''trobar''.\n\nSome proponents of this theory argue, only on cultural grounds, that both etymologies may well be correct, and that there may have been a conscious poetic exploitation of the [[Phonology|phonological]] coincidence between ''trobar'' and the triliteral Arabic root \u1e6c-R-B when [[Sufism|Sufi Islamic]] musical forms with a love theme first spread from [[Al-Andalus]] to southern France. It has also been pointed out that the concepts of \"finding\", \"music\", \"love\", and \"ardour\" \u2014 the precise semantic field attached to the word troubadour \u2014 are allied in Arabic under a single root W-J-D (\u0648\u062c\u062f) that plays a major role in Sufic discussions of music, and that the word troubadour may in part reflect this.<ref>See [[Idries Shah]], ''The Sufis''.</ref> Nevertheless, the linguistic facts do not support a hypothetical theory : the word ''trover'' is mentioned in French as soon as the 10th century before ''trobar'' in Occitan (see above) and the word ''trovere'' > ''trouv\u00e8re'' appears almost simultaneously in French as ''trobador'' in Occitan (see above).\n\nIn archaic and classical troubadour poetry, the word is only used in a mocking sense, having more or less the meaning of \"somebody who makes things up\". Cercamon writes:\n:''Ist trobador, entre ver e mentir,''\n:''Afollon drutz e molhers et espos,''\n:''E van dizen qu'Amors vay en biays''\n::(These troubadours, between truth and lies/corrupt lovers, women and husbands,/ and keep saying that Love proceeds obliquely).<ref>''Puois nostre temps comens'a brunezir''; read the whole text [http://www.trobar.org/troubadours/cercamon/cmn5.php here]</ref>\n\n[[Peire d'Alvernha]] also begins his famous mockery of contemporary authors ''cantarai d'aquest trobadors'',<ref>read the whole text [http://www.trobar.org/troubadours/alvernha/pealv12.php here]</ref> after which he proceeds to explain why none of them is worth anything.<ref>{{cite book|last=Del Monte|first=A.|title=Peire d'Alvernha, Liriche|year=1955|location=Turin}}</ref> When referring to themselves seriously, troubadours almost invariably use the word \"chantaire\" (singer).\n\n==Origins==\nThe early study of the troubadours focused intensely on their origins. No academic consensus was ever achieved in the area. Today, one can distinguish at least eleven competing theories (the adjectives used below are a blend from the [[Grove Dictionary of Music]] and Roger Boase's ''The Origins and Meaning of Courtly Love''):\n\n*''Arabic'' (also ''Arabist'' or ''Hispano-Arabic'')<br>The sixteenth century Italian historian Giammaria Barbieri was perhaps the first to suggest Arabian influences on the music of the troubadours.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Diminutives in the \"d\u012bw\u0101n\" of Ibn Quzm\u0101n: A Product of Their Hispanic Milieu?|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|volume=52|issue=2|year=1989|page=241|last1=Abu-Haidar|first1=JA}}</ref> Later scholars like J.B. Trend have asserted that the poetry of troubadours is connected to Arabic poetry written in Spain,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Veldeman|first1=Marie-Christine|year=2001|volume=28|issue=2|pages=87\u2013100|journal=Equivalences|title=Egypt, or the quest for syncretism and spiritual wholeness in Lawrence Durrell's Avignon Quintet|doi=10.3406/equiv.2001.1233}}</ref> while others have attempted to find direct evidence of this influence. In examining the works of [[William IX of Aquitaine]], [[\u00c9variste L\u00e9vi-Proven\u00e7al]] and other scholars found three lines that they believed were in some form of Arabic, indicating a potential Andalusian origin for his works. The scholars attempted to translate the lines in question, though the medievalist Istvan Frank contended that the lines were not Arabic at all, but instead the result of the rewriting of the original by a later scribe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Malkin|first1=Peter|title=Provence and Pound|page=[https://archive.org/details/provencepound0000maki/page/326 326]|publisher=University of California|year=1979|isbn=978-0520034884|url=https://archive.org/details/provencepound0000maki/page/326}}</ref><ref name=\"Beech1992\">{{cite journal|title= Troubadour Contacts with Muslim Spain and Knowledge of Arabic: New Evidence Concerning William IX of Aquitaine |journal=Romania|year=1992|pages=14\u201326|last1=Beech|first1=George T.}}</ref> Scholars like [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]] stated that the troubadour tradition was created by William, who had been influenced by [[Moorish]] music and poetry while fighting with the [[Reconquista]]. However, George T. Beech states that there is only one documented battle that William fought in Spain, and it occurred towards the end of his life. Beech adds that while the sources of William's inspirations are uncertain, he and his father did have Spanish individuals within their extended family, and he may have been friendly with some Europeans who could speak the Arabic language.<ref name=\"Beech1992\" /> Regardless of William's personal involvement in the tradition's creation, [[Magda Bogin]] states that Arab poetry was likely one of several influences on European \u201ccourtly love poetry\u201d, citing [[Ibn Hazm]]\u2019s \u201c[[The Ring of the Dove]]\u201d as an example of a similar Arab tradition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bogin|first1=Magda|last2=Bogin|first2=Meg|title=The Women Troubadours|year=1995|publisher=WW Norton|pages=46\u201347|isbn=978-0393009651}}</ref> Methods of transmission from Arab Spain to the rest of Europe did exist, such as the [[Toledo School of Translators]], though it only began translating major romances from Arabic into Latin in the second half of the thirteenth century, with [[Expurgation|objectionable sexual content]] removed in deference to the [[Catholic Church]].<ref>{{cite book|year=1997|isbn=978-0415609845|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies|editor=Mona Baker and Kirsten Malmkjaer|page=553|chapter=Spanish tradition|publisher=Routledge}}</ref> \n*''Bernardine-Marianist'' or ''Christian''<br>According to this theory, it was the theology espoused by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and the increasingly important [[Mariology]] that most strongly influenced the development of the troubadour genre. Specifically, the emphasis on religious and spiritual love, disinterestedness, mysticism, and devotion to Mary explained \"courtly love\". The emphasis of the reforming [[Robert of Arbrissel]] on \"matronage\" to achieve his ends can explain the troubadour attitude towards women.<ref>Gerald A. Bond, \"Origins\", in Akehurst and Davis, p. 246.</ref> Chronologically, however, this hypothesis is hard to sustain (the forces believed to have given rise to the phenomenon arrived later than it). But the influence of Bernardine and Marian theology can be retained without the origins theory. This theory was advanced early by Eduard Wechssler and further by Dmitri Scheludko (who emphasises the [[Cluniac Reform]]) and Guido Errante. Mario Casella and Leo Spitzer have added \"[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]]\" influence to it.\n*''Celtic'' or ''chivalric-matriarchal''<br>The survival of pre-Christian sexual ''mores'' and warrior codes from [[matriarchal]] societies, be they [[Celt]]ic, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], or [[Pictish]], among the aristocracy of Europe can account for the idea (fusion) of \"courtly love\". The existence of pre-Christian matriarchy has usually been treated with scepticism as has the persistence of underlying paganism in high medieval Europe, though the Celts and Germanic tribes were certainly less patriarchal than the Greco-Romans.\n*''Classical Latin''<br>The classical Latin theory emphasises parallels between [[Ovid]], especially his ''Amores'' and ''Ars amatoria'', and the lyric of courtly love. The ''aetas ovidiana'' that predominated in the 11th century in and around [[Orl\u00e9ans]], the quasi-[[Cicero]]nian ideology that held sway in the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial court]], and the scraps of [[Plato]] then available to scholars have all been cited as classical influences on troubadour poetry.<ref>Gerald A. Bond, \"Origins\", in Akehurst and Davis, p. 243.</ref>\n*(''Crypto-'')''Cathar''<br>According to this thesis, troubadour poetry is a reflection of [[Cathar]] religious doctrine. While the theory is supported by the traditional and near-universal account of the decline of the troubadours coinciding with the suppression of Catharism during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (first half of the 13th century), support for it has come in waves. The explicitly Catholic meaning of many early troubadour works also works against the theory.\n*''Liturgical''<br>The troubadour lyric may be a development of the Christian [[liturgy]] and [[hymnody]]. The influence of the [[Song of Songs]] has even been suggested. There is no preceding [[Latin poetry]] resembling that of the troubadours. On those grounds, no theory of the latter's origins in classical or post-classical Latin can be constructed, but that has not deterred some, who believe that a pre-existing Latin corpus must merely be lost to us.<ref>Warren, 4.</ref> That many troubadours received their grammatical training in Latin through the Church (from ''clerici'', clerics) and that many were trained musically by the Church is well-attested. The musical school of [[St. Martial's Abbey, Limoges|Saint Martial's]] at [[Limoges]] has been singled out in this regard.<ref>Warren, 7.</ref> \"Para-liturgical\" [[trope (literature)|trope]]s were in use there in the era preceding the troubadours' appearance.\n*''Feudal-social'' or ''-sociological''<br>This theory or set of related theories has gained ground in the 20th century. It is more a methodological approach to the question than a theory; it asks not from where the content or form of the lyric came but rather in what situation or circumstances did it arise.<ref name=menocal47>Menocal, 47.</ref> Under [[Marxist]] influence, [[Erich K\u00f6hler]], [[Marc Bloch]], and [[Georges Duby]] have suggested that the \"essential hegemony\" in the castle of the lord's wife during his absence was a driving force. The use of [[feudal]] terminology in troubadour poems is seen as evidence. This theory has been developed away from sociological towards [[psychological]] explanation.\n*''Folklore'' or ''spring folk ritual''<br>According to [[Mar\u00eda Rosa Menocal]], [[Alfred Jeanroy]] first suggested that [[folklore]] and [[oral tradition]] gave rise to troubadour poetry in 1883. According to F. M. Warren, it was [[Gaston Paris]], Jeanroy's reviewer, in 1891 who first located troubadour origins in the festive dances of women hearkening the spring in the [[Loire Valley]]. This theory has since been widely discredited, but the discovery of the ''[[jarcha]]s'' raises the question of the extent of literature (oral or written) in the 11th century and earlier.<ref name=menocal47/>\n*''Medieval Latin'' or ''mediolatin'' (''Goliardic'')<br>Hans Spanke analysed the intertextual connexion between vernacular and [[medieval Latin]] (such as [[Goliardic]]) songs. This theory is supported by Reto Bezzola, Peter Dronke, and musicologist [[Jacques Chailley]]. According to them, ''trobar'' means \"inventing a trope\", the trope being a poem where the words are used with a meaning different from their common signification, i.e. [[metaphor]] and [[metonymy]]. This poem was originally inserted in a serial of modulations ending a liturgic song. Then the trope became an autonomous piece organized in stanza form.<ref name=\"DITL\">[http://www.ditl.info/arttest/art4482.php Troubadour], ''Observatoire de terminologie litt\u00e9raire'', [[University of Limoges]], France.</ref> The influence of late 11th-century poets of the \"[[Loire school]]\", such as [[Marbod of Rennes]] and [[Hildebert of Lavardin]], is stressed in this connexion by Brinkmann.<ref>Gerald A. Bond, \"Origins\", in Akehurst and Davis, 244.</ref>\n*''Neoplatonic''<br>This theory is one of the more intellectualising. The \"ennobling effects of love\" in specific have been identified as [[neoplatonic]].<ref>Menocal, 46.</ref> It is viewed either as a strength or weakness that this theory requires a second theory about how the neoplatonism was transmitted to the troubadours; perhaps it can be coupled with one of the other origins stories or perhaps it is just peripheral. K\u00e4te Axhausen has \"exploited\" this theory and A. J. Denomy has linked it with the Arabist (through [[Avicenna]]) and the Cathar (through [[John Scotus Eriugena]]).<ref>Silverstein, 118.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vil\u00e9m9.jpg|thumb|left|[[William IX of Aquitaine]] portrayed as a knight, who first composed poetry on returning from the [[Crusade of 1101]]]]\n\n===Early period===\nThe earliest troubadour whose work survives is Guilh\u00e8m de Peitieus, better known as Duke [[William IX of Aquitaine]] (1071\u20131126). Peter Dronke, author of ''The Medieval Lyric'', however, believes that \"[his] songs represent not the beginnings of a tradition but summits of achievement in that tradition.\"<ref>Peter Dronke, ''The Medieval Lyric'', Perennial Library, 1968. p. 111.</ref> His name has been preserved because he was the [[Duke of Aquitaine]], but his work plays with already established structures; [[Eble II of Ventadorn]] is often credited as a predecessor, though none of his work survives. [[Orderic Vitalis]] referred to William composing songs about his experiences on his return from the [[Crusade of 1101]] (c. 1102). This may be the earliest reference to troubadour lyrics. Orderic also provides us (1135) with what may be the first description of a troubadour performance: an eyewitness account of William of Aquitaine.\n<blockquote>\n''Picauensis uero dux ... miserias captiuitatis suae ... coram regibus et magnatis atque Christianis coetibus multotiens retulit rythmicis uersibus cum facetis modulationibus''. (X.21)\n<br><br>\nThen the Poitevin duke ... the miseries of his captivity ... before kings, magnates, and Christian assemblies many times related with rhythmic verses and witty measures.<ref>Translation based on [[Marjorie Chibnall]], in Bond, p. 240.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Spread===\n[[File:Troubadours berlin.jpg|thumb|200px|Trobadours, 14th century]]\nThe first half of the 12th century saw relatively few recorded troubadours. Only in the last decades of the century did troubadour activity explode. Almost half of all troubadour works that survive are from the period 1180\u20131220.<ref>Paden, 161.</ref>\nIn total, moreover, there are over 2,500 troubadour lyrics available to be studied as lingusitic artifacts (Akehurst, 23).\nThe troubadour tradition seems to have begun in western Aquitaine ([[Poitou]] and [[Saintonge]]) and [[Gascony]], from there spreading over into eastern Aquitaine ([[Limousin (province)|Limousin]] and [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]]) and [[Provence]]. At its height it had become popular in [[Languedoc]] and the regions of [[Rouergue]], [[Toulouse]], and [[Quercy]] (c. 1200). Finally, in the early 13th century it began to spread into first Italy and then [[Catalonia]], whence to the rest of Spain and to Portugal. This development has been called the ''rayonnement des troubadours'' ({{IPA-fr|\u0281\u025bj\u0254nm\u0251\u0303 d\u025b t\u0281ubadu\u02d0\u0281|pron}}).<ref>Paden, 163.</ref>\n\n===Classical period===\nThe classical period of troubadour activity lasted from about 1170 until about 1213. The most famous names among the ranks of troubadours belong to this period. During this period the lyric art of the troubadours reached the height of its popularity and the number of surviving poems is greatest from this period. During this period the ''[[Canso (song)|canso]]'', or love song, became distinguishable as a genre. The master of the ''canso'' and the troubadour who epitomises the classical period is [[Bernart de Ventadorn]]. He was highly regarded by his contemporaries, as were [[Giraut de Bornelh]], reputed by his biographer to be the greatest composer of melodies to ever live, and [[Bertran de Born]], the master of the ''[[sirventes]]'', or political song, which became increasingly popular in this period.\n\nThe classical period came to be seen by later generations, especially in the 14th and 15th centuries and outside of Occitania, as representing the high point of lyric poetry and models to be emulated. The language of the classic poets, its grammar and vocabulary, their style and themes, were the ideal to which poets of the troubadour revival in Toulouse and their Catalan and Castilian contemporaries aspired. During the classical period the \"rules\" of poetic composition had first become standardised and written down, first by [[Raimon Vidal]] and then by [[Uc Faidit]].\n\n==Lives==\n{{see also|List of troubadours and trobairitz|Minstrel|Vida (Occitan literary form)|Razo|Consistori del Gay Saber|Consistori de Barcelona}}\nThe 450 or so troubadours known to historians came from a variety of backgrounds. They made their living in a variety of ways, lived and travelled in many different places, and were actors in many types of social context. The troubadours were not wandering entertainers. Typically, they stayed in one place for a lengthy period of time under the patronage of a wealthy nobleman or woman. Many did travel extensively, however, sojourning at one court and then another.\n\n===Status===\nThe earliest known troubadour, the Duke of Aquitaine, came from the high nobility. He was followed immediately by two poets of unknown origins, known only by their sobriquets, [[Cercamon]] and [[Marcabru]], and by a member of the princely class, [[Jaufre Rudel]]. Many troubadours are described in their ''vidas'' as poor knights. It was one of the most common descriptors of status: [[Berenguier de Palazol]], [[Gausbert Amiel]], [[Guilhem Ademar]], [[Guiraudo lo Ros]], [[Marcabru]], [[Peire de Maensac]], [[Peirol]], [[Raimon de Miraval]], [[Rigaut de Berbezilh]], and [[Uc de Pena]]. [[Albertet de Sestaro]] is described as the son of a noble jongleur, presumably a [[Petty nobility|petty noble]] lineage.\n\nLater troubadours especially could belong to lower classes, ranging from the middle class of merchants and \"burgers\" (persons of urban standing) to tradesmen and others who worked with their hands. [[Salh d'Escola]] and [[Elias de Barjols]] were described as the sons of merchants and [[Elias Fonsalada]] was the son of a burger and jongleur. [[Perdigon]] was the son of a \"poor fisherman\" and [[Elias Cairel]] of a blacksmith. [[Arnaut de Mareuil]] is specified in his ''vida'' as coming from a poor family, but whether this family was poor by noble standards or more global ones is not apparent.\n\nMany troubadours also possessed a clerical education. For some this was their springboard to composition, since their clerical education equipped them with an understanding of musical and poetic forms as well as vocal training. The ''vidas'' of the following troubadours note their clerical status: [[Aimeric de Belenoi]], [[Folquet de Marselha]] (who became a bishop), [[Gui d'Ussel]], [[Guillem Ramon de Gironella]], [[Jofre de Foix\u00e0]] (who became an abbot), [[Peire de Bussignac]], [[Peire Rogier]], [[Raimon de Cornet]], [[Uc Brunet]], and [[Uc de Saint Circ]].\n\n===''Trobadors'' and ''joglars''===\n[[File:Vielles and Citole, Manuscript T (El Escorial, Biblioteca del Real Monasterio, MS. T. I. 1), fol. 5r, detail.jpg|thumb|right|Musicians in the time of the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]. These were in the court of the king, two [[vielle]] players and one [[citoler]].]]\n\nThe Occitan words ''trobador'' and ''trobaire'' are relatively rare compared with the verb ''trobar'' (compose, invent), which was usually applied to the writing of poetry. It signified that a poem was original to an author (''trobador'') and was not merely sung or played by one. The term was used mostly for poetry only and in more careful works, like the ''vidas'', is not generally applied to the composition of music or to singing, though the troubadour's poetry itself is not so careful. Sometime in the middle of the 12th century, however, a distinction was definitely being made between an inventor of original verse and the performers of others'. These last were called ''joglars'', from the Latin ''ioculatores'', giving rise also to the French ''jongleur'', Castilian ''juglar'', and English [[juggler]], which has come to refer to a more specific breed of performer. The medieval ''jongleur/joglar'' is really a [[minstrel]].\n\nAt the height of troubadour poetry (the \"classical period\"), troubadours are often found attacking ''jongleurs'' and at least two small genres arose around the theme: the ''ensenhamen joglaresc'' and the ''sirventes joglaresc''. These terms are debated, however, since the adjective ''joglaresc'' seems to imply \"in the manner of the ''jongleurs''\". Inevitably, however, pieces of these genres are verbal attacks at ''jongleurs'', in general and in specific, with named individuals being called out. It is clear, for example from the poetry of [[Bertran de Born]], that ''jongleurs'' were performers who did not usually  compose. They often performed the troubadours' songs: singing, playing instruments, dancing, and even doing acrobatics.<ref>The earliest reference to the ''[[basse danse]]'' comes from [[Raimon de Cornet]], who attributes it to the ''jongleurs'' of the mid-14th century.</ref>\n\nIn the late 13th century [[Guiraut Riquier]] bemoaned the inexactness of his contemporaries and wrote a letter to [[Alfonso X of Castile]], a noted patron of literature and learning of all kinds, for clarification on the proper reference of the terms ''trobador'' and ''joglar''. According to Riquier, every vocation deserved a name of its own and the sloppy usage of ''joglar'' assured that it covered a multitude of activities, some, no doubt, with which Riquier did not wish to be associated. In the end Riquier argued\u2014and Alfonso X seems to agree, though his \"response\" was probably penned by Riquier\u2014that a ''joglar'' was a courtly entertainer (as opposed to popular or low-class one) and a troubadour was a poet and composer.\n\nDespite the distinctions noted, many troubadours were also known as jongleurs, either before they began composing or alongside. [[Aimeric de Belenoi]], [[Aimeric de Sarlat]], [[Albertet Cailla]], [[Arnaut de Mareuil]], [[Elias de Barjols]], [[Elias Fonsalada]], [[Falquet de Romans]], [[Guillem Magret]], [[Guiraut de Calanso]], [[Nicoletto da Torino]], [[Peire Raimon de Tolosa]], [[Peire Rogier]], [[Peire de Valeira]], [[Peirol]], [[Pistoleta]], [[Perdigon]], [[Salh d'Escola]], [[Uc de la Bacalaria]], [[Uc Brunet]], and [[Uc de Saint Circ]] were jongleur-troubadours.\n\n===''Vidas'' and ''razos''===\n\nA ''vida'' is a brief prose biography, written in [[Occitan]], of a troubadour. The word ''vida'' means \"life\" in Occitan. In the [[chansonnier]]s, the manuscript collections of medieval troubadour poetry, the works of a particular author are often accompanied by a short prose biography. The ''vidas'' are important early works of vernacular prose nonfiction. Nevertheless, it appears that many of them derive their facts from literal readings of their objects' poems, which leaves their historical reliability in doubt. Most of the ''vidas'' were composed in Italy in the 1220s, many by [[Uc de Saint Circ]].\n\nA ''razo'' (from Occitan for \"reason\") was a similar short piece of Occitan prose detailing the circumstances of a particular composition. A ''razo'' normally introduced the poem it explained; it might, however, share some of the characteristics of a ''vida''. The ''razos'' suffer from the same problems as the ''vidas'' in terms of reliability. Many are likewise the work of Uc de Saint Circ.\n\n[[File:Perceval Doria.jpg|thumb|right|Late 16th-century Italian cursive on paper, recording a song of Perceval Doria]]\n\n===''Podest\u00e0''-troubadours===\nA phenomenon arose in Italy, recognised around the turn of the 20th century by Giulio Bertoni, of men serving in several cities as ''[[podest\u00e0]]s'' on behalf of either the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph or Ghibelline]] party and writing political verse in Occitan rhyme. These figures generally came from the urban middle class. They aspired to high culture and though, unlike the nobility, they were not patrons of literature, they were its disseminators and its readers.\n\nThe first ''podest\u00e0''-troubadour was [[Rambertino Buvalelli]], possibly the first native Italian troubadour, who was ''podest\u00e0'' of [[Genoa]] between 1218 and 1221. Rambertino, a Guelph, served at one time or another as ''podest\u00e0'' of [[Brescia]], [[Milan]], [[Parma]], [[Mantua]], and [[Verona]]. It was probably during his three-year tenure there that he introduced Occitan lyric poetry to the city, which was later to develop a flourishing Occitan literary culture.\n\nAmong the ''podest\u00e0''-troubadours to follow Rambertino, four were from Genoa: the Guelphs [[Luca Grimaldi]], who also served in Florence, Milan, and [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]], and [[Luchetto Gattilusio]], who served in Milan, [[Cremona]], and Bologna, and the Ghibellines [[Perceval Doria]], who served in [[Arles]], [[Avignon]], [[Asti]], and [[Parma]], and [[Simon Doria]], sometime ''podest\u00e0'' of [[Savona]] and [[Albenga]]. Among the non-Genoese ''podest\u00e0''-troubadours was [[Alberico da Romano]], a nobleman of high rank who governed [[Vicenza]] and [[Treviso]] as variously a Ghibelline and a Guelph. He was a patron as well as a composer of Occitan lyric.\n\nMention should be made of the Proven\u00e7al troubadour [[Isnart d'Entrevenas]], who was ''podest\u00e0'' of Arles in 1220, though he does not fit the phenomenon Giulio Bertoni first identified in Italy.\n\n===Trobairitz===\n{{main|Trobairitz}}\nThe ''trobairitz'' were the female troubadours, the first female composers of [[secular music]] in the Western tradition. The word ''trobairitz'' was first used in the 13th-century ''[[Romance of Flamenca]]'' and its derivation is the same as that of ''trobaire'' but in feminine form. There were also female counterparts to the ''joglars'': the ''[[joglaresse|joglaresas]]''. The number of trobairitz varies between sources: there were twenty or twenty-one named trobairitz, plus an additional poet known only as [[Domna H.]] There are several anonymous texts ascribed to women; the total number of trobairitz texts varies from twenty-three (Schultz-Gora), twenty-five ([[Pierre Bec|Bec]]), thirty-six (Bruckner, White, and Shepard), and forty-six (Rieger). Only one melody composed by a trobairitz (the [[Beatritz de Dia|Comtessa de Dia]]) survives. Out of a total of about 450 troubadours and 2,500 troubadour works, the trobairitz and their corpus form a minor but interesting and informative portion. They are, therefore, quite well studied.\n\n[[File:BnF ms. 12473 fol. 110v - Na Castelloza (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Castelloza]]\n\nThe trobairitz were in most respects as varied a lot as their male counterparts, with the general exceptions of their poetic style and their provenance. They wrote predominantly ''[[cansos]]'' and ''[[tenso]]s''; only one ''sirventes'' by a named woman, [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]], survives (though two anonymous ones are attributed to women). One ''[[salut d'amor]]'', by a woman ([[Azalais d'Altier]]) to a woman ([[Clara d'Anduza]]) is also extant and one anonymous ''[[planh]]'' is usually assigned a female authorship. They wrote almost entirely within the ''[[trobar leu]]'' style; only two poems, one by [[Lombarda]] and another [[Alais, Yselda, and Carenza]], are usually considered to belong to the more demanding ''[[trobar clus]]''. None of the trobairitz were prolific, or if they were their work has not survived. Only two have left us more than one piece: the Comtessa de Dia, with four, and [[Castelloza]], with three or four. One of the known trobairitz, [[Gaudairen\u00e7a]], wrote a song entitled ''Coblas e dansas'', which has not survived; no other piece of hers has either.\n\nThe trobairitz came almost to a woman from [[Occitania]]. There are representatives from the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], [[Provence]], [[Languedoc]], the [[Dauphin\u00e9]], [[Toulousain]], and the [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]]. One trobairitz, [[Ysabella (trobairitz)|Ysabella]], may have been born in [[P\u00e9rigord]], Northern Italy, [[Latin Empire|Greece]], or [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Palestine]]. All the trobairitz whose families we know were high-born ladies; only one, Lombarda, was probably of the merchant class. All the trobairitz known by name lived around the same time: the late 12th and the early 13th century (c. 1170 \u2013 c. 1260). The earliest was probably [[Tibors de Sarenom]], who was active in the 1150s (the date of her known composition is uncertain). The latest was either [[Garsenda of Forcalquier]], who died in 1242, though her period of poetic patronage and composition probably occurred a quarter century earlier, or [[Guilleuma de Rosers]], who composed a ''tenso'' with [[Lanfranc Cigala]], known between 1235 and 1257. There exist brief prose biographies\u2014''[[Vida (Occitan literary form)|vidas]]''\u2014for eight trobairitz: [[Almucs de Castelnau]] (actually a ''[[razo]]''), [[Azalais de Porcairagues]], the Comtessa de Dia, Castelloza, [[Iseut de Capio]] (also a ''razo''), Lombarda, [[Maria de Ventadorn]], and Tibors de Sarenom.\n\n==Works==\n\n===Schools and styles===\n\nThree main styles of Occitan lyric poetry have been identified: the ''[[trobar leu]]'' (light), ''[[trobar ric]]'' (rich), and ''[[trobar clus]]'' (closed, [[Hermeticism|hermetic]]). The first was by far the most common: the wording is straightforward and relatively simple compared to the ''ric'' and literary devices are less common than in the ''clus''. This style was the most accessible and it was immensely popular. The most famous poet of the ''trobar leu'' was [[Bernart de Ventadorn]]. The ''trobar clus'' regularly escapes modern scholarly interpretation. Words are commonly used metaphorically and symbolically and what a poem appears to be about on its surface is rarely what is intended by the poet or understood by audiences \"in the know\". The ''clus'' style was invented early by [[Marcabru]] but only favoured by a few masters thereafter. The ''trobar ric'' style is not as opaque as the ''clus'', rather it employs a rich vocabulary, using many words, rare words, invented words, and unusual, colourful wordings.\n\nModern scholars recognise several \"schools\" in the troubadour tradition. Among the earliest is a school of followers of Marcabru, sometimes called the \"Marcabrunian school\": [[Bernart Marti]], [[Bernart de Venzac]], [[Gavaudan]], and [[Peire d'Alvernhe]]. These poets favoured the ''trobar clus'' or ''ric'' or a hybrid of the two. They were often moralising in tone and critical of contemporary courtly society. Another early school, whose style seems to have fallen out of favour, was the \"Gascon school\" of [[Cercamon]], [[Peire de Valeira]], and [[Guiraut de Calanso]]. Cercamon was said by his biographer to have composed in the \"old style\" (''la uzansa antiga'') and Guiraut's songs were ''d'aquella saison'' (\"of that time\"). This style of poetry seems to be attached to early troubadours from [[Gascony]] and was characterised by references to nature: leaves, flowers, birds, and their songs. This Gascon \"literary fad\" was unpopular in [[Provence]] in the early 13th century, harming the reputation of the poets associated with it.\n\nIn the late 13th century a school arose at [[B\u00e9ziers]], once the centre of pre-Albigensian Languedoc and of the Trencavel lordships, in the 1260s\u201380s. Three poets epitomise this \"school\": [[Bernart d'Auriac]], [[Joan Esteve]], [[Joan Miralhas]], and [[Raimon Gaucelm]]. All three were natives of B\u00e9ziers and lived there. All three were members of the urban middle class and no courtesans: Miralhas was possibly a potter and Bernart was a ''mayestre'' (teacher). All three were supporters of the French king [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] and the French aristocracy against the native Occitan nobility. They have been described as \"Gallicised\". Raimon Gaucelm supported the [[Eighth Crusade]] and even wrote a ''planh'', the only known one of its kind, to a burgher of B\u00e9ziers. Joan Esteve and Bernart both composed in support of the French in the [[Aragonese Crusade]]. The B\u00e9ziers are a shining example of the transformation of Occitania in the aftermath of the Albigensian Crusade, but also of the ability of troubadours to survive it.\n\n===Genres===\nTroubadours, at least after their style became established, usually followed some set of \"rules\", like those of the ''[[Leys d'amors]]'' (compiled between 1328 and 1337). Initially all troubadour verses were called simply ''vers'', yet this soon came to be reserved for only love songs and was later replaced by ''canso'', though the term lived on as an antique expression for the troubadours' early works and was even employed with a more technically meaning by the last generation of troubadours (mid-14th century), when it was thought to derive from the Latin word ''verus'' (truth) and was thus used to describe moralising or didactic pieces. The early troubadours developed many genres and these only proliferated as rules of composition came to be put in writing. The known genres are:\n*''[[Alba (poetry)|Alba]]'' (morning song)\u2014 the song of a lover as dawn approaches, often with a watchman warning of the approach of a lady's jealous husband\n*''[[Arlabecca]]''\u2014 a song defined by poetic metre, but perhaps once related to the [[rebec]]\n*''[[Canso (song)|Canso]]'', originally ''vers'', also ''chanso'' or ''can\u00e7o''\u2014 the love song, usually consisting of five or six [[stanza]]s with an [[envoi]]\n*''[[Cobla (Occitan literary term)|Cobla esparsa]]''\u2014 a stand-alone stanza\n*''[[Comiat]]''\u2014 a song renouncing a lover\n*[[Crusade song]] (''canso de crozada'')\u2014 a song about the [[Crusades]], usually encouraging them\n*''[[Dansa]]'' or ''balada''\u2014 a lively dance song with a [[refrain]]\n*''[[Descort]]''\u2014 a song heavily discordant in verse form and/or feeling\n*''[[Desdansa]]''\u2014 a dance designed for sad occasions\n*''[[Devinalh]]''\u2014 a riddle or cryptogram\n*''[[Ensenhamen]]''\u2014 a long didactic poem, usually not divided into stanzas, teaching a moral or practical lesson\n*''[[Enuig]]''\u2014 a poem expressing indignation or feelings of insult\n*''[[Escondig]]''\u2014 a lover's apology\n*''[[Estampida]]''\u2014 a dance-like song\n*''[[Gap (song)|Gap]]''\u2014 a boasting song, often presented as a challenge, often similar to modern sports chants\n*''[[Maldit]]''\u2014 a song complaining about a lady's behaviour and character\n*''[[Partimen]]''\u2014 a poetical exchange between two or more poets in which one is presented with a dilemma by another and responds\n*''[[Pastorela]]''\u2014 the tale of the love request of a [[knight]] to a [[shepherdess]]\n*''[[Planh]]''\u2014 a lament, especially on the death of some important figure\n*''[[Plazer]]''\u2014 a poem expressing pleasure\n*''[[Salut d'amor]]''\u2014 a love letter addressed to another, not always one's lover\n*''[[Serena (song)|Serena]]''\u2014 the song of a lover waiting impatiently for the evening (to consummate his love)\n*''[[Sestina]]''\u2014 highly structured verse form\n*''[[Sirventes]]''\u2014 a political poem or [[satire]], originally put in the mouth of a paid soldier (''sirvens'')\n*[[Sonnet]] (''sonet'')\u2014 an Italian genre imported into Occitan verse in the 13th century\n*''[[Tenso]]''\u2014 a poetical debate which was usually an exchange between two poets, but could be fictional\n*''[[Torneyamen]]''\u2014 a poetical debate between three or more persons, often with a judge (like a tournament)\n*''[[Viadeyra|Viadeira]]''\u2014 a traveller's complaint\n\nAll these genres were highly fluid. A cross between a ''sirventes'' and a ''canso'' was a ''meg-sirventes'' (half-''sirventes'').<ref>Sometimes ''canso-sirventes'' or ''sirventes-canso'' was used. [[Bertran de Born]] uses the term ''miei sirventes''.</ref> A ''tenso'' could be \"invented\" by a single poet; an ''alba'' or ''canso'' could be written with religious significance, addressed to God or the Virgin; and a ''sirventes'' may be nothing more than a political attack. The ''maldit'' and the ''comiat'' were often connected as a ''maldit-comiat'' and they could be used to attack and renounce a figure other than a lady or a lover, like a commanding officer (when combined, in a way, with the ''sirventes'').\n\n[[Peire Bremon Ricas Novas]] uses the term ''mieja chanso'' (half song) and [[Cerver\u00ed de Girona]] uses a similar phrase, ''miga can\u00e7o'', both to refer to a short ''canso'' and not a mixture of genres as sometimes supposed. Cerver\u00ed's ''mig'' (or ''meig'') ''vers e miga can\u00e7o'' was a ''vers'' in the new sense (a moralising song) that was also highly critical and thus combined the ''canso'' and the ''sirventes''. Among the more than one hundred works of Cerver\u00ed de Girona are many songs with unique labels, which may correspond more to \"titles\" than \"genres\", but that is debatable: ''peguesca'' (nonsense), ''espingadura'' ([[flageolet]] song), ''libel'' (legal petition), ''esdemessa'' (leap), ''somni'' (dream), ''acuyndamen'' (challenge), ''desiran\u00e7a'' (nostalgia), ''aniversari'' (anniversary), ''serena'' (serene).<ref>Frank M. Chambers (1985), ''An Introduction to Old Proven\u00e7al Versification'', (Darby, PA: Diane Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87169-167-1}}.), pp. 195\u201396.</ref>\n\nMost \"Crusading songs\" are classified either as ''cansos'' or ''sirventes'' but sometimes separately. Some styles became popular in other languages and in other literary or musical traditions. In [[French literature|French]], the ''alba'' became the ''[[aubade]]'', the ''pastorela'' the ''[[pastourelle]]'', and the ''partimen'' the ''[[jeu parti]]''. The ''sestina'' became popular in [[Italian literature]]. The troubadours were not averse to borrowing either. The ''planh'' developed out of the Latin ''[[planctus]]'' and the sonnet was stolen from the [[Sicilian School]]. The [[basse danse]] (''bassa dansa'') was first mentioned in the troubadour tradition (c. 1324), but only as being performed by jongleurs.\n\n[[File:BnF ms. 854 fol. 135 - Le moine de Montaudon (1).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Monge de Montaudon]] receiving a [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrow hawk]] as a prize for his performance in a contest]]\n\n===Performance===\nTroubadours performed their own songs. Jongleurs (performers) and ''cantaires'' (singers) also performed troubadours' songs. They could work from [[chansonnier]]s, many of which have survived, or possibly from more rudimentary (and temporary) songbooks, none of which have survived, if they even existed. Some troubadours, like [[Arnaut de Maruelh]], had their own jongleurs who were dedicated to singing their patron's work. Arnaut's ''joglar et cantaire'', probably both a singer and a messenger, who carried his love songs to his lady, was [[Pistoleta]]. The messenger was commonplace in troubadour poetry; many songs reference a messenger who will bring it to its intended ear. A troubadour often stayed with a noble patron of his own and entertained his court with his songs. Court songs could be used not only as entertainment but also as propaganda, praising the patron, mocking his enemies, encouraging his wars, teaching ethics and etiquette, and maintaining religious unity.\n\nThe court was not the only venue for troubadour performance. Competitions were held from an early date. According to the ''vida'' of the [[Monge de Montaudon]], he received a [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrow hawk]], a prized hunting bird, for his poetry from the ''cour du Puy'', some sort of poetry society associated with the court of [[Alfonso II of Aragon]]. The most famous contests were held in the twilight of the troubadours in the 14th and 15th centuries. The ''[[jocs florals]]'' held by the [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] at [[Toulouse]], by [[Peter IV of Aragon]] at [[Lleida]], and the [[Consistori de Barcelona|Consistori de la Gaya Sci\u00e8ncia]] at [[Barcelona]] awarded floral prizes to the best poetry in various categories, judging it by its accordance with a code called the ''[[Leys d'amors]]''.\n\nTroubadour songs are still performed and recorded today, albeit rarely.\n{{Listen|filename=A Chantar2.ogg|title=A chantar m'er|description=The only existing song by a ''trobairitz'' which survives with music.|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n===Music===\nTroubadour songs were usually [[monophony|monophonic]]. Fewer than 300 melodies out of an estimated 2500 survive.<ref>''The Grove Concise Dictionary of Music'' edited by Stanley Sadie. Macmillan Press Ltd., London.</ref> Most were composed by the troubadours themselves. Some were set to pre-existing pieces of music. [[Raimbaut de Vaqueyras]] wrote his ''Kalenda maya'' (\"The Calends of May\") to music composed by jongleurs at [[Montferrat]].\n\n===Grammars and dictionaries===\nBeginning in the early 13th century, the spread of Occitan verse demanded grammars and dictionaries, especially for those whose native tongue was not Occitan, such as the Catalan and Italian troubadours, and their imitators. The production of such works only increased with the academisation of the troubadour lyric in the 14th century.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Translation of title\n!Author\n!Date, place\n!Character\n|-\n|''Razos de trobar''\n|\"Explanations of composition\"\n|[[Raimon Vidal]]\n|c. 1210\n|[[File:Razos de Trobar.jpg|right|75px]] Prose guide to poetic composition that defends the superiority of Occitan over other vernaculars.

They are largely preserved in songbooks called ''[[chansonnier]]s'' made for wealthy patrons.\n\nTroubadour songs are generally referred to by their [[incipit]]s, that is, their opening lines. If this is long, or after it has already been mentioned, an abbreviation of the incipit may be used for convenience. A few troubadour songs are known by \"nicknames\", thus ''D'un sirventes far'' by [[Guilhem Figueira]] is commonly called the ''Sirventes contra Roma''. When a writer seeks to avoid using unglossed Occitan, the incipit of the song may be given in translation instead or a title may even be invented to reflect the theme of the work. Especially in translations designed for a popular audience, such as Ezra Pound's, English titles are commonly invented by the translator/editor. There are examples, however, of troubadour songs given Occitan titles in the manuscripts, such as an anonymous ''pastorela'' that begins ''Mentre per una ribeira'', which is entitled ''Porquieira''.\n\n===Table of chansonniers===\nThe number of Occitan parchment chansonniers given as extant varies between authors, depending on how they treat fragmentary and multilingual manuscripts. Conventionally, fragments are classified as fragments of the surviving chansonnier they most closely resemble and not as chansonniers in their own right. Some chansonniers have received both Occitan and French letters: troubadour D is trouv\u00e8re H, W is M and X is U. The lettering (''siglas'') was introduced by [[Karl Bartsch]], who placed sources he considered more reliable higher in the alphabet. This system is imperfect, however, since many of the chansonniers produced for an Italian audience are heavily edited and do not necessarily more closely resemble the original compositions. While parchment chansonniers are more durable, paper ones also exist and have received lower-case ''siglas''.<ref>Gaunt and Kay, \"Appendix 4\", 303\u201304.</ref><ref>Paden, \"Manuscripts\", in Akehurst and Davis, 329.</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Image\n!Troubadour manuscript letter (''sigla'')\n!Provenance (place of origin, date)\n!Location (library, city)\n!Shelf mark\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[File:Perdigon's vida, miniature, and canso, MS A.jpg|75px]]\n|A\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>13th century\n|[[Biblioteca Vaticana]],<br>[[Rome]]\n|Latin 5232\n|\n|-\n|\n|B\n|[[Occitania]],<br>13th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 1592\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Chansonnier C.jpg|75px]]\n|C\n|[[Occitania]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 856\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Peire dela Cauarana and Peire de Gauaret.jpg|75px]]\n|D\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>12 August 1254\n|[[Biblioteca Estense]],<br>[[Modena]]\n|Kg.4.MS2=E.45=\u03b1.R.4.4\n|The ''[[Poetarum Provinciali]]''.\n|-\n|\n|E\n|[[Occitania]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 1749\n|\n|-\n|\n|F\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioteca Vaticana]],<br>[[Rome]]\n|Chigi L.IV.106\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Chansonnier G.jpg|75px]]\n|G\n|[[Lombardy]] or [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]],<br>late 13th century\n|[[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]],<br>[[Milan]]\n|R 71 sup.\n|Contains troubadour music.\n|-\n|\n|H\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>late 13th century\n|[[Biblioteca Vaticana]],<br>[[Rome]]\n|Latin 3207\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Jaufre rudel.jpg|75px]]\n|I\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>13th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 854\n|\n|-\n|\n|J\n|[[Occitania]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Firenze|Biblioteca Nazionale]],<br>[[Florence]]\n|Conventi Soppressi F.IV.776\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Azala\u00efs de Porcairagues - BN MS12473 1.jpg|75px]]\n|K\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>13th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 12473\n|\n|-\n|\n|L\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioteca Vaticana]],<br>[[Rome]]\n|Latin 3206\n|\n|-\n|\n|M\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 12474\n|\n|-\n|\n|N\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>14th century\n|[[Pierpont Morgan Library|Pierpont Morgan]],<br>[[New York City|New York]]\n|819\n|The [[Philipps Manuscript]].\n|-\n|\n|O\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioteca Vaticana]],<br>[[Rome]]\n|Vat.Lat. 3208\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Raimon Guillem and Ferrarino da Ferrara.jpg|75px]]\n|P\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>1310\n|[[Biblioteca Laurenziana]],<br>[[Florence]]\n|XLI.42\n|\n|-\n|\n|Q\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioteca Riccardiana]],<br>[[Florence]]\n|2909\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Song of Guiraut Riquier.jpg|75px]]\n|R\n|[[Toulouse|Toulousain]] or [[Rouergue]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 22543\n|Contains more troubadour music than any other manuscript.

Since the word ''troubadour'' is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a [[trobairitz]].\n\nThe troubadour school or tradition began in the late 11th century in [[Occitania]], but it subsequently spread to Italy and Spain. Under the influence of the troubadours, related movements sprang up throughout Europe: the [[Minnesang]] in Germany, ''[[trovadorismo]]'' in [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]] and [[Portugal]], and that of the [[trouv\u00e8re]]s in northern France. [[Dante Alighieri]] in his ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' defined the troubadour lyric as ''fictio rethorica musicaque poita'': rhetorical, musical, and poetical fiction. After the \"classical\" period around the turn of the 13th century and a mid-century resurgence, the art of the troubadours declined in the 14th century and around the time of the [[Black Death]] (1348) it died out.\n\nThe texts of troubadour songs deal mainly with themes of [[chivalry]] and [[courtly love]]. Most were metaphysical, intellectual, and formulaic. Many were humorous or vulgar satires. Works can be grouped into three styles: the ''[[trobar leu]]'' (light), ''[[trobar ric]]'' (rich), and ''[[trobar clus]]'' (closed). Likewise there were many [[genre]]s, the most popular being the ''[[canso (song)|canso]]'', but ''[[sirventes]]'' and ''[[tenso]]s'' were especially popular in the post-classical period.\n\n==Etymology of name==\nThe English word ''troubadour'' was borrowed from the French word first recorded in 1575 in an historical context to mean \"langue d'oc poet at the court in the 12th and 13th century\" ([[Jean de Nostredame]], ''Vies des anciens Po\u00e8tes proven\u00e7aux'', p.&nbsp;14 in Gdf. Compl.).<ref name=\"cnrtl.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/troubadour|title=TROUBADOUR : Etymologie de TROUBADOUR|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nThe first use and earliest from of ''troubador'' is ''trobadors'', found in a 12th-century Occitan text by [[Cercamon]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolf|first=George|title=The Poetry of Cercamon and Jaufre Rudel.|year=1983|publisher=Garland Publishing|location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe French word itself is borrowed from the Occitan ''trobador''. It is the [[oblique case]] of the [[nominative]] ''trobaire'' \u201ccomposer\", related to ''trobar'' \u201cto compose, to discuss, to invent\" ([[Wace]], ''Brut'', editions I. Arnold, 3342). ''Trobar'' may come, in turn, from the hypothetical [[Late Latin]] *''trop\u0101re'' \u201cto compose, to invent a poem\" by regular [[phonetic change]]. This reconstructed form is based on the Latin root ''tropus'', meaning a [[Trope (music)|trope]]. In turn, the Latin word derives ultimately from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2'' (''tropos''), meaning \"turn, manner\".<ref name=chaytor>Chaytor, [http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Troubadours1.html Part 1.]</ref> B [[Intervocal]] Latin [p] shifted regularly to [b] in Occitan (cf. Latin ''sapere'' > Occitan ''saber'' \u201cto know\") (cf. Latin ''sapere'' > ''savoir''). The Latin suffix ''-\u0101tor'', ''-at\u014dris'' explains the Occitan suffix, according to its [[declension]] and [[Diacritical mark|accentuation]] : Gallo-Romance <small>*TROP\u0100TOR</small><ref>Jacques Alli\u00e8res, ''La formation de la langue fran\u00e7aise'', coll.

It has the support of some historians, specialists of literature and musicologists to justify of the troubadours' origins in Arabic [[Andalusian classical music|Andalusian musical]] practices. According to them, the Arabic word ''\u1e6daraba'' \u201cmusic\" (from the [[triliteral]] root \u1e6c-R-B (\u0637\u0631\u0628) \u201cprovoke emotion, excitement, agitation; make music, entertain by singing\") could partly be the etymon of the verb ''trobar''.<ref>Maria Rosa Menocal (1985), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/474171 \"Pride and Prejudice in Medieval Studies: European and Oriental\"], ''Hispanic Review'', '''53''':1, 61\u201378.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The origin and meaning of courtly love: a critical study of European scholarship|author=Roger Boase|page=131|year=1977|publisher=Manchester University Press}}</ref>  Another Arabic root had already been proposed before : \u1e0c-R-B (\u0636\u0631\u0628) \u201cstrike\", by extension \u201cplay a musical instrument\".<ref>[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ahess_0395-2649_1966_num_21_5_421446 Richard Lemay, \u00ab \u00c0 propos de l'origine arabe de l'art des troubadours \u00bb, ''Annales. \u00c9conomies, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, civilisations'', vol. 21, n\u00b05, 1966, p. 991 (French)]</ref> They entertain the possibility that the nearly homophonous \u1e0c-R-B root may have contributed to the sense of the newly coined Romance verb ''trobar''.\n\nSome proponents of this theory argue, only on cultural grounds, that both etymologies may well be correct, and that there may have been a conscious poetic exploitation of the [[Phonology|phonological]] coincidence between ''trobar'' and the triliteral Arabic root \u1e6c-R-B when [[Sufism|Sufi Islamic]] musical forms with a love theme first spread from [[Al-Andalus]] to southern France. It has also been pointed out that the concepts of \"finding\", \"music\", \"love\", and \"ardour\" \u2014 the precise semantic field attached to the word troubadour \u2014 are allied in Arabic under a single root W-J-D (\u0648\u062c\u062f) that plays a major role in Sufic discussions of music, and that the word troubadour may in part reflect this.<ref>See [[Idries Shah]], ''The Sufis''.</ref> Nevertheless, the linguistic facts do not support a hypothetical theory : the word ''trover'' is mentioned in French as soon as the 10th century before ''trobar'' in Occitan (see above) and the word ''trovere'' > ''trouv\u00e8re'' appears almost simultaneously in French as ''trobador'' in Occitan (see above).\n\nIn archaic and classical troubadour poetry, the word is only used in a mocking sense, having more or less the meaning of \"somebody who makes things up\". Cercamon writes:\n:''Ist trobador, entre ver e mentir,''\n:''Afollon drutz e molhers et espos,''\n:''E van dizen qu'Amors vay en biays''\n::(These troubadours, between truth and lies/corrupt lovers, women and husbands,/ and keep saying that Love proceeds obliquely).<ref>''Puois nostre temps comens'a brunezir''; read the whole text [http://www.trobar.org/troubadours/cercamon/cmn5.php here]</ref>\n\n[[Peire d'Alvernha]] also begins his famous mockery of contemporary authors ''cantarai d'aquest trobadors'',<ref>read the whole text [http://www.trobar.org/troubadours/alvernha/pealv12.php here]</ref> after which he proceeds to explain why none of them is worth anything.<ref>{{cite book|last=Del Monte|first=A.|title=Peire d'Alvernha, Liriche|year=1955|location=Turin}}</ref> When referring to themselves seriously, troubadours almost invariably use the word \"chantaire\" (singer).\n\n==Origins==\nThe early study of the troubadours focused intensely on their origins. No academic consensus was ever achieved in the area. Today, one can distinguish at least eleven competing theories (the adjectives used below are a blend from the [[Grove Dictionary of Music]] and Roger Boase's ''The Origins and Meaning of Courtly Love''):\n\n*''Arabic'' (also ''Arabist'' or ''Hispano-Arabic'')<br>The sixteenth century Italian historian Giammaria Barbieri was perhaps the first to suggest Arabian influences on the music of the troubadours.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Diminutives in the \"d\u012bw\u0101n\" of Ibn Quzm\u0101n: A Product of Their Hispanic Milieu?|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London|volume=52|issue=2|year=1989|page=241|last1=Abu-Haidar|first1=JA}}</ref> Later scholars like J.B.

In examining the works of [[William IX of Aquitaine]], [[\u00c9variste L\u00e9vi-Proven\u00e7al]] and other scholars found three lines that they believed were in some form of Arabic, indicating a potential Andalusian origin for his works. The scholars attempted to translate the lines in question, though the medievalist Istvan Frank contended that the lines were not Arabic at all, but instead the result of the rewriting of the original by a later scribe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Malkin|first1=Peter|title=Provence and Pound|page=[https://archive.org/details/provencepound0000maki/page/326 326]|publisher=University of California|year=1979|isbn=978-0520034884|url=https://archive.org/details/provencepound0000maki/page/326}}</ref><ref name=\"Beech1992\">{{cite journal|title= Troubadour Contacts with Muslim Spain and Knowledge of Arabic: New Evidence Concerning William IX of Aquitaine |journal=Romania|year=1992|pages=14\u201326|last1=Beech|first1=George T.}}</ref> Scholars like [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]] stated that the troubadour tradition was created by William, who had been influenced by [[Moorish]] music and poetry while fighting with the [[Reconquista]]. However, George T. Beech states that there is only one documented battle that William fought in Spain, and it occurred towards the end of his life. Beech adds that while the sources of William's inspirations are uncertain, he and his father did have Spanish individuals within their extended family, and he may have been friendly with some Europeans who could speak the Arabic language.<ref name=\"Beech1992\" /> Regardless of William's personal involvement in the tradition's creation, [[Magda Bogin]] states that Arab poetry was likely one of several influences on European \u201ccourtly love poetry\u201d, citing [[Ibn Hazm]]\u2019s \u201c[[The Ring of the Dove]]\u201d as an example of a similar Arab tradition.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bogin|first1=Magda|last2=Bogin|first2=Meg|title=The Women Troubadours|year=1995|publisher=WW Norton|pages=46\u201347|isbn=978-0393009651}}</ref> Methods of transmission from Arab Spain to the rest of Europe did exist, such as the [[Toledo School of Translators]], though it only began translating major romances from Arabic into Latin in the second half of the thirteenth century, with [[Expurgation|objectionable sexual content]] removed in deference to the [[Catholic Church]].<ref>{{cite book|year=1997|isbn=978-0415609845|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies|editor=Mona Baker and Kirsten Malmkjaer|page=553|chapter=Spanish tradition|publisher=Routledge}}</ref> \n*''Bernardine-Marianist'' or ''Christian''<br>According to this theory, it was the theology espoused by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and the increasingly important [[Mariology]] that most strongly influenced the development of the troubadour genre. Specifically, the emphasis on religious and spiritual love, disinterestedness, mysticism, and devotion to Mary explained \"courtly love\". The emphasis of the reforming [[Robert of Arbrissel]] on \"matronage\" to achieve his ends can explain the troubadour attitude towards women.<ref>Gerald A. Bond, \"Origins\", in Akehurst and Davis, p. 246.</ref> Chronologically, however, this hypothesis is hard to sustain (the forces believed to have given rise to the phenomenon arrived later than it). But the influence of Bernardine and Marian theology can be retained without the origins theory. This theory was advanced early by Eduard Wechssler and further by Dmitri Scheludko (who emphasises the [[Cluniac Reform]]) and Guido Errante. Mario Casella and Leo Spitzer have added \"[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]]\" influence to it.\n*''Celtic'' or ''chivalric-matriarchal''<br>The survival of pre-Christian sexual ''mores'' and warrior codes from [[matriarchal]] societies, be they [[Celt]]ic, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], or [[Pictish]], among the aristocracy of Europe can account for the idea (fusion) of \"courtly love\". The existence of pre-Christian matriarchy has usually been treated with scepticism as has the persistence of underlying paganism in high medieval Europe, though the Celts and Germanic tribes were certainly less patriarchal than the Greco-Romans.\n*''Classical Latin''<br>The classical Latin theory emphasises parallels between [[Ovid]], especially his ''Amores'' and ''Ars amatoria'', and the lyric of courtly love. The ''aetas ovidiana'' that predominated in the 11th century in and around [[Orl\u00e9ans]], the quasi-[[Cicero]]nian ideology that held sway in the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial court]], and the scraps of [[Plato]] then available to scholars have all been cited as classical influences on troubadour poetry.<ref>Gerald A. Bond, \"Origins\", in Akehurst and Davis, p. 243.</ref>\n*(''Crypto-'')''Cathar''<br>According to this thesis, troubadour poetry is a reflection of [[Cathar]] religious doctrine. While the theory is supported by the traditional and near-universal account of the decline of the troubadours coinciding with the suppression of Catharism during the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (first half of the 13th century), support for it has come in waves. The explicitly Catholic meaning of many early troubadour works also works against the theory.\n*''Liturgical''<br>The troubadour lyric may be a development of the Christian [[liturgy]] and [[hymnody]]. The influence of the [[Song of Songs]] has even been suggested. There is no preceding [[Latin poetry]] resembling that of the troubadours. On those grounds, no theory of the latter's origins in classical or post-classical Latin can be constructed, but that has not deterred some, who believe that a pre-existing Latin corpus must merely be lost to us.<ref>Warren, 4.</ref> That many troubadours received their grammatical training in Latin through the Church (from ''clerici'', clerics) and that many were trained musically by the Church is well-attested. The musical school of [[St. Martial's Abbey, Limoges|Saint Martial's]] at [[Limoges]] has been singled out in this regard.<ref>Warren, 7.</ref> \"Para-liturgical\" [[trope (literature)|trope]]s were in use there in the era preceding the troubadours' appearance.\n*''Feudal-social'' or ''-sociological''<br>This theory or set of related theories has gained ground in the 20th century. It is more a methodological approach to the question than a theory; it asks not from where the content or form of the lyric came but rather in what situation or circumstances did it arise.<ref name=menocal47>Menocal, 47.</ref> Under [[Marxist]] influence, [[Erich K\u00f6hler]], [[Marc Bloch]], and [[Georges Duby]] have suggested that the \"essential hegemony\" in the castle of the lord's wife during his absence was a driving force. The use of [[feudal]] terminology in troubadour poems is seen as evidence. This theory has been developed away from sociological towards [[psychological]] explanation.\n*''Folklore'' or ''spring folk ritual''<br>According to [[Mar\u00eda Rosa Menocal]], [[Alfred Jeanroy]] first suggested that [[folklore]] and [[oral tradition]] gave rise to troubadour poetry in 1883. According to F. M. Warren, it was [[Gaston Paris]], Jeanroy's reviewer, in 1891 who first located troubadour origins in the festive dances of women hearkening the spring in the [[Loire Valley]]. This theory has since been widely discredited, but the discovery of the ''[[jarcha]]s'' raises the question of the extent of literature (oral or written) in the 11th century and earlier.<ref name=menocal47/>\n*''Medieval Latin'' or ''mediolatin'' (''Goliardic'')<br>Hans Spanke analysed the intertextual connexion between vernacular and [[medieval Latin]] (such as [[Goliardic]]) songs. This theory is supported by Reto Bezzola, Peter Dronke, and musicologist [[Jacques Chailley]]. According to them, ''trobar'' means \"inventing a trope\", the trope being a poem where the words are used with a meaning different from their common signification, i.e. [[metaphor]] and [[metonymy]]. This poem was originally inserted in a serial of modulations ending a liturgic song. Then the trope became an autonomous piece organized in stanza form.<ref name=\"DITL\">[http://www.ditl.info/arttest/art4482.php Troubadour], ''Observatoire de terminologie litt\u00e9raire'', [[University of Limoges]], France.</ref> The influence of late 11th-century poets of the \"[[Loire school]]\", such as [[Marbod of Rennes]] and [[Hildebert of Lavardin]], is stressed in this connexion by Brinkmann.<ref>Gerald A. Bond, \"Origins\", in Akehurst and Davis, 244.</ref>\n*''Neoplatonic''<br>This theory is one of the more intellectualising. The \"ennobling effects of love\" in specific have been identified as [[neoplatonic]].<ref>Menocal, 46.</ref> It is viewed either as a strength or weakness that this theory requires a second theory about how the neoplatonism was transmitted to the troubadours; perhaps it can be coupled with one of the other origins stories or perhaps it is just peripheral. K\u00e4te Axhausen has \"exploited\" this theory and A. J. Denomy has linked it with the Arabist (through [[Avicenna]]) and the Cathar (through [[John Scotus Eriugena]]).<ref>Silverstein, 118.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vil\u00e9m9.jpg|thumb|left|[[William IX of Aquitaine]] portrayed as a knight, who first composed poetry on returning from the [[Crusade of 1101]]]]\n\n===Early period===\nThe earliest troubadour whose work survives is Guilh\u00e8m de Peitieus, better known as Duke [[William IX of Aquitaine]] (1071\u20131126). Peter Dronke, author of ''The Medieval Lyric'', however, believes that \"[his] songs represent not the beginnings of a tradition but summits of achievement in that tradition.\"<ref>Peter Dronke, ''The Medieval Lyric'', Perennial Library, 1968. p. 111.</ref> His name has been preserved because he was the [[Duke of Aquitaine]], but his work plays with already established structures; [[Eble II of Ventadorn]] is often credited as a predecessor, though none of his work survives. [[Orderic Vitalis]] referred to William composing songs about his experiences on his return from the [[Crusade of 1101]] (c. 1102). This may be the earliest reference to troubadour lyrics. Orderic also provides us (1135) with what may be the first description of a troubadour performance: an eyewitness account of William of Aquitaine.\n<blockquote>\n''Picauensis uero dux ... miserias captiuitatis suae ... coram regibus et magnatis atque Christianis coetibus multotiens retulit rythmicis uersibus cum facetis modulationibus''. (X.21)\n<br><br>\nThen the Poitevin duke ... the miseries of his captivity ... before kings, magnates, and Christian assemblies many times related with rhythmic verses and witty measures.<ref>Translation based on [[Marjorie Chibnall]], in Bond, p. 240.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Spread===\n[[File:Troubadours berlin.jpg|thumb|200px|Trobadours, 14th century]]\nThe first half of the 12th century saw relatively few recorded troubadours. Only in the last decades of the century did troubadour activity explode. Almost half of all troubadour works that survive are from the period 1180\u20131220.<ref>Paden, 161.</ref>\nIn total, moreover, there are over 2,500 troubadour lyrics available to be studied as lingusitic artifacts (Akehurst, 23).\nThe troubadour tradition seems to have begun in western Aquitaine ([[Poitou]] and [[Saintonge]]) and [[Gascony]], from there spreading over into eastern Aquitaine ([[Limousin (province)|Limousin]] and [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]]) and [[Provence]]. At its height it had become popular in [[Languedoc]] and the regions of [[Rouergue]], [[Toulouse]], and [[Quercy]] (c. 1200). Finally, in the early 13th century it began to spread into first Italy and then [[Catalonia]], whence to the rest of Spain and to Portugal. This development has been called the ''rayonnement des troubadours'' ({{IPA-fr|\u0281\u025bj\u0254nm\u0251\u0303 d\u025b t\u0281ubadu\u02d0\u0281|pron}}).<ref>Paden, 163.</ref>\n\n===Classical period===\nThe classical period of troubadour activity lasted from about 1170 until about 1213. The most famous names among the ranks of troubadours belong to this period. During this period the lyric art of the troubadours reached the height of its popularity and the number of surviving poems is greatest from this period. During this period the ''[[Canso (song)|canso]]'', or love song, became distinguishable as a genre. The master of the ''canso'' and the troubadour who epitomises the classical period is [[Bernart de Ventadorn]]. He was highly regarded by his contemporaries, as were [[Giraut de Bornelh]], reputed by his biographer to be the greatest composer of melodies to ever live, and [[Bertran de Born]], the master of the ''[[sirventes]]'', or political song, which became increasingly popular in this period.\n\nThe classical period came to be seen by later generations, especially in the 14th and 15th centuries and outside of Occitania, as representing the high point of lyric poetry and models to be emulated. The language of the classic poets, its grammar and vocabulary, their style and themes, were the ideal to which poets of the troubadour revival in Toulouse and their Catalan and Castilian contemporaries aspired. During the classical period the \"rules\" of poetic composition had first become standardised and written down, first by [[Raimon Vidal]] and then by [[Uc Faidit]].\n\n==Lives==\n{{see also|List of troubadours and trobairitz|Minstrel|Vida (Occitan literary form)|Razo|Consistori del Gay Saber|Consistori de Barcelona}}\nThe 450 or so troubadours known to historians came from a variety of backgrounds. They made their living in a variety of ways, lived and travelled in many different places, and were actors in many types of social context. The troubadours were not wandering entertainers. Typically, they stayed in one place for a lengthy period of time under the patronage of a wealthy nobleman or woman. Many did travel extensively, however, sojourning at one court and then another.\n\n===Status===\nThe earliest known troubadour, the Duke of Aquitaine, came from the high nobility. He was followed immediately by two poets of unknown origins, known only by their sobriquets, [[Cercamon]] and [[Marcabru]], and by a member of the princely class, [[Jaufre Rudel]]. Many troubadours are described in their ''vidas'' as poor knights. It was one of the most common descriptors of status: [[Berenguier de Palazol]], [[Gausbert Amiel]], [[Guilhem Ademar]], [[Guiraudo lo Ros]], [[Marcabru]], [[Peire de Maensac]], [[Peirol]], [[Raimon de Miraval]], [[Rigaut de Berbezilh]], and [[Uc de Pena]]. [[Albertet de Sestaro]] is described as the son of a noble jongleur, presumably a [[Petty nobility|petty noble]] lineage.\n\nLater troubadours especially could belong to lower classes, ranging from the middle class of merchants and \"burgers\" (persons of urban standing) to tradesmen and others who worked with their hands. [[Salh d'Escola]] and [[Elias de Barjols]] were described as the sons of merchants and [[Elias Fonsalada]] was the son of a burger and jongleur. [[Perdigon]] was the son of a \"poor fisherman\" and [[Elias Cairel]] of a blacksmith. [[Arnaut de Mareuil]] is specified in his ''vida'' as coming from a poor family, but whether this family was poor by noble standards or more global ones is not apparent.\n\nMany troubadours also possessed a clerical education. For some this was their springboard to composition, since their clerical education equipped them with an understanding of musical and poetic forms as well as vocal training. The ''vidas'' of the following troubadours note their clerical status: [[Aimeric de Belenoi]], [[Folquet de Marselha]] (who became a bishop), [[Gui d'Ussel]], [[Guillem Ramon de Gironella]], [[Jofre de Foix\u00e0]] (who became an abbot), [[Peire de Bussignac]], [[Peire Rogier]], [[Raimon de Cornet]], [[Uc Brunet]], and [[Uc de Saint Circ]].\n\n===''Trobadors'' and ''joglars''===\n[[File:Vielles and Citole, Manuscript T (El Escorial, Biblioteca del Real Monasterio, MS. T. I. 1), fol. 5r, detail.jpg|thumb|right|Musicians in the time of the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]. These were in the court of the king, two [[vielle]] players and one [[citoler]].]]\n\nThe Occitan words ''trobador'' and ''trobaire'' are relatively rare compared with the verb ''trobar'' (compose, invent), which was usually applied to the writing of poetry. It signified that a poem was original to an author (''trobador'') and was not merely sung or played by one. The term was used mostly for poetry only and in more careful works, like the ''vidas'', is not generally applied to the composition of music or to singing, though the troubadour's poetry itself is not so careful. Sometime in the middle of the 12th century, however, a distinction was definitely being made between an inventor of original verse and the performers of others'. These last were called ''joglars'', from the Latin ''ioculatores'', giving rise also to the French ''jongleur'', Castilian ''juglar'', and English [[juggler]], which has come to refer to a more specific breed of performer. The medieval ''jongleur/joglar'' is really a [[minstrel]].\n\nAt the height of troubadour poetry (the \"classical period\"), troubadours are often found attacking ''jongleurs'' and at least two small genres arose around the theme: the ''ensenhamen joglaresc'' and the ''sirventes joglaresc''. These terms are debated, however, since the adjective ''joglaresc'' seems to imply \"in the manner of the ''jongleurs''\". Inevitably, however, pieces of these genres are verbal attacks at ''jongleurs'', in general and in specific, with named individuals being called out. It is clear, for example from the poetry of [[Bertran de Born]], that ''jongleurs'' were performers who did not usually  compose. They often performed the troubadours' songs: singing, playing instruments, dancing, and even doing acrobatics.<ref>The earliest reference to the ''[[basse danse]]'' comes from [[Raimon de Cornet]], who attributes it to the ''jongleurs'' of the mid-14th century.</ref>\n\nIn the late 13th century [[Guiraut Riquier]] bemoaned the inexactness of his contemporaries and wrote a letter to [[Alfonso X of Castile]], a noted patron of literature and learning of all kinds, for clarification on the proper reference of the terms ''trobador'' and ''joglar''. According to Riquier, every vocation deserved a name of its own and the sloppy usage of ''joglar'' assured that it covered a multitude of activities, some, no doubt, with which Riquier did not wish to be associated. In the end Riquier argued\u2014and Alfonso X seems to agree, though his \"response\" was probably penned by Riquier\u2014that a ''joglar'' was a courtly entertainer (as opposed to popular or low-class one) and a troubadour was a poet and composer.\n\nDespite the distinctions noted, many troubadours were also known as jongleurs, either before they began composing or alongside. [[Aimeric de Belenoi]], [[Aimeric de Sarlat]], [[Albertet Cailla]], [[Arnaut de Mareuil]], [[Elias de Barjols]], [[Elias Fonsalada]], [[Falquet de Romans]], [[Guillem Magret]], [[Guiraut de Calanso]], [[Nicoletto da Torino]], [[Peire Raimon de Tolosa]], [[Peire Rogier]], [[Peire de Valeira]], [[Peirol]], [[Pistoleta]], [[Perdigon]], [[Salh d'Escola]], [[Uc de la Bacalaria]], [[Uc Brunet]], and [[Uc de Saint Circ]] were jongleur-troubadours.\n\n===''Vidas'' and ''razos''===\n\nA ''vida'' is a brief prose biography, written in [[Occitan]], of a troubadour. The word ''vida'' means \"life\" in Occitan. In the [[chansonnier]]s, the manuscript collections of medieval troubadour poetry, the works of a particular author are often accompanied by a short prose biography. The ''vidas'' are important early works of vernacular prose nonfiction. Nevertheless, it appears that many of them derive their facts from literal readings of their objects' poems, which leaves their historical reliability in doubt. Most of the ''vidas'' were composed in Italy in the 1220s, many by [[Uc de Saint Circ]].\n\nA ''razo'' (from Occitan for \"reason\") was a similar short piece of Occitan prose detailing the circumstances of a particular composition. A ''razo'' normally introduced the poem it explained; it might, however, share some of the characteristics of a ''vida''. The ''razos'' suffer from the same problems as the ''vidas'' in terms of reliability. Many are likewise the work of Uc de Saint Circ.\n\n[[File:Perceval Doria.jpg|thumb|right|Late 16th-century Italian cursive on paper, recording a song of Perceval Doria]]\n\n===''Podest\u00e0''-troubadours===\nA phenomenon arose in Italy, recognised around the turn of the 20th century by Giulio Bertoni, of men serving in several cities as ''[[podest\u00e0]]s'' on behalf of either the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph or Ghibelline]] party and writing political verse in Occitan rhyme. These figures generally came from the urban middle class. They aspired to high culture and though, unlike the nobility, they were not patrons of literature, they were its disseminators and its readers.\n\nThe first ''podest\u00e0''-troubadour was [[Rambertino Buvalelli]], possibly the first native Italian troubadour, who was ''podest\u00e0'' of [[Genoa]] between 1218 and 1221. Rambertino, a Guelph, served at one time or another as ''podest\u00e0'' of [[Brescia]], [[Milan]], [[Parma]], [[Mantua]], and [[Verona]]. It was probably during his three-year tenure there that he introduced Occitan lyric poetry to the city, which was later to develop a flourishing Occitan literary culture.\n\nAmong the ''podest\u00e0''-troubadours to follow Rambertino, four were from Genoa: the Guelphs [[Luca Grimaldi]], who also served in Florence, Milan, and [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]], and [[Luchetto Gattilusio]], who served in Milan, [[Cremona]], and Bologna, and the Ghibellines [[Perceval Doria]], who served in [[Arles]], [[Avignon]], [[Asti]], and [[Parma]], and [[Simon Doria]], sometime ''podest\u00e0'' of [[Savona]] and [[Albenga]]. Among the non-Genoese ''podest\u00e0''-troubadours was [[Alberico da Romano]], a nobleman of high rank who governed [[Vicenza]] and [[Treviso]] as variously a Ghibelline and a Guelph. He was a patron as well as a composer of Occitan lyric.\n\nMention should be made of the Proven\u00e7al troubadour [[Isnart d'Entrevenas]], who was ''podest\u00e0'' of Arles in 1220, though he does not fit the phenomenon Giulio Bertoni first identified in Italy.\n\n===Trobairitz===\n{{main|Trobairitz}}\nThe ''trobairitz'' were the female troubadours, the first female composers of [[secular music]] in the Western tradition. The word ''trobairitz'' was first used in the 13th-century ''[[Romance of Flamenca]]'' and its derivation is the same as that of ''trobaire'' but in feminine form. There were also female counterparts to the ''joglars'': the ''[[joglaresse|joglaresas]]''. The number of trobairitz varies between sources: there were twenty or twenty-one named trobairitz, plus an additional poet known only as [[Domna H.]] There are several anonymous texts ascribed to women; the total number of trobairitz texts varies from twenty-three (Schultz-Gora), twenty-five ([[Pierre Bec|Bec]]), thirty-six (Bruckner, White, and Shepard), and forty-six (Rieger). Only one melody composed by a trobairitz (the [[Beatritz de Dia|Comtessa de Dia]]) survives. Out of a total of about 450 troubadours and 2,500 troubadour works, the trobairitz and their corpus form a minor but interesting and informative portion. They are, therefore, quite well studied.\n\n[[File:BnF ms. 12473 fol. 110v - Na Castelloza (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Castelloza]]\n\nThe trobairitz were in most respects as varied a lot as their male counterparts, with the general exceptions of their poetic style and their provenance. They wrote predominantly ''[[cansos]]'' and ''[[tenso]]s''; only one ''sirventes'' by a named woman, [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]], survives (though two anonymous ones are attributed to women). One ''[[salut d'amor]]'', by a woman ([[Azalais d'Altier]]) to a woman ([[Clara d'Anduza]]) is also extant and one anonymous ''[[planh]]'' is usually assigned a female authorship. They wrote almost entirely within the ''[[trobar leu]]'' style; only two poems, one by [[Lombarda]] and another [[Alais, Yselda, and Carenza]], are usually considered to belong to the more demanding ''[[trobar clus]]''. None of the trobairitz were prolific, or if they were their work has not survived. Only two have left us more than one piece: the Comtessa de Dia, with four, and [[Castelloza]], with three or four. One of the known trobairitz, [[Gaudairen\u00e7a]], wrote a song entitled ''Coblas e dansas'', which has not survived; no other piece of hers has either.\n\nThe trobairitz came almost to a woman from [[Occitania]]. There are representatives from the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], [[Provence]], [[Languedoc]], the [[Dauphin\u00e9]], [[Toulousain]], and the [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]]. One trobairitz, [[Ysabella (trobairitz)|Ysabella]], may have been born in [[P\u00e9rigord]], Northern Italy, [[Latin Empire|Greece]], or [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Palestine]]. All the trobairitz whose families we know were high-born ladies; only one, Lombarda, was probably of the merchant class. All the trobairitz known by name lived around the same time: the late 12th and the early 13th century (c. 1170 \u2013 c. 1260). The earliest was probably [[Tibors de Sarenom]], who was active in the 1150s (the date of her known composition is uncertain). The latest was either [[Garsenda of Forcalquier]], who died in 1242, though her period of poetic patronage and composition probably occurred a quarter century earlier, or [[Guilleuma de Rosers]], who composed a ''tenso'' with [[Lanfranc Cigala]], known between 1235 and 1257. There exist brief prose biographies\u2014''[[Vida (Occitan literary form)|vidas]]''\u2014for eight trobairitz: [[Almucs de Castelnau]] (actually a ''[[razo]]''), [[Azalais de Porcairagues]], the Comtessa de Dia, Castelloza, [[Iseut de Capio]] (also a ''razo''), Lombarda, [[Maria de Ventadorn]], and Tibors de Sarenom.\n\n==Works==\n\n===Schools and styles===\n\nThree main styles of Occitan lyric poetry have been identified: the ''[[trobar leu]]'' (light), ''[[trobar ric]]'' (rich), and ''[[trobar clus]]'' (closed, [[Hermeticism|hermetic]]). The first was by far the most common: the wording is straightforward and relatively simple compared to the ''ric'' and literary devices are less common than in the ''clus''. This style was the most accessible and it was immensely popular. The most famous poet of the ''trobar leu'' was [[Bernart de Ventadorn]]. The ''trobar clus'' regularly escapes modern scholarly interpretation. Words are commonly used metaphorically and symbolically and what a poem appears to be about on its surface is rarely what is intended by the poet or understood by audiences \"in the know\". The ''clus'' style was invented early by [[Marcabru]] but only favoured by a few masters thereafter. The ''trobar ric'' style is not as opaque as the ''clus'', rather it employs a rich vocabulary, using many words, rare words, invented words, and unusual, colourful wordings.\n\nModern scholars recognise several \"schools\" in the troubadour tradition. Among the earliest is a school of followers of Marcabru, sometimes called the \"Marcabrunian school\": [[Bernart Marti]], [[Bernart de Venzac]], [[Gavaudan]], and [[Peire d'Alvernhe]]. These poets favoured the ''trobar clus'' or ''ric'' or a hybrid of the two. They were often moralising in tone and critical of contemporary courtly society. Another early school, whose style seems to have fallen out of favour, was the \"Gascon school\" of [[Cercamon]], [[Peire de Valeira]], and [[Guiraut de Calanso]]. Cercamon was said by his biographer to have composed in the \"old style\" (''la uzansa antiga'') and Guiraut's songs were ''d'aquella saison'' (\"of that time\"). This style of poetry seems to be attached to early troubadours from [[Gascony]] and was characterised by references to nature: leaves, flowers, birds, and their songs. This Gascon \"literary fad\" was unpopular in [[Provence]] in the early 13th century, harming the reputation of the poets associated with it.\n\nIn the late 13th century a school arose at [[B\u00e9ziers]], once the centre of pre-Albigensian Languedoc and of the Trencavel lordships, in the 1260s\u201380s. Three poets epitomise this \"school\": [[Bernart d'Auriac]], [[Joan Esteve]], [[Joan Miralhas]], and [[Raimon Gaucelm]]. All three were natives of B\u00e9ziers and lived there. All three were members of the urban middle class and no courtesans: Miralhas was possibly a potter and Bernart was a ''mayestre'' (teacher). All three were supporters of the French king [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] and the French aristocracy against the native Occitan nobility. They have been described as \"Gallicised\". Raimon Gaucelm supported the [[Eighth Crusade]] and even wrote a ''planh'', the only known one of its kind, to a burgher of B\u00e9ziers. Joan Esteve and Bernart both composed in support of the French in the [[Aragonese Crusade]]. The B\u00e9ziers are a shining example of the transformation of Occitania in the aftermath of the Albigensian Crusade, but also of the ability of troubadours to survive it.\n\n===Genres===\nTroubadours, at least after their style became established, usually followed some set of \"rules\", like those of the ''[[Leys d'amors]]'' (compiled between 1328 and 1337). Initially all troubadour verses were called simply ''vers'', yet this soon came to be reserved for only love songs and was later replaced by ''canso'', though the term lived on as an antique expression for the troubadours' early works and was even employed with a more technically meaning by the last generation of troubadours (mid-14th century), when it was thought to derive from the Latin word ''verus'' (truth) and was thus used to describe moralising or didactic pieces. The early troubadours developed many genres and these only proliferated as rules of composition came to be put in writing. The known genres are:\n*''[[Alba (poetry)|Alba]]'' (morning song)\u2014 the song of a lover as dawn approaches, often with a watchman warning of the approach of a lady's jealous husband\n*''[[Arlabecca]]''\u2014 a song defined by poetic metre, but perhaps once related to the [[rebec]]\n*''[[Canso (song)|Canso]]'', originally ''vers'', also ''chanso'' or ''can\u00e7o''\u2014 the love song, usually consisting of five or six [[stanza]]s with an [[envoi]]\n*''[[Cobla (Occitan literary term)|Cobla esparsa]]''\u2014 a stand-alone stanza\n*''[[Comiat]]''\u2014 a song renouncing a lover\n*[[Crusade song]] (''canso de crozada'')\u2014 a song about the [[Crusades]], usually encouraging them\n*''[[Dansa]]'' or ''balada''\u2014 a lively dance song with a [[refrain]]\n*''[[Descort]]''\u2014 a song heavily discordant in verse form and/or feeling\n*''[[Desdansa]]''\u2014 a dance designed for sad occasions\n*''[[Devinalh]]''\u2014 a riddle or cryptogram\n*''[[Ensenhamen]]''\u2014 a long didactic poem, usually not divided into stanzas, teaching a moral or practical lesson\n*''[[Enuig]]''\u2014 a poem expressing indignation or feelings of insult\n*''[[Escondig]]''\u2014 a lover's apology\n*''[[Estampida]]''\u2014 a dance-like song\n*''[[Gap (song)|Gap]]''\u2014 a boasting song, often presented as a challenge, often similar to modern sports chants\n*''[[Maldit]]''\u2014 a song complaining about a lady's behaviour and character\n*''[[Partimen]]''\u2014 a poetical exchange between two or more poets in which one is presented with a dilemma by another and responds\n*''[[Pastorela]]''\u2014 the tale of the love request of a [[knight]] to a [[shepherdess]]\n*''[[Planh]]''\u2014 a lament, especially on the death of some important figure\n*''[[Plazer]]''\u2014 a poem expressing pleasure\n*''[[Salut d'amor]]''\u2014 a love letter addressed to another, not always one's lover\n*''[[Serena (song)|Serena]]''\u2014 the song of a lover waiting impatiently for the evening (to consummate his love)\n*''[[Sestina]]''\u2014 highly structured verse form\n*''[[Sirventes]]''\u2014 a political poem or [[satire]], originally put in the mouth of a paid soldier (''sirvens'')\n*[[Sonnet]] (''sonet'')\u2014 an Italian genre imported into Occitan verse in the 13th century\n*''[[Tenso]]''\u2014 a poetical debate which was usually an exchange between two poets, but could be fictional\n*''[[Torneyamen]]''\u2014 a poetical debate between three or more persons, often with a judge (like a tournament)\n*''[[Viadeyra|Viadeira]]''\u2014 a traveller's complaint\n\nAll these genres were highly fluid. A cross between a ''sirventes'' and a ''canso'' was a ''meg-sirventes'' (half-''sirventes'').<ref>Sometimes ''canso-sirventes'' or ''sirventes-canso'' was used. [[Bertran de Born]] uses the term ''miei sirventes''.</ref> A ''tenso'' could be \"invented\" by a single poet; an ''alba'' or ''canso'' could be written with religious significance, addressed to God or the Virgin; and a ''sirventes'' may be nothing more than a political attack. The ''maldit'' and the ''comiat'' were often connected as a ''maldit-comiat'' and they could be used to attack and renounce a figure other than a lady or a lover, like a commanding officer (when combined, in a way, with the ''sirventes'').\n\n[[Peire Bremon Ricas Novas]] uses the term ''mieja chanso'' (half song) and [[Cerver\u00ed de Girona]] uses a similar phrase, ''miga can\u00e7o'', both to refer to a short ''canso'' and not a mixture of genres as sometimes supposed. Cerver\u00ed's ''mig'' (or ''meig'') ''vers e miga can\u00e7o'' was a ''vers'' in the new sense (a moralising song) that was also highly critical and thus combined the ''canso'' and the ''sirventes''. Among the more than one hundred works of Cerver\u00ed de Girona are many songs with unique labels, which may correspond more to \"titles\" than \"genres\", but that is debatable: ''peguesca'' (nonsense), ''espingadura'' ([[flageolet]] song), ''libel'' (legal petition), ''esdemessa'' (leap), ''somni'' (dream), ''acuyndamen'' (challenge), ''desiran\u00e7a'' (nostalgia), ''aniversari'' (anniversary), ''serena'' (serene).<ref>Frank M. Chambers (1985), ''An Introduction to Old Proven\u00e7al Versification'', (Darby, PA: Diane Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87169-167-1}}.), pp. 195\u201396.</ref>\n\nMost \"Crusading songs\" are classified either as ''cansos'' or ''sirventes'' but sometimes separately. Some styles became popular in other languages and in other literary or musical traditions. In [[French literature|French]], the ''alba'' became the ''[[aubade]]'', the ''pastorela'' the ''[[pastourelle]]'', and the ''partimen'' the ''[[jeu parti]]''. The ''sestina'' became popular in [[Italian literature]]. The troubadours were not averse to borrowing either. The ''planh'' developed out of the Latin ''[[planctus]]'' and the sonnet was stolen from the [[Sicilian School]]. The [[basse danse]] (''bassa dansa'') was first mentioned in the troubadour tradition (c. 1324), but only as being performed by jongleurs.\n\n[[File:BnF ms. 854 fol. 135 - Le moine de Montaudon (1).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Monge de Montaudon]] receiving a [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrow hawk]] as a prize for his performance in a contest]]\n\n===Performance===\nTroubadours performed their own songs. Jongleurs (performers) and ''cantaires'' (singers) also performed troubadours' songs. They could work from [[chansonnier]]s, many of which have survived, or possibly from more rudimentary (and temporary) songbooks, none of which have survived, if they even existed. Some troubadours, like [[Arnaut de Maruelh]], had their own jongleurs who were dedicated to singing their patron's work. Arnaut's ''joglar et cantaire'', probably both a singer and a messenger, who carried his love songs to his lady, was [[Pistoleta]]. The messenger was commonplace in troubadour poetry; many songs reference a messenger who will bring it to its intended ear. A troubadour often stayed with a noble patron of his own and entertained his court with his songs. Court songs could be used not only as entertainment but also as propaganda, praising the patron, mocking his enemies, encouraging his wars, teaching ethics and etiquette, and maintaining religious unity.\n\nThe court was not the only venue for troubadour performance. Competitions were held from an early date. According to the ''vida'' of the [[Monge de Montaudon]], he received a [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrow hawk]], a prized hunting bird, for his poetry from the ''cour du Puy'', some sort of poetry society associated with the court of [[Alfonso II of Aragon]]. The most famous contests were held in the twilight of the troubadours in the 14th and 15th centuries. The ''[[jocs florals]]'' held by the [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] at [[Toulouse]], by [[Peter IV of Aragon]] at [[Lleida]], and the [[Consistori de Barcelona|Consistori de la Gaya Sci\u00e8ncia]] at [[Barcelona]] awarded floral prizes to the best poetry in various categories, judging it by its accordance with a code called the ''[[Leys d'amors]]''.\n\nTroubadour songs are still performed and recorded today, albeit rarely.\n{{Listen|filename=A Chantar2.ogg|title=A chantar m'er|description=The only existing song by a ''trobairitz'' which survives with music.|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\n===Music===\nTroubadour songs were usually [[monophony|monophonic]]. Fewer than 300 melodies out of an estimated 2500 survive.<ref>''The Grove Concise Dictionary of Music'' edited by Stanley Sadie. Macmillan Press Ltd., London.</ref> Most were composed by the troubadours themselves. Some were set to pre-existing pieces of music. [[Raimbaut de Vaqueyras]] wrote his ''Kalenda maya'' (\"The Calends of May\") to music composed by jongleurs at [[Montferrat]].\n\n===Grammars and dictionaries===\nBeginning in the early 13th century, the spread of Occitan verse demanded grammars and dictionaries, especially for those whose native tongue was not Occitan, such as the Catalan and Italian troubadours, and their imitators. The production of such works only increased with the academisation of the troubadour lyric in the 14th century.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Translation of title\n!Author\n!Date, place\n!Character\n|-\n|''Razos de trobar''\n|\"Explanations of composition\"\n|[[Raimon Vidal]]\n|c. 1210\n|[[File:Razos de Trobar.jpg|right|75px]] Prose guide to poetic composition that defends the superiority of Occitan over other vernaculars.

They are largely preserved in songbooks called ''[[chansonnier]]s'' made for wealthy patrons.\n\nTroubadour songs are generally referred to by their [[incipit]]s, that is, their opening lines. If this is long, or after it has already been mentioned, an abbreviation of the incipit may be used for convenience. A few troubadour songs are known by \"nicknames\", thus ''D'un sirventes far'' by [[Guilhem Figueira]] is commonly called the ''Sirventes contra Roma''. When a writer seeks to avoid using unglossed Occitan, the incipit of the song may be given in translation instead or a title may even be invented to reflect the theme of the work. Especially in translations designed for a popular audience, such as Ezra Pound's, English titles are commonly invented by the translator/editor. There are examples, however, of troubadour songs given Occitan titles in the manuscripts, such as an anonymous ''pastorela'' that begins ''Mentre per una ribeira'', which is entitled ''Porquieira''.\n\n===Table of chansonniers===\nThe number of Occitan parchment chansonniers given as extant varies between authors, depending on how they treat fragmentary and multilingual manuscripts. Conventionally, fragments are classified as fragments of the surviving chansonnier they most closely resemble and not as chansonniers in their own right. Some chansonniers have received both Occitan and French letters: troubadour D is trouv\u00e8re H, W is M and X is U. The lettering (''siglas'') was introduced by [[Karl Bartsch]], who placed sources he considered more reliable higher in the alphabet. This system is imperfect, however, since many of the chansonniers produced for an Italian audience are heavily edited and do not necessarily more closely resemble the original compositions. While parchment chansonniers are more durable, paper ones also exist and have received lower-case ''siglas''.<ref>Gaunt and Kay, \"Appendix 4\", 303\u201304.</ref><ref>Paden, \"Manuscripts\", in Akehurst and Davis, 329.</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Image\n!Troubadour manuscript letter (''sigla'')\n!Provenance (place of origin, date)\n!Location (library, city)\n!Shelf mark\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[File:Perdigon's vida, miniature, and canso, MS A.jpg|75px]]\n|A\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>13th century\n|[[Biblioteca Vaticana]],<br>[[Rome]]\n|Latin 5232\n|\n|-\n|\n|B\n|[[Occitania]],<br>13th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 1592\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Chansonnier C.jpg|75px]]\n|C\n|[[Occitania]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 856\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Peire dela Cauarana and Peire de Gauaret.jpg|75px]]\n|D\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>12 August 1254\n|[[Biblioteca Estense]],<br>[[Modena]]\n|Kg.4.MS2=E.45=\u03b1.R.4.4\n|The ''[[Poetarum Provinciali]]''.\n|-\n|\n|E\n|[[Occitania]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 1749\n|\n|-\n|\n|F\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioteca Vaticana]],<br>[[Rome]]\n|Chigi L.IV.106\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Chansonnier G.jpg|75px]]\n|G\n|[[Lombardy]] or [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]],<br>late 13th century\n|[[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]],<br>[[Milan]]\n|R 71 sup.\n|Contains troubadour music.\n|-\n|\n|H\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>late 13th century\n|[[Biblioteca Vaticana]],<br>[[Rome]]\n|Latin 3207\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Jaufre rudel.jpg|75px]]\n|I\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>13th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 854\n|\n|-\n|\n|J\n|[[Occitania]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Firenze|Biblioteca Nazionale]],<br>[[Florence]]\n|Conventi Soppressi F.IV.776\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Azala\u00efs de Porcairagues - BN MS12473 1.jpg|75px]]\n|K\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>13th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 12473\n|\n|-\n|\n|L\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioteca Vaticana]],<br>[[Rome]]\n|Latin 3206\n|\n|-\n|\n|M\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 12474\n|\n|-\n|\n|N\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>14th century\n|[[Pierpont Morgan Library|Pierpont Morgan]],<br>[[New York City|New York]]\n|819\n|The [[Philipps Manuscript]].\n|-\n|\n|O\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioteca Vaticana]],<br>[[Rome]]\n|Vat.Lat. 3208\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Raimon Guillem and Ferrarino da Ferrara.jpg|75px]]\n|P\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>1310\n|[[Biblioteca Laurenziana]],<br>[[Florence]]\n|XLI.42\n|\n|-\n|\n|Q\n|[[Lombardy]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioteca Riccardiana]],<br>[[Florence]]\n|2909\n|\n|-\n|[[File:Song of Guiraut Riquier.jpg|75px]]\n|R\n|[[Toulouse|Toulousain]] or [[Rouergue]],<br>14th century\n|[[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]],<br>[[Paris]]\n|BN f.f. 22543\n|Contains more troubadour music than any other manuscript.
