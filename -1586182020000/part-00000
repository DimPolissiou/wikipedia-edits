Annual, published mainly under the Fleetway imprint, continued to appear every year: the final Annual, cover-dated 1976, was published in the autumn of 1975.\n\nDuring 1967 and 1968 ''Smash!'' was part of Odhams' [[Power Comics]] line (from #44 to #143), absorbing its sister titles ''[[Pow! (comics)|Pow!]]'' on 14 September 1968 (issue&nbsp;137) and ''[[Fantastic (comics)|Fantastic]]'' on 2 November 1968 (issue&nbsp;144). As ''Pow!'' and ''Fantastic'' had themselves already merged with ''[[Wham! (comics)|Wham!]]'' and ''[[Terrific (comics)|Terrific]]'' respectively, ''Smash!'' became the last survivor of the ''Power Comics''.\n\nUntil March 1969, alongside British humour strips, it included black-and-white reprints of superhero strips originally published in America by [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics|DC]]. The last of these, the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', ended in issue&nbsp;162. Thereafter it featured solely British content: a mixture of humour, sporting and adventure strips.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2008/01/crikey-its-another-hit-and-miss-issue.html|title=BLIMEY!

The ''Fleetway'' name, a holdover from AP, was used to identify that part of IPC's comics publishing arm which derived from AP.

The ''Power Comics'' logo, printed on the cover of each issue, was a gimmick dreamed up by Odhams to unify their five titles under a common banner. ''Smash'' remained part of that lineup for 100 issues; the logo was quietly dropped after #143 when the last of the other comics forming part of the lineup was cancelled (so that there was no longer a group of titles needing to be unified).\n\nThe other Power Comics were all ultimately absorbed into ''Smash'', which became the last survivor. On 14 September 1968, with issue 137, it merged with ''[[Pow! (comics)|Pow!]]'' (which had previously absorbed ''[[Wham! (comics)|Wham]]''), becoming ''Smash and Pow''. On 2 November 1968, with issue&nbsp;144, it merged with ''[[Fantastic (comics)|Fantastic]]'' (which had previously absorbed ''[[Terrific (comics)|Terrific]]''), becoming ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic''.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=3 Covers Gallery for 1968] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' ceased to be published by Odhams Press Ltd, and was thereafter published by IPC Magazines Ltd (an IPC subsidiary formed during 1968). On 15 March 1969 it was relaunched without its American superhero strips. Further changes followed during the course of 1969, and then a 2nd relaunch at the start of 1970.

Holiday Special in 1971.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1966 the initial success of ''Wham!'' (which had launched in 1964 and quickly built up strong circulation figures) encouraged Odhams' London management to publish a second title, conceived by Alf Wallace (Managing Editor of Odhams' juveniles \u2014 ''Eagle'', ''Swift'' and ''Boy's World'') and Albert Cosser.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984)</ref> Leo Baxendale, who had created ''Wham!'' for Odhams in 1964, was too heavily embroiled with on-going production on it, providing much of the art for each issue, so had little time for anything else. Also, Baxendale was then still working at long range from Dundee.<ref>DC Thompson Ltd, Baxendale's former employers, were based in Dundee, Scotland</ref>\n\nAccordingly, it was Alf Wallace and Albert Cosser (soon to be known to their young audience as Alf and Cos) who determined the initial format of ''Smash!''. They also recruited the artists who would draw the early issues, as it was plain that Baxendale was fully occupied with the art for ''Wham!''. Baxendale's initial contribution to ''Smash'' was thus limited to providing a list of titles and situations for the humour strips, together with brief written scenarios (script ideas for the individual weekly issues), which he gave to Wallace to be farmed-out to other artists. ''The Swots and The Blots'' was one of these.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984),p.4-5</ref>\n\nBaxendale was asked only to create the ''Bad Penny'' strip, and to give ''Grimly Feendish'' (a character from his ''Eagle Eye, Junior Spy'' strip then running in ''Wham!'') a strip of his own. Wallace also had Baxendale draw the covers for the first three issues.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\"/>\n\n''Smash'' launched with the same format as the early issues of ''Wham'', namely 24 pages per issue, four of which were in colour; but it was printed on lower-quality paper than ''Wham''.\n\nThe initial line-up of strips mixed humour and adventure freely, with the comedic ''Ronnie Rich'' featuring on the cover of the first issue, inside which were adventure strips including the World War Two based ''Ghost Patrol'' \u2014 this latter a reprint strip which lasted only until issue 25. ''Ghost Patrol'' proved symptomatic of the problem with adventure strips which plagued ''Smash'' during the Odhams years, which tended to be ''sloppy in presentation and possessed of little real character or emotion''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984), p.6</ref>\n\nThe root of the problem with ''Smash'' was that it went through many changes in its early days \u2014 far too many. Particularly in its adventure strips: ''The Ghost Patrol'' came and went; ''The Legend Testers'' came and went; ''Moon Madness'' was particularly short-lived; and there were numerous others, equally forgettable. None proved popular enough to last.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref> Undeniably, none enjoyed the tremendous popularity of the American superhero strips which the comic would shortly feature, which genuinely had sufficient popularity to rival that of television.<ref>Marvel Comics as an independent UK publisher, in the 1970s, demonstrated that their superhero comics were capable of strong sales even in the face of competition from the newest rival -- colour television. ''Smash'' might have survived into that 1970s era of colour tv if it could have managed to retain its popular superhero strips.</ref>\n\nThose readers old enough to have become emotionally attached to comics before Odhams introduced American superhero strips to British readers tended to dislike those superhero strips.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref> Whereas, according to the letters pages each week, those same Marvel and DC heroes were enormously popular among the younger age group which had not been reading comics previously. Accordingly, ''Wham'' readers tended to resent the changes made in 1966, because British strips were cancelled in ''Wham'' and replaced with US superheroes, whereas ''Smash'' readers did not resent the superheroes, because in 1966 that comic had only just launched, so there were no real changes \u2014 ''Smash'' more or less teemed with American strips from the very beginning.\n\nThe decision, in 1969, to discontinue the American superhero strips was the real cause of the comic's demise. Other problems would contribute to the difficulties it subsequently faced - including strikes at its Printers - but the root cause of those problems was the falling circulation it suffered as a consequence of not having any unique elements to distinguish it from other IPC comics such as ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''. The superheroes were the only element which genuinely had the necessary popularity to halt the decline in weekly sales caused by the competition from television.\n\n==Odhams Years==\n===Superheroes===\nBlack-and-white reprints of [[Marvel Comics]] strips<ref>All the Marvel stories were written by Stan Lee</ref> were introduced into ''Smash'' with issue&nbsp;16, when the ''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' began.<ref>Issue 16 saw the first appearance of Marvel's ''[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=1 Incredible Hulk]'' strip, drawn by [[Jack Kirby]]</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html|title=BLIMEY!

In July&nbsp;1967 ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''<ref>Drawn at various times by Bill Everett, Wally Wood and Gene Colan</ref> replaced the Hulk, from issue&nbsp;76 onwards \u2014 ''Smash'' having exhausted all Hulk stories, from all sources, which had been published in the USA up to that time.\n\nIt's hard to overstate the significance of the introduction of ''The Hulk'', in the issue dated 21 May 1966. It was the first ''Marvel Comics'' strip featured by Odhams, the success of which led to the introduction of ''Fantastic Four'' into ''Wham'' on 6 August of that year, and to the launching of two entire comics entirely dedicated to Marvel superheroes \u2014 ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' \u2014 in 1967. The Hulk's initial appearance in ''Smash'' took up a massive 6 pages, one-quarter of each 24 page issue, pushing fully five existing strips out of that issue, and causing the permanent cancellation of \"Space Jinx\" and \"Brian's Brain\" (although the latter would be revived much later).<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.11</ref>\n\nPrior to this, [[DC Comics|DC]]'s ''[[Batman (comic strip)|Batman]]'' had become the second American superhero to debut in ''Smash'', crashing onto the front cover of issue&nbsp;20 a month after the Hulk's debut, in re-edited reprints from American daily and Sunday newspaper strips: these were credited in-page to ''Batman'' creator Bob Kane, but were actually drawn by [[Al Plastino]] and ghost-written by [[Whitney Ellsworth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/issue/368494/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Smash! #75|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> This was a response to the sudden and enormous popularity of the ''Batman'' television series starring Adam West. The impact of this hit TV show led to the ''Batman'' strip retaining the front cover of ''Smash'', in colour, for better than a year and a half, entitled ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder''.\n\nInitially, this syndicated newspaper strip adopted the camp style of the Adam West television series, with appearances by humorous guest stars such as American funnyman [[Jack Benny]]. In the later part of the run (which featured serious, rather than camp, stories) Batgirl, too, appeared in the strip, a response to her addition to the TV show in its 3rd season: in the newspaper strip, Batman initially believed her to be a criminal rather than a crime fighter. Superman then co-starred in the strip, which was retitled ''Superman and Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'', as Batman and Robin attempt to save Superman from the diabolical Professor Zinkk who was secretly poisoning him with kryptonite.\n\nThe expansion of the American content, with the arrival of ''Batman'', meant the loss of two more of the initial British strips: the adventure strip ''The Ghost Patrol'', and the cartoon strip ''The Tellybugs''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\"/>\n\nIn September 1968 the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' began a six-month run in ''Smash'', when it absorbed ''Pow'' (which had previously merged with ''Wham'', in which the strip had initially featured). As one of only a handful of ''Pow'' strips to survive the merger, it was used to lure ''Pow'' readers to the new comic. The strip was introduced to readers of ''Smash'' with the wedding of Reed and Sue from ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3. Their adventures continued with ''Defeated by the Frightful Four'', and ran through to ''Lo There Shall Be an Ending'', which was the final Marvel strip to appear in ''Smash''.\n\n''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' began a short run in November 1968 when ''Smash'' absorbed ''Fantastic''. The stories, continued from ''Fantastic'', began with ''The Ringmaster's Circus of Crime''. When the Marvel strips were discontinued the following spring, the final ''Thor'' reprint had a new ending substituted, in a rushed attempt to resolve a continuing sub-plot.\n\nThe financial crisis which overtook Odhams in 1968, resulting in the closure of all the other ''Power Comics'', also caused them to give up the expensive licence to reprint the Marvel superhero stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/marvuk.htm|title=Marvel UK|website=www.internationalhero.co.uk}}</ref> This decision took effect in March&nbsp;1969, when the licence came up for renewal; the final Marvel strips appeared in issue&nbsp;162. The expensive ''Batman'' newspaper strip had already been discontinued, ending in issue&nbsp;157.\n\n===Odhams Humour Strips===\nThere were typically a dozen British humour strips in each of the first 162 issues.\n\nThe initial line-up starred ''The Man From B.U.N.G.L.E.'', which usually occupied the front cover prior to issue&nbsp;20,<ref>''Smash'': [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html The first 20 covers]</ref> supported by seven other long-running humour strips (''Charlie's Choice'',<ref name=\"Brian Lewis\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Brian Lewis]</ref> ''Bad Penny'',<ref name=\"Leo Baxendale\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Leo Baxendale]</ref> ''Percy's Pets'',<ref>Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> ''The Nervs'',<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html|title=BLIMEY!

It is unclear why Alf and Cos chose this deeply unfunny strip for what must have been considered the pride of place in the new comic. ''Space Jinx'' was primarily another ''Jonah'' (a strip by Ken Reid which had run in ''The Beano''), except that it could not hold its own against the brilliance of Reid's sea-faring twit. Where ''Jonah'' dealt with sinking ships of the sea, Brian Lewis's ''Space Jinx'' dealt with similar situations in outer space, but (in practice) without the necessary degree of humour.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.7</ref>\n\nKen Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' would last only slightly longer, at 43 issues. A masterpiece of comic artistry, telling the story of the ''Buoyant Queen'' and its two-man crew, Enoch and Bert, a pair of oafs with a love/hate relationship (mostly hate!), it was perhaps too intelligent for its target audience \u2014 its disappearance was a great loss to the comic.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> Many readers failed to understand, amongst many things in the strip that went clear over their heads, that the two main characters were drawn in the likeness of comedians [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]], and that the strip's humour was based on the movies of Laurel & Hardy.\n\nAfter only five months \u2013 foreshadowing many, many reshuffles to come \u2013 ''Smash!'' underwent its first major overhaul: from issue&nbsp;20 the ''Batman'' newspaper strip took over the front cover, whilst ''Grimly Feendish'' lost the colour back cover to Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' (which shrank from its original two pages each week to only a single page \u2014 the loss of the extra page was a drawback, but was compensated for by the strip now having a more prestigious location in the comic, and of course by now being in colour).\n\nFurther cover changes would follow. When, after two years, the popularity of the ''Batman'' television series eventually faded, from issue&nbsp;114 onward Batman and Robin were moved to the inside pages, yielding the front cover to the long-running success ''The Swots and the Blots'', at this point still being drawn by Mike Lacey, a humour strip in which two rival gangs vied to outwit each other at Pond Road School, with \"Teach\" caught in the crossfire. Its origins lay in Baxendale's classroom-based strip ''The Tiddlers'', which had then been running for 2 years in ''Wham''<ref>In fact it was a direct continuation of ''[https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/wham/ The Tiddlers]'', with only a change of name. The characters (i.e. \"Teach\" and the Blots), school buildings, and situations, were all largely as they had been in ''The Tiddlers''. The only difference was the addition of the Swots, so that Teach now had an ally.</ref> (and which continued in ''Pow'' when ''Wham'' merged with it in 1968, where it was combined with ''The Dolls of St Dominics'' to become ''The Tiddlers and The Dolls'').\n\n''The Swots and the Blots'' was one of the few strips in ''Smash'' to survive all the changes of 1969 and 1970, reaching a new standard of excellence when [[Leo Baxendale]] began drawing it for the new-look ''Smash'' from March 1969, but even during the Odhams years it had wit and a sense of style. In Baxendale's hands it had notable similarities to his earlier classroom-based strip, ''The Bash Street Kids'', in ''[[The Beano]]''.<ref>Around 1968, Baxendale quit Odhams for the better paying ''Fleetway'' comics. One of the strips he produced there was ''[http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2017/07/leo-baxendales-big-chief-pow-wow.html Big Chief Pow Wow]'' for ''Buster''\u2014the strip ran from 14 September 1968 to 31 January 1970 (some issues were fill-ins by other artists).</ref>\n\n''The Man from BUNGLE'', spoofing the popular TV series ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', was a spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye Junior Spy'' strip in ''Wham''. BUNGLE was a secret spy organisation in Britain, organised along more chaotic lines than UNCLE, featuring a secret agent who employed a wide variety of hugely unlikely gadgets in his fight against his humorous opponents. Baxendale himself drew the first few editions, which appeared as large single illustrations on some of the early covers of ''Smash'', after which Mike Lacey took over.\n\nThe second spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye'' strip was ''[[Grimly Feendish]]'' (subtitled ''The Rottenest Crook in the World''), which Leo Baxendale himself drew. Feendish had been the most popular character in the earlier strip, thanks to his ghoulish appearance, which was based on Uncle Fester in the American television series ''[[The Addams Family]]'' (and, presumably, on Charles Adams' illustrations from which the TV series was derived).<ref>Interestingly, the strip would probably have been ''banned'' if this had been an American comic, as the [[Comics Code Authority]] prohibited presentation of crime in comics if it tended to create sympathy for the criminal, and this strip appears to fall foul of that restriction.</ref> The new strip at one point occupied a prestigious position, as the full-colour back cover feature each week, and survived throughout the entire run of 162 issues published by Odhams (even though, after giving up its cover status, it was sometimes ignominiously reduced to only a quarter-page \"filler\").\n\n''Bad Penny'' was another memorable Baxendale creation. Its title logo featured a portrait of Penny herself, alongside the 'Bad Penny' caption, and an illustration of a giant pre-decimal One Penny coin (the coin suggesting the connection with the proverb from which the character's name originated).\n\nShe had some similarities with Baxendale's earlier Minnie the Minx character in ''The Beano''. When he had been drawing Minnie, he had concentrated on experimenting with facial expressions and character traits. By the time he began working on ''Bad Penny'' his drawing style had matured, with an equal concentration on developing a zany but tight storyline, less emphasis on close-ups of facial expressions, but retaining the essentials needed to put over a character's own personality traits.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\"/>\n\nBad Penny was so popular that she survived the changes of 1969, and continued to appear in the new ''Smash''. When the strip was eventually dropped, in 1970, Bad Penny herself still continued to appear, albeit infrequently, making occasional appearances in Baxendale's ''The Swots and the Blots'' as a new member of the Blots.\n\nAs had happened in ''Wham'', artists such as Mike Lacey were commissioned from time to time to \"ghost\" Baxendale's style. Baxendale was allowed to sign his early work on ''Smash'', so there is a way to distinguish which strips he personally drew during his time at Odhams.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075207/http://26pigs.com/wham/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Wham!|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref><ref>In practice, Baxendale signed very few of his strips, so it is quite difficult to tell which are his and which are other artists substituting for him.</ref> After he transferred to Fleetway, another IPC subsidiary, he still contributed strips to ''Smash'', but now worked \"undercover\", i.e. without signing them. He explained this in his autobiography, ''A Very Funny Business'' (Duckworth, 1978, page&nbsp;91): \"I was in a delightful situation. Working under my own name, a lot was expected of me. Publishers ''expected'' me to cram my drawings with funny detail. A double standard operated. Working undercover, I was able to reduce the layouts to the simplest terms. Backgrounds were minimal or non-existent \u2014 just a horizon line. And there was no ancillary comic detail \u2014 just the characters acting out the story line against an empty backdrop.\"\n\nThe most bizarre of the Odhams humour strips was ''The Nervs'', depicting a group of little characters inhabiting a schoolboy called Fatty: the strip showed them running Fatty like a group of workers running a factory. Allocated two pages, it followed the same formula as the strip ''Georgie's Germs'' from ''Wham!''. Fatty was aptly named, with the tiny Nervs battling to save the fat twerp's stomach from its numerous overloads, as a minute never passed which was free from him guzzling!\n\nDrawn for the majority of its run by Graham Allen,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> in its final months during 1968-69 [[Ken Reid (comics artist)|Ken Reid]]<ref>Comics artist [http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Ken%20Reid Ken Reid]</ref> \u2014 previously of ''Queen of the Seas'', and who had earlier contributed the ''Dare-a-Day Davy''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/dadd.htm|title=Ken Reid's Dare A Day Davy|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> strip to ''Pow'' \u2014 drew this double-page feature.\n\nReid's career had begun at ''The Beano'' in the 1950s, but for Odhams he had already produced the long running success ''Frankie Stein'', in ''Wham!'', before taking on ''Queen of the Seas'' in the early issues of ''Smash!'' and the  ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip in ''Pow!''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> He turned ''The Nervs'' into an extremely surreal, even visceral, strip; achieving a rare level of hilarity and bawdiness, in a subversive presentation of comical horror \u2014 and in the process alarming IPC's management !<ref name=\"Career history of artist Ken Reid\"/>\n\nHe already had some degree of notoriety, as being the only Odhams artist whose work so disturbed the management that it was actually banned.<ref>[http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/weird1.html Review] of the banned ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' Frankenstein strip</ref><ref>''Dare-A-Day Davy'' [http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/picts2.html Frankenstein strip], published in ''Weird Fantasy''&nbsp;#1 in 1969</ref> At the suggestion of Vance Gledhill of Blackpool, Davy was dared to dig up Frankenstein's monster (in the ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip) and bring him back to life \u2013 for which Reid decided to employ the \"kiss of life\"!

This was a device for featuring, as guest stars in the strip each week, an assortment of popular TV stars. The strip's debut appearance, for instance, featured Robert Vaughn and David McCallum, stars of top-rated secret agent show ''The Man From UNCLE'', maximising their appearance by splashing them across the front cover. It was hoped that by bringing popular television stars into its pages, this would make TV's growing popularity work ''for'' the comic \u2014 a not very subtle ploy to boost its circulation and sales.\n\n''Sammy Shrink'' (subtitled ''The Smallest Boy in the World'')<ref name=\"auto3\"/> was a humour strip about a boy who was only two inches tall. Sammy had the most successful \u2014 but also the most chequered \u2014 career of all the characters featured in ''Smash'', having originated in ''Wham'', then moved to ''Pow'' when they merged, arriving in ''Smash'' when it in turn absorbed ''Pow'', and would subsequently be revived in ''Knockout'', finally ending his career in ''Whizzer and Chips'' when it absorbed ''Knockout'' in June&nbsp;1973.\n\n''Ronnie Rich'' featured the richest kid in the world, who stands to inherit a fortune if only he can get rid of the money he's got. Drawn by Gordon Hogg,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> each week Ronnie spent his every last penny, in some reckless or extravagant way, only to have his scheme backfire and make him richer than ever. He never did get his hands on the fortune.\n\nOften a half-page feature, ''Percy's Pets'' drawn by Stan McMurtry (alias Mac)<ref>Comics artist [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1040731/Macs-secret-lady-Britains-cartoonist-reveals-hidden-images-wife.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> was popular enough to go on to make sporadic reappearances from time to time in the new ''Smash'' after March&nbsp;1969. Percy was a small plump schoolboy, who filled his family's home with his exotic collection of pets. These included (from time to time) an elephant, a giraffe, a hippopotamus, a snake, an ape \u2014 in fact almost every type of animal that might be found in a typical zoo \u2014 together with a parrot, a tortoise, a white mouse, and a hedgehog; thereby causing a predictable degree of comical chaos for his long suffering mum and dad.\n\nSome of the best-remembered strips were not included in all of the first 162 issues: a number of them were only acquired in #137, from the merger with ''Pow!'' (which had already absorbed the most popular strips running in ''Wham!'').\n\nOne such acquisition from ''Pow!'' was ''The Cloak''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/cloak.htm|title=Mike Higgs' The Cloak|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> \u2014 like ''The Man From BUNGLE'', another humorous secret agent strip. The Cloak was the top agent for Britain's Special Squad, nominally a part of Scotland Yard; but he usually operated from his personal headquarters, known as the Secret Sanctum. His ingenuity and never-ending supply of gadgets and secret weapons gave him the edge over his somewhat odd enemies (some were ''very'' odd, including Deathshead and various other agents of G.H.O.U.L.).\n\nHe had some equally odd colleagues. Assisted initially by Mole (the tall one with the bald head, big nose and specs) and Shortstuff (the short squirt with the hairy nut and big eyeballs), he then began having adventures in which he found himself also alongside the sexy and flirtatious Lady Shady, the shady lady. The strip benefited from the unusual, idiosyncratic drawing style of Mike Higgs, whose overt inclusion of pop culture imagery made the strip seem extremely modern.\n\n''Wiz War'', drawn by Mike Brown, had also begun in ''Pow!'', and would be one of a handful of strips to survive the changes of 1969. Brown seems to have been unaware of the house rule banning artists from signing their work, as the strip often bore his name. The \"War\" in the title referred to a feud between two wizards, Wizard Prang and his enemy Demon Druid. Being a humour strip, the editorial staff allowed the hero the very silly name of Wizard Prang, a piece of RAF slang from the Second World War.\n\nOther than the fact that Prang was robed entirely in white, befitting his status as the good guy, and Demon Druid was always in black, being the villain of the piece, their costumes were quite similar - a flowing wizard's robe with stars on, and a pointed hat. They would fly around on broomsticks, zapping each other with spells: which turned the other into a toad, or something equally amusing. Wizard Prang was alternately helped and hindered by Englebert, his pet bird. The best feature of the strip was the sign above Wizard Prang's front door. This usually read \"Wizard Prang is... In\" (if he was at home) or \"Wizard Prang is... Out\" (if he was out and about); but if he'd had a bad time in the story, the sign would often make a humorous remark in the final panel, such as \"Wizard Prang is... All At Sea\".\n\nThe secret of Mike Brown, unacknowledged for many years, was that Leo Baxendale needed to earn money from Odhams without disclosing to Fleetway that he was now working for both companies. Accordingly, Baxendale now pencilled the drawings, and Brown, who was a cartoon film animator, inked them in. In this way, they turned out together large numbers of ''Bad Penny'' and ''Grimly Feendish'' strips, which they sold to Odhams under Brown's name \u2014 a situation Baxendale referred to, in his 1978 autobiography, as working ''undercover''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984),p.10</ref>\n\nLost in the merger with ''Pow'' were ''Charlie's Choice'', ''Ronnie Rich'' and ''The Man From BUNGLE''. Also lost in this merger, in effect, was Ken Reid's ''Dare-A-Day Davey'' strip, one of several established features in ''Pow'' which were dropped instead of transferring to ''Smash''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.15</ref>\n\n===Odhams Adventure Strips===\n\nAs ''Smash'' was essentially a superhero and humour comic during the Odhams years, there were few traditional adventure strips in it; but a handful do bear special mention.\n\nThere were various well-remembered adventure strips in the first hundred issues, including some which were quite outstanding, such as ''Rubberman'', ''Experiment X'', ''The Legend Testers'', and ''The Python''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nFrom issue 144 in November 1968 ''Smash'' was the only surviving ''Power Comic'', as this was the issue in which ''Smash and Pow'' (as it then was) merged with ''Fantastic''. Five British adventure serials were introduced in this issue, to plug the gap left by the loss of the withdrawn American superhero strips which had been major features of the four closed titles.\n\n''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' is an adventure strip in which a crime reporter on the Daily Globe newspaper is apparently killed while investigating a news story. The world believes newspaperman Jim Jordan is dead, but he still carries on his crusade against crime... calling himself The Spectre.\n\nHe is now fighting crime, rather than merely reporting it, using an array of gadgets which make it seem he is the ghost of the missing reporter. Hence his opponents are terrified to find that if they shoot him he doesn't die (a bullet-proof raincoat was the trick here). And he has a secret underground hideout beneath the statue erected in his memory, from which he would covertly and unexpectedly emerge, or disappear into, under cover of an artificial fog, to give the impression he was coming and going from the spirit world. His first case began in issue&nbsp;144, in which he tracks down Black Murdo, the racketeer who the world believes had murdered him.\n\n''Destination Danger'', a motor racing serial, also began in issue&nbsp;144. This strip was about a feud between a young English racing driver, Jeff Jackson, who was working for Puma Motors in the US, and his enemy Vic Stafford, the Puma team's chief driver, who has taken a bribe to throw a forthcoming race.\n\nAlthough new to ''Smash'', the old-fashioned artwork in the strips ''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' and ''Destination Danger'' marked them out as reprints. The use of reprints was a cost-cutting measure, indicating the straightened financial circumstances of ''Smash'' at this point \u2013 if any evidence were needed beyond the closure of all four of the other ''Power Comics''.\n\n''Laird of the Apes'' was a science fiction strip, milking the popularity of the big budget Charlton Heston motion picture ''Planet of the Apes'' which was released earlier that year. In the strip, set in the 18th century, a young Scottish laird returns to the Highlands to aid his outlaw clansmen in their struggle with the English Redcoats, bringing with him a band of highly trained Apes.\n\nAn adventure strip with a sporting theme was the wrestling serial ''King of the Ring'', featuring Ken King, who was a champion of the grunt-'n'-grapple game (although in the earliest strips he had begun as a boxer). As was not exactly uncommon in the Odhams years, there was a tendency to give the characters very silly names. The most outrageous example in this strip was King's manager, who (in spite of ''not'' being Irish) was called Blarney Stone!\n\nBlarney's real name was originally Tim Stone, and Blarney was only a nickname; but this was soon forgotten. In order to fulfil Ken's ambition to travel, Blarney agrees to manage him on a world tour, if he'll agree to fight his way round the world!\n\nThe fifth adventure strip added was ''Brian's Brain'', drawn by Bert Vandeput,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> a serial with science fiction elements, continued from ''Pow''. This featured two schoolboys: the eponymous Brian and his friend Duffy Rolls. Brian Kingsley possessed an electronic Brain resembling a human skull, which he carried about in a box. It could communicate with him telepathically, glowing when active; and it could control the actions of animals if they were within a few yards, which was the limit of its brain-wave transmissions.\n\nAll five strips commenced in issue&nbsp;144; and all were serials, with cliff-hanger endings each week.\n\n===The Closure of the ''Power Comics''===\nWhat must always be born in mind is that, in the comics industry, the 1960s were not the 1930s. With the advent in Britain of commercial television, in 1955 \u2014 displacing the staid, old-fashioned children's television offered by the BBC up to that point \u2014 the ever-increasing competition from the ''boob-tube'' began a continuous (and accelerating) decline in comics circulation. Throughout the 1960s, in consequence, the circulation wars fought in the comics publishing industry were fought out against a backdrop of ever-declining circulation figures.\n\nFollowing the initial success of ''Wham'' in 1964, Odhams had launched four more [[Power Comics]] during 1966 and '67, including ''Smash'', only to close them in quick succession: merging each in turn into the survivors until by 1969 only ''Smash'' remained. Whereas 1968 began with all five ''Power Comics'' apparently flourishing, by the year's end only ''Smash'' was still being published.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\"/> Even the sleepiest of readers began to notice that something was seriously wrong, as the increasingly frantic series of mergers resulted in ever more ludicrous titles, culminating in the astonishing ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic'' (commonly spoofed as ''Smash, Pow, Wham, incorporating Fantastic and Terrific'').\n\nThe question is why, in a limited market such as the UK, they took such a big risk as to launch five titles (which in hindsight looks an unwise decision by the Odhams management), if it was so quickly obvious that the market could only support one? It has been suggested<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> that it was common practice for a publisher to quickly clone a successful title, in order to forestall its competitors from doing so. That does not seem to be the case here. The comic's only distinctive feature was its American superhero strips, so ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' (which most of the time contained ''only'' Marvel superhero strips) might loosely be described as clones of ''Smash'', even though they lacked any humour strips; but IPC had an ''exclusive'' licence from Marvel Comics to reprint Marvel's strips in the UK, which precluded anyone else from doing so.\n\nThe actual answer lies in the unexpected nature of the economic crisis of 1968 that hit the British economy, resulting in the devaluation of the Pound.<ref>In Britain, the devaluation crisis was major news due to certain ill-judged remarks by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who would be mocked for the rest of his career for his infamous falsehood, ''This will not affect the Pound in your pocket!''</ref> The economic chaos began with a Sterling crisis in Britain in 1967, leading to devaluation in the November. There then followed a crisis for the U.S. dollar in March&nbsp;1968 which had a cascade effect on the international economic system, sending first the French franc and then the West German deutschmark into devaluation, and culminating in a ''new'' Sterling crisis in Britain in November&nbsp;1968.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2170396 ''The Economic Crisis of 1968''] \u2013 published in ''American Historical Review''</ref><ref>Article, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/dec2005/mccar-d30.shtml ''Eugene McCarthy \u2013 pivotal role in 1968 Political Crisis'']</ref>\n\nThese repeated falls in the value of the Pound against the U.S. dollar significantly increased the cost of publishing the American strips, which had to be paid for in dollars, and raised the daunting spectre of further increases if the Pound fell in value yet again. Increasing the cover price of the ''Power Comics'' to compensate was impossible because of stiff competition (with sales on a sharp downward spiral, as circulation fell victim to the ever increasing popularity of television); so the fall in the value of Sterling made the American strips unaffordable.\n\nThe toughness of the competition is apparent from examining other contemporary titles.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/ British Comics] website</ref> The first issue of its stablemate ''Fantastic'', published in February 1967, cost 9d for 40 pages (due to its very high content of American superhero strips), a cover price which forced ''Fantastic'' to close within 18 months. ''Terrific'', having the same high content of American material, also had a high cover price of 9d, and closed even quicker.\n\nIn contrast, the comics ''Dandy'' and ''Beano'' published by the rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] organisation sold at a cover price of 3d. ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' cost three times as much, which (even with double the number of pages compared to many DC Thomson titles) proved unsustainable. This is not surprising, given that ''Wham'' and ''Pow'' each peaked at a cover price of 7d, and even that proved unsustainable.\n\n''Smash'' had launched in February&nbsp;1966 with a cover price of 7d for 24&nbsp;pages. By March&nbsp;1969, although its cover price had not changed, circumstances had conspired to increase its page count, such that each issue now contained 36&nbsp;pages. In fact the page count jumped overnight from 24 pages to 36 pages (a fifty percent increase), with a consequent sharp rise in production costs, and so a marked decline in profit-per-copy.\n\nThe tipping point was issue 144, in which ''Smash'', ''Pow'' and ''Fantastic'' were merged into a single title. The recently created ''Smash and Pow'' lost its ''Daredevil'' and ''Spider-Man'' strips, which together had comprised a full third of each 24 page issue, but now had to accommodate both ''Thor'' and ''Fantastic Four'' from the discontinued titles, plus a whole slew of new British adventure strips (which were being added in preparation for the comic's impending transition to solely-British content).\n\nAll this could not be achieved within the standard ''Smash'' format of 24 pages. So IPC now \"bit the bullet\" and increased the page count, at a single bound, by fifty percent \u2014 a necessity if they were to achieve their intention of reproducing with ''Smash'' the successful formula which was buoying-up sales of their most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant'', both of which were 36-pagers (in effect, to produce another clone of them: an identical mix of adventure and humour, with an identical page count, at an identical price).\n\nOne fundamental difficulty for the ''Power Comics'', however, was always the stark economic truth that a kid could buy both ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'', at 3d each, and still have change left over, for what it cost to buy ''Smash!'', ''Wham!'' or ''Pow!'' at 7d each. However, the DC Thomson titles only had 16 pages, and this more than anything drove up the page count in ''Smash!'', from its original 24 pages to 36 pages, and eventually to 40 pages in 1970 (i.e. it might be more than double the price of a DC Thomson title but it was also more than double the size).<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.9</ref> The difficulty was that the much lower price of ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'' gave those titles a significant advantage, since a kid could choose to buy only one of them, at 3d \u2014 a winning competitive advantage which, as of 1966, would keep both of the DC Thomson titles afloat for more than 30 years to come.\n\nThe highly competitive nature of the UK's publishing industry meant margins were thin: a minimum number of sales each week were needed to reach break-even point, and the lower the cover price, the greater was the number of sales needed to reach that point; but the higher the cover price, the fewer were the number of sales that could actually be achieved.\n\nThe juvenile readers (or their parents) might be able to afford two or three comics a week, but by publishing five ''Power Comics'' IPC were pricing themselves out of the market. For the situation in Britain was not like that in America, where, with comics published just once a month, a child might afford five titles. In Britain, comics were published weekly.\n\nUnder those conditions the ''Power Comics'' were effectively competing with each other \u2014 a factor IPC were certainly aware of, as the letters pages in ''Smash'', in 1968, actually carried readers' complaints that they couldn't afford all five ''Power'' titles. The five together cost an astonishing three shillings and threpence a week (39d), to buy them all, far beyond the reach of the average child's weekly pocket money.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.13</ref>\n\nThe ''Power Comics'' were also competing with IPC's other titles, including [[Lion (comics)|Lion]], [[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]] and [[Buster (comics)|Buster]], potentially dragging the Group's entire line into bankruptcy. Rationalisation, by closing some of the titles, would produce an overall benefit, as it would dramatically cut IPC's production costs. Although it would mean fewer titles, as IPC's comics were actually competing against each other it ought to result in better sales for the survivors. In theory, there would be no overall loss of sales or revenue, provided readers switched from the closing titles to surviving IPC ones (rather than to rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] ones).\n\nAnother factor Odhams had not anticipated was the distribution of American comic books within the UK. Although this had always been a consideration, the volume of such comics arriving in Britain had traditionally been small, and their distribution haphazard. In 1968, distribution and quantity suddenly underwent a marked improvement: in America, Marvel Comics' owner, Martin Goodman, pulled off a business coup that overnight freed Marvel from a restrictive distribution agreement, which for a decade had limited it to publishing only 8 titles a month: Marvel was suddenly quadrupeling its monthly output, and dozens of new titles were flooding into Britain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emagazinepdf.com/2017/05/marvel_comics_-_the_untold_story/|title=''Marvel Comics \u2014 The Untold Story'', Sean Howe (2012)}}</ref> Odhams' black-and-white [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] reprints in their ''Power Comics'' range suddenly faced much more extensive competition from four-colour Marvel originals, and this began to harm sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/03/40-year-flashback-smash-regenerates.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: 40 Year Flashback: SMASH! regenerates|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=8 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the turbulent economic conditions, any part of IPC's business which was loss-making had no future. Standard industry practice was to close a comic or magazine if its revenues dipped ''towards'' the break-even point; publishers did not wait for a title to actually incur losses.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> Hence, merely to anticipate losses on the other four titles (''Pow'', ''Wham'', ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'') was enough to doom them. And the closures represented a major cost-cutting exercise, reducing the ongoing production costs on the ''Power Comics'' line by four-fifths.\n\nAs for actual losses incurred due to the sudden and unexpected nature of the problem, and the inability to quickly terminate the long-term contracts with the Americans, ''Smash'' as sole survivor couldn't hope to generate enough income on its own to meet these. In fact it didn't need to. The fortunate circumstance that the ''Power Comics'' were all published by Odhams Press Ltd, a subsidiary company with limited liability, meant that it was possible to ring-fence all debts on the Odhams publications within that one company, thus preventing any losses affecting the rest of the IPC Group (since IPC's other titles were all published by other IPC subsidiaries). Accordingly, with effect from 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' was transferred to IPC Magazines Ltd, a new IPC subsidiary formed during 1968,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/publisher/1946/|title=GCD :: Publisher :: IPC|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> leaving Odhams with no continuing titles, and ''Smash'' started again from scratch.<ref>[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//companysearch?disp=1&frfsh=1414205283&#result Odhams Press Ltd] continued in being until 7 January 1998, when it changed its name to Formpart (No.11) Limited, which still exists today; currently a dormant private company.</ref>\n\nDespite being the longest survivor, and inheriting many popular strips from the other four titles, ''Smash'' was only a limited success. It was plainly on shakey ground: for, hard on the heels of the closure of the other titles, in the spring of 1969 IPC quickly made extensive changes to it, dropping the last remaining Marvel superhero strips, to shed the expense of the licensing fee for using them (having already dropped ''Batman''), and ending many other strips too.\n\nIn consequence of the decision to discontinue the American reprints, as each ''Power Comic'' closed its superhero strips were given up. Only in the case of ''Fantastic'', where the existing contract with Marvel had some months to run, were those strips transferred to its replacement, the merged ''Smash incorporating Fantastic'', until the contract expired in March&nbsp;1969.\n\n''Smash'' then introduced a new cover feature, new strips, and free gifts. In all but name it was a new comic. Even so, it required yet another major shakeup 12 months later, in the spring of 1970, when further changes of editorial policy were imposed by new owners Reed International, who had bought out IPC that year. This resulted, among other things, in the dropping of the newly introduced ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature in favour of a new lead serial: an adventure series entitled ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test''.\n\nWithin the British market, boys' comics for the age group which was too old for titles such as ''Beano'', ''Dandy'' and ''Sparky'' tended to focus around adventure, sport and war (in titles such as ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''), or humour (in titles such as ''Buster''). In abandoning its superheroes, ''Smash'' sought to attract readers of both types, by offering traditional adventure as well as humour.\n\nTo place these changes in context, the ''Power Comics'' were not the only casualties of the turmoil at IPC in 1969. Hulton's long-running adventure comic ''Eagle'' was also cancelled, merging with Fleetway's ''Lion'' from 2 May 1969. The merged comic was known briefly as ''Lion and Eagle'', but quickly reverted simply to ''Lion''. The humour comic, ''Giggle'', aimed at the slightly younger market dominated by Fleetway's ''Buster'', was also dropped, being merged into ''Buster'' in the spring of 1969 to form ''Buster and Giggle''. As ever, the name change lasted only long enough to absorb the discontinued comic's readership: the reference to ''Giggle'' failed to see out the year, and by December the title had reverted to simply ''Buster'' once more.<ref>''Buster'' [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/ cover gallery] at Wordpress.com</ref> And ''Buster'', like ''Smash'', also now became a publication of the Group's newest subsidiary, IPC Magazines Ltd.\n\nThe surviving titles at both Odhams and at Fleetway were now transferred to a merged operation, at New Year 1969, as merely a part of IPC's newest division, IPC Magazines Ltd, and were placed under the responsibility of Jack Legrand, formerly the Managing Editor of Fleetway's juvenile publications.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.17</ref>\n\nA notable feature of the Odhams years was how few advertisements the comic carried. There were occasional quarter-page inserts, mainly advertising foreign Postage Stamps for stamp collectors, or Subbuteo table-football; but they were few and far between, and their combined total didn't usually exceed one page per issue. Reflecting its financial problems, the relaunched comic under IPC Magazines carried a significantly greater amount of advertising. One obvious change was the back cover (the only in-colour page apart from the front cover), which gradually began to carry colourful full-page advertisements. On the inside pages, too, there was a much more noticeable quantity of adverts: each issue typically carried 4 full-page ads, plus two half-page ads. It was a noticeable feature of the relaunch that the comic now expanded to 40 pages, in order to cope with the need to carry an extra 4 pages of advertising in each issue.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/ British Comics] website</ref>\n\nThis was a potentially significant new strategy, and a major change of policy. No longer did the profitability of the comic rest exclusively with the income derived from its sales figures. That sales income was now supplemented by advertising revenue, and without even having to sacrifice any significant amount of page space, nor cancel any strips, thanks to adding the additional pages.\n\n===Turmoil in 1967===\nThe events of 1968 were not even the first threat to the survival of the ''Power Comics''. Odhams had faced their first serious crisis in May 1967.\nThe editorial page warned readers in issue 68 that ''Smash'', initially printed by St Clements Press Ltd of London, had to find new printers within one month, or face closure. In the event, Odhams were able to sign a contract with Southernprint Ltd of Poole in Dorset in time to maintain publication.\n\n==''SMASH'' after Odhams==\n\nIn January 1969 Odhams ceased to exist as a publishing imprint, and ''Smash'' now became an IPC Magazines publication. Most of the consequences of the change didn't become apparent until the issue cover-dated 15 March, in which the comic changed dramatically. IPC had waited three months to relaunch ''Smash'', because, on the one hand, it needed some lead-time in which to ready new strips, and, on the other, in the publishing industry Spring was traditionally considered a good time to launch a new (in this case, a virtually new) comic.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/>\n\nWith the re-launch, ''Smash'' became the last ever British comic to feature a variety mix of adventure, humour and sports themed stories. Subsequent boys' comics featured exclusively sports, or war, or humour; such as ''[[Scorcher (magazine)|Scorcher and Score]]'' and ''[[Shoot (football magazine)|Shoot]]'' (which featured only soccer), and ''[[Action (comics)|Action]]'' and ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' (which featured only war stories).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075250/http://26pigs.com/smash/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Smash|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>  A hallmark of this policy was to be the even-handedness with which the editorial staff drew the multitude of reprint strips featured in the new ''Smash'' from both ''Lion'' and ''Buster'', in seeking to appeal to readers of both (i.e. mixing serious and humorous strips without discrimination).\n\nThe symbol of the change was the new cover feature, ''Warriors of the World''. This now replaced ''The Swots and Blots'', who, drawn by Mike Lacey, had occupied the cover during the final part of the Odhams years. Happily, ''The Swots and the Blots'' survived (and prospered) on the inside pages, now drawn by Leo Baxendale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: Christmas comics: Valiant 1971|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=17 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith the first relaunch issue (No.163) bearing a cover feature entitled ''Warriors of the World No.1'', the former numbering was discontinued.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/25870/ Smash! - Title Notes] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> To have maintained the original sequential numbering alongside the ''Warriors of the World'' series could only have caused confusion.\n\nThe revamped ''Smash'', now comprising 40 pages, featured all-British strips \u2014 adventure serials, humour strips, and sporting strips \u2014 many of which were reprints from ''Lion'', such as ''Eric the Viking'' (originally ''Karl the Viking''), ''The Battle of Britain'' (originally ''Britain in Chains''), and ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''; and others which were reprints from ''Buster'', such as ''Wacker'' (originally ''Elmer''), ''Monty Muddle - The Man from Mars'' (originally ''Milkiway - The Man from Mars''), and ''Consternation Street''; but strictly no American superheroes.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The number of reprint strips was another significant indicator of its troubled financial situation, reprints being significantly cheaper than commissioning new strips.\n\nOf the former Odhams strips, only a handful survived. Humour strips which continued were ''The Swots and the Blots'', ''Wiz War'' and ''Bad Penny''. Additionally, ''Percy's Pets'' made occasional appearances (but did not appear every week). Much mourned were the loss of ''The Cloak'' and ''The Man from BUNGLE'', dropped due to the waning popularity of spy spoofs (in 1968 the TV series ''The Man from UNCLE'' had been cancelled); and especially mourned was the loss of Ken Reid and ''The Nervs''.\n\nThe serious offerings fared even worse. For although the survivors appeared to include ''Sergeant Rock - Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'', in reality neither of these were genuinely from the Odhams era. Both had begun only a few weeks earlier, in issues 156 and 158 respectively. They were really a part of the relaunch, but were introduced slightly ahead of time to disguise that fact. The only genuine survivor from the adventure strips of the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', and even that had only begun with issue&nbsp;144, in November&nbsp;1968.\n\nAfter a few months, superheroes appeared to be making a comeback. The Editorial column admitted receiving complaints from readers about the loss of the Marvel strips; and, in the autumn of 1969, six months after the ''Fantastic Four'' and ''Thor'' had been dropped, an all-British superhero called Tri-Man appeared, debuting in the issue of 13 September, and the character also featured in the ''Smash'' Annual that Christmas. Some indication of the effort put into this character is the fact that he was given sole possession of the front cover of the Annual! The adventures of Johnny Meek featured a hero who had triple-superpowers, hence the name Tri-Man. He leaped about rooftops (shades of Spider-Man, from the long-vanished ''Pow''), and got his powers from a ray device once every 24 hours (shades of DC's ''Green Lantern''). But the strip did not prove popular, and quietly vanished in the reshuffles of 1970.\n\nIn the light of how few strips of any sort survived from the Odhams era, and given that none of the superhero strips survived at all (which, according to the Letters pages,<ref>It was a feature of the Odhams years that the comic included a page for readers' letters, like the American comics published by Marvel and DC on which it was based, but the Letters Page was dropped in March 1969 in favour of extra advertising space.</ref> were the most popular feature of the ''Power Comics''), it would be stretching the truth to say that ''Smash'' inherited the best of the Odhams strips. Stylistically, ''The Swots and the Blots'' was the most creative and sophisticated Odhams strip (save only ''The Nervs''), and it did survive. But it was only one strip. And ''The Nervs'', which was objectively a more sophisticated strip in 1968, did not.\n\nMoreover, the publisher was taking a significant risk by re-launching the former ''Power Comic'' as, in effect, a clone of IPC's most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''. The publisher hoped it could repeat the success of ''Valiant'' and ''Lion'' by copying their successful formula. Nevertheless, without its discontinued superheroes ''Smash'' had nothing unique about it that might attract new readers, compared to its stablemates \u2014 featuring as it did a mix of strips reprinted from (or based on the style of) ''Lion'' and ''Buster''.\n\n===IPC Humour Strips===\n\nAs under Odhams, humour continued to play a large part in the relaunched comic (in terms of the page count): not to the extent it did in ''Buster'', but at least as much as in ''Valiant'' or ''Lion''.\n\nWith the relaunch, ''The Swots and the Blots'' (one of the handful of surviving Odhams strips) moved from the prestigious front cover to the centre pages. Nevertheless, now drawn by Leo Baxendale it became a standard bearer for sophisticated artwork. Baxendale began a five-year run on the strip (beginning in ''Smash'' and continuing in its successor, ''Valiant and Smash'', with some fill-ins by Les Barton<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=2818|title=Smash! comic the swots and the blots- Leo Baxendale - Comics UK|website=comicsuk.co.uk}}</ref>), by adopting a new style, one which influenced many others in the comics field, just as his earlier ''Beano'' work had done; and in the process attaining a new, deliriously daft, high standard, one rarely approached by other strips.\n\nNew humour strips featured in the relaunch (new to ''Smash'' at any rate) included a half-page cartoon strip drawn by Nadal, entitled ''Big 'Ead'', detailing the humorous misadventures of a Mr&nbsp;Knowall character, summed up by the strip's catchphrase, continually bellowed at the lead character by his irate victims: \"''Have a care there, Big&nbsp;'Ead!''\" Reprinted from ''Buster'', where it had initially run \u2014 under the same title \u2014 from 28 May 1960 to 18 February 1961.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p43</ref>\n\n''Wacker'' was a single page cartoon strip, subtitled ''He's All at Sea''. Drawn at different times by Rafart and by Roy Wilson, it concerned the crazy antics in the Royal Navy of Mis-leading Seaman Wacker, who was forever driving the Captain of HMS Impossible toward a nervous breakdown. Despite the Liverpudlian overtones of his surname, Wacker seemed not to be a Scouser \u2013 which may have been because it was ''not'' his real name! The strip, although new to ''Smash'', had run in ''[[Buster (comics)|Buster]]'' from 29 October 1960 to 17 October 1964 under its real title, ''Elmer''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/|title=Buster 60s|date=29 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/>\n\nAnother humour strip new to ''Smash'' was the World War Two spoof, ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men From W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' Set in 1940, this featured an English scientist named Professor Nutt, who was a boffin inventing eccentric secret weapons for a department of the War Office known as W.H.E.E.Z.E. (short for Weapon Handling Early Experimental and Zoning Establishment), who was kept out of trouble by his Army \"minder\", Sgt&nbsp;'Lightning' Bolt. Nutt and Bolt were perpetually clashing with a cunning Nazi scientist named Doktor Skull. This was another reprint strip, perhaps from ''Lion''. As its title implies, it was born out of the earlier popularity of the ''Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' television series. However, the strip had only a short run in ''Smash'', being replaced after just 22&nbsp;issues.\n\nYet it was not only in the plainly cartoon-style strips that humour flourished in the new ''Smash''. Many of the ostensibly more serious offerings were, in reality, humour strips: in particular, ''His Sporting Lordship'' and ''The World Wide Wanderers''; but there was also a strong humorous undercurrent in the new lead serial, ''Master of the Marsh''.\n\n===IPC Sporting Strips===\n\nSporting strips were now the order of the day. Reflecting this, the new lead, on page 3, was ''Master of the Marsh'', drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]],<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\">Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Solano Lopez]</ref> a sports serial about Patchman, a strange hermit who lived in the East Anglian fens. He was appointed as the new sports master at Marshside Secondary School, nicknamed 'The Marsh', because he was the only person who could control the kids \u2014 a group of hooligans known as 'the Monsters of the Marsh'. There was an association of ideas between fens and marsh, reinforced by the fact that Patchman camped in the inaccessible heart of the marshes. He was a burly woodsman who had always lived in the Fens, and could communicate after a fashion with the local wildlife, for whom he acted as protector.\n\nThe strip initially featured humorous stories about the attempts of Knocker Reeves \u2013 the worst of the 'monsters' \u2013 to get the better of the new teacher. But eventually it transpired that Patchman was secretly the guardian of a collection of relics left behind by [[Hereward the Wake]], a warlord who had fought the Norman invaders in the Fens during the 11th Century. In this respect, the strip had an occasional tendency to embrace science fiction overtones.\n\nOf the sports-based stories, the only survivor from the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', which continued to prosper. Possibly feeling the strip was suffering in the credibility stakes, the new editorial team made a decision to change the name of King's manager, who bore the remarkable name (actually a nickname) of Blarney Stone! They threw Blarney out of the series and substituted a new manager with a less silly name. ''Ballyhoo Barnes'' wasn't all that much less silly, but it's the thought that counts! Even so, Blarney reappeared after a few weeks, by popular demand.\n\nThe most successful of the new sports-based strips (certainly the most long-running) was ''His Sporting Lordship'', drawn by Douglas Maxted.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html Douglas Maxted]</ref> This humorous hit proved so popular that it ultimately became one of the few to outlast ''Smash'' itself. Henry Nobbins had been a labourer on a building site until he inherited the title of Earl of Ranworth and five million pounds. Before he could touch the money, however, he had to become champion at a number of sports. He also had to evade the nefarious attentions of Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, who was a rival claimant to the fortune, and Parkinson's villainous henchman, Fred Bloggs.\n\nLord Henry, as he had now become, was more than ably assisted by his Butler, Jarvis, who he had inherited from the previous Earl. And Jarvis proved indispensable. Henry was never portrayed as anything other than an able athlete and a good natured bloke, leaving Jarvis to supply the cunning which was (frequently) needed to defeat the dastardly Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, and prevent Henry's ancestral home, Castle Plonkton, from being turned into a glue factory.\n\nThe relaunch included a short-lived football strip with humorous overtones, entitled ''The World-Wide Wanderers'', about a League football team composed of eleven players from eleven different countries \u2014 not such a funny joke today! Football manager Harry Kraft found himself a passenger on a ship passing through the Suez Canal; ships from all over the world called there, and the crews conducted impromptu soccer matches to while away the time in port. Some of the crews had been stranded there, and constant soccer practice (since there was nothing else to do) had caused them to develop fantastic footballing skills. Kraft shipped eleven of them, from as many different countries, back to England; and they used their highly unorthodox individual skills to play as a team in the old Fourth Division.\n\n===IPC Adventure Strips===\n\nThe other staple of the new ''Smash'' was adventure serials, and far and away the most successful of these was ''The Incredible Adventures of [[Janus Stark]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Janus%2BStark|title=British Comic Art}}</ref> written by Tom Tully,<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183041 Janus Stark] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> featuring an escapologist in Victorian London who appeared to be simply an unusual act on the music-hall stage, but who privately used his extraordinary abilities to battle against injustice. Stark had an unusually flexible bone structure, enabling him to get out of an astonishing variety of tight situations, thanks to training received in childhood from his mentor, Blind Largo. Drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]], there was more than a touch of Reed Richards, from the departed ''Fantastic Four'' strip, in Stark's uncanny abilities.<ref>Stark's flexible bone structure, which was the basis of his career as an escapologist in the theatres, was perhaps more akin to ''Rubberman'', a character who had featured in ''Smash'' in 1966</ref> Lopez's dark, moody artwork also gave the strip a perfect 19th Century setting.<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\"/> The strip was one of the few to survive the merger of ''Smash'' into ''Valiant'' in 1971, and is still well remembered today. As a mark of its popularity, from week 30 it replaced ''Master of the Marsh'' as the lead serial on page 3 (swapping places with the latter, which was thus relegated to an inconspicuous location on pages 12 and 13).\n\nThis brings up the matter of economics once more. Solano Lopez was a foreign illustrator, born in the Argentine, who worked at a studio in Spain. For reasons of cost, IPC had taken a policy decision to source artwork from cheaper sources outside the UK.<ref name=\"blogs.birminghammail.net\"/> Along with the presence in the new ''Smash'' of reprint strips, which were much cheaper than commissioning new strips, this is yet another indicator of the financial pressure the comic was still under, and the absolute necessity of cutting production costs to the bone in order to make it financially viable.\n\nAnother long-running adventure strip was ''The Battle of Britain'', in which secret agent Simon Kane fought against Baron Rudolph, a usurper who had seized control of Britain using a secret weapon. The weapon emitted a sound wave which paralysed anyone who wasn't protected against it. Rudolph set up a police state, similar in emblems and uniforms to medieval England at the time of King John, and Kane led the resistance against him.\n\nIn spite of the title, the strip had no connection with the Second World War! Drawn for the initial 40 issues by Geoff Campion, and thereafter by [[John Stokes (comics)|John Stokes]],<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p109</ref> it was in fact a reprint; hence it, too, was an indication of the comic's troubled financial status (reprints being cheaper than new strips). It originally ran in ''[[Lion (comics)|Lion]]'' from 29 February 1964 to 28 May 1966 under various titles including ''Britain in Chains'' and ''The Battle for Britain'', where the hero was called Vic Gunn. The editorial staff of ''Smash'' took a decision to change the names of the leading characters from Gunn and Barrel (i.e. ''gun barrel''), to slightly less absurd ones; and so were born secret agent Simon Kane and his assistant Tubby. This had been a very long-running strip in ''Lion'', so much so that ''Smash'' actually ceased publication \u2014 in April 1971 \u2014 before it had reprinted the entire run from ''Lion'', and in the final issue created an (unconvincing) new ending for the serial.\n\n''Rebbels on the Run'' was another adventure serial, featuring three young brothers whose surname was Rebbel, who run away from an orphanage to avoid being split up. After a few months on the run, the strip took an amazing turn and \u2014 renamed ''The Rebbel Robot'' \u2014 became a science fiction serial, when the boys discovered that their late father's mind was preserved within the brain of a robot, which became their unofficial guardian. With it they embarked on a quest to track down a criminal known as The Genie, who had murdered their real father \u2014 who, in a further improbable turn of events, turned out to be a secret agent!\n\n''Eric the Viking'', a continuing serial featuring its eponymous Viking hero, and set in the Dark Ages, was another reprint from ''Lion'', where it had run under the title ''Karl the Viking'', as a set of 13 stories, from 29 October 1960 until 29 September 1964, written by Ken Bulmer.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\">Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p108</ref> The change of name to Eric probably reflects on the continuing fame (during the 1960s) of a real-life Viking leader in Dark Age Britain, Eric Bloodaxe, who history records was King in Viking York in the 10th Century. The strip is well remembered under its original title, as it was drawn by a famous comics artist, Don Lawrence.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Don Lawrence]</ref><ref>[http://www.donlawrence.co.uk/shop/index.php?hg=2&sg=35 Deluxe hardback collection of ''Karl the Viking'' strips] by Don Lawrence</ref> Eric (and Karl) fought a weird but impressive collection of legendary and fantasy monsters, in sword-and-sorcery epics which had some reflections in Lawrence's art for his contemporary work on the highly regarded all-colour science fiction strip ''[[The Trigan Empire]]'' then running in ''Look and Learn''. This was not even the first reprint: retitled ''Swords of the Sea Wolves'' it had initially been reprinted in ''Lion'', in part, between 1 October 1966 and 7 October 1967, with the lead character renamed Rolf the Viking.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\"/> And it would later be reprinted again, in the European version of ''Vulcan'': on that occasion translated into German and retitled 'Kobra'.\n\nTwo of the new IPC adventure strips \u2014 ''Sergeant Rock Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'' \u2014 were introduced five or six weeks early, in an attempt to conceal how few Odhams strips had actually survived, by making these appear to be existing strips although they were not. World War Two was the setting for the former, which, with occasional stories drawn by John Vernon,<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p88</ref> recounted the adventures of the 'Red Devils' of the Parachute Regiment. Initially, Sgt Rock was merely a narrator, introducing stories featuring other characters, so that it was actually tales-of-the-parachute-regiment, rather than tales of Sgt Rock himself. This was a device for reprinting old war stories from other comics: the strip had originally appeared in Fleetway's ''Hurricane'', from 4 July 1964 to 8 May 1965, entitled ''Paratrooper'', and continued in ''Tiger'' when that title absorbed ''Hurricane'' in the issue dated 15 May 1965. The reprints in ''Smash'' were reasonably successful, running for a year; and Sergeant Rock eventually featured as more than just narrator, with later editions sending him into action with the SAS, and marking the change by altering the title to ''Sergeant Rock - Special Air Service''. This change was noticeable, also, by a change of artist; seemingly \u2014 from the similarity of style \u2014 to the artist on the discontinued wartime strip, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''.\n\n''Bunsen's Burner'' was a short-lived strip, lasting just a few weeks.<ref>It was discontinued during the reshuffles of August 1969, when various changes were quietly made to the comic over the course of a month.</ref> This was an adventure yarn with humorous overtones \u2013 its humorous content being trailed in its title: a reference to an item familiar to most schoolboys from their Chemistry classes. Ben Bunsen was the owner of a vintage car, which was known as \"the Burner\" because it was so old it was steam-driven! Like an old-fashioned steam train it had a boiler which had to be stoked, as it ran on coal instead of petrol. Ben and his pal had to drive the Burner around the world, as a condition of Ben inheriting his uncle's fortune; but a rival claimant (shades of ''His Sporting Lordship''!) was secretly out to stop them.\n\nAnother adventure strip which had a sadly brief run, lasting only 47 weeks, but which is very well-remembered today, was ''Cursitor Doom''. In this spooky and atmospheric series,<ref>The strip had various artists during its one year run, but far and away the most effective of them was the talented Eric Bradbury, and it is mainly his serials from which the strip's enduring reputation derives</ref> Cursitor Doom, master investigator of the strange and mystic, who openly practiced sorcery in the strip, battled against the dark forces of evil, ably assisted by the pounding fists of his assistant, Angus McCraggan. Doom battled against genuine spirits and sorcerers, in tales including ''The Case of Kalak the Dwarf'', ''The Sorcerer's Talisman'' and ''The Dark Legion of Mardarax'', in the latter encountering a haunted (and unstoppable) Roman Legion brought back to \"life\" by the evil Mardarax. Doom's pet Raven, Scarab, who could write messages in the dust for Angus McCraggan, by scratching with his claw, was often of more help to Doom in these serials than was the perpetually baffled McCraggan.\n\nThe ''Cursitor Doom'' strip was drawn by Geoff Campion (including ''The Return of the Hunter''), and \u2013 more effectively \u2013 by [[Eric Bradbury]] (including the magnificently atmospheric ''Dark Legion of Mardarax'').\n\n===Changes in August 1969===\n\nAfter 22 weeks, in August&nbsp;1969, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' was dropped, and replaced from the 23rd&nbsp;issue by a more serious World War Two strip entitled ''Send For... Q-Squad'', which dealt with the adventures of a hand picked group of six specialists, who were assigned to unusual missions that required special expertise both in the air and on the ground. This, too, in keeping with the need to cut costs, was a reprint, originally published in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 7 March 1964 under the title ''Phantom Force 5''.<ref>[http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html ''Phantom Force Five''] in ''Buster''</ref><ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p36</ref>\n\nThis was another of those drawn, initially, by one of IPC's best British artists, [[Eric Bradbury]], at other times by the Spanish-based artist Luis Bermejo Rojo,<ref>[http://smashpages.net/2015/12/15/rip-luis-bermejo-rojo/ Career of Luis Bermejo] at SmashPages.net</ref> and in its final months mainly by Fred Holmes.<ref>Comics artist [http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html Fred Holmes] at BusterComic.com</ref> Because the strip had a regrettably short run in ''Smash'' (from 16 August 1969 to 30 January 1970 only), most of the run features art by Eric Bradbury.\n\nIt was marked out as a reprint by its unique style \u2014 which was both different from, and grimmer than, all the other strips. Whereas Sgt Rock emulated Lord Henry (and Janus Stark), by maintaining a huge and confident smile, regardless of how much trouble he was in, no one in ''Q-Squad'' ever stopped looking worried. Its reprint status was also signalled by the fact that Q-Squad was plainly ''not'' the original name of the team. Some panels showed evidence of the name having been inserted over a previous one: a change in the lettering style for the name 'Q-Squad' and any adjacent words \u2014 which used a different handwriting in a cruder style wherever the name appeared, but nowhere else.\n\nIn the same issue, a serious footballing serial entitled ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'' began, replacing the departed \u2014 and rather more humorous \u2014 ''World Wide Wanderers''. Hard-as-nails former prison sports instructor 'Toff' Morgan (so called for his habit of always wearing a top-hat) took over the management of ailing First Division side Haversham Hotspurs. Morgan began to rebuild the team by 'framing' ex-criminals who he'd known while working in various prisons, forcing them to sign on with the club in order to make use of their dishonest skills as footballing talents. These convicts became the 'handcuff hotspurs' of the title. The club's former manager, Reg Jessup, tried constantly to sabotage Morgan's efforts, in order to persuade the Directors to re-appoint him instead.\n\nSix months earlier, various humour strips had been introduced as replacements for the (far more surreal) humour of [[Ken Reid (comics)|Ken Reid]], whose strip ''The Nervs'' had so disturbed IPC's management. Now another was forthcoming, and one which reflected the pervasive sporting theme of the relaunched comic. ''The Touchline Tearaways'' (replacing ''Big 'Ead'') was another new football-themed strip, featuring three mad-keen supporters of Grimshot United: a totally useless Football League team, perpetually in danger of being relegated as it was made up entirely of ailing and decrepit players. Each week the Tearaways \u2014 Hairy, Lug'oles and Clever Dick \u2014 would execute some scheme from the touchline to help Grimshot win that week's fixture, usually involving a battle of wits with officials from the Ministry of Football, who, not unnaturally, tried to put a stop to the Tearaways well-intentioned cheating.\n\nThe name of the club, Grimshot United, was a humorous indication that the team was not very good (i.e. that the players were \"grim shots\"). Each strip featured a single match, with a plot based around helping the team overcome that week's opponent. Clever Dick masterminded all the ploys used in helping Grimshot, and apart from occasional words of congratulation or encouragement he was generally the only \"Tearaway\" who had dialogue in the strip. Hairy and Lug'oles tended to be merely a pair of walking visual gags: Hairy's features were perpetually invisible behind a vast mass of long black hair that covered his entire face and head, and Lug'oles had a pair of enormous ears.\n\nThese three new strips represented a minor change of emphasis, replacing two of the more whimsical offerings with two entirely serious strips \u2014 even though the third new entry (which was only a single-page) was simply one outright cartoon strip replacing another.\n\nThus, within six months, a number of the strips introduced in the relaunch had already bitten the dust. And more changes were looming.\n\n===The 2nd Relaunch : 1970===\n\nThe most obvious problem faced by the new-look ''Smash'' was the constant \"churn\": the incessant turnover of strips. Without its solidly popular superhero strips to rely on, the editorial staff seemed pathologically incapable of settling on a fixed line-up.<ref>Continual change of line-up was not a problem unique to ''Smash'', but was shared by all IPC's comics of this period. Editors struggled to find strips sufficiently popular to halt the decline in weekly sales; but making so many changes was self-defeating, because it harmed reader loyalty.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the changes made in August&nbsp;1969, further changes made at the start of 1970 left ''Smash'' looking very different from its appearance in the wake of the relaunch just 12&nbsp;months earlier. A vast number of new strips were added, in a second re-launch, such that only half of those introduced in March&nbsp;1969 now survived, although those which continued included ''Master of the Marsh'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'', ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''Battle of Britain'', ''Eric the Viking'', ''Wacker'', ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'', ''The Swots and the Blots'', and ''Percy's Pets'' \u2014 the latter two now being the only remaining Odhams strips.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\nDiscontinued were ''King of the Ring'' (last survivor of the serious strips from the Odhams era), ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service'', and ''Cursitor Doom''. Three of the strips only recently introduced were also dropped, namely the wartime ''Q-Squad'', British superhero ''Tri-Man'', and the humour strip ''The Touchline Tearaways''.\n\nThe first changes in 1970 occurred in the issue dated 24 January, when three new strips appeared, all reprints from ''Buster'': ''The Kid Commandos'', ''Consternation Street'', and ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' (originally titled ''Milkiway \u2013 The Man from Mars''). These were introduced as part of a relaunch of the comic: by once again bringing in some of the changes a few weeks ahead of the relaunch, as had been done in the Spring of 1969, the publisher hoped to disguise the true extent of the changes.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\n''The Kid Commandos'' was a war story about three cockney children stranded in occupied France in World War Two. Drawn by Tom Kerr, the Sparrow children \u2014 Tommy, Jan and Podge \u2014 were on the run from the Germans each week, in a single page strip set in 1940. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it appeared from 9 January to 24 July 1965, under the imaginative title ''The Sparrows Go To War''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref>\n\nIn the humour strip ''Consternation Street'' drawn by Reg Parlett (the title spoofed that of the popular British television soap opera, ''Coronation Street''), which was usually a one-page strip, a collection of unlikely neighbours rubbed shoulders in a very small street. Watched over by the dim-witted Constable Clott were the Snobbs and the Ardupps, Colonel Curry & Caesar (his dog), Miss Primm and her pets, Cutprice the Grocer, and Roger the Lodger. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it had originally run \u2013 under the same title \u2013 between 9 January and 23 October 1965.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p44</ref> Parlett was also known from his other humour strips in ''Buster'' including ''Rent-A-Ghost Ltd'', ''The Happy Family'' and ''Bonehead''.<ref>[http://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=1992 Reg Parlett's contributions to ''Valiant'' and ''Buster''] (including the long running ''Billy Bunter'' strip in ''Valiant'', which continued in ''Valiant and Smash'')</ref>\n\nThe half-page humour strip ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' recounted the misadventures of spaceman Monty Muddle (a name rather less convincing than the character's original name, ''Milkiway''). It originally ran in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 10 March 1962, with art credited to Nadal/Rafart.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/> He flew about in his small bubble-domed spacecraft trying to make friends with the Earth people. However, due to his misunderstanding of Earth customs, his every attempt at contact ended in disaster; and each strip would typically end with the catchphrase ''I'll try again next week!''\n\nThe 7 February issue then saw a full re-launch: with more free gifts, another new cover feature, and no less than eight new strips (making an astonishing eleven strips added since the beginning of the year).\n\nThe ''Warriors of the World'' covers had run into a problem, in that war stories were no longer a strong element of ''Smash'', which had dropped the humour strip ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' some time earlier. When it was decided to also drop ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Paratrooper'' (by then renamed ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service''), and ''Q&nbsp;Squad'', the cover feature had to go too. It was not practical to advertise war stories on the cover if there were no war stories inside!\n\nThe newly added ''Kid Commandos'' did not count as a war story in this context, since the three fugitive children did not do any conventional fighting. The strip was more like a souped-up version of the discontinued ''Rebbels on the Run''.\n\nAccordingly, after forty seven weeks<ref>46 issues featuring the ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature, and one Christmas issue</ref> the ''Warriors of the World'' series was ended. Instead, the issue dated 7 February 1970 began ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'', written by Angus Allan and drawn by the ever-popular Eric Bradbury.<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183036 ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'']</ref> Henceforth each week's cover featured a full-page splash advertising the task which adventurer Simon Test would undertake in a new strip on the inside pages. This strip proved so successful that when the original thirteen-week series was completed (featuring one task each week), Simon Test was given a new series of adventures, extending his hold on the cover indefinitely. He would prove particularly enduring, being one of the few strips to ultimately survive the merger with ''Valiant'' in 1971.\n\n''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'' saw him undertake a quest for immortality by attempting the thirteen tasks of the Pharaoh Thot, believing this to be the only way to save his life, having been deceived into believing he has only a few months to live. The sinister Jabez Coppenger secretly desired Test's death as a means of restoring his own youth. This serial introduced the mute servant Karka, who would ultimately become Test's friend and assistant.\n\nTest then went on to the more lengthy series of adventures entitled ''Simon Test and the Curse of the Conqueror'', where he battled the twenty servants of the evil Ezekiel Spar, the self-styled Conqueror. This pitted him against twenty athletes and champions, each of whom was under the hypnotic control of Spar, who implanted in them an in-built impulse to kill Simon Test.\n\nNew supporting strips introduced in the 7 February issue included ''Threat of the Toymaker'', ''The Pillater Peril'', ''Birdman of Baratoga'', ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'', and three humour strips with a common supernatural element: ''Sam's Spook'' (drawn by Leo Baxendale), ''The Haunts of Headless Harry'', and ''Ghost Ship''.\n\nIn ''Threat of the Toymaker'', drawn by Solano Lopez, a criminal scientist named Doctor Droll escaped from Garstone Prison with the aid of an army of remote controlled mechanical toys he had constructed, along the way taking the Prison Governor's children, Pam and Peter Keen, as hostages. Hampered by the children at every turn, Droll finds himself on the run, pursued by the Police wherever he goes. The idea of using radio controlled toys in the strip was scarcely original, since it was a straight lift from the ''House of Dolmann'', which was then running in ''Valiant'', as well as from the ''General Jumbo'' strip in ''The Beano''. The strip was scarcely original either: having been first published in ''Buster'', under the title ''The Toys of Doom'', between 27 February 1965 and 13 January 1968 (and in which it would be reprinted\u2014in part\u2014between 3 May and 6 September 1986, under the title ''The Terror Toys''), it was also reprinted in ''Eagle'', under its original title ''The Toys of Doom''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\"/>\n\n''The Pillater Peril'' saw David Pillater return to Pillater House, his ancestral home on the Cornish coast, which he is to inherit on his 21st&nbsp;birthday. Along with his four cousins and his Uncle Bernard, David is imperilled by Francis Pillater, an ancestor who has seemingly returned from the dead. Francis had an evil reputation for his misdeeds in the 16th century, but was thought to have perished in a shipwreck during a storm at sea. Blaming the family for his troubles, he sets out for revenge by kidnapping them one by one. The strip had only a short run, but when discontinued it did, unusually, seemingly come to a natural conclusion (rather than merely wrapping-up many continuing plot threads unconvincingly in the final panel).\n\n''Birdman from Baratoga'' was an adventure strip about a boy who grew up on a Pacific island with only the company of birds, and learned from them the secret of flight. By the use of a feather cape, he was able to glide through the air like an albatros. When an English sailor is castaway on the island, called Baratoga, they escape together on a raft and set out on a series of adventures in the Pacific, beginning by hunting down the desperado who has stolen the man's pearl-fishing yacht, ''Enterprise''. ''Birdman from Baratoga'' was perhaps loosely based on a humour strip which had run in ''Buster'' during 1968: ''Captain Swoop \u2013 He's Half Man, Half Bird, Half Wit''.\n\nIn a very atypical move, prompted by IPC's on-going financial problems (in the year in which they were taken over by the Reed Group), the editorial team now resurrected one of the old strips which had run in ''Wham'' under Odhams, drawn by Gordon Hogg. ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'' featured two young lads from Liverpool who fancied themselves as musicians, spoke in Liverpudlian slang (even the original title of the strip was derived from a slang Scouse term for a native of Liverpool: 'wacker'), sported Beatles-style haircuts, and always carried guitars. This was a reprint of ''The&nbsp;Wacks'', which had run in ''Wham'' during 1964, reprinted here with only the title and the names changed. Spoofing the pop group ''The Beatles'', it was an odd choice to run it a year ''after'' that group's demise. It was, though, a popular item: this 1964 strip had already been reprinted, under the title ''Birk 'n' 'Ed, the Mersey Dead-Beats'', from 30 January 1965 in Fleetway's ''Hurricane''.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p.89</ref><ref>Spoken quickly for comic effect, the names of the two characters were intended to sound like that of a district in Liverpool called Birkenhead</ref>\n\nA common supernatural theme linked the three new humour strips. In ''Sam's Spook'', drawn by the ubiquitous Leo Baxendale, Sam was a schoolboy with a ghostly pal called Spooky, who used his powers to humorous effect on Sam's behalf. The strip mostly consisted of Sam's school friends catching Spooky doing a bit of ghostly cheating in order to help Sam win at sports or football, and Sam doing a lot of running away to avoid a bashing.\n\n''The Haunts of Headless Harry'' featured the amiable ghost of a 16th-century soldier who had been beheaded. Harry's head and body led separate but related ghostly existences, with the body carrying the head around everywhere, and both of them were able to talk. Harry's humorous adventures invariably involved misplacing his head; such as going to the cinema and, on leaving, calling at the cloakroom to collect it (as though it was a hat), and being asked by the attendant to identify it among all the other ghostly heads left there during the film.\n\nThe other new humour strip was ''Ghost Ship'', in which the spirit of an ancient galleon, and the ghosts of its pirate crew, sailed the Seven Seas making mischief, but usually coming off worst.\n\nFurther changes followed: such that fully thirteen strips had been introduced since the start of 1970. In the issue dated 27 June 1970, a new humour strip began entitled ''Moonie's Magic Mate'', about a schoolboy, Barry Moon, who finds a Genie in a dusty old bottle. In the issue dated 29 August, a humour strip titled ''The Fighting Three'' began, featuring the misadventures of three men: globe-trotters McGinty, Hambone and Weasel are travelling the world, trying to raise enough money to start their own construction company, but get into fights \u2013 and jail! \u2013 wherever they go. Drawn by Carlos Cruz, this was another reprint from ''Buster'', where, under its original title ''Mighty McGinty'', the strip had run in 1964.<ref>Published 29 February to 17 October 1964: ''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref> And finally, in the last addition before the comic's closure, a strip entitled ''Tyler the Tamer'' was launched in early 1971, about the adventures of the greatest film stuntman in the world. Dropped to make room for these were ''Kid Commandos'', ''Threat of the Toymaker'' and ''The Pillater Peril'' (the ''Pillater'' saga seemingly reaching a natural conclusion, instead of merely being summarily abandoned).\n\n==Merger with ''Valiant''==\n\nIn mid-November 1970, production on ''Smash'' (and many other IPC titles, including ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'') came to a halt due to a printers' strike, and no editions were published for the next three months.<ref name=SP2010 /> By the time the strike was settled, in February of the following year, irreparable damage had been done to the comic's circulation, as its young readers had turned elsewhere in the intervening 11&nbsp;weeks. Similar harm had been suffered by ''Valiant''. In consequence of this latest financial disaster, after eight issues, in April&nbsp;1971 the two titles were merged in an attempt to combine their surviving circulation. For a brief time the merged comic was entitled ''Valiant and Smash'' (10 April to 18 September 1971<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/11/27/valiant-70s/|title=Valiant 70s|date=27 November 2018}}</ref>), before reverting to simply ''Valiant''.\n\nSome strips from ''Smash'' survived in the new comic, including ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'' and ''The Swots and the Blots'', but most were lost,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180805023305/http://26pigs.com/valiant/index.html Merger with ''Valiant''] - ''Valiant and Smash''</ref> although the ''Smash'' Annual continued to appear for many years afterwards (continuing, in fact, until the 1976 Annual, published in the autumn of 1975). A lot of the strips thereby continued to appear each year, including many which had not even survived into ''Valiant'', long after ''Smash'' had ceased publication as a comic.<ref name=\"British Comics website\">{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/|title=Smash!|date=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe sports themed ''His Sporting Lordship'' had enjoyed perhaps the greatest popularity, surviving the shake-ups of 1969 and 1970, and then surviving even the merger with ''Valiant'', though it was to last only a few months in its new home, finally ending in December&nbsp;1971. However, it was revived in the 1972 ''Smash'' Annual, published at Christmas&nbsp;1971, and returned year after year: becoming the regular cover feature of the Annuals.<ref name=\"British Comics website\"/>\n\nThe merged title was dominated by ''Valiant'', which contributed nine strips consisting of twenty pages; whereas ''Smash!'' was represented by only four strips, totalling a meager nine pages: ''Janus Stark'', ''The Swots & The Blots'', ''Simon Test'', and ''His Sporting Lordship''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kidr77.blogspot.com/2012/10/a-valiant-attempt-at-smashing.html|title=CRIVENS! COMICS & STUFF: A VALIANT ATTEMPT AT A SMASHING COMBINATION...|date=25 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite all of the changes, the new ''Smash'' had lasted only two years. Maybe it was only marginally profitable, but no title could have survived such a lengthy loss of production. Its demise was directly attributable to the strike.<ref name=SP2010>{{Cite web|url=https://stephenpoppitt.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/comics-010/|title=Smash! : The IPC Years \u2013 Part 5: Cancellation|date=16 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n''Smash'' was the last attempt in the UK market to publish a general boys comic, mixing adventure, sports and humour strips. Subsequent comics would survive only by ruthlessly focusing on narrow, sectional interests: such as all-sports, all-war, or all-humour;<ref>The most successful of these was ''Doctor Who Weekly'', which still exists today, although it had to become a monthly title in order to survive (and adopt a magazine format)</ref> just as the American market had already specialised into all-funnies, all-horror, and all-superhero titles.

''Smash'' remained part of that lineup for 100 issues; the logo was quietly dropped after #143 when the last of the other comics forming part of the lineup was cancelled (so that there was no longer a group of titles needing to be unified).\n\nThe other Power Comics were all ultimately absorbed into ''Smash'', which became the last survivor.

(which had launched in 1964 and quickly built up strong circulation figures) encouraged Odhams' London management to publish a second title, conceived by Alf Wallace (Managing Editor of Odhams' juveniles \u2014 ''Eagle'', ''Swift'' and ''Boy's World'') and Albert Cosser.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984)</ref> Leo Baxendale, who had created ''Wham!'' for Odhams in 1964, was too heavily embroiled with on-going production on it, providing much of the art for each issue, so had little time for anything else. Also, Baxendale was then still working at long range from Dundee.<ref>DC Thompson Ltd, Baxendale's former employers, were based in Dundee, Scotland</ref>\n\nAccordingly, it was Alf Wallace and Albert Cosser (soon to be known to their young audience as Alf and Cos) who determined the initial format of ''Smash!''. They also recruited the artists who would draw the early issues, as it was plain that Baxendale was fully occupied with the art for ''Wham!''. Baxendale's initial contribution to ''Smash'' was thus limited to providing a list of titles and situations for the humour strips, together with brief written scenarios (script ideas for the individual weekly issues), which he gave to Wallace to be farmed-out to other artists. ''The Swots and The Blots'' was one of these.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984),p.4-5</ref>\n\nBaxendale was asked only to create the ''Bad Penny'' strip, and to give ''Grimly Feendish'' (a character from his ''Eagle Eye, Junior Spy'' strip then running in ''Wham!'') a strip of his own. Wallace also had Baxendale draw the covers for the first three issues.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\"/>\n\n''Smash'' launched with the same format as the early issues of ''Wham'', namely 24 pages per issue, four of which were in colour; but it was printed on lower-quality paper than ''Wham''.\n\nThe initial line-up of strips mixed humour and adventure freely, with the comedic ''Ronnie Rich'' featuring on the cover of the first issue, inside which were adventure strips including the World War Two based ''Ghost Patrol'' \u2014 this latter a reprint strip which lasted only until issue 25. ''Ghost Patrol'' proved symptomatic of the problem with adventure strips which plagued ''Smash'' during the Odhams years, which tended to be ''sloppy in presentation and possessed of little real character or emotion''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'' Issue #3 (June 1984), p.6</ref>\n\nThe root of the problem with ''Smash'' was that it went through many changes in its early days \u2014 far too many. Particularly in its adventure strips: ''The Ghost Patrol'' came and went; ''The Legend Testers'' came and went; ''Moon Madness'' was particularly short-lived; and there were numerous others, equally forgettable. None proved popular enough to last.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref> Undeniably, none enjoyed the tremendous popularity of the American superhero strips which the comic would shortly feature, which genuinely had sufficient popularity to rival that of television.<ref>Marvel Comics as an independent UK publisher, in the 1970s, demonstrated that their superhero comics were capable of strong sales even in the face of competition from the newest rival -- colour television. ''Smash'' might have survived into that 1970s era of colour tv if it could have managed to retain its popular superhero strips.</ref>\n\nThose readers old enough to have become emotionally attached to comics before Odhams introduced American superhero strips to British readers tended to dislike those superhero strips.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref> Whereas, according to the letters pages each week, those same Marvel and DC heroes were enormously popular among the younger age group which had not been reading comics previously. Accordingly, ''Wham'' readers tended to resent the changes made in 1966, because British strips were cancelled in ''Wham'' and replaced with US superheroes, whereas ''Smash'' readers did not resent the superheroes, because in 1966 that comic had only just launched, so there were no real changes \u2014 ''Smash'' more or less teemed with American strips from the very beginning.\n\nThe decision, in 1969, to discontinue the American superhero strips was the real cause of the comic's demise. Other problems would contribute to the difficulties it subsequently faced - including strikes at its Printers - but the root cause of those problems was the falling circulation it suffered as a consequence of not having any unique elements to distinguish it from other IPC comics such as ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''. The superheroes were the only element it had which genuinely had the necessary popularity to halt the decline in weekly sales caused by the competition from television.\n\n==Odhams Years==\n===Superheroes===\nBlack-and-white reprints of [[Marvel Comics]] strips<ref>All the Marvel stories were written by Stan Lee</ref> were introduced into ''Smash'' with issue&nbsp;16, when the ''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' began.<ref>Issue 16 saw the first appearance of Marvel's ''[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=1 Incredible Hulk]'' strip, drawn by [[Jack Kirby]]</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html|title=BLIMEY!

In July&nbsp;1967 ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''<ref>Drawn at various times by Bill Everett, Wally Wood and Gene Colan</ref> replaced the Hulk, from issue&nbsp;76 onwards \u2014 ''Smash'' having exhausted all Hulk stories, from all sources, which had been published in the USA up to that time.\n\nIt's hard to overstate the significance of the introduction of ''The Hulk'', in the issue dated 21 May 1966. It was the first ''Marvel Comics'' strip featured by Odhams, the success of which led to the introduction of ''Fantastic Four'' into ''Wham'' on 6 August of that year, and to the launching of two entire comics entirely dedicated to Marvel superheroes \u2014 ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' \u2014 in 1967. The Hulk's initial appearance in ''Smash'' took up a massive 6 pages, one-quarter of each 24 page issue, pushing fully five existing strips out of that issue, and causing the permanent cancellation of \"Space Jinx\" and \"Brian's Brain\" (although the latter would be revived much later).<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.11</ref>\n\nPrior to this, [[DC Comics|DC]]'s ''[[Batman (comic strip)|Batman]]'' had become the second American superhero to debut in ''Smash'', crashing onto the front cover of issue&nbsp;20 a month after the Hulk's debut, in re-edited reprints from American daily and Sunday newspaper strips: these were credited in-page to ''Batman'' creator Bob Kane, but were actually drawn by [[Al Plastino]] and ghost-written by [[Whitney Ellsworth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/issue/368494/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Smash! #75|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> This was a response to the sudden and enormous popularity of the ''Batman'' television series starring Adam West. The impact of this hit TV show led to the ''Batman'' strip retaining the front cover of ''Smash'', in colour, for better than a year and a half, entitled ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder''.\n\nInitially, this syndicated newspaper strip adopted the camp style of the Adam West television series, with appearances by humorous guest stars such as American funnyman [[Jack Benny]]. In the later part of the run (which featured serious, rather than camp, stories) Batgirl, too, appeared in the strip, a response to her addition to the TV show in its 3rd season: in the newspaper strip, Batman initially believed her to be a criminal rather than a crime fighter. Superman then co-starred in the strip, which was retitled ''Superman and Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'', as Batman and Robin attempt to save Superman from the diabolical Professor Zinkk who was secretly poisoning him with kryptonite.\n\nThe expansion of the American content, with the arrival of ''Batman'', meant the loss of two more of the initial British strips: the adventure strip ''The Ghost Patrol'', and the cartoon strip ''The Tellybugs''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\"/>\n\nIn September 1968 the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' began a six-month run in ''Smash'', when it absorbed ''Pow'' (which had previously merged with ''Wham'', in which the strip had initially featured). As one of only a handful of ''Pow'' strips to survive the merger, it was used to lure ''Pow'' readers to the new comic. The strip was introduced to readers of ''Smash'' with the wedding of Reed and Sue from ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3. Their adventures continued with ''Defeated by the Frightful Four'', and ran through to ''Lo There Shall Be an Ending'', which was the final Marvel strip to appear in ''Smash''.\n\n''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' began a short run in November 1968 when ''Smash'' absorbed ''Fantastic''. The stories, continued from ''Fantastic'', began with ''The Ringmaster's Circus of Crime''. When the Marvel strips were discontinued the following spring, the final ''Thor'' reprint had a new ending substituted, in a rushed attempt to resolve a continuing sub-plot.\n\nThe financial crisis which overtook Odhams in 1968, resulting in the closure of all the other ''Power Comics'', also caused them to give up the expensive licence to reprint the Marvel superhero stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/marvuk.htm|title=Marvel UK|website=www.internationalhero.co.uk}}</ref> This decision took effect in March&nbsp;1969, when the licence came up for renewal; the final Marvel strips appeared in issue&nbsp;162. The expensive ''Batman'' newspaper strip had already been discontinued, ending in issue&nbsp;157.\n\n===Odhams Humour Strips===\nThere were typically a dozen British humour strips in each of the first 162 issues.\n\nThe initial line-up starred ''The Man From B.U.N.G.L.E.'', which usually occupied the front cover prior to issue&nbsp;20,<ref>''Smash'': [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html The first 20 covers]</ref> supported by seven other long-running humour strips (''Charlie's Choice'',<ref name=\"Brian Lewis\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Brian Lewis]</ref> ''Bad Penny'',<ref name=\"Leo Baxendale\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Leo Baxendale]</ref> ''Percy's Pets'',<ref>Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> ''The Nervs'',<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: 50 Year Flashback: SMASH! No.1|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=31 January 2016}}</ref> ''The Swots and the Blots'',<ref>Initially assigned to Mike Lacey</ref> ''Ronnie Rich''<ref>Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Gordon Hogg]</ref> and ''Grimly Feendish''<ref name=\"Leo Baxendale\"/> \u2014 more about these below), and four humour strips which didn't last, namely ''Danger Mouse'', ''Space Jinx'',<ref name=\"Brian Lewis\"/> ''Queen of the Seas''<ref>Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Ken Reid]</ref> and ''The Tellybugs''.<ref>Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html George Parlett] (the source might actually mean ''Reg'' Parlett)</ref>\n\nLasting only a few weeks, ''Space Jinx'' was the first and only character to hold the coveted centre pages in colour. It is unclear why Alf and Cos chose this deeply unfunny strip for what must have been considered the pride of place in the new comic. ''Space Jinx'' was primarily another ''Jonah'' (a strip by Ken Reid which had run in ''The Beano''), except that it could not hold its own against the brilliance of Reid's sea-faring twit. Where ''Jonah'' dealt with sinking ships of the sea, Brian Lewis's ''Space Jinx'' dealt with similar situations in outer space, but (in practice) without the necessary degree of humour.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.7</ref>\n\nKen Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' would last only slightly longer, at 43 issues. A masterpiece of comic artistry, telling the story of the ''Buoyant Queen'' and its two-man crew, Enoch and Bert, a pair of oafs with a love/hate relationship (mostly hate!), it was perhaps too intelligent for its target audience \u2014 its disappearance was a great loss to the comic.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> Many readers failed to understand, amongst many things in the strip that went clear over their heads, that the two main characters were drawn in the likeness of comedians [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]], and that the strip's humour was based on the movies of Laurel & Hardy.\n\nAfter only five months \u2013 foreshadowing many, many reshuffles to come \u2013 ''Smash!'' underwent its first major overhaul: from issue&nbsp;20 the ''Batman'' newspaper strip took over the front cover, whilst ''Grimly Feendish'' lost the colour back cover to Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' (which shrank from its original two pages each week to only a single page \u2014 the loss of the extra page was a drawback, but was compensated for by the strip now having a more prestigious location in the comic, and of course by now being in colour).\n\nFurther cover changes would follow. When, after two years, the popularity of the ''Batman'' television series eventually faded, from issue&nbsp;114 onward Batman and Robin were moved to the inside pages, yielding the front cover to the long-running success ''The Swots and the Blots'', at this point still being drawn by Mike Lacey, a humour strip in which two rival gangs vied to outwit each other at Pond Road School, with \"Teach\" caught in the crossfire. Its origins lay in Baxendale's classroom-based strip ''The Tiddlers'', which had then been running for 2 years in ''Wham''<ref>In fact it was a direct continuation of ''[https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/wham/ The Tiddlers]'', with only a change of name. The characters (i.e. \"Teach\" and the Blots), school buildings, and situations, were all largely as they had been in ''The Tiddlers''. The only difference was the addition of the Swots, so that Teach now had an ally.</ref> (and which continued in ''Pow'' when ''Wham'' merged with it in 1968, where it was combined with ''The Dolls of St Dominics'' to become ''The Tiddlers and The Dolls'').\n\n''The Swots and the Blots'' was one of the few strips in ''Smash'' to survive all the changes of 1969 and 1970, reaching a new standard of excellence when [[Leo Baxendale]] began drawing it for the new-look ''Smash'' from March 1969, but even during the Odhams years it had wit and a sense of style. In Baxendale's hands it had notable similarities to his earlier classroom-based strip, ''The Bash Street Kids'', in ''[[The Beano]]''.<ref>Around 1968, Baxendale quit Odhams for the better paying ''Fleetway'' comics. One of the strips he produced there was ''[http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2017/07/leo-baxendales-big-chief-pow-wow.html Big Chief Pow Wow]'' for ''Buster''\u2014the strip ran from 14 September 1968 to 31 January 1970 (some issues were fill-ins by other artists).</ref>\n\n''The Man from BUNGLE'', spoofing the popular TV series ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', was a spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye Junior Spy'' strip in ''Wham''. BUNGLE was a secret spy organisation in Britain, organised along more chaotic lines than UNCLE, featuring a secret agent who employed a wide variety of hugely unlikely gadgets in his fight against his humorous opponents. Baxendale himself drew the first few editions, which appeared as large single illustrations on some of the early covers of ''Smash'', after which Mike Lacey took over.\n\nThe second spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye'' strip was ''[[Grimly Feendish]]'' (subtitled ''The Rottenest Crook in the World''), which Leo Baxendale himself drew. Feendish had been the most popular character in the earlier strip, thanks to his ghoulish appearance, which was based on Uncle Fester in the American television series ''[[The Addams Family]]'' (and, presumably, on Charles Adams' illustrations from which the TV series was derived).<ref>Interestingly, the strip would probably have been ''banned'' if this had been an American comic, as the [[Comics Code Authority]] prohibited presentation of crime in comics if it tended to create sympathy for the criminal, and this strip appears to fall foul of that restriction.</ref> The new strip at one point occupied a prestigious position, as the full-colour back cover feature each week, and survived throughout the entire run of 162 issues published by Odhams (even though, after giving up its cover status, it was sometimes ignominiously reduced to only a quarter-page \"filler\").\n\n''Bad Penny'' was another memorable Baxendale creation. Its title logo featured a portrait of Penny herself, alongside the 'Bad Penny' caption, and an illustration of a giant pre-decimal One Penny coin (the coin suggesting the connection with the proverb from which the character's name originated).\n\nShe had some similarities with Baxendale's earlier Minnie the Minx character in ''The Beano''. When he had been drawing Minnie, he had concentrated on experimenting with facial expressions and character traits. By the time he began working on ''Bad Penny'' his drawing style had matured, with an equal concentration on developing a zany but tight storyline, less emphasis on close-ups of facial expressions, but retaining the essentials needed to put over a character's own personality traits.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\"/>\n\nBad Penny was so popular that she survived the changes of 1969, and continued to appear in the new ''Smash''. When the strip was eventually dropped, in 1970, Bad Penny herself still continued to appear, albeit infrequently, making occasional appearances in Baxendale's ''The Swots and the Blots'' as a new member of the Blots.\n\nAs had happened in ''Wham'', artists such as Mike Lacey were commissioned from time to time to \"ghost\" Baxendale's style. Baxendale was allowed to sign his early work on ''Smash'', so there is a way to distinguish which strips he personally drew during his time at Odhams.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075207/http://26pigs.com/wham/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Wham!|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref><ref>In practice, Baxendale signed very few of his strips, so it is quite difficult to tell which are his and which are other artists substituting for him.</ref> After he transferred to Fleetway, another IPC subsidiary, he still contributed strips to ''Smash'', but now worked \"undercover\", i.e. without signing them. He explained this in his autobiography, ''A Very Funny Business'' (Duckworth, 1978, page&nbsp;91): \"I was in a delightful situation. Working under my own name, a lot was expected of me. Publishers ''expected'' me to cram my drawings with funny detail. A double standard operated. Working undercover, I was able to reduce the layouts to the simplest terms. Backgrounds were minimal or non-existent \u2014 just a horizon line. And there was no ancillary comic detail \u2014 just the characters acting out the story line against an empty backdrop.\"\n\nThe most bizarre of the Odhams humour strips was ''The Nervs'', depicting a group of little characters inhabiting a schoolboy called Fatty: the strip showed them running Fatty like a group of workers running a factory. Allocated two pages, it followed the same formula as the strip ''Georgie's Germs'' from ''Wham!''. Fatty was aptly named, with the tiny Nervs battling to save the fat twerp's stomach from its numerous overloads, as a minute never passed which was free from him guzzling!\n\nDrawn for the majority of its run by Graham Allen,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> in its final months during 1968-69 [[Ken Reid (comics artist)|Ken Reid]]<ref>Comics artist [http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Ken%20Reid Ken Reid]</ref> \u2014 previously of ''Queen of the Seas'', and who had earlier contributed the ''Dare-a-Day Davy''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/dadd.htm|title=Ken Reid's Dare A Day Davy|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> strip to ''Pow'' \u2014 drew this double-page feature.\n\nReid's career had begun at ''The Beano'' in the 1950s, but for Odhams he had already produced the long running success ''Frankie Stein'', in ''Wham!'', before taking on ''Queen of the Seas'' in the early issues of ''Smash!'' and the  ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip in ''Pow!''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> He turned ''The Nervs'' into an extremely surreal, even visceral, strip; achieving a rare level of hilarity and bawdiness, in a subversive presentation of comical horror \u2014 and in the process alarming IPC's management !<ref name=\"Career history of artist Ken Reid\"/>\n\nHe already had some degree of notoriety, as being the only Odhams artist whose work so disturbed the management that it was actually banned.<ref>[http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/weird1.html Review] of the banned ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' Frankenstein strip</ref><ref>''Dare-A-Day Davy'' [http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/picts2.html Frankenstein strip], published in ''Weird Fantasy''&nbsp;#1 in 1969</ref> At the suggestion of Vance Gledhill of Blackpool, Davy was dared to dig up Frankenstein's monster (in the ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip) and bring him back to life \u2013 for which Reid decided to employ the \"kiss of life\"!

This was a device for featuring, as guest stars in the strip each week, an assortment of popular TV stars. The strip's debut appearance, for instance, featured Robert Vaughn and David McCallum, stars of top-rated secret agent show ''The Man From UNCLE'', maximising their appearance by splashing them across the front cover. It was hoped that by bringing popular television stars into its pages, this would make TV's growing popularity work ''for'' the comic \u2014 a not very subtle ploy to boost its circulation and sales.\n\n''Sammy Shrink'' (subtitled ''The Smallest Boy in the World'')<ref name=\"auto3\"/> was a humour strip about a boy who was only two inches tall. Sammy had the most successful \u2014 but also the most chequered \u2014 career of all the characters featured in ''Smash'', having originated in ''Wham'', then moved to ''Pow'' when they merged, arriving in ''Smash'' when it in turn absorbed ''Pow'', and would subsequently be revived in ''Knockout'', finally ending his career in ''Whizzer and Chips'' when it absorbed ''Knockout'' in June&nbsp;1973.\n\n''Ronnie Rich'' featured the richest kid in the world, who stands to inherit a fortune if only he can get rid of the money he's got. Drawn by Gordon Hogg,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> each week Ronnie spent his every last penny, in some reckless or extravagant way, only to have his scheme backfire and make him richer than ever. He never did get his hands on the fortune.\n\nOften a half-page feature, ''Percy's Pets'' drawn by Stan McMurtry (alias Mac)<ref>Comics artist [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1040731/Macs-secret-lady-Britains-cartoonist-reveals-hidden-images-wife.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> was popular enough to go on to make sporadic reappearances from time to time in the new ''Smash'' after March&nbsp;1969. Percy was a small plump schoolboy, who filled his family's home with his exotic collection of pets. These included (from time to time) an elephant, a giraffe, a hippopotamus, a snake, an ape \u2014 in fact almost every type of animal that might be found in a typical zoo \u2014 together with a parrot, a tortoise, a white mouse, and a hedgehog; thereby causing a predictable degree of comical chaos for his long suffering mum and dad.\n\nSome of the best-remembered strips were not included in all of the first 162 issues: a number of them were only acquired in #137, from the merger with ''Pow!'' (which had already absorbed the most popular strips running in ''Wham!'').\n\nOne such acquisition from ''Pow!'' was ''The Cloak''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/cloak.htm|title=Mike Higgs' The Cloak|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> \u2014 like ''The Man From BUNGLE'', another humorous secret agent strip. The Cloak was the top agent for Britain's Special Squad, nominally a part of Scotland Yard; but he usually operated from his personal headquarters, known as the Secret Sanctum. His ingenuity and never-ending supply of gadgets and secret weapons gave him the edge over his somewhat odd enemies (some were ''very'' odd, including Deathshead and various other agents of G.H.O.U.L.).\n\nHe had some equally odd colleagues. Assisted initially by Mole (the tall one with the bald head, big nose and specs) and Shortstuff (the short squirt with the hairy nut and big eyeballs), he then began having adventures in which he found himself also alongside the sexy and flirtatious Lady Shady, the shady lady. The strip benefited from the unusual, idiosyncratic drawing style of Mike Higgs, whose overt inclusion of pop culture imagery made the strip seem extremely modern.\n\n''Wiz War'', drawn by Mike Brown, had also begun in ''Pow!'', and would be one of a handful of strips to survive the changes of 1969. Brown seems to have been unaware of the house rule banning artists from signing their work, as the strip often bore his name. The \"War\" in the title referred to a feud between two wizards, Wizard Prang and his enemy Demon Druid. Being a humour strip, the editorial staff allowed the hero the very silly name of Wizard Prang, a piece of RAF slang from the Second World War.\n\nOther than the fact that Prang was robed entirely in white, befitting his status as the good guy, and Demon Druid was always in black, being the villain of the piece, their costumes were quite similar - a flowing wizard's robe with stars on, and a pointed hat. They would fly around on broomsticks, zapping each other with spells: which turned the other into a toad, or something equally amusing. Wizard Prang was alternately helped and hindered by Englebert, his pet bird. The best feature of the strip was the sign above Wizard Prang's front door. This usually read \"Wizard Prang is... In\" (if he was at home) or \"Wizard Prang is... Out\" (if he was out and about); but if he'd had a bad time in the story, the sign would often make a humorous remark in the final panel, such as \"Wizard Prang is... All At Sea\".\n\nThe secret of Mike Brown, unacknowledged for many years, was that Leo Baxendale needed to earn money from Odhams without disclosing to Fleetway that he was now working for both companies. Accordingly, Baxendale now pencilled the drawings, and Brown, who was a cartoon film animator, inked them in. In this way, they turned out together large numbers of ''Bad Penny'' and ''Grimly Feendish'' strips, which they sold to Odhams under Brown's name \u2014 a situation Baxendale referred to, in his 1978 autobiography, as working ''undercover''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984),p.10</ref>\n\nLost in the merger with ''Pow'' were ''Charlie's Choice'', ''Ronnie Rich'' and ''The Man From BUNGLE''. Also lost in this merger, in effect, was Ken Reid's ''Dare-A-Day Davey'' strip, one of several established features in ''Pow'' which were dropped instead of transferring to ''Smash''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.15</ref>\n\n===Odhams Adventure Strips===\n\nAs ''Smash'' was essentially a superhero and humour comic during the Odhams years, there were few traditional adventure strips in it; but a handful do bear special mention.\n\nThere were various well-remembered adventure strips in the first hundred issues, including some which were quite outstanding, such as ''Rubberman'', ''Experiment X'', ''The Legend Testers'', and ''The Python''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nFrom issue 144 in November 1968 ''Smash'' was the only surviving ''Power Comic'', as this was the issue in which ''Smash and Pow'' (as it then was) merged with ''Fantastic''. Five British adventure serials were introduced in this issue, to plug the gap left by the loss of the withdrawn American superhero strips which had been major features of the four closed titles.\n\n''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' is an adventure strip in which a crime reporter on the Daily Globe newspaper is apparently killed while investigating a news story. The world believes newspaperman Jim Jordan is dead, but he still carries on his crusade against crime... calling himself The Spectre.\n\nHe is now fighting crime, rather than merely reporting it, using an array of gadgets which make it seem he is the ghost of the missing reporter. Hence his opponents are terrified to find that if they shoot him he doesn't die (a bullet-proof raincoat was the trick here). And he has a secret underground hideout beneath the statue erected in his memory, from which he would covertly and unexpectedly emerge, or disappear into, under cover of an artificial fog, to give the impression he was coming and going from the spirit world. His first case began in issue&nbsp;144, in which he tracks down Black Murdo, the racketeer who the world believes had murdered him.\n\n''Destination Danger'', a motor racing serial, also began in issue&nbsp;144. This strip was about a feud between a young English racing driver, Jeff Jackson, who was working for Puma Motors in the US, and his enemy Vic Stafford, the Puma team's chief driver, who has taken a bribe to throw a forthcoming race.\n\nAlthough new to ''Smash'', the old-fashioned artwork in the strips ''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' and ''Destination Danger'' marked them out as reprints. The use of reprints was a cost-cutting measure, indicating the straightened financial circumstances of ''Smash'' at this point \u2013 if any evidence were needed beyond the closure of all four of the other ''Power Comics''.\n\n''Laird of the Apes'' was a science fiction strip, milking the popularity of the big budget Charlton Heston motion picture ''Planet of the Apes'' which was released earlier that year. In the strip, set in the 18th century, a young Scottish laird returns to the Highlands to aid his outlaw clansmen in their struggle with the English Redcoats, bringing with him a band of highly trained Apes.\n\nAn adventure strip with a sporting theme was the wrestling serial ''King of the Ring'', featuring Ken King, who was a champion of the grunt-'n'-grapple game (although in the earliest strips he had begun as a boxer). As was not exactly uncommon in the Odhams years, there was a tendency to give the characters very silly names. The most outrageous example in this strip was King's manager, who (in spite of ''not'' being Irish) was called Blarney Stone!\n\nBlarney's real name was originally Tim Stone, and Blarney was only a nickname; but this was soon forgotten. In order to fulfil Ken's ambition to travel, Blarney agrees to manage him on a world tour, if he'll agree to fight his way round the world!\n\nThe fifth adventure strip added was ''Brian's Brain'', drawn by Bert Vandeput,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> a serial with science fiction elements, continued from ''Pow''. This featured two schoolboys: the eponymous Brian and his friend Duffy Rolls. Brian Kingsley possessed an electronic Brain resembling a human skull, which he carried about in a box. It could communicate with him telepathically, glowing when active; and it could control the actions of animals if they were within a few yards, which was the limit of its brain-wave transmissions.\n\nAll five strips commenced in issue&nbsp;144; and all were serials, with cliff-hanger endings each week.\n\n===The Closure of the ''Power Comics''===\nWhat must always be born in mind is that, in the comics industry, the 1960s were not the 1930s. With the advent in Britain of commercial television, in 1955 \u2014 displacing the staid, old-fashioned children's television offered by the BBC up to that point \u2014 the ever-increasing competition from the ''boob-tube'' began a continuous (and accelerating) decline in comics circulation. Throughout the 1960s, in consequence, the circulation wars fought in the comics publishing industry were fought out against a backdrop of ever-declining circulation figures.\n\nFollowing the initial success of ''Wham'' in 1964, Odhams had launched four more [[Power Comics]] during 1966 and '67, including ''Smash'', only to close them in quick succession: merging each in turn into the survivors until by 1969 only ''Smash'' remained. Whereas 1968 began with all five ''Power Comics'' apparently flourishing, by the year's end only ''Smash'' was still being published.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\"/> Even the sleepiest of readers began to notice that something was seriously wrong, as the increasingly frantic series of mergers resulted in ever more ludicrous titles, culminating in the astonishing ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic'' (commonly spoofed as ''Smash, Pow, Wham, incorporating Fantastic and Terrific'').\n\nThe question is why, in a limited market such as the UK, they took such a big risk as to launch five titles (which in hindsight looks an unwise decision by the Odhams management), if it was so quickly obvious that the market could only support one? It has been suggested<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> that it was common practice for a publisher to quickly clone a successful title, in order to forestall its competitors from doing so. That does not seem to be the case here. The comic's only distinctive feature was its American superhero strips, so ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' (which most of the time contained ''only'' Marvel superhero strips) might loosely be described as clones of ''Smash'', even though they lacked any humour strips; but IPC had an ''exclusive'' licence from Marvel Comics to reprint Marvel's strips in the UK, which precluded anyone else from doing so.\n\nThe actual answer lies in the unexpected nature of the economic crisis of 1968 that hit the British economy, resulting in the devaluation of the Pound.<ref>In Britain, the devaluation crisis was major news due to certain ill-judged remarks by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who would be mocked for the rest of his career for his infamous falsehood, ''This will not affect the Pound in your pocket!''</ref> The economic chaos began with a Sterling crisis in Britain in 1967, leading to devaluation in the November. There then followed a crisis for the U.S. dollar in March&nbsp;1968 which had a cascade effect on the international economic system, sending first the French franc and then the West German deutschmark into devaluation, and culminating in a ''new'' Sterling crisis in Britain in November&nbsp;1968.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2170396 ''The Economic Crisis of 1968''] \u2013 published in ''American Historical Review''</ref><ref>Article, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/dec2005/mccar-d30.shtml ''Eugene McCarthy \u2013 pivotal role in 1968 Political Crisis'']</ref>\n\nThese repeated falls in the value of the Pound against the U.S. dollar significantly increased the cost of publishing the American strips, which had to be paid for in dollars, and raised the daunting spectre of further increases if the Pound fell in value yet again. Increasing the cover price of the ''Power Comics'' to compensate was impossible because of stiff competition (with sales on a sharp downward spiral, as circulation fell victim to the ever increasing popularity of television); so the fall in the value of Sterling made the American strips unaffordable.\n\nThe toughness of the competition is apparent from examining other contemporary titles.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/ British Comics] website</ref> The first issue of its stablemate ''Fantastic'', published in February 1967, cost 9d for 40 pages (due to its very high content of American superhero strips), a cover price which forced ''Fantastic'' to close within 18 months. ''Terrific'', having the same high content of American material, also had a high cover price of 9d, and closed even quicker.\n\nIn contrast, the comics ''Dandy'' and ''Beano'' published by the rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] organisation sold at a cover price of 3d. ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' cost three times as much, which (even with double the number of pages compared to many DC Thomson titles) proved unsustainable. This is not surprising, given that ''Wham'' and ''Pow'' each peaked at a cover price of 7d, and even that proved unsustainable.\n\n''Smash'' had launched in February&nbsp;1966 with a cover price of 7d for 24&nbsp;pages. By March&nbsp;1969, although its cover price had not changed, circumstances had conspired to increase its page count, such that each issue now contained 36&nbsp;pages. In fact the page count jumped overnight from 24 pages to 36 pages (a fifty percent increase), with a consequent sharp rise in production costs, and so a marked decline in profit-per-copy.\n\nThe tipping point was issue 144, in which ''Smash'', ''Pow'' and ''Fantastic'' were merged into a single title. The recently created ''Smash and Pow'' lost its ''Daredevil'' and ''Spider-Man'' strips, which together had comprised a full third of each 24 page issue, but now had to accommodate both ''Thor'' and ''Fantastic Four'' from the discontinued titles, plus a whole slew of new British adventure strips (which were being added in preparation for the comic's impending transition to solely-British content).\n\nAll this could not be achieved within the standard ''Smash'' format of 24 pages. So IPC now \"bit the bullet\" and increased the page count, at a single bound, by fifty percent \u2014 a necessity if they were to achieve their intention of reproducing with ''Smash'' the successful formula which was buoying-up sales of their most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant'', both of which were 36-pagers (in effect, to produce another clone of them: an identical mix of adventure and humour, with an identical page count, at an identical price).\n\nOne fundamental difficulty for the ''Power Comics'', however, was always the stark economic truth that a kid could buy both ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'', at 3d each, and still have change left over, for what it cost to buy ''Smash!'', ''Wham!'' or ''Pow!'' at 7d each. However, the DC Thomson titles only had 16 pages, and this more than anything drove up the page count in ''Smash!'', from its original 24 pages to 36 pages, and eventually to 40 pages in 1970 (i.e. it might be more than double the price of a DC Thomson title but it was also more than double the size).<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.9</ref> The difficulty was that the much lower price of ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'' gave those titles a significant advantage, since a kid could choose to buy only one of them, at 3d \u2014 a winning competitive advantage which, as of 1966, would keep both of the DC Thomson titles afloat for more than 30 years to come.\n\nThe highly competitive nature of the UK's publishing industry meant margins were thin: a minimum number of sales each week were needed to reach break-even point, and the lower the cover price, the greater was the number of sales needed to reach that point; but the higher the cover price, the fewer were the number of sales that could actually be achieved.\n\nThe juvenile readers (or their parents) might be able to afford two or three comics a week, but by publishing five ''Power Comics'' IPC were pricing themselves out of the market. For the situation in Britain was not like that in America, where, with comics published just once a month, a child might afford five titles. In Britain, comics were published weekly.\n\nUnder those conditions the ''Power Comics'' were effectively competing with each other \u2014 a factor IPC were certainly aware of, as the letters pages in ''Smash'', in 1968, actually carried readers' complaints that they couldn't afford all five ''Power'' titles. The five together cost an astonishing three shillings and threpence a week (39d), to buy them all, far beyond the reach of the average child's weekly pocket money.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.13</ref>\n\nThe ''Power Comics'' were also competing with IPC's other titles, including [[Lion (comics)|Lion]], [[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]] and [[Buster (comics)|Buster]], potentially dragging the Group's entire line into bankruptcy. Rationalisation, by closing some of the titles, would produce an overall benefit, as it would dramatically cut IPC's production costs. Although it would mean fewer titles, as IPC's comics were actually competing against each other it ought to result in better sales for the survivors. In theory, there would be no overall loss of sales or revenue, provided readers switched from the closing titles to surviving IPC ones (rather than to rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] ones).\n\nAnother factor Odhams had not anticipated was the distribution of American comic books within the UK. Although this had always been a consideration, the volume of such comics arriving in Britain had traditionally been small, and their distribution haphazard. In 1968, distribution and quantity suddenly underwent a marked improvement: in America, Marvel Comics' owner, Martin Goodman, pulled off a business coup that overnight freed Marvel from a restrictive distribution agreement, which for a decade had limited it to publishing only 8 titles a month: Marvel was suddenly quadrupeling its monthly output, and dozens of new titles were flooding into Britain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emagazinepdf.com/2017/05/marvel_comics_-_the_untold_story/|title=''Marvel Comics \u2014 The Untold Story'', Sean Howe (2012)}}</ref> Odhams' black-and-white [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] reprints in their ''Power Comics'' range suddenly faced much more extensive competition from four-colour Marvel originals, and this began to harm sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/03/40-year-flashback-smash-regenerates.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: 40 Year Flashback: SMASH! regenerates|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=8 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the turbulent economic conditions, any part of IPC's business which was loss-making had no future. Standard industry practice was to close a comic or magazine if its revenues dipped ''towards'' the break-even point; publishers did not wait for a title to actually incur losses.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> Hence, merely to anticipate losses on the other four titles (''Pow'', ''Wham'', ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'') was enough to doom them. And the closures represented a major cost-cutting exercise, reducing the ongoing production costs on the ''Power Comics'' line by four-fifths.\n\nAs for actual losses incurred due to the sudden and unexpected nature of the problem, and the inability to quickly terminate the long-term contracts with the Americans, ''Smash'' as sole survivor couldn't hope to generate enough income on its own to meet these. In fact it didn't need to. The fortunate circumstance that the ''Power Comics'' were all published by Odhams Press Ltd, a subsidiary company with limited liability, meant that it was possible to ring-fence all debts on the Odhams publications within that one company, thus preventing any losses affecting the rest of the IPC Group (since IPC's other titles were all published by other IPC subsidiaries). Accordingly, with effect from 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' was transferred to IPC Magazines Ltd, a new IPC subsidiary formed during 1968,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/publisher/1946/|title=GCD :: Publisher :: IPC|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> leaving Odhams with no continuing titles, and ''Smash'' started again from scratch.<ref>[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//companysearch?disp=1&frfsh=1414205283&#result Odhams Press Ltd] continued in being until 7 January 1998, when it changed its name to Formpart (No.11) Limited, which still exists today; currently a dormant private company.</ref>\n\nDespite being the longest survivor, and inheriting many popular strips from the other four titles, ''Smash'' was only a limited success. It was plainly on shakey ground: for, hard on the heels of the closure of the other titles, in the spring of 1969 IPC quickly made extensive changes to it, dropping the last remaining Marvel superhero strips, to shed the expense of the licensing fee for using them (having already dropped ''Batman''), and ending many other strips too.\n\nIn consequence of the decision to discontinue the American reprints, as each ''Power Comic'' closed its superhero strips were given up. Only in the case of ''Fantastic'', where the existing contract with Marvel had some months to run, were those strips transferred to its replacement, the merged ''Smash incorporating Fantastic'', until the contract expired in March&nbsp;1969.\n\n''Smash'' then introduced a new cover feature, new strips, and free gifts. In all but name it was a new comic. Even so, it required yet another major shakeup 12 months later, in the spring of 1970, when further changes of editorial policy were imposed by new owners Reed International, who had bought out IPC that year. This resulted, among other things, in the dropping of the newly introduced ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature in favour of a new lead serial: an adventure series entitled ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test''.\n\nWithin the British market, boys' comics for the age group which was too old for titles such as ''Beano'', ''Dandy'' and ''Sparky'' tended to focus around adventure, sport and war (in titles such as ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''), or humour (in titles such as ''Buster''). In abandoning its superheroes, ''Smash'' sought to attract readers of both types, by offering traditional adventure as well as humour.\n\nTo place these changes in context, the ''Power Comics'' were not the only casualties of the turmoil at IPC in 1969. Hulton's long-running adventure comic ''Eagle'' was also cancelled, merging with Fleetway's ''Lion'' from 2 May 1969. The merged comic was known briefly as ''Lion and Eagle'', but quickly reverted simply to ''Lion''. The humour comic, ''Giggle'', aimed at the slightly younger market dominated by Fleetway's ''Buster'', was also dropped, being merged into ''Buster'' in the spring of 1969 to form ''Buster and Giggle''. As ever, the name change lasted only long enough to absorb the discontinued comic's readership: the reference to ''Giggle'' failed to see out the year, and by December the title had reverted to simply ''Buster'' once more.<ref>''Buster'' [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/ cover gallery] at Wordpress.com</ref> And ''Buster'', like ''Smash'', also now became a publication of the Group's newest subsidiary, IPC Magazines Ltd.\n\nThe surviving titles at both Odhams and at Fleetway were now transferred to a merged operation, at New Year 1969, as merely a part of IPC's newest division, IPC Magazines Ltd, and were placed under the responsibility of Jack Legrand, formerly the Managing Editor of Fleetway's juvenile publications.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.17</ref>\n\nA notable feature of the Odhams years was how few advertisements the comic carried. There were occasional quarter-page inserts, mainly advertising foreign Postage Stamps for stamp collectors, or Subbuteo table-football; but they were few and far between, and their combined total didn't usually exceed one page per issue. Reflecting its financial problems, the relaunched comic under IPC Magazines carried a significantly greater amount of advertising. One obvious change was the back cover (the only in-colour page apart from the front cover), which gradually began to carry colourful full-page advertisements. On the inside pages, too, there was a much more noticeable quantity of adverts: each issue typically carried 4 full-page ads, plus two half-page ads. It was a noticeable feature of the relaunch that the comic now expanded to 40 pages, in order to cope with the need to carry an extra 4 pages of advertising in each issue.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/ British Comics] website</ref>\n\nThis was a potentially significant new strategy, and a major change of policy. No longer did the profitability of the comic rest exclusively with the income derived from its sales figures. That sales income was now supplemented by advertising revenue, and without even having to sacrifice any significant amount of page space, nor cancel any strips, thanks to adding the additional pages.\n\n===Turmoil in 1967===\nThe events of 1968 were not even the first threat to the survival of the ''Power Comics''. Odhams had faced their first serious crisis in May 1967.\nThe editorial page warned readers in issue 68 that ''Smash'', initially printed by St Clements Press Ltd of London, had to find new printers within one month, or face closure. In the event, Odhams were able to sign a contract with Southernprint Ltd of Poole in Dorset in time to maintain publication.\n\n==''SMASH'' after Odhams==\n\nIn January 1969 Odhams ceased to exist as a publishing imprint, and ''Smash'' now became an IPC Magazines publication. Most of the consequences of the change didn't become apparent until the issue cover-dated 15 March, in which the comic changed dramatically. IPC had waited three months to relaunch ''Smash'', because, on the one hand, it needed some lead-time in which to ready new strips, and, on the other, in the publishing industry Spring was traditionally considered a good time to launch a new (in this case, a virtually new) comic.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/>\n\nWith the re-launch, ''Smash'' became the last ever British comic to feature a variety mix of adventure, humour and sports themed stories. Subsequent boys' comics featured exclusively sports, or war, or humour; such as ''[[Scorcher (magazine)|Scorcher and Score]]'' and ''[[Shoot (football magazine)|Shoot]]'' (which featured only soccer), and ''[[Action (comics)|Action]]'' and ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' (which featured only war stories).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075250/http://26pigs.com/smash/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Smash|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>  A hallmark of this policy was to be the even-handedness with which the editorial staff drew the multitude of reprint strips featured in the new ''Smash'' from both ''Lion'' and ''Buster'', in seeking to appeal to readers of both (i.e. mixing serious and humorous strips without discrimination).\n\nThe symbol of the change was the new cover feature, ''Warriors of the World''. This now replaced ''The Swots and Blots'', who, drawn by Mike Lacey, had occupied the cover during the final part of the Odhams years. Happily, ''The Swots and the Blots'' survived (and prospered) on the inside pages, now drawn by Leo Baxendale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: Christmas comics: Valiant 1971|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=17 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith the first relaunch issue (No.163) bearing a cover feature entitled ''Warriors of the World No.1'', the former numbering was discontinued.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/25870/ Smash! - Title Notes] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> To have maintained the original sequential numbering alongside the ''Warriors of the World'' series could only have caused confusion.\n\nThe revamped ''Smash'', now comprising 40 pages, featured all-British strips \u2014 adventure serials, humour strips, and sporting strips \u2014 many of which were reprints from ''Lion'', such as ''Eric the Viking'' (originally ''Karl the Viking''), ''The Battle of Britain'' (originally ''Britain in Chains''), and ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''; and others which were reprints from ''Buster'', such as ''Wacker'' (originally ''Elmer''), ''Monty Muddle - The Man from Mars'' (originally ''Milkiway - The Man from Mars''), and ''Consternation Street''; but strictly no American superheroes.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The number of reprint strips was another significant indicator of its troubled financial situation, reprints being significantly cheaper than commissioning new strips.\n\nOf the former Odhams strips, only a handful survived. Humour strips which continued were ''The Swots and the Blots'', ''Wiz War'' and ''Bad Penny''. Additionally, ''Percy's Pets'' made occasional appearances (but did not appear every week). Much mourned were the loss of ''The Cloak'' and ''The Man from BUNGLE'', dropped due to the waning popularity of spy spoofs (in 1968 the TV series ''The Man from UNCLE'' had been cancelled); and especially mourned was the loss of Ken Reid and ''The Nervs''.\n\nThe serious offerings fared even worse. For although the survivors appeared to include ''Sergeant Rock - Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'', in reality neither of these were genuinely from the Odhams era. Both had begun only a few weeks earlier, in issues 156 and 158 respectively. They were really a part of the relaunch, but were introduced slightly ahead of time to disguise that fact. The only genuine survivor from the adventure strips of the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', and even that had only begun with issue&nbsp;144, in November&nbsp;1968.\n\nAfter a few months, superheroes appeared to be making a comeback. The Editorial column admitted receiving complaints from readers about the loss of the Marvel strips; and, in the autumn of 1969, six months after the ''Fantastic Four'' and ''Thor'' had been dropped, an all-British superhero called Tri-Man appeared, debuting in the issue of 13 September, and the character also featured in the ''Smash'' Annual that Christmas. Some indication of the effort put into this character is the fact that he was given sole possession of the front cover of the Annual! The adventures of Johnny Meek featured a hero who had triple-superpowers, hence the name Tri-Man. He leaped about rooftops (shades of Spider-Man, from the long-vanished ''Pow''), and got his powers from a ray device once every 24 hours (shades of DC's ''Green Lantern''). But the strip did not prove popular, and quietly vanished in the reshuffles of 1970.\n\nIn the light of how few strips of any sort survived from the Odhams era, and given that none of the superhero strips survived at all (which, according to the Letters pages,<ref>It was a feature of the Odhams years that the comic included a page for readers' letters, like the American comics published by Marvel and DC on which it was based, but the Letters Page was dropped in March 1969 in favour of extra advertising space.</ref> were the most popular feature of the ''Power Comics''), it would be stretching the truth to say that ''Smash'' inherited the best of the Odhams strips. Stylistically, ''The Swots and the Blots'' was the most creative and sophisticated Odhams strip (save only ''The Nervs''), and it did survive. But it was only one strip. And ''The Nervs'', which was objectively a more sophisticated strip in 1968, did not.\n\nMoreover, the publisher was taking a significant risk by re-launching the former ''Power Comic'' as, in effect, a clone of IPC's most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''. The publisher hoped it could repeat the success of ''Valiant'' and ''Lion'' by copying their successful formula. Nevertheless, without its discontinued superheroes ''Smash'' had nothing unique about it that might attract new readers, compared to its stablemates \u2014 featuring as it did a mix of strips reprinted from (or based on the style of) ''Lion'' and ''Buster''.\n\n===IPC Humour Strips===\n\nAs under Odhams, humour continued to play a large part in the relaunched comic (in terms of the page count): not to the extent it did in ''Buster'', but at least as much as in ''Valiant'' or ''Lion''.\n\nWith the relaunch, ''The Swots and the Blots'' (one of the handful of surviving Odhams strips) moved from the prestigious front cover to the centre pages. Nevertheless, now drawn by Leo Baxendale it became a standard bearer for sophisticated artwork. Baxendale began a five-year run on the strip (beginning in ''Smash'' and continuing in its successor, ''Valiant and Smash'', with some fill-ins by Les Barton<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=2818|title=Smash! comic the swots and the blots- Leo Baxendale - Comics UK|website=comicsuk.co.uk}}</ref>), by adopting a new style, one which influenced many others in the comics field, just as his earlier ''Beano'' work had done; and in the process attaining a new, deliriously daft, high standard, one rarely approached by other strips.\n\nNew humour strips featured in the relaunch (new to ''Smash'' at any rate) included a half-page cartoon strip drawn by Nadal, entitled ''Big 'Ead'', detailing the humorous misadventures of a Mr&nbsp;Knowall character, summed up by the strip's catchphrase, continually bellowed at the lead character by his irate victims: \"''Have a care there, Big&nbsp;'Ead!''\" Reprinted from ''Buster'', where it had initially run \u2014 under the same title \u2014 from 28 May 1960 to 18 February 1961.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p43</ref>\n\n''Wacker'' was a single page cartoon strip, subtitled ''He's All at Sea''. Drawn at different times by Rafart and by Roy Wilson, it concerned the crazy antics in the Royal Navy of Mis-leading Seaman Wacker, who was forever driving the Captain of HMS Impossible toward a nervous breakdown. Despite the Liverpudlian overtones of his surname, Wacker seemed not to be a Scouser \u2013 which may have been because it was ''not'' his real name! The strip, although new to ''Smash'', had run in ''[[Buster (comics)|Buster]]'' from 29 October 1960 to 17 October 1964 under its real title, ''Elmer''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/|title=Buster 60s|date=29 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/>\n\nAnother humour strip new to ''Smash'' was the World War Two spoof, ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men From W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' Set in 1940, this featured an English scientist named Professor Nutt, who was a boffin inventing eccentric secret weapons for a department of the War Office known as W.H.E.E.Z.E. (short for Weapon Handling Early Experimental and Zoning Establishment), who was kept out of trouble by his Army \"minder\", Sgt&nbsp;'Lightning' Bolt. Nutt and Bolt were perpetually clashing with a cunning Nazi scientist named Doktor Skull. This was another reprint strip, perhaps from ''Lion''. As its title implies, it was born out of the earlier popularity of the ''Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' television series. However, the strip had only a short run in ''Smash'', being replaced after just 22&nbsp;issues.\n\nYet it was not only in the plainly cartoon-style strips that humour flourished in the new ''Smash''. Many of the ostensibly more serious offerings were, in reality, humour strips: in particular, ''His Sporting Lordship'' and ''The World Wide Wanderers''; but there was also a strong humorous undercurrent in the new lead serial, ''Master of the Marsh''.\n\n===IPC Sporting Strips===\n\nSporting strips were now the order of the day. Reflecting this, the new lead, on page 3, was ''Master of the Marsh'', drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]],<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\">Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Solano Lopez]</ref> a sports serial about Patchman, a strange hermit who lived in the East Anglian fens. He was appointed as the new sports master at Marshside Secondary School, nicknamed 'The Marsh', because he was the only person who could control the kids \u2014 a group of hooligans known as 'the Monsters of the Marsh'. There was an association of ideas between fens and marsh, reinforced by the fact that Patchman camped in the inaccessible heart of the marshes. He was a burly woodsman who had always lived in the Fens, and could communicate after a fashion with the local wildlife, for whom he acted as protector.\n\nThe strip initially featured humorous stories about the attempts of Knocker Reeves \u2013 the worst of the 'monsters' \u2013 to get the better of the new teacher. But eventually it transpired that Patchman was secretly the guardian of a collection of relics left behind by [[Hereward the Wake]], a warlord who had fought the Norman invaders in the Fens during the 11th Century. In this respect, the strip had an occasional tendency to embrace science fiction overtones.\n\nOf the sports-based stories, the only survivor from the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', which continued to prosper. Possibly feeling the strip was suffering in the credibility stakes, the new editorial team made a decision to change the name of King's manager, who bore the remarkable name (actually a nickname) of Blarney Stone! They threw Blarney out of the series and substituted a new manager with a less silly name. ''Ballyhoo Barnes'' wasn't all that much less silly, but it's the thought that counts! Even so, Blarney reappeared after a few weeks, by popular demand.\n\nThe most successful of the new sports-based strips (certainly the most long-running) was ''His Sporting Lordship'', drawn by Douglas Maxted.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html Douglas Maxted]</ref> This humorous hit proved so popular that it ultimately became one of the few to outlast ''Smash'' itself. Henry Nobbins had been a labourer on a building site until he inherited the title of Earl of Ranworth and five million pounds. Before he could touch the money, however, he had to become champion at a number of sports. He also had to evade the nefarious attentions of Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, who was a rival claimant to the fortune, and Parkinson's villainous henchman, Fred Bloggs.\n\nLord Henry, as he had now become, was more than ably assisted by his Butler, Jarvis, who he had inherited from the previous Earl. And Jarvis proved indispensable. Henry was never portrayed as anything other than an able athlete and a good natured bloke, leaving Jarvis to supply the cunning which was (frequently) needed to defeat the dastardly Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, and prevent Henry's ancestral home, Castle Plonkton, from being turned into a glue factory.\n\nThe relaunch included a short-lived football strip with humorous overtones, entitled ''The World-Wide Wanderers'', about a League football team composed of eleven players from eleven different countries \u2014 not such a funny joke today! Football manager Harry Kraft found himself a passenger on a ship passing through the Suez Canal; ships from all over the world called there, and the crews conducted impromptu soccer matches to while away the time in port. Some of the crews had been stranded there, and constant soccer practice (since there was nothing else to do) had caused them to develop fantastic footballing skills. Kraft shipped eleven of them, from as many different countries, back to England; and they used their highly unorthodox individual skills to play as a team in the old Fourth Division.\n\n===IPC Adventure Strips===\n\nThe other staple of the new ''Smash'' was adventure serials, and far and away the most successful of these was ''The Incredible Adventures of [[Janus Stark]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Janus%2BStark|title=British Comic Art}}</ref> written by Tom Tully,<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183041 Janus Stark] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> featuring an escapologist in Victorian London who appeared to be simply an unusual act on the music-hall stage, but who privately used his extraordinary abilities to battle against injustice. Stark had an unusually flexible bone structure, enabling him to get out of an astonishing variety of tight situations, thanks to training received in childhood from his mentor, Blind Largo. Drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]], there was more than a touch of Reed Richards, from the departed ''Fantastic Four'' strip, in Stark's uncanny abilities.<ref>Stark's flexible bone structure, which was the basis of his career as an escapologist in the theatres, was perhaps more akin to ''Rubberman'', a character who had featured in ''Smash'' in 1966</ref> Lopez's dark, moody artwork also gave the strip a perfect 19th Century setting.<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\"/> The strip was one of the few to survive the merger of ''Smash'' into ''Valiant'' in 1971, and is still well remembered today. As a mark of its popularity, from week 30 it replaced ''Master of the Marsh'' as the lead serial on page 3 (swapping places with the latter, which was thus relegated to an inconspicuous location on pages 12 and 13).\n\nThis brings up the matter of economics once more. Solano Lopez was a foreign illustrator, born in the Argentine, who worked at a studio in Spain. For reasons of cost, IPC had taken a policy decision to source artwork from cheaper sources outside the UK.<ref name=\"blogs.birminghammail.net\"/> Along with the presence in the new ''Smash'' of reprint strips, which were much cheaper than commissioning new strips, this is yet another indicator of the financial pressure the comic was still under, and the absolute necessity of cutting production costs to the bone in order to make it financially viable.\n\nAnother long-running adventure strip was ''The Battle of Britain'', in which secret agent Simon Kane fought against Baron Rudolph, a usurper who had seized control of Britain using a secret weapon. The weapon emitted a sound wave which paralysed anyone who wasn't protected against it. Rudolph set up a police state, similar in emblems and uniforms to medieval England at the time of King John, and Kane led the resistance against him.\n\nIn spite of the title, the strip had no connection with the Second World War! Drawn for the initial 40 issues by Geoff Campion, and thereafter by [[John Stokes (comics)|John Stokes]],<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p109</ref> it was in fact a reprint; hence it, too, was an indication of the comic's troubled financial status (reprints being cheaper than new strips). It originally ran in ''[[Lion (comics)|Lion]]'' from 29 February 1964 to 28 May 1966 under various titles including ''Britain in Chains'' and ''The Battle for Britain'', where the hero was called Vic Gunn. The editorial staff of ''Smash'' took a decision to change the names of the leading characters from Gunn and Barrel (i.e. ''gun barrel''), to slightly less absurd ones; and so were born secret agent Simon Kane and his assistant Tubby. This had been a very long-running strip in ''Lion'', so much so that ''Smash'' actually ceased publication \u2014 in April 1971 \u2014 before it had reprinted the entire run from ''Lion'', and in the final issue created an (unconvincing) new ending for the serial.\n\n''Rebbels on the Run'' was another adventure serial, featuring three young brothers whose surname was Rebbel, who run away from an orphanage to avoid being split up. After a few months on the run, the strip took an amazing turn and \u2014 renamed ''The Rebbel Robot'' \u2014 became a science fiction serial, when the boys discovered that their late father's mind was preserved within the brain of a robot, which became their unofficial guardian. With it they embarked on a quest to track down a criminal known as The Genie, who had murdered their real father \u2014 who, in a further improbable turn of events, turned out to be a secret agent!\n\n''Eric the Viking'', a continuing serial featuring its eponymous Viking hero, and set in the Dark Ages, was another reprint from ''Lion'', where it had run under the title ''Karl the Viking'', as a set of 13 stories, from 29 October 1960 until 29 September 1964, written by Ken Bulmer.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\">Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p108</ref> The change of name to Eric probably reflects on the continuing fame (during the 1960s) of a real-life Viking leader in Dark Age Britain, Eric Bloodaxe, who history records was King in Viking York in the 10th Century. The strip is well remembered under its original title, as it was drawn by a famous comics artist, Don Lawrence.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Don Lawrence]</ref><ref>[http://www.donlawrence.co.uk/shop/index.php?hg=2&sg=35 Deluxe hardback collection of ''Karl the Viking'' strips] by Don Lawrence</ref> Eric (and Karl) fought a weird but impressive collection of legendary and fantasy monsters, in sword-and-sorcery epics which had some reflections in Lawrence's art for his contemporary work on the highly regarded all-colour science fiction strip ''[[The Trigan Empire]]'' then running in ''Look and Learn''. This was not even the first reprint: retitled ''Swords of the Sea Wolves'' it had initially been reprinted in ''Lion'', in part, between 1 October 1966 and 7 October 1967, with the lead character renamed Rolf the Viking.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\"/> And it would later be reprinted again, in the European version of ''Vulcan'': on that occasion translated into German and retitled 'Kobra'.\n\nTwo of the new IPC adventure strips \u2014 ''Sergeant Rock Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'' \u2014 were introduced five or six weeks early, in an attempt to conceal how few Odhams strips had actually survived, by making these appear to be existing strips although they were not. World War Two was the setting for the former, which, with occasional stories drawn by John Vernon,<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p88</ref> recounted the adventures of the 'Red Devils' of the Parachute Regiment. Initially, Sgt Rock was merely a narrator, introducing stories featuring other characters, so that it was actually tales-of-the-parachute-regiment, rather than tales of Sgt Rock himself. This was a device for reprinting old war stories from other comics: the strip had originally appeared in Fleetway's ''Hurricane'', from 4 July 1964 to 8 May 1965, entitled ''Paratrooper'', and continued in ''Tiger'' when that title absorbed ''Hurricane'' in the issue dated 15 May 1965. The reprints in ''Smash'' were reasonably successful, running for a year; and Sergeant Rock eventually featured as more than just narrator, with later editions sending him into action with the SAS, and marking the change by altering the title to ''Sergeant Rock - Special Air Service''. This change was noticeable, also, by a change of artist; seemingly \u2014 from the similarity of style \u2014 to the artist on the discontinued wartime strip, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''.\n\n''Bunsen's Burner'' was a short-lived strip, lasting just a few weeks.<ref>It was discontinued during the reshuffles of August 1969, when various changes were quietly made to the comic over the course of a month.</ref> This was an adventure yarn with humorous overtones \u2013 its humorous content being trailed in its title: a reference to an item familiar to most schoolboys from their Chemistry classes. Ben Bunsen was the owner of a vintage car, which was known as \"the Burner\" because it was so old it was steam-driven! Like an old-fashioned steam train it had a boiler which had to be stoked, as it ran on coal instead of petrol. Ben and his pal had to drive the Burner around the world, as a condition of Ben inheriting his uncle's fortune; but a rival claimant (shades of ''His Sporting Lordship''!) was secretly out to stop them.\n\nAnother adventure strip which had a sadly brief run, lasting only 47 weeks, but which is very well-remembered today, was ''Cursitor Doom''. In this spooky and atmospheric series,<ref>The strip had various artists during its one year run, but far and away the most effective of them was the talented Eric Bradbury, and it is mainly his serials from which the strip's enduring reputation derives</ref> Cursitor Doom, master investigator of the strange and mystic, who openly practiced sorcery in the strip, battled against the dark forces of evil, ably assisted by the pounding fists of his assistant, Angus McCraggan. Doom battled against genuine spirits and sorcerers, in tales including ''The Case of Kalak the Dwarf'', ''The Sorcerer's Talisman'' and ''The Dark Legion of Mardarax'', in the latter encountering a haunted (and unstoppable) Roman Legion brought back to \"life\" by the evil Mardarax. Doom's pet Raven, Scarab, who could write messages in the dust for Angus McCraggan, by scratching with his claw, was often of more help to Doom in these serials than was the perpetually baffled McCraggan.\n\nThe ''Cursitor Doom'' strip was drawn by Geoff Campion (including ''The Return of the Hunter''), and \u2013 more effectively \u2013 by [[Eric Bradbury]] (including the magnificently atmospheric ''Dark Legion of Mardarax'').\n\n===Changes in August 1969===\n\nAfter 22 weeks, in August&nbsp;1969, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' was dropped, and replaced from the 23rd&nbsp;issue by a more serious World War Two strip entitled ''Send For... Q-Squad'', which dealt with the adventures of a hand picked group of six specialists, who were assigned to unusual missions that required special expertise both in the air and on the ground. This, too, in keeping with the need to cut costs, was a reprint, originally published in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 7 March 1964 under the title ''Phantom Force 5''.<ref>[http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html ''Phantom Force Five''] in ''Buster''</ref><ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p36</ref>\n\nThis was another of those drawn, initially, by one of IPC's best British artists, [[Eric Bradbury]], at other times by the Spanish-based artist Luis Bermejo Rojo,<ref>[http://smashpages.net/2015/12/15/rip-luis-bermejo-rojo/ Career of Luis Bermejo] at SmashPages.net</ref> and in its final months mainly by Fred Holmes.<ref>Comics artist [http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html Fred Holmes] at BusterComic.com</ref> Because the strip had a regrettably short run in ''Smash'' (from 16 August 1969 to 30 January 1970 only), most of the run features art by Eric Bradbury.\n\nIt was marked out as a reprint by its unique style \u2014 which was both different from, and grimmer than, all the other strips. Whereas Sgt Rock emulated Lord Henry (and Janus Stark), by maintaining a huge and confident smile, regardless of how much trouble he was in, no one in ''Q-Squad'' ever stopped looking worried. Its reprint status was also signalled by the fact that Q-Squad was plainly ''not'' the original name of the team. Some panels showed evidence of the name having been inserted over a previous one: a change in the lettering style for the name 'Q-Squad' and any adjacent words \u2014 which used a different handwriting in a cruder style wherever the name appeared, but nowhere else.\n\nIn the same issue, a serious footballing serial entitled ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'' began, replacing the departed \u2014 and rather more humorous \u2014 ''World Wide Wanderers''. Hard-as-nails former prison sports instructor 'Toff' Morgan (so called for his habit of always wearing a top-hat) took over the management of ailing First Division side Haversham Hotspurs. Morgan began to rebuild the team by 'framing' ex-criminals who he'd known while working in various prisons, forcing them to sign on with the club in order to make use of their dishonest skills as footballing talents. These convicts became the 'handcuff hotspurs' of the title. The club's former manager, Reg Jessup, tried constantly to sabotage Morgan's efforts, in order to persuade the Directors to re-appoint him instead.\n\nSix months earlier, various humour strips had been introduced as replacements for the (far more surreal) humour of [[Ken Reid (comics)|Ken Reid]], whose strip ''The Nervs'' had so disturbed IPC's management. Now another was forthcoming, and one which reflected the pervasive sporting theme of the relaunched comic. ''The Touchline Tearaways'' (replacing ''Big 'Ead'') was another new football-themed strip, featuring three mad-keen supporters of Grimshot United: a totally useless Football League team, perpetually in danger of being relegated as it was made up entirely of ailing and decrepit players. Each week the Tearaways \u2014 Hairy, Lug'oles and Clever Dick \u2014 would execute some scheme from the touchline to help Grimshot win that week's fixture, usually involving a battle of wits with officials from the Ministry of Football, who, not unnaturally, tried to put a stop to the Tearaways well-intentioned cheating.\n\nThe name of the club, Grimshot United, was a humorous indication that the team was not very good (i.e. that the players were \"grim shots\"). Each strip featured a single match, with a plot based around helping the team overcome that week's opponent. Clever Dick masterminded all the ploys used in helping Grimshot, and apart from occasional words of congratulation or encouragement he was generally the only \"Tearaway\" who had dialogue in the strip. Hairy and Lug'oles tended to be merely a pair of walking visual gags: Hairy's features were perpetually invisible behind a vast mass of long black hair that covered his entire face and head, and Lug'oles had a pair of enormous ears.\n\nThese three new strips represented a minor change of emphasis, replacing two of the more whimsical offerings with two entirely serious strips \u2014 even though the third new entry (which was only a single-page) was simply one outright cartoon strip replacing another.\n\nThus, within six months, a number of the strips introduced in the relaunch had already bitten the dust. And more changes were looming.\n\n===The 2nd Relaunch : 1970===\n\nThe most obvious problem faced by the new-look ''Smash'' was the constant \"churn\": the incessant turnover of strips. Without its solidly popular superhero strips to rely on, the editorial staff seemed pathologically incapable of settling on a fixed line-up.<ref>Continual change of line-up was not a problem unique to ''Smash'', but was shared by all IPC's comics of this period. Editors struggled to find strips sufficiently popular to halt the decline in weekly sales; but making so many changes was self-defeating, because it harmed reader loyalty.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the changes made in August&nbsp;1969, further changes made at the start of 1970 left ''Smash'' looking very different from its appearance in the wake of the relaunch just 12&nbsp;months earlier. A vast number of new strips were added, in a second re-launch, such that only half of those introduced in March&nbsp;1969 now survived, although those which continued included ''Master of the Marsh'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'', ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''Battle of Britain'', ''Eric the Viking'', ''Wacker'', ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'', ''The Swots and the Blots'', and ''Percy's Pets'' \u2014 the latter two now being the only remaining Odhams strips.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\nDiscontinued were ''King of the Ring'' (last survivor of the serious strips from the Odhams era), ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service'', and ''Cursitor Doom''. Three of the strips only recently introduced were also dropped, namely the wartime ''Q-Squad'', British superhero ''Tri-Man'', and the humour strip ''The Touchline Tearaways''.\n\nThe first changes in 1970 occurred in the issue dated 24 January, when three new strips appeared, all reprints from ''Buster'': ''The Kid Commandos'', ''Consternation Street'', and ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' (originally titled ''Milkiway \u2013 The Man from Mars''). These were introduced as part of a relaunch of the comic: by once again bringing in some of the changes a few weeks ahead of the relaunch, as had been done in the Spring of 1969, the publisher hoped to disguise the true extent of the changes.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\n''The Kid Commandos'' was a war story about three cockney children stranded in occupied France in World War Two. Drawn by Tom Kerr, the Sparrow children \u2014 Tommy, Jan and Podge \u2014 were on the run from the Germans each week, in a single page strip set in 1940. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it appeared from 9 January to 24 July 1965, under the imaginative title ''The Sparrows Go To War''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref>\n\nIn the humour strip ''Consternation Street'' drawn by Reg Parlett (the title spoofed that of the popular British television soap opera, ''Coronation Street''), which was usually a one-page strip, a collection of unlikely neighbours rubbed shoulders in a very small street. Watched over by the dim-witted Constable Clott were the Snobbs and the Ardupps, Colonel Curry & Caesar (his dog), Miss Primm and her pets, Cutprice the Grocer, and Roger the Lodger. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it had originally run \u2013 under the same title \u2013 between 9 January and 23 October 1965.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p44</ref> Parlett was also known from his other humour strips in ''Buster'' including ''Rent-A-Ghost Ltd'', ''The Happy Family'' and ''Bonehead''.<ref>[http://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=1992 Reg Parlett's contributions to ''Valiant'' and ''Buster''] (including the long running ''Billy Bunter'' strip in ''Valiant'', which continued in ''Valiant and Smash'')</ref>\n\nThe half-page humour strip ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' recounted the misadventures of spaceman Monty Muddle (a name rather less convincing than the character's original name, ''Milkiway''). It originally ran in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 10 March 1962, with art credited to Nadal/Rafart.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/> He flew about in his small bubble-domed spacecraft trying to make friends with the Earth people. However, due to his misunderstanding of Earth customs, his every attempt at contact ended in disaster; and each strip would typically end with the catchphrase ''I'll try again next week!''\n\nThe 7 February issue then saw a full re-launch: with more free gifts, another new cover feature, and no less than eight new strips (making an astonishing eleven strips added since the beginning of the year).\n\nThe ''Warriors of the World'' covers had run into a problem, in that war stories were no longer a strong element of ''Smash'', which had dropped the humour strip ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' some time earlier. When it was decided to also drop ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Paratrooper'' (by then renamed ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service''), and ''Q&nbsp;Squad'', the cover feature had to go too. It was not practical to advertise war stories on the cover if there were no war stories inside!\n\nThe newly added ''Kid Commandos'' did not count as a war story in this context, since the three fugitive children did not do any conventional fighting. The strip was more like a souped-up version of the discontinued ''Rebbels on the Run''.\n\nAccordingly, after forty seven weeks<ref>46 issues featuring the ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature, and one Christmas issue</ref> the ''Warriors of the World'' series was ended. Instead, the issue dated 7 February 1970 began ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'', written by Angus Allan and drawn by the ever-popular Eric Bradbury.<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183036 ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'']</ref> Henceforth each week's cover featured a full-page splash advertising the task which adventurer Simon Test would undertake in a new strip on the inside pages. This strip proved so successful that when the original thirteen-week series was completed (featuring one task each week), Simon Test was given a new series of adventures, extending his hold on the cover indefinitely. He would prove particularly enduring, being one of the few strips to ultimately survive the merger with ''Valiant'' in 1971.\n\n''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'' saw him undertake a quest for immortality by attempting the thirteen tasks of the Pharaoh Thot, believing this to be the only way to save his life, having been deceived into believing he has only a few months to live. The sinister Jabez Coppenger secretly desired Test's death as a means of restoring his own youth. This serial introduced the mute servant Karka, who would ultimately become Test's friend and assistant.\n\nTest then went on to the more lengthy series of adventures entitled ''Simon Test and the Curse of the Conqueror'', where he battled the twenty servants of the evil Ezekiel Spar, the self-styled Conqueror. This pitted him against twenty athletes and champions, each of whom was under the hypnotic control of Spar, who implanted in them an in-built impulse to kill Simon Test.\n\nNew supporting strips introduced in the 7 February issue included ''Threat of the Toymaker'', ''The Pillater Peril'', ''Birdman of Baratoga'', ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'', and three humour strips with a common supernatural element: ''Sam's Spook'' (drawn by Leo Baxendale), ''The Haunts of Headless Harry'', and ''Ghost Ship''.\n\nIn ''Threat of the Toymaker'', drawn by Solano Lopez, a criminal scientist named Doctor Droll escaped from Garstone Prison with the aid of an army of remote controlled mechanical toys he had constructed, along the way taking the Prison Governor's children, Pam and Peter Keen, as hostages. Hampered by the children at every turn, Droll finds himself on the run, pursued by the Police wherever he goes. The idea of using radio controlled toys in the strip was scarcely original, since it was a straight lift from the ''House of Dolmann'', which was then running in ''Valiant'', as well as from the ''General Jumbo'' strip in ''The Beano''. The strip was scarcely original either: having been first published in ''Buster'', under the title ''The Toys of Doom'', between 27 February 1965 and 13 January 1968 (and in which it would be reprinted\u2014in part\u2014between 3 May and 6 September 1986, under the title ''The Terror Toys''), it was also reprinted in ''Eagle'', under its original title ''The Toys of Doom''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\"/>\n\n''The Pillater Peril'' saw David Pillater return to Pillater House, his ancestral home on the Cornish coast, which he is to inherit on his 21st&nbsp;birthday. Along with his four cousins and his Uncle Bernard, David is imperilled by Francis Pillater, an ancestor who has seemingly returned from the dead. Francis had an evil reputation for his misdeeds in the 16th century, but was thought to have perished in a shipwreck during a storm at sea. Blaming the family for his troubles, he sets out for revenge by kidnapping them one by one. The strip had only a short run, but when discontinued it did, unusually, seemingly come to a natural conclusion (rather than merely wrapping-up many continuing plot threads unconvincingly in the final panel).\n\n''Birdman from Baratoga'' was an adventure strip about a boy who grew up on a Pacific island with only the company of birds, and learned from them the secret of flight. By the use of a feather cape, he was able to glide through the air like an albatros. When an English sailor is castaway on the island, called Baratoga, they escape together on a raft and set out on a series of adventures in the Pacific, beginning by hunting down the desperado who has stolen the man's pearl-fishing yacht, ''Enterprise''. ''Birdman from Baratoga'' was perhaps loosely based on a humour strip which had run in ''Buster'' during 1968: ''Captain Swoop \u2013 He's Half Man, Half Bird, Half Wit''.\n\nIn a very atypical move, prompted by IPC's on-going financial problems (in the year in which they were taken over by the Reed Group), the editorial team now resurrected one of the old strips which had run in ''Wham'' under Odhams, drawn by Gordon Hogg. ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'' featured two young lads from Liverpool who fancied themselves as musicians, spoke in Liverpudlian slang (even the original title of the strip was derived from a slang Scouse term for a native of Liverpool: 'wacker'), sported Beatles-style haircuts, and always carried guitars. This was a reprint of ''The&nbsp;Wacks'', which had run in ''Wham'' during 1964, reprinted here with only the title and the names changed. Spoofing the pop group ''The Beatles'', it was an odd choice to run it a year ''after'' that group's demise. It was, though, a popular item: this 1964 strip had already been reprinted, under the title ''Birk 'n' 'Ed, the Mersey Dead-Beats'', from 30 January 1965 in Fleetway's ''Hurricane''.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p.89</ref><ref>Spoken quickly for comic effect, the names of the two characters were intended to sound like that of a district in Liverpool called Birkenhead</ref>\n\nA common supernatural theme linked the three new humour strips. In ''Sam's Spook'', drawn by the ubiquitous Leo Baxendale, Sam was a schoolboy with a ghostly pal called Spooky, who used his powers to humorous effect on Sam's behalf. The strip mostly consisted of Sam's school friends catching Spooky doing a bit of ghostly cheating in order to help Sam win at sports or football, and Sam doing a lot of running away to avoid a bashing.\n\n''The Haunts of Headless Harry'' featured the amiable ghost of a 16th-century soldier who had been beheaded. Harry's head and body led separate but related ghostly existences, with the body carrying the head around everywhere, and both of them were able to talk. Harry's humorous adventures invariably involved misplacing his head; such as going to the cinema and, on leaving, calling at the cloakroom to collect it (as though it was a hat), and being asked by the attendant to identify it among all the other ghostly heads left there during the film.\n\nThe other new humour strip was ''Ghost Ship'', in which the spirit of an ancient galleon, and the ghosts of its pirate crew, sailed the Seven Seas making mischief, but usually coming off worst.\n\nFurther changes followed: such that fully thirteen strips had been introduced since the start of 1970. In the issue dated 27 June 1970, a new humour strip began entitled ''Moonie's Magic Mate'', about a schoolboy, Barry Moon, who finds a Genie in a dusty old bottle. In the issue dated 29 August, a humour strip titled ''The Fighting Three'' began, featuring the misadventures of three men: globe-trotters McGinty, Hambone and Weasel are travelling the world, trying to raise enough money to start their own construction company, but get into fights \u2013 and jail! \u2013 wherever they go. Drawn by Carlos Cruz, this was another reprint from ''Buster'', where, under its original title ''Mighty McGinty'', the strip had run in 1964.<ref>Published 29 February to 17 October 1964: ''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref> And finally, in the last addition before the comic's closure, a strip entitled ''Tyler the Tamer'' was launched in early 1971, about the adventures of the greatest film stuntman in the world. Dropped to make room for these were ''Kid Commandos'', ''Threat of the Toymaker'' and ''The Pillater Peril'' (the ''Pillater'' saga seemingly reaching a natural conclusion, instead of merely being summarily abandoned).\n\n==Merger with ''Valiant''==\n\nIn mid-November 1970, production on ''Smash'' (and many other IPC titles, including ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'') came to a halt due to a printers' strike, and no editions were published for the next three months.<ref name=SP2010 /> By the time the strike was settled, in February of the following year, irreparable damage had been done to the comic's circulation, as its young readers had turned elsewhere in the intervening 11&nbsp;weeks. Similar harm had been suffered by ''Valiant''. In consequence of this latest financial disaster, after eight issues, in April&nbsp;1971 the two titles were merged in an attempt to combine their surviving circulation. For a brief time the merged comic was entitled ''Valiant and Smash'' (10 April to 18 September 1971<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/11/27/valiant-70s/|title=Valiant 70s|date=27 November 2018}}</ref>), before reverting to simply ''Valiant''.\n\nSome strips from ''Smash'' survived in the new comic, including ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'' and ''The Swots and the Blots'', but most were lost,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180805023305/http://26pigs.com/valiant/index.html Merger with ''Valiant''] - ''Valiant and Smash''</ref> although the ''Smash'' Annual continued to appear for many years afterwards (continuing, in fact, until the 1976 Annual, published in the autumn of 1975). A lot of the strips thereby continued to appear each year, including many which had not even survived into ''Valiant'', long after ''Smash'' had ceased publication as a comic.<ref name=\"British Comics website\">{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/|title=Smash!|date=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe sports themed ''His Sporting Lordship'' had enjoyed perhaps the greatest popularity, surviving the shake-ups of 1969 and 1970, and then surviving even the merger with ''Valiant'', though it was to last only a few months in its new home, finally ending in December&nbsp;1971. However, it was revived in the 1972 ''Smash'' Annual, published at Christmas&nbsp;1971, and returned year after year: becoming the regular cover feature of the Annuals.<ref name=\"British Comics website\"/>\n\nThe merged title was dominated by ''Valiant'', which contributed nine strips consisting of twenty pages; whereas ''Smash!'' was represented by only four strips, totalling a meager nine pages: ''Janus Stark'', ''The Swots & The Blots'', ''Simon Test'', and ''His Sporting Lordship''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kidr77.blogspot.com/2012/10/a-valiant-attempt-at-smashing.html|title=CRIVENS!

Maybe it was only marginally profitable, but no title could have survived such a lengthy loss of production.

Subsequent comics would survive only by ruthlessly focusing on narrow, sectional interests: such as all-sports, all-war, or all-humour;<ref>The most successful of these was ''Doctor Who Weekly'', which still exists today, although it had to become a monthly title in order to survive (and adopt a magazine format)</ref> just as the American market had already specialised into all-funnies, all-horror, and all-superhero titles.

Its population stood at 47,607 in 1982, 75,425 in 1992 and the preliminary result of the 2002 census suggests a population of 88,000. In 2012, the city's population was estimated at 100,900 people. It is a centre for steel and fertiliser production in the country.\n\nKwekwe and neighbouring [[Redcliff, Zimbabwe|Redcliff]] are the headquarters of [[Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company]] ([[ZISCO]]), the country's largest steelworks. It also hosts the Zimbabwe Iron and Smelting Company (ZIMASCO), the largest ferrochrome producer, and one of the biggest power generating plants, [[ZESA|ZESA-Munyati]], in [[Munyati]], a suburb of Kwekwe. Kwekwe is Zimbabwe's richest city in terms of minerals.\n\n==Background==\nKwekwe town was founded in 1898 as a [[gold mining]] town, and hosts Zimbabwe's [[National Mining Museum, Zimbabwe|National Mining Museum]]. The town remains an industrial centre of the country. The name stems from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word \"isikwekwe\", which means \"scurvy\", \"mange\" or \"scab\".<ref>THIS IS OUR LAND. Stories and Legends of the two Rhodesias by Frank Clements. p.43, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, 1963.</ref> Popular belief states that Kwekwe is named after the croaking noise made by the nearby river's frogs.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town is situated on Zimbabwe's [[Highveld]] at an altitude of {{convert|1220|m|ft}}, above sea level. It is located in the tropics but its high altitude modifies this to a warm temperate climate.\nThe average annual temperature is {{convert|19|C|F}}.<ref>Average monthly data 1971 \u2013 2000, GHCN Climate averages</ref> As with much of the Highveld, summers are long but not hot as the temperature depends on the amount of cloudiness and indirectly the amount of rain received. Drought years are hotter than wet years. The climate is hot and wet during the summer rainy season from mid November to mid March, with cool, dry weather from May to mid-August in the winter season, and warm dry weather from August to mid November. Winters are characterised mainly by their cold nights, with an average minimum temperature of {{convert|7|C|F}}, and are the sunniest time of the year.\n\n<div style=\"width:80%;\">\n{{Weather box\n|location = Kwekwe (1961\u20131990)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 28.4\n|Feb high C = 28.2\n|Mar high C = 28.3\n|Apr high C = 27.6\n|May high C = 25.5\n|Jun high C = 25.5\n|Jul high C = 23.3\n|Aug high C = 26.0\n|Sep high C = 29.5\n|Oct high C = 31.1\n|Nov high C = 29.5\n|Dec high C = 28.3\n|year high C = 27.6\n|Jan low C = 16.9\n|Feb low C = 16.5\n|Mar low C = 15.0\n|Apr low C = 12.8\n|May low C = 8.7\n|Jun low C = 8.7\n|Jul low C = 5.9\n|Aug low C = 7.8\n|Sep low C = 11.7\n|Oct low C = 15.2\n|Nov low C = 16.5\n|Dec low C = 16.9\n|year low C = 12.7\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 158.7\n|Feb rain mm = 119.1\n|Mar rain mm = 62.6\n|Apr rain mm = 29.1\n|May rain mm = 5.3\n|Jun rain mm = 2.0\n|Jul rain mm = 0.5\n|Aug rain mm = 0.4\n|Sep rain mm = 5.4\n|Oct rain mm = 24.8\n|Nov rain mm = 85.4\n|Dec rain mm = 144.6\n|year rain mm = 637.9\n|unit rain days = \n|Jan rain days = 13\n|Feb rain days = 10\n|Mar rain days = 6\n|Apr rain days = 3\n|May rain days = 0\n|Jun rain days = 0\n|Jul rain days = 0\n|Aug rain days = 0\n|Sep rain days = 1\n|Oct rain days = 4\n|Nov rain days = 9\n|Dec rain days = 13\n|year rain days = 59\n|source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organization]]<ref name= WMO>{{cite web\n| url = http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=951\n| title = World Weather Information Service \u2013 Kwekwe\n| publisher = World Meteorological Organization\n| accessdate = 25 October 2015}}</ref>\n|date=October 2015\n}}</div>\n\n== Culture and recreation ==\nKwekwe has always been a festive and social centre with a mild political atmosphere. It is a multi ethnic city. In and around the city one is assured to come across [[Shona language|Shona]], [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]], [[Ikalanga language|Karanga]], [[Chewa language|Chewa]], [[Venda]], [[Tonga]] and [[Nambya]] speaking people.\n\n[[Association Football]] and [[cricket]] are the main sports in the city, just as in the rest of the country.  Kwekwe hosts one of Zimbabwe's major provincial cricket sides \u2013 the [[Mid West Rhinos]]. Their cricket ground has been host to several first class and one day matches, and has even hosted some internationals, most notably against Kenya. Kwekwe also hosts a variety of touring sides versus Zimbabwe 'A' teams. Almost all of the schools in Kwekwe play cricket.\n\nKwekwe hosts two [[football (soccer)]] clubs, the Lancashire Steel (named after a local steel company) and Kwekwe Cables. [[The Kwekwe Queens Club]] is also a reputable sporting establishment, with a sizeable membership and drinking crowd. [[Lancashire Steel FC]], the main team in the city, has been in the [[Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League|PSL]] a number of times. At its home stadium, [[Baghdad Stadium]], it has hosted a number of big teams in the country, including [[Dynamos (Zimbabwe)|Dynamos FC]], and [[Highlanders FC]].\n\nGolf tournaments are hosted by [[Kwekwe Golf Club]].\n\n[[Tongai Moyo]],[Bantuman I], [[L kat]] and [[Bob Nyabinde]] are popular singers in the country who hail from Kwekwe. [Bantu Entertainment Zimbabwe] is one of the city's arts and culture promotion stable that is fighting to develop the performing arts in the City. Kwekwe is a major stop for many music groups in the country who perform at [[Mbizo Stadium]]. The cricketer [[Charles Coventry (Zimbabwean cricketer)|Charles Coventry]] also hails from Kwekwe \u2013 he is best known for equalling the ODI World Record of 194 runs in an inning. It is also the birthplace of former cricketer [[Norman Featherstone]].\n\nA [[Kwekwe stadium stampede|stampede at Mbizo Stadium]] killed 11 people in 2014.\n\n== Education ==\nKwekwe is well endowed with many educational facilities. Most are state-run. For university education, the closest facilities are 60&nbsp;km away in [[Gweru]], the [[Midlands Province]] capital, at [[Midlands State University]].\n\n;Primary and secondary schools\nLike most urban areas in the country, the city of Kwekwe is serviced by many schools. Amaveni High School, [[Mbizo High School]] and [[Manunure High School]] recently expanded to offer [[A-level]] classes. Amaveni High serves the high density suburb of Amaveni while Mbizo and Manunure serve the high density suburb of [[Mbizo]]. Shungu High School is located about 16&nbsp;km from Kwekwe.  It is a Catholic run school. The middle-class suburbs close to the city centre have [[Kwekwe High School]] and [[Goldridge College]], plus the primary schools including Goldridge Primary School, Fitchlea Primary School, Kwekwe Junior High School and Globe & Phoenix Primary School, Maryward Primary School and [[Sally Mugabe Primary School]]. There is almost one primary school for about four sections of the high density areas\n\n;Tertiary education\nKwekwe Polytechnic is the only tertiary education institution in Kwekwe. [[Sable Chemicals]] and [[ZISCO Steel]] run apprenticeship programs with the polytechnic and with other universities in Zimbabwe. Recently the polytechnic has started offering B-tech degrees. Plans are underway to convert it into a modern university.\n\n== Residential areas ==\n\n[[Image:Kwekwe Scene.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A scene close to the bus terminus in Kwekwe, 2006]]\n[[Image:Mbizo One Extension.jpg|250px|thumb|right| Mbizo One Extension, a new addition to one of the oldest suburbs in the town, 2006]]\n\nThe residential suburbs in the city are divided into higher and lower density areas. The main suburbs in the town are [[Mbizo Township]], [[Amaveni Township]], Msasa Park, Goldrich, Hillandale, Newtown, Gaika, Beverly Hills, Chicago, Golden Acres, Southwood and Fitchlea.<ref>[http://www.iconnect-online.org/Stories/Story.import5184 iConnect Online; sharing knowledge on ICT4D \u2013 Computer training &amp; e-commerce<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023184304/http://www.iconnect-online.org/Stories/Story.import5184 |date=23 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nKwekwe's suburbs are divided into low cost housing, residential housing and also industrial and railway housing. Kwekwe has only one set of traffic lights which are just outside the city centre on a road leading to the high density suburb of [[Mbizo]].\n\n[[Amaveni Township]] and [[Mbizo Township]] are low-cost housing suburbs. These two [[slum]] areas were primarily built close to the mines for the use of mineworkers, and the most successful businesses, especially local bars known as [[beer hall]]s, serve this customer base. Then there are the middle-class homes in the Fitchlea area. This area is made up of big three- and four-bedroom homes and is still home to wealthy families despite the collapse of the economy.\n\nMasasa Park and New Town are among the wealthier suburbs. The very wealthy upper-class families reside ''mugomo'' (on the mountain) in the suburb of [[Chicago, Zimbabwe|Chicago]] although [[New Town, Kwekwe|New Town]] is considered the richest area in the town. This is subdivided into mini-suburbs such as Hazeldene. The homes in this area are significantly larger than most, and are usually staffed with 2\u20134 domestic workers and, at times, security guards.\n\nThe town lies on the Bulawayo\u2013Harare railway line. It is home to two mosques, a meetinghouse for [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], Salvation Army, Protestant and Catholic churches.\n\nKwekwe has paved roads leading to [[Gweru]], [[Kadoma, Zimbabwe|Kadoma]], [[Mvuma]] and [[Gokwe Center|Gokwe Business Centre]] hence it is considered a well-connected city. Besides being close to the geographical centre of the country, Kwekwe is also strategically located within the Midlands metropolitan area. Kwekwe, together with Gweru, [[Munyati]], Kadoma and Redcliff form a single customer base for local commercial enterprises.\n\n== Industry and economy ==\nAs elsewhere in Zimbabwe, a high proportion of the population depends on the [[informal sector]], possibly more than half of the population. Many [[self-employed]] miners carry out illegal digging work just north of the city, [[Placer mining|panning]] for gold, one of the most lucrative sources of income. Other residents engage in less strenuous work as cobblers, carpenters, TV and radio repairmen, and vendors selling anything from onions to meat.\n\n=== Mining ===\n[[Image:Kwekwe Vendors.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Part of the informal sector in the town: vendors selling snacks to travellers in a bus]]\nGold is mined in the city, and is the reason the city was established. At one stage, the [[Globe and Phoenix Mine]] around which the town developed (circa 1900) was the biggest gold mine in the country.  In the local mining museum on its premises stands a relic of these boom days called the Paper House, a wood and reinforced cardboard structure in striking green and white. This two-bedroom dwelling on stilts (presumably to combat the heat and protect from termites) was home to the first mine manager, and was once slept in by [[Cecil John Rhodes]], the colonial empire builder who was closely connected with the early development of [[Rhodesia]] (Zimbabwe's former name). Kwekwe was originally a gold mining camp and is today characterised by the large mines in its vicinity producing gold, and the chrome ore and iron ore used in steelmaking.\n\nFour gold deposits within the Kwekwe district have been studied. The Primrose and Globe and Phoenix gold deposits display typical features of [[Archean]] orogenic lode gold systems such as fluid inclusions with low [[salinity]], mixed aqueous-carbonic fluids, formation temperatures between 300 and 400&nbsp;\u00b0C, and a common stable isotope composition of fluid and mineral precipitates. Deposits of this type formed in the brittle-ductile crustal transition zone at 1.5 to 3.0 kbars. In contrast, gold mineralisation at Jojo and especially the Indarama gold deposits probably formed at lower temperatures (<<300&nbsp;\u00b0C) and from dominantly aqueous, early moderate- to late high-salinity fluids.<ref>Peter Buchholz{dagger} and Thomas Oberth\u00fcr.

Its population stood at 47,607 in 1982, 75,425 in 1992 and the preliminary result of the 2002 census suggests a population of 88,000. In 2012, the city's population was estimated at 100,900 people. It is a centre for steel and fertiliser production in the country.\n\nKwekwe and neighbouring [[Redcliff, Zimbabwe|Redcliff]] are the headquarters of [[Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company]] ([[ZISCO]]), the country's largest steelworks. It also hosts the Zimbabwe Iron and Smelting Company (ZIMASCO), the largest ferrochrome producer, and one of the biggest power generating plants, [[ZESA|ZESA-Munyati]], in [[Munyati]], a suburb of Kwekwe. Kwekwe is Zimbabwe's richest city in terms of minerals.\n\n==Background==\nKwekwe town was founded in 1898 as a [[gold mining]] town, and hosts Zimbabwe's [[National Mining Museum, Zimbabwe|National Mining Museum]]. The town remains an industrial centre of the country. The name stems from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word \"isikwekwe\", which means \"scurvy\", \"mange\" or \"scab\".<ref>THIS IS OUR LAND. Stories and Legends of the two Rhodesias by Frank Clements. p.43, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, 1963.</ref> Popular belief states that Kwekwe is named after the croaking noise made by the nearby river's frogs.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town is situated on Zimbabwe's [[Highveld]] at an altitude of {{convert|1220|m|ft}}, above sea level. It is located in the tropics but its high altitude modifies this to a warm temperate climate.\nThe average annual temperature is {{convert|19|C|F}}.<ref>Average monthly data 1971 \u2013 2000, GHCN Climate averages</ref> As with much of the Highveld, summers are long but not hot as the temperature depends on the amount of cloudiness and indirectly the amount of rain received. Drought years are hotter than wet years. The climate is hot and wet during the summer rainy season from mid November to mid March, with cool, dry weather from May to mid-August in the winter season, and warm dry weather from August to mid November. Winters are characterised mainly by their cold nights, with an average minimum temperature of {{convert|7|C|F}}, and are the sunniest time of the year.\n\n<div style=\"width:80%;\">\n{{Weather box\n|location = Kwekwe (1961\u20131990)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 28.4\n|Feb high C = 28.2\n|Mar high C = 28.3\n|Apr high C = 27.6\n|May high C = 25.5\n|Jun high C = 25.5\n|Jul high C = 23.3\n|Aug high C = 26.0\n|Sep high C = 29.5\n|Oct high C = 31.1\n|Nov high C = 29.5\n|Dec high C = 28.3\n|year high C = 27.6\n|Jan low C = 16.9\n|Feb low C = 16.5\n|Mar low C = 15.0\n|Apr low C = 12.8\n|May low C = 8.7\n|Jun low C = 8.7\n|Jul low C = 5.9\n|Aug low C = 7.8\n|Sep low C = 11.7\n|Oct low C = 15.2\n|Nov low C = 16.5\n|Dec low C = 16.9\n|year low C = 12.7\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 158.7\n|Feb rain mm = 119.1\n|Mar rain mm = 62.6\n|Apr rain mm = 29.1\n|May rain mm = 5.3\n|Jun rain mm = 2.0\n|Jul rain mm = 0.5\n|Aug rain mm = 0.4\n|Sep rain mm = 5.4\n|Oct rain mm = 24.8\n|Nov rain mm = 85.4\n|Dec rain mm = 144.6\n|year rain mm = 637.9\n|unit rain days = \n|Jan rain days = 13\n|Feb rain days = 10\n|Mar rain days = 6\n|Apr rain days = 3\n|May rain days = 0\n|Jun rain days = 0\n|Jul rain days = 0\n|Aug rain days = 0\n|Sep rain days = 1\n|Oct rain days = 4\n|Nov rain days = 9\n|Dec rain days = 13\n|year rain days = 59\n|source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organization]]<ref name= WMO>{{cite web\n| url = http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=951\n| title = World Weather Information Service \u2013 Kwekwe\n| publisher = World Meteorological Organization\n| accessdate = 25 October 2015}}</ref>\n|date=October 2015\n}}</div>\n\n== Culture and recreation ==\nKwekwe has always been a festive and social centre with a mild political atmosphere. It is a multi ethnic city. In and around the city one is assured to come across [[Shona language|Shona]], [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]], [[Ikalanga language|Karanga]], [[Chewa language|Chewa]], [[Venda]], [[Tonga]] and [[Nambya]] speaking people.\n\n[[Association Football]] and [[cricket]] are the main sports in the city, just as in the rest of the country.  Kwekwe hosts one of Zimbabwe's major provincial cricket sides \u2013 the [[Mid West Rhinos]]. Their cricket ground has been host to several first class and one day matches, and has even hosted some internationals, most notably against Kenya. Kwekwe also hosts a variety of touring sides versus Zimbabwe 'A' teams. Almost all of the schools in Kwekwe play cricket.\n\nKwekwe hosts two [[football (soccer)]] clubs, the Lancashire Steel (named after a local steel company) and Kwekwe Cables. [[The Kwekwe Queens Club]] is also a reputable sporting establishment, with a sizeable membership and drinking crowd. [[Lancashire Steel FC]], the main team in the city, has been in the [[Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League|PSL]] a number of times. At its home stadium, [[Baghdad Stadium]], it has hosted a number of big teams in the country, including [[Dynamos (Zimbabwe)|Dynamos FC]], and [[Highlanders FC]].\n\nGolf tournaments are hosted by [[Kwekwe Golf Club]].\n\n[[Tongai Moyo]],[Bantuman I], [[L kat]] and [[Bob Nyabinde]] are popular singers in the country who hail from Kwekwe. [Bantu Entertainment Zimbabwe] is one of the city's arts and culture promotion stable that is fighting to develop the performing arts in the City. Kwekwe is a major stop for many music groups in the country who perform at [[Mbizo Stadium]]. The cricketer [[Charles Coventry (Zimbabwean cricketer)|Charles Coventry]] also hails from Kwekwe \u2013 he is best known for equalling the ODI World Record of 194 runs in an inning. It is also the birthplace of former cricketer [[Norman Featherstone]].\n\nA [[Kwekwe stadium stampede|stampede at Mbizo Stadium]] killed 11 people in 2014.\n\n== Education ==\nKwekwe is well endowed with many educational facilities. Most are state-run. For university education, the closest facilities are 60&nbsp;km away in [[Gweru]], the [[Midlands Province]] capital, at [[Midlands State University]].\n\n;Primary and secondary schools\nLike most urban areas in the country, the city of Kwekwe is serviced by many schools. Amaveni High School, [[Mbizo High School]] and [[Manunure High School]] recently expanded to offer [[A-level]] classes. Amaveni High serves the high density suburb of Amaveni while Mbizo and Manunure serve the high density suburb of [[Mbizo]]. Shungu High School is located about 16&nbsp;km from Kwekwe.  It is a Catholic run school. The middle-class suburbs close to the city centre have [[Kwekwe High School]] and [[Goldridge College]], plus the primary schools including Goldridge Primary School, Fitchlea Primary School, Kwekwe Junior High School and Globe & Phoenix Primary School, Maryward Primary School and [[Sally Mugabe Primary School]]. There is almost one primary school for about four sections of the high density areas\n\n;Tertiary education\nKwekwe Polytechnic is the only tertiary education institution in Kwekwe. [[Sable Chemicals]] and [[ZISCO Steel]] run apprenticeship programs with the polytechnic and with other universities in Zimbabwe. Recently the polytechnic has started offering B-tech degrees. Plans are underway to convert it into a modern university.\n\n== Residential areas ==\n\n[[Image:Kwekwe Scene.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A scene close to the bus terminus in Kwekwe, 2006]]\n[[Image:Mbizo One Extension.jpg|250px|thumb|right| Mbizo One Extension, a new addition to one of the oldest suburbs in the town, 2006]]\n\nThe residential suburbs in the city are divided into higher and lower density areas. The main suburbs in the town are [[Mbizo Township]], [[Amaveni Township]], Msasa Park, Goldrich, Hillandale, Newtown, Gaika, Beverly Hills, Chicago, Golden Acres, Southwood and Fitchlea.<ref>[http://www.iconnect-online.org/Stories/Story.import5184 iConnect Online; sharing knowledge on ICT4D \u2013 Computer training &amp; e-commerce<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023184304/http://www.iconnect-online.org/Stories/Story.import5184 |date=23 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nKwekwe's suburbs are divided into low cost housing, residential housing and also industrial and railway housing. Kwekwe has only one set of traffic lights which are just outside the city centre on a road leading to the high density suburb of [[Mbizo]].\n\n[[Amaveni Township]] and [[Mbizo Township]] are low-cost housing suburbs. These two [[slum]] areas were primarily built close to the mines for the use of mineworkers, and the most successful businesses, especially local bars known as [[beer hall]]s, serve this customer base. Then there are the middle-class homes in the Fitchlea area. This area is made up of big three- and four-bedroom homes and is still home to wealthy families despite the collapse of the economy.\n\nMasasa Park and New Town are among the wealthier suburbs. The very wealthy upper-class families reside ''mugomo'' (on the mountain) in the suburb of [[Chicago, Zimbabwe|Chicago]] although [[New Town, Kwekwe|New Town]] is considered the richest area in the town. This is subdivided into mini-suburbs such as Hazeldene. The homes in this area are significantly larger than most, and are usually staffed with 2\u20134 domestic workers and, at times, security guards.\n\nThe town lies on the Bulawayo\u2013Harare railway line. It is home to two mosques, a meetinghouse for [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], Salvation Army, Protestant and Catholic churches.\n\nKwekwe has paved roads leading to [[Gweru]], [[Kadoma, Zimbabwe|Kadoma]], [[Mvuma]] and [[Gokwe Center|Gokwe Business Centre]] hence it is considered a well-connected city. Besides being close to the geographical centre of the country, Kwekwe is also strategically located within the Midlands metropolitan area. Kwekwe, together with Gweru, [[Munyati]], Kadoma and Redcliff form a single customer base for local commercial enterprises.\n\n== Industry and economy ==\nAs elsewhere in Zimbabwe, a high proportion of the population depends on the [[informal sector]], possibly more than half of the population. Many [[self-employed]] miners carry out illegal digging work just north of the city, [[Placer mining|panning]] for gold, one of the most lucrative sources of income. Other residents engage in less strenuous work as cobblers, carpenters, TV and radio repairmen, and vendors selling anything from onions to meat.\n\n=== Mining ===\n[[Image:Kwekwe Vendors.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Part of the informal sector in the town: vendors selling snacks to travellers in a bus]]\nGold is mined in the city, and is the reason the city was established. At one stage, the [[Globe and Phoenix Mine]] around which the town developed (circa 1900) was the biggest gold mine in the country.  In the local mining museum on its premises stands a relic of these boom days called the Paper House, a wood and reinforced cardboard structure in striking green and white. This two-bedroom dwelling on stilts (presumably to combat the heat and protect from termites) was home to the first mine manager, and was once slept in by [[Cecil John Rhodes]], the colonial empire builder who was closely connected with the early development of [[Rhodesia]] (Zimbabwe's former name). Kwekwe was originally a gold mining camp and is today characterised by the large mines in its vicinity producing gold, and the chrome ore and iron ore used in steelmaking.\n\nFour gold deposits within the Kwekwe district have been studied. The Primrose and Globe and Phoenix gold deposits display typical features of [[Archean]] orogenic lode gold systems such as fluid inclusions with low [[salinity]], mixed aqueous-carbonic fluids, formation temperatures between 300 and 400&nbsp;\u00b0C, and a common stable isotope composition of fluid and mineral precipitates. Deposits of this type formed in the brittle-ductile crustal transition zone at 1.5 to 3.0 kbars. In contrast, gold mineralisation at Jojo and especially the Indarama gold deposits probably formed at lower temperatures (<<300&nbsp;\u00b0C) and from dominantly aqueous, early moderate- to late high-salinity fluids.<ref>Peter Buchholz{dagger} and Thomas Oberth\u00fcr.
