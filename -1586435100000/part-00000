Beginning in 1013, [[Norway]] (presumably also intended to include all her colonies, like [[Orkney]], as later under [[Denmark-Norway]]), came into [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]], in the rule of [[Sweyn Forkbeard]].\n\nIn 1497, when [[John Cabot]] landed on the same island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], just on the [[Avalon Peninsula]] and nowhere near [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], he raised the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Pope|Papal]] banners and claimed the land for his sponsor King [[Henry VII of England]], while recognizing the religious authority of the Catholic Church.<ref>P D'Epiro, M.D. Pinkowish, \"Sprezzatura: 50 ways Italian genius shaped the world\" pp. 179\u2013180</ref> A letter of John Day states that Cabot landed on 24 June 1497 and \"he landed at only one spot of the mainland, near the place where land was first sighted, and they disembarked there with a crucifix and raised banners with the arms of the Holy Father and those of the King of England\".<ref name=\"The John Day Letter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/john-day.php|title= The John Day Letter|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2018-05-14}}</ref>\nIn 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded the first Catholic colony in [[Quebec City]].\n\n[[Missionary]] work among Indigenous peoples began in the early 1610s as a stipulated condition to the colonization projects of the King of France. Historian Robert Choquette credits secular priest Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9 as the first to perform dozens of baptisms on Indigenous peoples, which impacted the religious landscape of [[Mi'kma'ki]]. Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9's ministry was criticized by Jesuits who believed Flech\u00e9 erred in baptizing neophytes without teaching them the Catholic faith beforehand.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.63</ref> In 1611, the [[Society of Jesus]] started its missionary work in [[Acadia]].

This was the first continuous Catholic ministry in [[British North America]]. Despite the severe religious conflicts of the period, Calvert secured the right of Catholics to practice their religion unimpeded in Newfoundland, and embraced the novel principle of religious [[toleration|tolerance]], which he wrote into the Charter of Avalon and the later [[Province of Maryland#Founding charter|Charter of Maryland]].

Nevertheless, the [[Catholic Church]] continued to grow in [[Canada]] due to the flexibility imposed on the British regime in Canada by the [[Head of state|sovereigns]] of the [[United Kingdom]] who always spoke in favor of the protection of [[Catholicism]] and [[French-speaking]] people in Canada.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/catholicism |title=Catholicism |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6KBIoZf4A</ref> This historical perspective still influences Canadian society today.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/why-is-canada-the-most-tolerant-country-in-the-world-luck/article19427921|title=Why is Canada the most tolerant country in the world?

Although the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation Agreement of 1867]] guaranteed the status of Catholic schools where they had been legalized, disputes erupted in numerous provinces, especially in the [[Manitoba]] [[Manitoba Schools Question|Schools Question]]  in the 1890s and [[Ontario]] in the 1910s.<ref>Margaret Prang, \"Clerics, Politicians, and the Bilingual Schools Issue in Ontario, 1910\u20131917.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 41.4 (1960): 281-307.</ref> In Ontario, [[Regulation 17]] was a regulation by the Ontario Ministry of Education, that restricted the use of French as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. French Canada reacted vehemently and resisted the implementation of the Regulation. This conflict, which was first rooted in linguistic and cultural questions, transformed into a religious divide. In 1915, Ontario clergy was divided between French Canadian and Irish allegiances, with the Irish supporting the position of the provincial government. [[Pope Benedict XV]] asked his Canadian representative to study the divide in order to reestablish unity among the Catholic church in the province of Ontario.<ref>Bock, Michel.

The fact that the Irish Catholics formed coalition with the anti-French Protestants further infuriated the French.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe Irish Catholics collaborated with Protestants inside Canada, on the school issue: they opposed French language Catholic schools. The Irish had a significant advantage since they were favoured by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Irish Catholicism was \"[[ultramontanism|ultramontane]]\", which meant its adherents professed total obedience to the Pope. By contrast, the French bishops in Canada kept their distance from the Vatican. In the form of [[Regulation 17]] this became the central issue that finally alienated the French in Quebec from the Canadian Anglophone establishment during the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon L.

Tensions were [[Manitoba Schools Question|especially high in Manitoba]] at the end of the 19th century.  In [[Alberta]] in the 1920s, a new Irish bishop undermined French language Catholic schooling, and removed the Francophile order of teaching sisters.<ref>Henry Wostenberg, \"Language Controversy in the Red Deer Catholic Parish, 1924-1932\" ''Alberta History'' (2013) 61#4 [https://www.questia.com/article/1G1-349221834/language-controversy-in-the-red-deer-catholic-parish online]</ref>\n\n=== Newfoundland ===\nIn the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] (which was an independent dominion before joining Canada in 1949), politics was polarized around religious lines, with the Protestants confronting the Irish Catholics.<ref>{{cite book|author=John P.

The Protestants narrowly elected [[Hugh Hoyles]] as the Conservative Prime Minister. Hoyles suddenly reversed his long record of militant Protestant activism and worked to defuse tensions. He shared patronage and power with the Catholics; all jobs and patronage were split between the various religious bodies on a per capita basis. This 'denominational compromise' was further extended to education when all religious schools were put on the basis which the Catholics had enjoyed since the 1840s.<ref>Frederick Jones, \"HOYLES, Sir HUGH WILLIAM,\" in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' vol. 11, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2003\u2013, accessed May 25, 2015. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hoyles_hugh_william_11E.html.</ref> Newfoundland's denominational schools were funded by the province until the late 1990s.

(whose mother had converted and brought Catholicism to what became the Diocese of [[Gar\u00f0ar, Greenland]]), his sister and at least two brothers, according to the [[Vinland Sagas]]. Beginning in 1013, [[Norway]] (presumably also intended to include all her colonies, like [[Orkney]], as later under [[Denmark-Norway]]), came into [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]], in the rule of [[Sweyn Forkbeard]].\n\nIn 1497, when [[John Cabot]] landed on the same island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], just on the [[Avalon Peninsula]] and nowhere near [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], he raised the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Pope|Papal]] banners and claimed the land for his sponsor King [[Henry VII of England]], while recognizing the religious authority of the Catholic Church.<ref>P D'Epiro, M.D. Pinkowish, \"Sprezzatura: 50 ways Italian genius shaped the world\" pp. 179\u2013180</ref> A letter of John Day states that Cabot landed on 24 June 1497 and \"he landed at only one spot of the mainland, near the place where land was first sighted, and they disembarked there with a crucifix and raised banners with the arms of the Holy Father and those of the King of England\".<ref name=\"The John Day Letter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/john-day.php|title= The John Day Letter|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2018-05-14}}</ref>\nIn 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded the first Catholic colony in [[Quebec City]].\n\n[[Missionary]] work among Indigenous peoples began in the early 1610s as a stipulated condition to the colonization projects of the King of France. Historian Robert Choquette credits secular priest Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9 as the first to perform dozens of baptisms on Indigenous peoples, which impacted the religious landscape of [[Mi'kma'ki]]. Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9's ministry was criticized by Jesuits who believed Flech\u00e9 erred in baptizing neophytes without teaching them the Catholic faith beforehand.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.63</ref> In 1611, the [[Society of Jesus]] started its missionary work in [[Acadia]]. Unlike their predecessor, the Jesuits began their work on Mi'kma'ki by learning the local language and living alongside the [[Mi'kmaq]] in order to instruct and convert them to Catholicism.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.74</ref>\n\nIn 1620, [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]] purchased a tract of land in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] from Sir [[William Vaughan (writer)|William Vaughan]] and established a colony, calling it Avalon, after the legendary spot where [[Christianity]] was introduced to Britain.<ref name=\"Browne, William Hand\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9kwOAAAAIAAJ |title=George Calvert and Cecilius Calvert: Barons Baltimore of Baltimore|publisher=New York: Dodd, Mead, and Company|accessdate=2013-01-23|year=1890}}</ref> In 1627 Calvert brought two Catholic priests to Avalon. This was the first continuous Catholic ministry in [[British North America]]. Despite the severe religious conflicts of the period, Calvert secured the right of Catholics to practice their religion unimpeded in Newfoundland, and embraced the novel principle of religious [[toleration|tolerance]], which he wrote into the Charter of Avalon and the later [[Province of Maryland#Founding charter|Charter of Maryland]]. The [[Province of Avalon|Colony of Avalon]] was thus the first [[North America]]n jurisdiction to practice religious tolerance.<ref name=\"Sir George Calvert\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/avalon.html|title=Sir George Calvert and the Colony of Avalon|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref>\n\n===British Rule in Canada===\nIn the way of the Canada Conquest in 1759, New France became a British colony. Nevertheless, the [[Catholic Church]] continued to grow in [[Canada]] due to the flexibility imposed on the British regime in Canada by the [[Head of state|sovereigns]] of the [[United Kingdom]] who always spoke in favor of the protection of [[Catholicism]] and [[French-speaking]] people in Canada.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/catholicism |title=Catholicism |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6KBIoZf4A</ref> This historical perspective still influences Canadian society today.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/why-is-canada-the-most-tolerant-country-in-the-world-luck/article19427921|title=Why is Canada the most tolerant country in the world?

Although the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation Agreement of 1867]] guaranteed the status of Catholic schools where they had been legalized, disputes erupted in numerous provinces, especially in the [[Manitoba]] [[Manitoba Schools Question|Schools Question]]  in the 1890s and [[Ontario]] in the 1910s.<ref>Margaret Prang, \"Clerics, Politicians, and the Bilingual Schools Issue in Ontario, 1910\u20131917.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 41.4 (1960): 281-307.</ref> In Ontario, [[Regulation 17]] was a regulation by the Ontario Ministry of Education, that restricted the use of French as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. French Canada reacted vehemently and resisted the implementation of the Regulation. This conflict, which was first rooted in linguistic and cultural questions, transformed into a religious divide. In 1915, Ontario clergy was divided between French Canadian and Irish allegiances, with the Irish supporting the position of the provincial government. [[Pope Benedict XV]] asked his Canadian representative to study the divide in order to reestablish unity among the Catholic church in the province of Ontario.<ref>Bock, Michel.

The fact that the Irish Catholics formed coalition with the anti-French Protestants further infuriated the French.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe Irish Catholics collaborated with Protestants inside Canada, on the school issue: they opposed French language Catholic schools. The Irish had a significant advantage since they were favoured by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Irish Catholicism was \"[[ultramontanism|ultramontane]]\", which meant its adherents professed total obedience to the Pope. By contrast, the French bishops in Canada kept their distance from the Vatican. In the form of [[Regulation 17]] this became the central issue that finally alienated the French in Quebec from the Canadian Anglophone establishment during the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon L.

Tensions were [[Manitoba Schools Question|especially high in Manitoba]] at the end of the 19th century.  In [[Alberta]] in the 1920s, a new Irish bishop undermined French language Catholic schooling, and removed the Francophile order of teaching sisters.<ref>Henry Wostenberg, \"Language Controversy in the Red Deer Catholic Parish, 1924-1932\" ''Alberta History'' (2013) 61#4 [https://www.questia.com/article/1G1-349221834/language-controversy-in-the-red-deer-catholic-parish online]</ref>\n\n=== Newfoundland ===\nIn the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] (which was an independent dominion before joining Canada in 1949), politics was polarized around religious lines, with the Protestants confronting the Irish Catholics.<ref>{{cite book|author=John P.

The Protestants narrowly elected [[Hugh Hoyles]] as the Conservative Prime Minister. Hoyles suddenly reversed his long record of militant Protestant activism and worked to defuse tensions. He shared patronage and power with the Catholics; all jobs and patronage were split between the various religious bodies on a per capita basis. This 'denominational compromise' was further extended to education when all religious schools were put on the basis which the Catholics had enjoyed since the 1840s.<ref>Frederick Jones, \"HOYLES, Sir HUGH WILLIAM,\" in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' vol. 11, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2003\u2013, accessed May 25, 2015. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hoyles_hugh_william_11E.html.</ref> Newfoundland's denominational schools were funded by the province until the late 1990s. In the fall of 1998, Newfoundland officially adopted a non-denominational school system, following two referenda and judgements by the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and its Court of Appeal that constitutionally recognized the end of provincially-funded Catholic schools.<ref>The Collapse of Denominational Education\" in ''Heritage Newfoundland & Labrador'' by Jenny Higgins, 2011. \u2013, accessed May 29, 2018. https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/collapse-denominational-education.php</ref>\n\n=== Decline ===\nIt appears that across Canada the [[Catholic Church]] is declining, resulting in [[Deconsecration|closures]] of more and more churches in all [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] of country. Identification with [[Catholicism]] (as well as to other sects of [[Christianity]]) in Canada is also declining.

The complex today presents various historical layers of interventions that attest to different architectural and engineering styles and approaches of the time. It represents an important stage in the history of urban planning and modern architecture, especially after a long Ottoman period that did not include such concepts of urban planning.\nThe National Theater building, started as the Italian-Albanian Circle named \"Circolo Scanderbeg\". It is the first construction of a cultural and sport complex that preserves its cultural function still today. The materials and techniques applied in this construction were considered innovative for Italy and beyond at European level.\nAfter its opening, the \"Savoy\" Theater, known in the 1940s as the Kino-Theater \"Kosova\", became a center where the most important institutions cultural institutions would be established in post-war Albania. Given these historical facts, this architectural complex is part of the country's cultural and national identity.\nThe innovative materials - most specifically a material called \"Populit\" panels, a new material composed of mineralized wood fibers with high strength concrete, thermally and acoustically insulating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dspace.epoka.edu.al/bitstream/handle/1/1272/517-1441-1-PB.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)|title=Experimental building techniques in the 1930\u2019s: the \u201cPater\u201d system in the Ex- Circolo Skanderbeg of Tirana|last=Menghini|first=Anna Bruna|date=2013|website=dspace.epoka.edu.a|url-status=live|archive-url=http://dspace.epoka.edu.al/bitstream/handle/1/1272/517-1441-1-PB.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)|archive-date=2013|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>-  and techniques applied in this construction were not only for Albania, but were also considered as such for Italy and beyond at European level. After its opening, the \"Savoy\" Theater, known in the 1940s as the Theater of Kosovo, after 1945 (at the end of World War II) as the National and today's National Theater, became a center where some of the most important institutions cultural institutions would be established in post-war Albania. Given these historical facts, this architectural complex is part of the country's cultural and national identity. The interventions of 1950-4 prove the engagement of some of the most prominent architects after World War II in the country such as A. Lufi, S. Pashallari and others. Also, the presence of working groups of Soviet architects like D. Vasiliev shows the impact of Soviet neoclassicism on the increased volume of internal courtyard closure, which is still in good shape today. Engineers and architects engaged in additional projects and structures (after 1945) and the solutions they apply demonstrate not only their care for the harmonization of the structures of the different phases, but at the same time these interventions prove to us today the political changes in the country by applying techniques and materials different from those of the autarchy period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dspace.epoka.edu.al/bitstream/handle/1/1272/517-1441-1-PB.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)|title=Experimental building techniques in the 1930's: the \"Pater\" system in the Ex- Circolo Skanderbeg of Tirana|last=Bruna Menghini|first=Anna |website=dspace.epoka.edu.al|url-status=live|archive-url=|date=23-25 May 2013|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Uniqueness - unique value'''\n\nThe complex is a turning point on the monumental axis, as it is the first rationalist object after a period of neoclassical construction. It is also one of the first rationalist buildings in Albania. The facility was first realized with prefabricated elements and innovative materials at the time, not only in Albania but also beyond. The cultural and sports complex is also the first facility with the pool still existing in the atrium.

The complex today presents various historical layers of interventions that attest to different architectural and engineering styles and approaches of the time. It represents an important stage in the history of urban planning and modern architecture, especially after a long Ottoman period that did not include such concepts of urban planning.\nThe National Theater building, started as the Italian-Albanian Circle named \"Circolo Scanderbeg\". It is the first construction of a cultural and sport complex that preserves its cultural function still today. The materials and techniques applied in this construction were considered innovative for Italy and beyond at European level.\nAfter its opening, the \"Savoy\" Theater, known in the 1940s as the Kino-Theater \"Kosova\", became a center where the most important institutions cultural institutions would be established in post-war Albania. Given these historical facts, this architectural complex is part of the country's cultural and national identity.\nThe innovative materials - most specifically a material called \"Populit\" panels, a new material composed of mineralized wood fibers with high strength concrete, thermally and acoustically insulating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dspace.epoka.edu.al/bitstream/handle/1/1272/517-1441-1-PB.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)|title=Experimental building techniques in the 1930\u2019s: the \u201cPater\u201d system in the Ex- Circolo Skanderbeg of Tirana|last=Menghini|first=Anna Bruna|date=2013|website=dspace.epoka.edu.a|url-status=live|archive-url=http://dspace.epoka.edu.al/bitstream/handle/1/1272/517-1441-1-PB.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)|archive-date=2013|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>-  and techniques applied in this construction were not only for Albania, but were also considered as such for Italy and beyond at European level. After its opening, the \"Savoy\" Theater, known in the 1940s as the Theater of Kosovo, after 1945 (at the end of World War II) as the National and today's National Theater, became a center where some of the most important institutions cultural institutions would be established in post-war Albania. Given these historical facts, this architectural complex is part of the country's cultural and national identity. The interventions of 1950-4 prove the engagement of some of the most prominent architects after World War II in the country such as A. Lufi, S. Pashallari and others. Also, the presence of working groups of Soviet architects like D. Vasiliev shows the impact of Soviet neoclassicism on the increased volume of internal courtyard closure, which is still in good shape today. Engineers and architects engaged in additional projects and structures (after 1945) and the solutions they apply demonstrate not only their care for the harmonization of the structures of the different phases, but at the same time these interventions prove to us today the political changes in the country by applying techniques and materials different from those of the autarchy period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dspace.epoka.edu.al/bitstream/handle/1/1272/517-1441-1-PB.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)|title=Experimental building techniques in the 1930's: the \"Pater\" system in the Ex- Circolo Skanderbeg of Tirana|last=Bruna Menghini|first=Anna |website=dspace.epoka.edu.al|url-status=live|archive-url=|date=23-25 May 2013|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Uniqueness - unique value'''\n\nThe complex is a turning point on the monumental axis, as it is the first rationalist object after a period of neoclassical construction. It is also one of the first rationalist buildings in Albania. The facility was first realized with prefabricated elements and innovative materials at the time, not only in Albania but also beyond. The cultural and sports complex is also the first facility with the pool still existing in the atrium.

It is colloquially known as the '''coronavirus''', and was previously referred to by its [[Novel coronavirus|provisional name]] '''2019 novel coronavirus''' ('''2019-nCoV''').<ref name=\"WHO21Jan2020\" /><ref name=\"CDC-nCoV\" /><ref name=\"CDCAbout\" /> SARS-CoV-2 is a [[positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus]].<ref name=\"gisaid\" /> It is [[Contagious disease|contagious]] in humans, and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has designated [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|the ongoing pandemic]] of COVID-19 a <!--It is both a pandemic and a PHEIC.

The virus is primarily spread between people through close contact and via [[respiratory droplets]] produced from coughs or sneezes.<ref name=\"WHO2020QA\" /><ref name=\"CDCTrans\" /> It mainly [[Viral entry|enters]] human cells by binding to the receptor [[angiotensin converting enzyme 2]] (ACE2).<ref name=\"HoffmanCell\" />\n\n==Virology==\n===Infection===\nHuman-to-human [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"Chan24Jan2020\"/> Transmission occurs primarily via [[Transmission (medicine)#Droplet infection|respiratory droplets]] from coughs and sneezes within a range of about {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|adj=ri1}}.<ref name=\"CDCTrans\" /><ref name=\"NBCSpread\" /> Indirect contact via [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] is another possible cause of infection.<ref name=\"WHO-Workplace\" /> Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic ([[polypropylene]]) and [[SAE 304 stainless steel|stainless steel]] for up to three days, but does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours;<ref name=\"NEJM-Stability\" /> the virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises its [[lipid bilayer]].<ref name=\"AtlanticSuccess\" /><ref name=\"NatGeoSoap\" /> Viral RNA has also been found in [[Stool test|stool sample]]s from infected people.<ref name=\"NEJM-FirstUS\" />\n\nThe degree to which the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain, but research has indicated that the [[Pharynx|pharynx]] reaches peak [[Viral load|viral load]] approximately four days after infection.<ref name=\"NaturePeakLoad\" /><ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref name=\"ScienceRapid\" />\n\n===Reservoir===\n[[File:Rhinolophus rouxii.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A horseshoe bat|[[Horseshoe bat]]s are among the most likely [[natural reservoir]]s of SARS-CoV-2]]\n\nThe first known infections from the SARS-CoV-2 strain were discovered in [[Wuhan]], China.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /> The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> Bats are considered the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\n===Phylogenetics and taxonomy===\n{{Infobox genome\n| image   = File:SARS-CoV-2 genome.svg\n| caption = [[Genomic]] organisation of

of viruses known as [[coronavirus]]es. It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS-CoV-2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the [[Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CCDC) and other institutions;<ref name=\"gisaid\"/><ref name=\"VirologicalInitial\" /> the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020.<ref name=\"NextstrainJanuary\" /> A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were \"highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a [[common ancestor]]\", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019.<ref name=\"NextstrainJanuary\" /> {{As of|2020|March|27|post=,}} 1,495 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled on six continents were publicly available.<ref name=\"NextstrainMarch\" />\n\nOn 11 February 2020, the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses on the basis of five [[conserved sequence]]s of [[nucleic acid]]s, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|virus strain from the 2003 SARS outbreak]] were insufficient to make them separate [[viral species]]. Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of ''[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus]]''.<ref name=\"CoronavirusStudyGroup\" />\n\n===Structural biology===\n[[File:Coronavirus virion structure.svg|alt=Figure of a spherical SARSr-CoV virion showing locations of structural proteins forming the viral envelope and the inner nucleocapsid|thumb|right|Structure of a SARSr-CoV virion]]\n\nEach SARS-CoV-2 [[virion]] is approximately 50\u2013200 [[nanometre]]s in diameter.<ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N ([[nucleocapsid]]) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the [[viral envelope]].<ref name=\"WuStructure\" /> The spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using [[cryogenic electron microscopy]],<ref name=\"SCI-20200219\" /><ref name=\"GZM-20200220\" /> is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the [[cell membrane|membrane]] of a host cell.<ref name=\"WuStructure\" />\n\n[[File:6VSB spike protein SARS-CoV-2 monomer in homotrimer.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=SARS-CoV-2 spike homotrimer focusing upon one protein subunit with an ACE2 binding domain highlighted|SARS-CoV-2 spike [[homotrimer]] with one [[protein subunit]] highlighted; the ACE2 [[binding domain]] is in magenta]]\n\n[[Protein structure prediction|Protein modeling]] experiments on the spike protein of the virus soon suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has sufficient affinity to the receptor [[angiotensin converting enzyme 2]] (ACE2) on human cells to use them as a mechanism of [[Viral entry|cell entry]].<ref name=\"SCLSModeling\" /> By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using [[reverse genetics]] methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"Letko22Jan2020\" /><ref name=\"NatMicLetko\" /><ref name=\"ElSahly\" /> Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus strain.<ref name=\"SCI-20200219\" /><ref name=\"NIH-Structure\" /> SARS-CoV-2 may also use [[basigin]] to assist in cell entry.<ref name=\"CD147\" />\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal | total_width = 400 | image1 = SARS-CoV-2 49531042877.jpg | alt1 = SARS-CoV-2 emerging from a human cell | image2 = SARS-CoV-2 scanning electron microscope image.jpg | alt2 = SARS-CoV-2 virions emerging from a human cell | footer_align = center | footer = Digitally colourised [[Micrograph|electron micrographs]] of SARS-CoV-2 virions (yellow) emerging from human cells [[Cell culture|cultured]] in a laboratory}}\n\nInitial spike protein priming by [[TMPRSS2|transmembrane protease, serine 2]] (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"HoffmanCell\" /> After a SARS-CoV-2 virion attaches to a target cell, the cell's [[protease]] TMPRSS2 cuts open the spike protein of the virus, exposing a [[fusion peptide]].

the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that

The film was written by [[Edward Hume]], produced by Robert Papazian, and directed by [[Nicholas Meyer]]. It was released on [[DVD]] on May 18, 2004, by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story follows several citizens\u2014and people they encounter\u2014in and around [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and the college town of [[Lawrence, Kansas]], {{convert|40|mi}} to its west.\n\nThe film's narrative is structured as a before-during-after scenario of a nuclear attack: the first segment introduces the various characters and their stories; the second shows the nuclear disaster itself; and the third details the effects of the fallout on the characters.\n\nDuring the first segment, as the characters are introduced, the chronology of events leading up to the war is depicted entirely via television and radio news broadcasts, as well as communications among U.S. military personnel and hearsay, enhanced by characters' reactions and analysis of the events.\n\n===Chronology of the war===\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict = World War III (fictional)\n| partof =\n| image = Dayafter1.jpg\n| caption = A (fictional) nuclear weapon detonates near [[Fort Riley, Kansas]].\n| date = September 16\n| place = Initially [[Germany]]; eventually [[Europe]], [[North America]], and the [[Soviet Union]]\n| causes = Blockading of [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]]\n| result = [[Nuclear war]] between the United States and Soviet Union\n| combatant1 = {{flag|NATO}}\n*{{Flagcountry|US|1960}}\n*{{Flagcountry|UK}}\n*{{Flagcountry|France}}\n*{{Flagcountry|FRG}}\n| combatant2 = {{flagicon image|Warsaw Pact Logo.svg}} [[Warsaw Pact]]\n*{{USSR}}\n*{{GDR}}\n|Commanders and leaders\n| commander1 = NATO:<br>{{flagicon|US|1960}} [[President of the United States]]<br /> {{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]<br /> {{flagicon|France}} [[President of France]]<br />\n{{flagicon|FRG}} [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor of West Germany]]\n| commander2 = Warsaw Pact:<br>{{flagicon|USSR}} [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]<br /> {{flagicon|GDR}} [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany]]\n| notes =\n}}\n \nThe [[Soviet Union]] is shown to have begun a military buildup in [[East Germany]] (which the Soviets insist are [[Warsaw Pact]] exercises) with the goal of intimidating the United States, the United Kingdom, and France into withdrawing from [[West Berlin]]. When the United States does not back down, Soviet armored divisions are sent to the border between East and West Germany.\n\nDuring the late hours of Friday, September 15, news broadcasts report a \"widespread rebellion among several divisions of the [[East German Army]].\" As a result, the Soviets [[blockade]] West Berlin. Tensions mount, and the United States issues an ultimatum that the Soviets stand down from the blockade by 6:00{{nbsp}}a.m. the next day, and noncompliance will be interpreted as an [[Casus belli|act of war]]. The Soviets refuse, and the [[President of the United States]] orders all U.S. military forces around the world on [[DEFCON]] 2 alert.\n\nOn Saturday, September 16, [[NATO]] forces in West Germany invade East Germany through the [[Helmstedt-Marienborn border crossing|Helmstedt-Marienborn checkpoint]] to free Berlin. The Soviets hold the Marienborn corridor and inflict heavy casualties on NATO troops. Two Soviet [[MiG-25]]s cross into West German airspace and bomb a NATO munitions storage facility, also striking a school and a hospital. A subsequent radio broadcast states that Moscow is being evacuated. At this point, major U.S. cities begin mass evacuations as well. Unconfirmed reports soon follow that nuclear weapons were used in [[Wiesbaden]] and [[Frankfurt]]. Meanwhile, in the [[Persian Gulf]], naval warfare erupts, as radio reports tell of ship sinkings on both sides.\n\nThe [[Soviet Army]] eventually reaches the [[Rhine]]. Seeking to prevent Soviet forces from invading France and causing the rest of [[Western Europe]] to fall, NATO halts the Soviet advance by [[air burst|airbursting]] three low-yield [[tactical nuclear weapons]] over advancing Soviet troops. Soviet forces counter by launching a nuclear strike on [[NATO headquarters]] in [[Brussels]]. In response, the United States [[Strategic Air Command]] begins scrambling [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers.\n\nThe Soviet Air Force then destroys a [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System|BMEWS]] station at [[RAF Fylingdales]] in England, and another at [[Beale Air Force Base]] in California. Meanwhile, on board the [[EC-135 Looking Glass]] aircraft, the order comes in from the President for a full nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. A Minuteman Missile crew launch ten Minuteman Missiles from their launch station at [[Whiteman Air Force Base]]. Dozens of other launch facilities do the same. Within minutes, over 1,000 missiles from the U.S. are launched. Almost simultaneously, an Air Force officer receives a report that a massive Soviet nuclear assault against the United States has been launched, further updated with a report that over 300 Soviet [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) are inbound. It is deliberately left unclear in the film whether the Soviet Union or the United States launches the main nuclear attack first.\n\nThe first salvo of the Soviet nuclear attack on the [[Midwestern United States]] (as shown from the point of view of the residents of central [[Kansas]] and western [[Missouri]]) occurs when a large-yield nuclear weapon air bursts at high altitude over [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. This generates an [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) that shuts down the electric power grid to nearby Whiteman Air Force Base's operable [[Minuteman II]] missile silos and the surrounding areas. Thirty seconds later, incoming Soviet ICBMs begin to hit military and population targets. [[Higginsville, Missouri|Higginsville]], Kansas City, [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]], and all the way south to [[El Dorado Springs, Missouri]], are blanketed with [[ground burst]] nuclear weapons. While the story provides no specifics, it strongly suggests that U.S. cities, military, and industrial bases are heavily damaged or destroyed. The aftermath depicts the Midwestern and [[Northwestern United States]] as a blackened wasteland of burned-out cities filled with burn, blast, and radiation victims. Eventually, the U.S. President delivers a radio address in which he declares there is now a [[ceasefire]] between the United States and the Soviet Union (which, although not shown, has suffered the same devastating effects) and states there has not been any surrender by the United States.\n\n===Storyline===\nDr. Russell Oakes lives in the upper-class Brookside neighborhood with his wife and works in a hospital in downtown Kansas City. He is scheduled to teach a [[hematology]] class at the [[University of Kansas]] (KU) hospital in nearby Lawrence, Kansas, and is ''en route'' when he hears an alarming [[Emergency Broadcast System]] alert on his car radio. The [[sine waves]] attention signal vibrates and then a woman announces an advisory message. He exits the crowded freeway and attempts to contact his wife but gives up due to the long line at a phone booth. Oakes attempts to return to his home via the [[K-10 (Kansas highway)|K-10 freeway]] and is the only eastbound motorist. The nuclear attack begins, and Kansas City is gripped with panic as air raid sirens wail. Oakes' car is permanently disabled by the EMP from the first high-altitude detonation, as are all motor vehicles and electricity. Oakes is about {{convert|30|mi}} away from downtown when the missiles hit. His family, many colleagues, and almost all of Kansas City's population are killed. He walks {{convert|10|mi}} to Lawrence, which has been severely damaged from the blasts, and, at the university hospital, treats the wounded with Dr. Sam Hachiya and Nurse Nancy Bauer. Also at the university, science Professor Joe Huxley and students use a [[Geiger counter]] to monitor the [[nuclear fallout]] outside. They build a makeshift radio to maintain contact with Dr. Oakes at the hospital as well as to locate any other broadcasting survivors beyond their area.\n\n[[Airman first class|Airman]] Billy McCoy is stationed at a [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman]] missile silo near [[Whiteman Air Force Base]], {{convert|70|mi|km}} east-southeast of Kansas City, and is called to duty during the [[DEFCON 2]] alert. His crew are among the first to witness the initial missile launches, indicating full-scale nuclear war. After it becomes clear that a Soviet [[Counterattack|counterstrike]] is imminent, the airmen panic. Several stubbornly insist that they should stay at their post and take shelter in the silo, while others, including McCoy, point out that it is futile because the silo will not withstand a direct hit. McCoy tells them they have done their jobs and speeds away in an Air Force truck to retrieve his wife and child in [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]] ({{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Whiteman AFB), but the truck is permanently disabled by an EMP from an airburst detonation. McCoy abandons the truck and takes shelter inside an overturned semi truck trailer, barely escaping the oncoming nuclear blast. After the attack, McCoy walks towards a town and finds an abandoned store, where he takes candy bars and other provisions, while gunfire is heard in the distance. While standing in line for a drink of water from a well pump, McCoy befriends a man who is mute and shares his provisions. McCoy asks another man along the road about Sedalia, and the man indicates that Sedalia and Windsor no longer exist. As McCoy and his companion both begin to suffer the effects of [[radiation sickness]], they leave a refugee camp and head to the hospital at Lawrence, where McCoy ultimately succumbs to the radiation sickness.\n\nFarmer Jim Dahlberg and his family live in rural [[Harrisonville, Missouri]], very close to a field of missile silos about {{convert|37|mi}} south-southeast of Kansas City. While the family is preparing for the wedding of their elder daughter, Denise, to KU senior Bruce Gallatin, Jim prepares for the impending attack by converting their basement into a makeshift fallout shelter. As the missiles are launched, he forcefully carries his wife Eve, who refuses to accept the reality of the escalating crisis and continues making wedding preparations, downstairs into the basement. While running to the shelter, the Dahlbergs' son, Danny, inadvertently looks behind him just as a missile detonates in the distance and is instantly blinded and carried back to the shelter by Dahlberg.\n\nKU student Stephen Klein, while hitchhiking home to [[Joplin, Missouri]], stumbles upon the farm and persuades the Dahlbergs to take him in. After several days in the basement, Denise, distraught over the situation and the unknown whereabouts of Bruce, escapes from the basement and runs about the field that is cluttered with dead animals. She sees a clear blue sky and thinks the worst is over. However, the field is actually covered in radioactive fallout. Klein goes after her, attempting to warn her about the effects of the invisible nuclear radiation that is going through her cells like [[X-ray]]s, but Denise, ignoring this warning, tries to run from him. Eventually, Klein is able to chase Denise back to safety in the basement, but not before Denise runs to the stairs to find her wedding dress. During a makeshift church service, while the minister tries to express how lucky they are to have survived, Denise begins to bleed externally from her groin due to radiation sickness from her run through the field.\n\nKlein takes Danny and Denise to [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] for treatment. Dr. Hachiya attempts to treat Danny, and Klein also develops radiation sickness. Dahlberg, upon returning from an emergency farmers' meeting, confronts a group of silent survivors [[squatter|squatting]] on his farm and attempts to persuade them to move somewhere else, only to be shot and killed mid-sentence by one of the squatters.\n\nUltimately, the situation at the hospital becomes grim. Dr. Oakes collapses from exhaustion and, upon awakening several days later, learns that Nurse Bauer has died from [[meningitis]]. Oakes, suffering from terminal radiation sickness, decides to return to Kansas City to see his home for the last time, while Dr. Hachiya stays behind. Oakes hitches a ride on an [[Army National Guard]] truck, where he witnesses U.S. military personnel blindfolding and executing looters. After somehow managing to locate where his home was, he finds the charred remains of his wife's wristwatch and a family huddled in the ruins. Oakes angrily orders them to leave his home. The family silently offers Oakes food, causing him to collapse in despair, as a member of the family comforts him.\n\nAs the scene fades to black, Professor Huxley calls into his makeshift radio: \"Hello? Is anybody there? Anybody at all?\" There is no response.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n;'''The Oakeses'''\n*[[Jason Robards]] as Dr. Russell Oakes\n*[[Georgann Johnson]] as Helen Oakes\n*Kyle Aletter as Marilyn Oakes\n\n;'''The Dahlbergs'''\n*[[John Cullum]] as Jim Dahlberg\n*[[Bibi Besch]] as Eve Dahlberg\n*Lori Lethin as Denise Dahlberg\n*Doug Scott as Danny Dahlberg\n*Ellen Anthony as Joleen Dahlberg\n\n;'''Hospital staff'''\n*[[JoBeth Williams]] as Nurse Nancy Bauer\n*[[Calvin Jung]] as Dr. Sam Hachiya\n*Lin McCarthy as Dr. Austin\n*[[Rosanna Huffman]] as Dr. Wallenberg\n*[[George Petrie (actor)|George Petrie]] as Dr. Landowska\n*Jonathan Estrin as Julian French\n\n{{col-break}}\n;'''Others'''\n*[[Steve Guttenberg]] as Stephen Klein\n*[[John Lithgow]] as Joe Huxley\n*[[Amy Madigan]] as Alison Ransom\n*[[William Allen Young]] as Airman First Class Billy McCoy\n*[[Jeff East]] as Bruce Gallatin\n*[[Dennis Lipscomb]] as Reverend Walker\n*Clayton Day as Dennis Hendry\n*Antonie Becker as Ellen Hendry\n*[[Stephen Furst]] as Aldo\n*[[Arliss Howard]] as Tom Cooper\n*Stan Wilson as Vinnie Conrad\n*[[Harry Bugin]] as Man at phone\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Day After'' was the idea of ABC Motion Picture Division president [[Brandon Stoddard]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/business/media/brandon-stoddard-77-abc-executive-who-brought-roots-to-tv-is-dead.html|title=Brandon Stoddard, 77, ABC Executive Who Brought 'Roots' to TV, Is Dead|last=Weber|first=Bruce|date=2014-12-23|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-18}}</ref> who, after watching ''[[The China Syndrome]]'', was so impressed that he envisioned creating a film exploring the effects of nuclear war on the United States. Stoddard asked his executive vice president of television movies and miniseries Stu Samuels to develop a script. Samuels created the title ''The Day After'' to emphasize that the story was not about a nuclear war itself, but the aftermath. Samuels suggested several writers and eventually Stoddard commissioned veteran television writer [[Edward Hume]] to write the script in 1981. ABC, which financed the production, was concerned about the graphic nature of the film and how to appropriately portray the subject on a family-oriented television channel. Hume undertook a massive amount of research on nuclear war and went through several drafts until finally ABC deemed the plot and characters acceptable.\n\nOriginally, the film was based more around and in Kansas City, Missouri. Kansas City was not bombed in the original script, although [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] was, making Kansas City suffer shock waves and the horde of survivors staggering into town. There was no Lawrence, Kansas, in the story, although there was a small Kansas town called \"Hampton\". While Hume was writing the script, he and producer Robert Papazian, who had great experience in on-location shooting, took several trips to Kansas City to scout locations and met with officials from the Kansas film commission and from the Kansas tourist offices to search for a suitable location for \"Hampton.\" It came down to a choice of either [[Warrensburg, Missouri]], and Lawrence, Kansas, both college towns\u2014Warrensburg was home of [[Central Missouri State University]] and was near Whiteman Air Force Base and Lawrence was home of the [[University of Kansas]] and was near Kansas City. Hume and Papazian ended up selecting Lawrence, due to the access to a number of good locations: a university, a hospital, football and basketball venues, farms, and a flat countryside. Lawrence was also agreed upon as being the \"geographic center\" of the United States. The Lawrence people were urging ABC to change the name \"Hampton\" to \"Lawrence\" in the script.\n\nBack in Los Angeles, the idea of making a TV movie showing the true effects of nuclear war on average American citizens was still stirring up controversy. ABC, Hume, and Papazian realized that for the scene depicting the nuclear blast, they would have to use state-of-the-art special effects and they took the first step by hiring some of the best special effects people in the business to draw up some storyboards for the complicated blast scene. Then, ABC hired Robert Butler to direct the project. For several months, this group worked on drawing up storyboards and revising the script again and again; then, in early 1982, Butler was forced to leave ''The Day After'' because of other contractual commitments. ABC then offered the project to two other directors, who both turned it down. Finally, in May, ABC hired feature film director [[Nicholas Meyer]], who had just completed the blockbuster ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''. Meyer was apprehensive at first and doubted ABC would get away with making a television film on nuclear war without the censors diminishing its effect. However, after reading the script, Meyer agreed to direct ''The Day After.''\n\nHowever, Meyer wanted to make sure he would film the script he was offered. He did not want the censors to censor the film, nor the film to be a regular Hollywood disaster movie from the start. Meyer figured the more ''The Day After'' resembled such a film, the less effective it would be, and preferred to present the facts of nuclear war to viewers. He made it clear to ABC that no big TV or film stars should be in ''The Day After.'' ABC agreed, although they wanted to have one star to help attract European audiences to the film when it would be shown theatrically there. Later, while flying to visit his parents in [[New York City]], Meyer happened to be on the same plane with [[Jason Robards]] and asked him to join the cast.\n\nMeyer plunged into several months of nuclear research, which made him quite pessimistic about the future, to point of becoming ill each evening when he came home from work. Meyer and Papazian also made trips to the ABC censors, and to the [[United States Department of Defense]] during their research phase, and experienced conflicts with both. Meyer had many heated arguments over elements in the script, that the network censors wanted cut out of the film. The Department of Defense said they would cooperate with ABC if the script made clear that the Soviet Union launched their missiles first\u2014something Meyer and Papazian took pains not to do.\n\nIn any case, Meyer, Papazian, Hume, and several casting directors spent most of July 1982 taking numerous trips to Kansas City. In between casting in [[Los Angeles]], where they relied mostly on unknowns, they would fly to the Kansas City area to interview local actors and scenery. They were hoping to find some real Midwesterners for smaller roles. Hollywood casting directors strolled through shopping malls in Kansas City, looking for local people to fill small and supporting roles, while the daily newspaper in Lawrence ran an advertisement calling for local residents of all ages to sign up for jobs as a large number of extras in the film and a professor of theater and film at the [[University of Kansas]] was hired to head up the local casting of the movie. Out of the eighty or so speaking parts, only fifteen were cast in Los Angeles. The remaining roles were filled in Kansas City and Lawrence.\n\nWhile in Kansas City, Meyer and Papazian toured the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] offices in Kansas City. When asked what their plans for surviving nuclear war were, a FEMA official replied that they were experimenting with putting evacuation instructions in [[telephone book]]s in [[New England]]. \"In about six years, everyone should have them.\" This meeting led Meyer to later refer to FEMA as \"a complete joke.\" It was during this time that the decision was made to change \"Hampton\" in the script to \"Lawrence.\" Meyer and Hume figured since Lawrence was a real town, that it would be more believable and besides, Lawrence was a perfect choice to play a representative of [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]]. The town boasted a \"socio-cultural mix,\" sat near the exact geographic center of the continental U.S., and Hume and Meyer's research told them that Lawrence was a prime missile target, because 150 [[Minuteman missile]] silos stood nearby. Lawrence had some great locations, and the people there were more supportive of the project. Suddenly, less emphasis was put on Kansas City, the decision was made to have the city completely annihilated in the script, and Lawrence was made the primary location in the film.\n\n=== Editing ===\nABC originally planned to air ''The Day After'' as a four-hour \"television event\", spread over two nights with total running time of 180 minutes without commercials.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Naha|first=Ed|date=April 1983|title=L.A. Offbeat: A Lesson in Reality|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-069/page/n23|journal=Starlog|volume=|pages=24\u201325|via=}}</ref> Director Nicholas Meyer felt the original script was padded, and suggested cutting out an hour of material to present the whole film in one night. The network stuck with their two night broadcast plan, and Meyer filmed the entire three hour script, as evidenced by a 172 minute work-print that has surfaced.<ref>{{Citation|last=nisus8|title=The Day After (1983) - 3-Hour Workprint Version|date=2018-08-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MobwUGgdI3A|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Subsequently, the network found that it was difficult to find advertisers, considering the subject matter. ABC relented, and told Meyer he could edit the film for a one-night broadcast version. Meyer's original single-night cut ran two hours and twenty minutes, which he presented to the network. After this screening, many executives were deeply moved and some even cried, leading Meyer to believe they approved of his cut.\n\nNevertheless, a further six-month struggle ensued over the final shape of the film. Network censors had opinions about the inclusion of specific scenes, and ABC itself, eventually intent on \"trimming the film to the bone\", made demands to cut out many scenes Meyer strongly lobbied to keep. Finally Meyer and his editor Bill Dornisch balked. Dornisch was fired, and Meyer walked away from the project. ABC brought in other editors, but the network ultimately was not happy with the results they produced. They finally brought Meyer back and reached a compromise, with Meyer paring down ''The Day After'' to a final running time of 120 minutes.<ref name=\"fallout\">{{cite web|last=Niccum|first=John|title=Fallout from ''The Day After''|url=http://www.lawrence.com/news/2003/nov/19/fallout_from/|work=lawrence.com|accessdate=October 11, 2011|date=2003-11-19}}</ref><ref>Meyer, Nicholas, \"The View From the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood\", page 150. Viking Adult, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Broadcast ===\n''The Day After'' was initially scheduled to premiere on ABC in May 1983, but the post-production work to reduce the film's length pushed back its initial airdate to November. Censors forced ABC to cut an entire scene of a child having a nightmare about nuclear holocaust and then sitting up, screaming. A psychiatrist told ABC that this would disturb children. \"This strikes me as ludicrous,\" Meyer wrote in ''[[TV Guide]]'' at the time, \"not only in relation to the rest of the film, but also when contrasted with the huge doses of violence to be found on any average evening of TV viewing.\" In any case, they made a few more cuts, including to a scene where Denise possesses a [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]. Another scene, where a hospital patient abruptly sits up screaming, was excised from the original television broadcast but restored for home video releases. Meyer persuaded ABC to dedicate the film to the citizens of Lawrence, and also to put a disclaimer at the end of the film, following the credits, letting the viewer know that ''The Day After'' downplayed the true effects of nuclear war so they would be able to have a story. The disclaimer also included a list of books that provide more information on the subject.\n\n''The Day After'' received a large promotional campaign prior to its broadcast. Commercials aired several months in advance, ABC distributed half a million \"viewer's guides\" that discussed the dangers of nuclear war and prepared the viewer for the graphic scenes of mushroom clouds and radiation burn victims. Discussion groups were also formed nationwide.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Atomic War Film Spurs Nationwide Discussion|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|date=November 22, 1983|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nComposer [[David Raksin]] wrote original music and adapted music from ''[[The River (1938 film)|The River]]'' (a documentary film score by concert composer [[Virgil Thomson]]), featuring an adaptation of the hymn \"[[How Firm a Foundation (hymn)|How Firm a Foundation]]\". Although he recorded just under 30 minutes of music, much of it was edited out of the final cut. Music from the ''First Strike'' footage, conversely, was not edited out.\n\n===Deleted and alternative scenes===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}\nDue to the film's being shortened from the original three hours (running time) to two, several planned special-effects scenes were scrapped, although storyboards were made in anticipation of a possible \"expanded\" version. They included a \"bird's eye\" view of Kansas City at the moment of two nuclear detonations as seen from a [[Boeing 737]] airliner on approach to the city's airport, as well as simulated newsreel footage of U.S. troops in [[West Germany]] taking up positions in preparation of advancing Soviet armored units, and the tactical nuclear exchange in Germany between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, which follows after the attacking Warsaw Pact force breaks through and overwhelms the NATO lines.\n\nABC censors severely toned down scenes to reduce the body count or severe burn victims. Meyer refused to remove key scenes but reportedly some eight and a half minutes of excised footage still exist, significantly more graphic. Some footage was reinstated for the film's release on home video. Additionally, the nuclear attack scene was longer and supposed to feature very graphic and very accurate shots of what happens to a human body during a nuclear blast. Examples included people being set on fire, their flesh carbonizing, being burned to the bone, eyes melting, faceless heads, skin hanging, deaths from flying glass and debris, limbs torn off, being crushed, blown from buildings by the shockwave, and people in fallout shelters suffocating during the firestorm. Also cut were images of radiation sickness, as well as graphic post-attack violence from survivors such as food riots, looting, and general lawlessness as authorities attempted to restore order.\n\nOne cut scene shows surviving students battling over food. The two sides were to be athletes versus the science students under the guidance of Professor Huxley. Another brief scene later cut related to a firing squad, where two U.S. soldiers are blindfolded and executed. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} An officer reads the charges, verdict and sentence, as a bandaged chaplain reads the [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Last Rites]]. A similar sequence occurs in a 1965 UK-produced faux documentary, ''[[The War Game]]''. In the original broadcast of ''The Day After'', when the U.S. president addresses the nation, the voice was an imitation of [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QdZqBKwTMs</ref> In subsequent broadcasts, that voice was overdubbed by a stock actor.\n\nHome video releases in the U.S. and internationally come in at various running times, many listed at 126 or 127 minutes; full screen (4:3 aspect ratio) seems to be more common than widescreen. RCA videodiscs of the early 1980s were limited to 2 hours per disc, so that full screen release appears to be closest to what originally aired on ABC in the US. A 2001 U.S. VHS version (Anchor Bay Entertainment, Troy, Michigan) lists a running time of 122 minutes. A 1995 double laser disc \"director's cut\" version (Image Entertainment) runs 127 minutes, includes commentary by director Nicholas Meyer and is \"presented in its 1.75:1 European theatrical aspect ratio\" (according to the LD jacket).\n\nTwo different German DVD releases run 122 and 115 minutes; edits reportedly downplay the Soviet Union's role.<ref>[http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=193898 Movie-censorship.com]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn its original broadcast (Sunday, November 20, 1983), [[John Cullum]] warned viewers before the film was premiered that the film contains graphic and disturbing scenes, and encourages parents who have young children watching, to watch together and discuss the issues of nuclear warfare.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbgejAu2y4Q 11/20/1983 The Day After Intro and Disclaimer ABC - via YouTube]</ref> ABC and local TV affiliates opened [[Toll-free number|1-800 hotlines]] with counselors standing by. There were no commercial breaks after the nuclear attack. ABC then aired a live debate on Viewpoint, hosted by ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''{{'}}s [[Ted Koppel]], featuring scientist [[Carl Sagan]], former Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Elie Wiesel]], former Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], General [[Brent Scowcroft]] and conservative commentator [[William F. Buckley Jr.]]. Sagan argued against [[nuclear proliferation]], while Buckley promoted the concept of [[Mutual assured destruction|nuclear deterrence]]. Sagan described the [[Nuclear arms race|arms race]] in the following terms: \"Imagine a room awash in gasoline, and there are two implacable enemies in that room.

The film was written by [[Edward Hume]], produced by Robert Papazian, and directed by [[Nicholas Meyer]]. It was released on [[DVD]] on May 18, 2004, by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe story follows several citizens\u2014and people they encounter\u2014in and around [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and the college town of [[Lawrence, Kansas]], {{convert|40|mi}} to its west.\n\nThe film's narrative is structured as a before-during-after scenario of a nuclear attack: the first segment introduces the various characters and their stories; the second shows the nuclear disaster itself; and the third details the effects of the fallout on the characters.\n\nDuring the first segment, as the characters are introduced, the chronology of events leading up to the war is depicted entirely via television and radio news broadcasts, as well as communications among U.S. military personnel and hearsay, enhanced by characters' reactions and analysis of the events.\n\n===Chronology of the war===\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict = World War III (fictional)\n| partof =\n| image = Dayafter1.jpg\n| caption = A (fictional) nuclear weapon detonates near [[Fort Riley, Kansas]].\n| date = September 16\n| place = Initially [[Germany]]; eventually [[Europe]], [[North America]], and the [[Soviet Union]]\n| causes = Blockading of [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]]\n| result = *[[Nuclear war]] between the United States and Soviet Union\n| combatant1 = {{flag|NATO}}\n*{{Flagcountry|US|1960}}\n*{{Flagcountry|UK}}\n*{{Flagcountry|France}}\n*{{Flagcountry|FRG}}\n| combatant2 = {{flagicon image|Warsaw Pact Logo.svg}} [[Warsaw Pact]]\n*{{USSR}}\n*{{GDR}}\n|Commanders and leaders\n| commander1 = NATO:<br>{{flagicon|US|1960}} [[President of the United States]]<br /> {{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]<br /> {{flagicon|France}} [[President of France]]<br />\n{{flagicon|FRG}} [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor of West Germany]]\n| commander2 = Warsaw Pact:<br>{{flagicon|USSR}} [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]<br /> {{flagicon|GDR}} [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany]]\n| notes =\n}}\n \nThe [[Soviet Union]] is shown to have begun a military buildup in [[East Germany]] (which the Soviets insist are [[Warsaw Pact]] exercises) with the goal of intimidating the United States, the United Kingdom, and France into withdrawing from [[West Berlin]]. When the United States does not back down, Soviet armored divisions are sent to the border between East and West Germany.\n\nDuring the late hours of Friday, September 15, news broadcasts report a \"widespread rebellion among several divisions of the [[East German Army]].\" As a result, the Soviets [[blockade]] West Berlin. Tensions mount, and the United States issues an ultimatum that the Soviets stand down from the blockade by 6:00{{nbsp}}a.m. the next day, and noncompliance will be interpreted as an [[Casus belli|act of war]]. The Soviets refuse, and the [[President of the United States]] orders all U.S. military forces around the world on [[DEFCON]] 2 alert.\n\nOn Saturday, September 16, [[NATO]] forces in West Germany invade East Germany through the [[Helmstedt-Marienborn border crossing|Helmstedt-Marienborn checkpoint]] to free Berlin. The Soviets hold the Marienborn corridor and inflict heavy casualties on NATO troops. Two Soviet [[MiG-25]]s cross into West German airspace and bomb a NATO munitions storage facility, also striking a school and a hospital. A subsequent radio broadcast states that Moscow is being evacuated. At this point, major U.S. cities begin mass evacuations as well. Unconfirmed reports soon follow that nuclear weapons were used in [[Wiesbaden]] and [[Frankfurt]]. Meanwhile, in the [[Persian Gulf]], naval warfare erupts, as radio reports tell of ship sinkings on both sides.\n\nThe [[Soviet Army]] eventually reaches the [[Rhine]]. Seeking to prevent Soviet forces from invading France and causing the rest of [[Western Europe]] to fall, NATO halts the Soviet advance by [[air burst|airbursting]] three low-yield [[tactical nuclear weapons]] over advancing Soviet troops. Soviet forces counter by launching a nuclear strike on [[NATO headquarters]] in [[Brussels]]. In response, the United States [[Strategic Air Command]] begins scrambling [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers.\n\nThe Soviet Air Force then destroys a [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System|BMEWS]] station at [[RAF Fylingdales]] in England, and another at [[Beale Air Force Base]] in California. Meanwhile, on board the [[EC-135 Looking Glass]] aircraft, the order comes in from the President for a full nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. A Minuteman Missile crew launch ten Minuteman Missiles from their launch station at [[Whiteman Air Force Base]]. Dozens of other launch facilities do the same. Within minutes, over 1,000 missiles from the U.S. are launched. Almost simultaneously, an Air Force officer receives a report that a massive Soviet nuclear assault against the United States has been launched, further updated with a report that over 300 Soviet [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) are inbound. It is deliberately left unclear in the film whether the Soviet Union or the United States launches the main nuclear attack first.\n\nThe first salvo of the Soviet nuclear attack on the [[Midwestern United States]] (as shown from the point of view of the residents of central [[Kansas]] and western [[Missouri]]) occurs when a large-yield nuclear weapon air bursts at high altitude over [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. This generates an [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) that shuts down the electric power grid to nearby Whiteman Air Force Base's operable [[Minuteman II]] missile silos and the surrounding areas. Thirty seconds later, incoming Soviet ICBMs begin to hit military and population targets. [[Higginsville, Missouri|Higginsville]], Kansas City, [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]], and all the way south to [[El Dorado Springs, Missouri]], are blanketed with [[ground burst]] nuclear weapons. While the story provides no specifics, it strongly suggests that U.S. cities, military, and industrial bases are heavily damaged or destroyed. The aftermath depicts the Midwestern and [[Northwestern United States]] as a blackened wasteland of burned-out cities filled with burn, blast, and radiation victims. Eventually, the U.S. President delivers a radio address in which he declares there is now a [[ceasefire]] between the United States and the Soviet Union (which, although not shown, has suffered the same devastating effects) and states there has not been any surrender by the United States.\n\n===Storyline===\nDr. Russell Oakes lives in the upper-class Brookside neighborhood with his wife and works in a hospital in downtown Kansas City. He is scheduled to teach a [[hematology]] class at the [[University of Kansas]] (KU) hospital in nearby Lawrence, Kansas, and is ''en route'' when he hears an alarming [[Emergency Broadcast System]] alert on his car radio. The [[sine waves]] attention signal vibrates and then a woman announces an advisory message. He exits the crowded freeway and attempts to contact his wife but gives up due to the long line at a phone booth. Oakes attempts to return to his home via the [[K-10 (Kansas highway)|K-10 freeway]] and is the only eastbound motorist. The nuclear attack begins, and Kansas City is gripped with panic as air raid sirens wail. Oakes' car is permanently disabled by the EMP from the first high-altitude detonation, as are all motor vehicles and electricity. Oakes is about {{convert|30|mi}} away from downtown when the missiles hit. His family, many colleagues, and almost all of Kansas City's population are killed. He walks {{convert|10|mi}} to Lawrence, which has been severely damaged from the blasts, and, at the university hospital, treats the wounded with Dr. Sam Hachiya and Nurse Nancy Bauer. Also at the university, science Professor Joe Huxley and students use a [[Geiger counter]] to monitor the [[nuclear fallout]] outside. They build a makeshift radio to maintain contact with Dr. Oakes at the hospital as well as to locate any other broadcasting survivors beyond their area.\n\n[[Airman first class|Airman]] Billy McCoy is stationed at a [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman]] missile silo near [[Whiteman Air Force Base]], {{convert|70|mi|km}} east-southeast of Kansas City, and is called to duty during the [[DEFCON 2]] alert. His crew are among the first to witness the initial missile launches, indicating full-scale nuclear war. After it becomes clear that a Soviet [[Counterattack|counterstrike]] is imminent, the airmen panic. Several stubbornly insist that they should stay at their post and take shelter in the silo, while others, including McCoy, point out that it is futile because the silo will not withstand a direct hit. McCoy tells them they have done their jobs and speeds away in an Air Force truck to retrieve his wife and child in [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]] ({{convert|20|mi|km}} east of Whiteman AFB), but the truck is permanently disabled by an EMP from an airburst detonation. McCoy abandons the truck and takes shelter inside an overturned semi truck trailer, barely escaping the oncoming nuclear blast. After the attack, McCoy walks towards a town and finds an abandoned store, where he takes candy bars and other provisions, while gunfire is heard in the distance. While standing in line for a drink of water from a well pump, McCoy befriends a man who is mute and shares his provisions. McCoy asks another man along the road about Sedalia, and the man indicates that Sedalia and Windsor no longer exist. As McCoy and his companion both begin to suffer the effects of [[radiation sickness]], they leave a refugee camp and head to the hospital at Lawrence, where McCoy ultimately succumbs to the radiation sickness.\n\nFarmer Jim Dahlberg and his family live in rural [[Harrisonville, Missouri]], very close to a field of missile silos about {{convert|37|mi}} south-southeast of Kansas City. While the family is preparing for the wedding of their elder daughter, Denise, to KU senior Bruce Gallatin, Jim prepares for the impending attack by converting their basement into a makeshift fallout shelter. As the missiles are launched, he forcefully carries his wife Eve, who refuses to accept the reality of the escalating crisis and continues making wedding preparations, downstairs into the basement. While running to the shelter, the Dahlbergs' son, Danny, inadvertently looks behind him just as a missile detonates in the distance and is instantly blinded and carried back to the shelter by Dahlberg.\n\nKU student Stephen Klein, while hitchhiking home to [[Joplin, Missouri]], stumbles upon the farm and persuades the Dahlbergs to take him in. After several days in the basement, Denise, distraught over the situation and the unknown whereabouts of Bruce, escapes from the basement and runs about the field that is cluttered with dead animals. She sees a clear blue sky and thinks the worst is over. However, the field is actually covered in radioactive fallout. Klein goes after her, attempting to warn her about the effects of the invisible nuclear radiation that is going through her cells like [[X-ray]]s, but Denise, ignoring this warning, tries to run from him. Eventually, Klein is able to chase Denise back to safety in the basement, but not before Denise runs to the stairs to find her wedding dress. During a makeshift church service, while the minister tries to express how lucky they are to have survived, Denise begins to bleed externally from her groin due to radiation sickness from her run through the field.\n\nKlein takes Danny and Denise to [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] for treatment. Dr. Hachiya attempts to treat Danny, and Klein also develops radiation sickness. Dahlberg, upon returning from an emergency farmers' meeting, confronts a group of silent survivors [[squatter|squatting]] on his farm and attempts to persuade them to move somewhere else, only to be shot and killed mid-sentence by one of the squatters.\n\nUltimately, the situation at the hospital becomes grim. Dr. Oakes collapses from exhaustion and, upon awakening several days later, learns that Nurse Bauer has died from [[meningitis]]. Oakes, suffering from terminal radiation sickness, decides to return to Kansas City to see his home for the last time, while Dr. Hachiya stays behind. Oakes hitches a ride on an [[Army National Guard]] truck, where he witnesses U.S. military personnel blindfolding and executing looters. After somehow managing to locate where his home was, he finds the charred remains of his wife's wristwatch and a family huddled in the ruins. Oakes angrily orders them to leave his home. The family silently offers Oakes food, causing him to collapse in despair, as a member of the family comforts him.\n\nAs the scene fades to black, Professor Huxley calls into his makeshift radio: \"Hello? Is anybody there? Anybody at all?\" There is no response.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n;'''The Oakeses'''\n*[[Jason Robards]] as Dr. Russell Oakes\n*[[Georgann Johnson]] as Helen Oakes\n*Kyle Aletter as Marilyn Oakes\n\n;'''The Dahlbergs'''\n*[[John Cullum]] as Jim Dahlberg\n*[[Bibi Besch]] as Eve Dahlberg\n*Lori Lethin as Denise Dahlberg\n*Doug Scott as Danny Dahlberg\n*Ellen Anthony as Joleen Dahlberg\n\n;'''Hospital staff'''\n*[[JoBeth Williams]] as Nurse Nancy Bauer\n*[[Calvin Jung]] as Dr. Sam Hachiya\n*Lin McCarthy as Dr. Austin\n*[[Rosanna Huffman]] as Dr. Wallenberg\n*[[George Petrie (actor)|George Petrie]] as Dr. Landowska\n*Jonathan Estrin as Julian French\n\n{{col-break}}\n;'''Others'''\n*[[Steve Guttenberg]] as Stephen Klein\n*[[John Lithgow]] as Joe Huxley\n*[[Amy Madigan]] as Alison Ransom\n*[[William Allen Young]] as Airman First Class Billy McCoy\n*[[Jeff East]] as Bruce Gallatin\n*[[Dennis Lipscomb]] as Reverend Walker\n*Clayton Day as Dennis Hendry\n*Antonie Becker as Ellen Hendry\n*[[Stephen Furst]] as Aldo\n*[[Arliss Howard]] as Tom Cooper\n*Stan Wilson as Vinnie Conrad\n*[[Harry Bugin]] as Man at phone\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n''The Day After'' was the idea of ABC Motion Picture Division president [[Brandon Stoddard]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/business/media/brandon-stoddard-77-abc-executive-who-brought-roots-to-tv-is-dead.html|title=Brandon Stoddard, 77, ABC Executive Who Brought 'Roots' to TV, Is Dead|last=Weber|first=Bruce|date=2014-12-23|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-18}}</ref> who, after watching ''[[The China Syndrome]]'', was so impressed that he envisioned creating a film exploring the effects of nuclear war on the United States. Stoddard asked his executive vice president of television movies and miniseries Stu Samuels to develop a script. Samuels created the title ''The Day After'' to emphasize that the story was not about a nuclear war itself, but the aftermath. Samuels suggested several writers and eventually Stoddard commissioned veteran television writer [[Edward Hume]] to write the script in 1981. ABC, which financed the production, was concerned about the graphic nature of the film and how to appropriately portray the subject on a family-oriented television channel. Hume undertook a massive amount of research on nuclear war and went through several drafts until finally ABC deemed the plot and characters acceptable.\n\nOriginally, the film was based more around and in Kansas City, Missouri. Kansas City was not bombed in the original script, although [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] was, making Kansas City suffer shock waves and the horde of survivors staggering into town. There was no Lawrence, Kansas, in the story, although there was a small Kansas town called \"Hampton\". While Hume was writing the script, he and producer Robert Papazian, who had great experience in on-location shooting, took several trips to Kansas City to scout locations and met with officials from the Kansas film commission and from the Kansas tourist offices to search for a suitable location for \"Hampton.\" It came down to a choice of either [[Warrensburg, Missouri]], and Lawrence, Kansas, both college towns\u2014Warrensburg was home of [[Central Missouri State University]] and was near Whiteman Air Force Base and Lawrence was home of the [[University of Kansas]] and was near Kansas City. Hume and Papazian ended up selecting Lawrence, due to the access to a number of good locations: a university, a hospital, football and basketball venues, farms, and a flat countryside. Lawrence was also agreed upon as being the \"geographic center\" of the United States. The Lawrence people were urging ABC to change the name \"Hampton\" to \"Lawrence\" in the script.\n\nBack in Los Angeles, the idea of making a TV movie showing the true effects of nuclear war on average American citizens was still stirring up controversy. ABC, Hume, and Papazian realized that for the scene depicting the nuclear blast, they would have to use state-of-the-art special effects and they took the first step by hiring some of the best special effects people in the business to draw up some storyboards for the complicated blast scene. Then, ABC hired Robert Butler to direct the project. For several months, this group worked on drawing up storyboards and revising the script again and again; then, in early 1982, Butler was forced to leave ''The Day After'' because of other contractual commitments. ABC then offered the project to two other directors, who both turned it down. Finally, in May, ABC hired feature film director [[Nicholas Meyer]], who had just completed the blockbuster ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''. Meyer was apprehensive at first and doubted ABC would get away with making a television film on nuclear war without the censors diminishing its effect. However, after reading the script, Meyer agreed to direct ''The Day After.''\n\nHowever, Meyer wanted to make sure he would film the script he was offered. He did not want the censors to censor the film, nor the film to be a regular Hollywood disaster movie from the start. Meyer figured the more ''The Day After'' resembled such a film, the less effective it would be, and preferred to present the facts of nuclear war to viewers. He made it clear to ABC that no big TV or film stars should be in ''The Day After.'' ABC agreed, although they wanted to have one star to help attract European audiences to the film when it would be shown theatrically there. Later, while flying to visit his parents in [[New York City]], Meyer happened to be on the same plane with [[Jason Robards]] and asked him to join the cast.\n\nMeyer plunged into several months of nuclear research, which made him quite pessimistic about the future, to point of becoming ill each evening when he came home from work. Meyer and Papazian also made trips to the ABC censors, and to the [[United States Department of Defense]] during their research phase, and experienced conflicts with both. Meyer had many heated arguments over elements in the script, that the network censors wanted cut out of the film. The Department of Defense said they would cooperate with ABC if the script made clear that the Soviet Union launched their missiles first\u2014something Meyer and Papazian took pains not to do.\n\nIn any case, Meyer, Papazian, Hume, and several casting directors spent most of July 1982 taking numerous trips to Kansas City. In between casting in [[Los Angeles]], where they relied mostly on unknowns, they would fly to the Kansas City area to interview local actors and scenery. They were hoping to find some real Midwesterners for smaller roles. Hollywood casting directors strolled through shopping malls in Kansas City, looking for local people to fill small and supporting roles, while the daily newspaper in Lawrence ran an advertisement calling for local residents of all ages to sign up for jobs as a large number of extras in the film and a professor of theater and film at the [[University of Kansas]] was hired to head up the local casting of the movie. Out of the eighty or so speaking parts, only fifteen were cast in Los Angeles. The remaining roles were filled in Kansas City and Lawrence.\n\nWhile in Kansas City, Meyer and Papazian toured the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] offices in Kansas City. When asked what their plans for surviving nuclear war were, a FEMA official replied that they were experimenting with putting evacuation instructions in [[telephone book]]s in [[New England]]. \"In about six years, everyone should have them.\" This meeting led Meyer to later refer to FEMA as \"a complete joke.\" It was during this time that the decision was made to change \"Hampton\" in the script to \"Lawrence.\" Meyer and Hume figured since Lawrence was a real town, that it would be more believable and besides, Lawrence was a perfect choice to play a representative of [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]]. The town boasted a \"socio-cultural mix,\" sat near the exact geographic center of the continental U.S., and Hume and Meyer's research told them that Lawrence was a prime missile target, because 150 [[Minuteman missile]] silos stood nearby. Lawrence had some great locations, and the people there were more supportive of the project. Suddenly, less emphasis was put on Kansas City, the decision was made to have the city completely annihilated in the script, and Lawrence was made the primary location in the film.\n\n=== Editing ===\nABC originally planned to air ''The Day After'' as a four-hour \"television event\", spread over two nights with total running time of 180 minutes without commercials.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Naha|first=Ed|date=April 1983|title=L.A. Offbeat: A Lesson in Reality|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-069/page/n23|journal=Starlog|volume=|pages=24\u201325|via=}}</ref> Director Nicholas Meyer felt the original script was padded, and suggested cutting out an hour of material to present the whole film in one night. The network stuck with their two night broadcast plan, and Meyer filmed the entire three hour script, as evidenced by a 172 minute work-print that has surfaced.<ref>{{Citation|last=nisus8|title=The Day After (1983) - 3-Hour Workprint Version|date=2018-08-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MobwUGgdI3A|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Subsequently, the network found that it was difficult to find advertisers, considering the subject matter. ABC relented, and told Meyer he could edit the film for a one-night broadcast version. Meyer's original single-night cut ran two hours and twenty minutes, which he presented to the network. After this screening, many executives were deeply moved and some even cried, leading Meyer to believe they approved of his cut.\n\nNevertheless, a further six-month struggle ensued over the final shape of the film. Network censors had opinions about the inclusion of specific scenes, and ABC itself, eventually intent on \"trimming the film to the bone\", made demands to cut out many scenes Meyer strongly lobbied to keep. Finally Meyer and his editor Bill Dornisch balked. Dornisch was fired, and Meyer walked away from the project. ABC brought in other editors, but the network ultimately was not happy with the results they produced. They finally brought Meyer back and reached a compromise, with Meyer paring down ''The Day After'' to a final running time of 120 minutes.<ref name=\"fallout\">{{cite web|last=Niccum|first=John|title=Fallout from ''The Day After''|url=http://www.lawrence.com/news/2003/nov/19/fallout_from/|work=lawrence.com|accessdate=October 11, 2011|date=2003-11-19}}</ref><ref>Meyer, Nicholas, \"The View From the Bridge: Memories of Star Trek and a Life in Hollywood\", page 150. Viking Adult, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Broadcast ===\n''The Day After'' was initially scheduled to premiere on ABC in May 1983, but the post-production work to reduce the film's length pushed back its initial airdate to November. Censors forced ABC to cut an entire scene of a child having a nightmare about nuclear holocaust and then sitting up, screaming. A psychiatrist told ABC that this would disturb children. \"This strikes me as ludicrous,\" Meyer wrote in ''[[TV Guide]]'' at the time, \"not only in relation to the rest of the film, but also when contrasted with the huge doses of violence to be found on any average evening of TV viewing.\" In any case, they made a few more cuts, including to a scene where Denise possesses a [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]. Another scene, where a hospital patient abruptly sits up screaming, was excised from the original television broadcast but restored for home video releases. Meyer persuaded ABC to dedicate the film to the citizens of Lawrence, and also to put a disclaimer at the end of the film, following the credits, letting the viewer know that ''The Day After'' downplayed the true effects of nuclear war so they would be able to have a story. The disclaimer also included a list of books that provide more information on the subject.\n\n''The Day After'' received a large promotional campaign prior to its broadcast. Commercials aired several months in advance, ABC distributed half a million \"viewer's guides\" that discussed the dangers of nuclear war and prepared the viewer for the graphic scenes of mushroom clouds and radiation burn victims. Discussion groups were also formed nationwide.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Atomic War Film Spurs Nationwide Discussion|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|date=November 22, 1983|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nComposer [[David Raksin]] wrote original music and adapted music from ''[[The River (1938 film)|The River]]'' (a documentary film score by concert composer [[Virgil Thomson]]), featuring an adaptation of the hymn \"[[How Firm a Foundation (hymn)|How Firm a Foundation]]\". Although he recorded just under 30 minutes of music, much of it was edited out of the final cut. Music from the ''First Strike'' footage, conversely, was not edited out.\n\n===Deleted and alternative scenes===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}\nDue to the film's being shortened from the original three hours (running time) to two, several planned special-effects scenes were scrapped, although storyboards were made in anticipation of a possible \"expanded\" version. They included a \"bird's eye\" view of Kansas City at the moment of two nuclear detonations as seen from a [[Boeing 737]] airliner on approach to the city's airport, as well as simulated newsreel footage of U.S. troops in [[West Germany]] taking up positions in preparation of advancing Soviet armored units, and the tactical nuclear exchange in Germany between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, which follows after the attacking Warsaw Pact force breaks through and overwhelms the NATO lines.\n\nABC censors severely toned down scenes to reduce the body count or severe burn victims. Meyer refused to remove key scenes but reportedly some eight and a half minutes of excised footage still exist, significantly more graphic. Some footage was reinstated for the film's release on home video. Additionally, the nuclear attack scene was longer and supposed to feature very graphic and very accurate shots of what happens to a human body during a nuclear blast. Examples included people being set on fire, their flesh carbonizing, being burned to the bone, eyes melting, faceless heads, skin hanging, deaths from flying glass and debris, limbs torn off, being crushed, blown from buildings by the shockwave, and people in fallout shelters suffocating during the firestorm. Also cut were images of radiation sickness, as well as graphic post-attack violence from survivors such as food riots, looting, and general lawlessness as authorities attempted to restore order.\n\nOne cut scene shows surviving students battling over food. The two sides were to be athletes versus the science students under the guidance of Professor Huxley. Another brief scene later cut related to a firing squad, where two U.S. soldiers are blindfolded and executed. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} An officer reads the charges, verdict and sentence, as a bandaged chaplain reads the [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Last Rites]]. A similar sequence occurs in a 1965 UK-produced faux documentary, ''[[The War Game]]''. In the original broadcast of ''The Day After'', when the U.S. president addresses the nation, the voice was an imitation of [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QdZqBKwTMs</ref> In subsequent broadcasts, that voice was overdubbed by a stock actor.\n\nHome video releases in the U.S. and internationally come in at various running times, many listed at 126 or 127 minutes; full screen (4:3 aspect ratio) seems to be more common than widescreen. RCA videodiscs of the early 1980s were limited to 2 hours per disc, so that full screen release appears to be closest to what originally aired on ABC in the US. A 2001 U.S. VHS version (Anchor Bay Entertainment, Troy, Michigan) lists a running time of 122 minutes.
