Historically used to protect [[military personnel]], today it is also used by various types of [[police]] ([[riot police]] in particular), private [[security guard]]s or [[bodyguard]]s, and occasionally ordinary civilians.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Heat strain evaluation of overt and covert body armour in a hot and humid environment|journal = Applied Ergonomics|date = 2015-03-01|issn = 1872-9126|pmid = 25479969|pages = 11\u201315|volume = 47|doi = 10.1016/j.apergo.2014.08.016|first = Andrew J.|last = Pyke|first2 = Joseph T.|last2 = Costello|first3 = Ian B.|last3 = Stewart}}</ref> Today there are two main types: regular non-plated body armor for moderate to substantial protection, and hard-plate reinforced body armor for maximum protection, such as used by combat soldiers.hgjjkd dhfgd dodge s sus,\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mycenaean armour 1400BC.jpg|thumb|Greek [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] armor, c. 1400 BC]]\n[[File:Dong Son brozne armor 2.JPG|thumb|Bronze lamellae, Vietnam, 300 BC&nbsp;\u2013 100 BC]]\nMany factors have affected the development of personal armor throughout human history. Significant factors in the development of armor include the economic and technological necessities of armor production. For instance full [[plate armor]] first appeared in Medieval Europe when water-powered [[trip hammer]]s made the formation of plates faster and cheaper.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}  At times the development of armor has run parallel to the development of increasingly effective weaponry on the battlefield, with armorers seeking to create better protection without sacrificing mobility. With the development of capitalism and technological advancements armor became more available to the lower classes often at a cost of quality.\n\n===Ancient===\nThe first record of body armor in history was found on the [[Stele of the Vultures|Stele of Vultures]] in [[Sumer|ancient Sumer]] in today's south [[Iraq]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gabriel|first=Richard A.|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=6sAftYT6dsIC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=oldest+%22armor%22+stele+vultures&source=bl&ots=oe8PDnxCX7&sig=ACfU3U3CK9XODa9Kqqx4IQnEvtUlA4mS5A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiA4d7ayZboAhVxyaYKHQg1ClwQ6AEwC3oECBgQAQ#v=onepage&q=oldest%20%22armor%22%20stele%20vultures&f=false|title=From Sumer to Rome: The Military Capabilities of Ancient Armies|last2=Metz|first2=Karen S.|date=1991|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-27645-3|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Gabriel|first=Richard A.|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=HscIwvtkq2UC&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=oldest+%22armor%22+stele+vultures&source=bl&ots=PTkeslpGmu&sig=ACfU3U0fiLm9POhLqFsIRDRBDImVQ_k1bg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiA4d7ayZboAhVxyaYKHQg1ClwQ6AEwCnoECBsQAQ#v=onepage&q=oldest%20%22armor%22%20stele%20vultures&f=false|title=The Ancient World|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33348-4|language=en}}</ref> The oldest known Western armor is the [[Dendra panoply]], dating from the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Era]] around 1400 BC.\n[[Mail (armour)|Mail]], also referred to as chainmail, is made of interlocking iron rings, which may be riveted or welded shut.

While no non-metallic armor is known to have survived, it was likely to have been commonplace due to its lower cost.\n\nThe use of iron plate armor on the Korean peninsula was developed during the Gaya (Kaya) Confederacy [[Gaya Confederacy]] of 42 CE - 562 CE. The iron was mined and refined in the area surrounding Gimhae (Gyeongsangnam Provence, South Korea). Using both vertical and triangular plate design, the plate armor sets consisted of 27 or more individual 1-2mm thick curved plates, which were secured together by nail or hinge. The recovered sets include accessories such as iron arm guards, neck guards, leg guards, and horse armor/bits. The use of these armor types disappeared from use on the Korean Peninsula after the fall of the Gaya Confederacy to the Silla Dynasty, during the three kingdoms era [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] in 562 CE.<ref>Korean Archaeological Society</ref>\n\n[[Chinese armour|Eastern armor]] has a long history, beginning in [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Ancient China]]. In East Asian history laminated armor such as [[lamellar armour|lamellar]], and styles similar to the [[coat of plates]], and [[brigandine]] were commonly used. Later cuirasses and plates were also used. In pre-Qin dynasty times, leather armor was made out of rhinoceros. Chinese influence in Japan would result in the Japanese adopting Chinese styles, their [[Samurai|samurai armor]] being a result of this influence.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Turkey.Bodrum073.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[plated mail]]]]\nIn [[European history]], well-known armor types include  the [[mail (armour)|mail]] [[hauberk]] of the early medieval age, and the full steel [[plate armour|plate harness]] worn by later [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[knight]]s, and a few key components (breast and back plates) by heavy cavalry in several European countries until the first year of World War I (1914\u201315).\n\n====Plate====\n{{main|Plate armour}}\n{{further|Components of medieval armour}}\n\nGradually, small additional plates or discs of iron were added to the mail to protect vulnerable areas.  By the late 13th century, the knees were capped, and two circular discs, called [[besagew]]s were fitted to protect the underarms.\nA variety of methods for improving the protection provided by mail were used as armorers seemingly experimented.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Hardened leather and [[splint armour|splinted]] construction were used for arm and leg pieces. The [[coat of plates]] was developed, an armor made of large plates sewn inside a textile or leather coat.\n\nEarly plate in Italy, and elsewhere in the 13th to 15th centuries were made of iron. Iron armor could be [[Carburizing|carburized]] or  [[Case hardening|case hardened]] to give a surface of harder steel.{{sfn|Williams|2003|pp=740\u2013741}} Plate armor became cheaper than mail by the 15th century as it required much less labor and labor had become much more expensive after the [[Black Death]], though it did require larger furnaces to produce larger blooms.  Mail continued to be used to protect those joints which could not be adequately protected by plate, such as the armpit, crook of the elbow and groin. Another advantage of plate was that a lance rest could be fitted to the breast plate.{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=55}}\n[[File:Maratha Armour.jpg|thumb|Signature [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] helmet with curved back, side view]]\nThe small skull cap evolved into a bigger true helmet, the [[bascinet]], as it was lengthened downward to protect the back of the neck and the sides of the head.   Additionally, several new forms of fully enclosed helmets were introduced in the late 14th century to replace the [[great helm]], such as the [[sallet]] and [[barbute]] and later the [[armet]] and [[close helm]].\n\nProbably the most recognized style of armor in the world became the [[plate armour|plate armor]] associated with the [[knight]]s of the European [[Late Middle Ages]], but continuing to the early 17th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]] in all European countries.\n\nBy about 1400 the full harness of plate armor had been developed in armories of Lombardy{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=53}} Heavy cavalry dominated the battlefield for centuries in part because of their armor.\n\nIn the early 15th century, small \"[[hand cannon]]\" first began to be used, in the [[Hussite Wars]], in combination with [[Wagenburg]] tactics, allowing infantry to defeat armored knights on the battlefield. At the same time [[crossbow]]s were made more powerful to pierce armor, and the development of the Swiss [[Pike square]] formation also created substantial problems for heavy cavalry. Rather than dooming the use of body armor, the threat of small firearms intensified the use and further refinement of plate armor. There was a 150-year period in which better and more metallurgically advanced steel armor was being used, precisely because of the danger posed by the gun. Hence, guns and cavalry in plate armor were \"threat and remedy\" together on the battlefield for almost 400 years. By the 15th century Italian armor plates were almost always made of steel.{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=66}} In Southern Germany armorers began to harden their steel armor only in the late 15th century. They would continue to harden their steel for the next century because they [[quench]]ed and [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempered]] their product which allowed for the [[fire-gilding]] to be combined with tempering.{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=331}}\n\nThe quality of the metal used in armor deteriorated as armies became bigger and armor was made thicker, necessitating breeding of larger cavalry horses. If during the 14th and 15th centuries armor seldom weighed more than 15&nbsp;kg, then by the late 16th century it weighed 25&nbsp;kg.{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=916}} The increasing weight and thickness of late 16th-century armor therefore gave substantial resistance.\n\nIn the early years of pistol and [[arquebuses]], firearms were relatively low in velocity.  The full suits of armor, or breast plates actually stopped bullets fired from a modest distance. The front breast plates were, in fact, commonly shot as a test. The impact point would often be encircled with engraving to point it out. This was called the \"proof\". Armor often also bore an insignia of the maker, especially if it was of good quality.  Crossbow bolts, if still used, would seldom penetrate good plate, nor would any bullet unless fired from close range.\n\n[[File:Suits of armour for riders Berlin museum.jpg|thumb|Renaissance/Early Modern suits of armor appropriate for heavy cavalry]]\n\nIn effect, rather than making plate armor obsolete, the use of firearms stimulated the development of plate armor into its later stages. For most of that period, it allowed horsemen to fight while being the targets of defending arquebusiers without being easily killed. Full suits of armor were actually worn by generals and princely commanders right up to the 1710s.\n\n====Horse armor====\nThe horse was afforded protection from lances and infantry weapons by steel plate [[barding]].  This gave the horse protection and enhanced the visual impression of a mounted knight.  Late in the era, elaborate barding was used in parade armor.\n\n===Gunpowder era===\n[[File:Detaille - Lieutenant of cuirassiers.jpg|thumb|upright|French [[cuirassier]] of the 19th century (Drawing by [[\u00c9douard Detaille]], 1885)]]\nAs gunpowder weapons improved, it became cheaper and more effective to have groups of unarmored men with early guns than to have expensive knights, which caused armor to be largely discarded. Cavalry units continued to use armor. Examples include the German [[Reiter]], Polish heavy [[hussars]] and the back and breast worn by heavy cavalry units during the Napoleonic wars.\n\n===Late modern use===\n{{main|Bulletproof_vest#History}}\n[[File:Ministry of Information First World War Official Collection Q30161.jpg|thumb|World War I personal armour, including steel cap, steel plate vest, steel gauntlet/dagger and French splinter goggles]] \nMetal armor remained in limited use long after its general obsolescence. Soldiers in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865) bought iron and steel vests from peddlers (both sides had considered but rejected it for standard issue). The effectiveness of the vests varied widely\u2014some successfully deflected bullets and saved lives but others were poorly made and resulted in tragedy for the soldiers. In any case the vests were abandoned by many soldiers due to their weight on long marches as well as the stigma they got for being cowards from their fellow troops.\n\nAt the start of [[World War I]] in 1914, thousands of the French [[Cuirassier]]s rode out to engage the German Cavalry who likewise used helmets and armor. By that period, the shiny armor plate was covered in dark paint and a canvas wrap covered their elaborate Napoleonic-style helmets. Their armor was meant to protect only against [[sabre|saber]]s and [[lance]]s. The cavalry had to beware of high velocity [[rifle]]s and [[machine gun]]s like the foot soldiers, who at least had a [[trench]] to protect them.\n\n== Modern non-metallic armor ==\nSoldiers use metal or ceramic plates in their [[Bulletproof vest|bullet resistant vests]], providing additional protection from [[pistol]] and [[rifle]] bullets. Metallic components or tightly-woven fiber layers can give soft armor resistance to stab and slash attacks from [[knife|knives]] and [[bayonet]]s. [[Chain mail]] armored gloves continue to be used by butchers and abattoir workers to prevent cuts and wounds while cutting up carcasses.\n\n=== Fibers ===\nDuPont [[Kevlar]] is well known as a component of some bullet resistant vests and [[Ballistic face mask|bullet resistant face mask]]s. The [[Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops|PASGT helmet and vest]] used by [[United States]] military forces since the early 1980s both have Kevlar as a key component, as do their replacements. Civilian applications include Kevlar reinforced clothing for motorcycle riders to protect against abrasion injuries. Kevlar in non-woven long strand form is used inside an outer protective cover to form chaps that loggers use while operating a chainsaw. If the moving chain contacts and tears through the outer cover, the long fibers of Kevlar tangle, clog, and stop the chain from moving as they get drawn into the workings of the drive mechanism of the saw. Kevlar is used also in emergency services protection gear if it involves high heat, ''e.g.'', tackling a fire, and Kevlar such as vests for police officers, security, and [[SWAT]]. The latest Kevlar material that DuPont has developed is Kevlar XP. In comparison with \"normal\" Kevlar, Kevlar XP is more light-weight and more comfortable to wear, as its quilt stitch is not required for the ballistic package.\n\nOn the other hand, [[Twaron]] is similar to Kevlar. They both belong to the aramid family of synthetic fibers. The only difference is that Twaron was first developed by Akzo in the 1970s. Twaron was first commercially produced in 1986. Now, Twaron is being manufactured by [[Teijin Aramid]]. Like Kevlar, Twaron is a strong, synthetic fiber. It is also heat resistant and has many applications. It can be used in the production of several materials that include the military, construction, automotive, aerospace, and even sports market sectors. Among the examples of Twaron-made materials are body armor, helmets, ballistic vests, speaker woofers, drumheads, tires, turbo hoses, wire ropes, and cables.\n\nAnother fiber used to manufacture a bullet-resistant vest is Dyneema [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]]. Originated in the Netherlands, Dyneema has an extremely high strength-to-weight ratio (a 1-mm-diameter rope of Dyneema can bear up to a 240-kg load), is light enough that it can float on water, and has high energy absorption characteristics. Since the introduction of the Dyneema Force Multiplier Technology in 2013, many body armor manufacturers have switched to Dyneema for their high-end armor solutions.\n\n==Protected areas==\n{{Main|List of personal protective equipment by body area}}\n\n===Shield===\n[[File:Police officer in riot gear.jpg|thumb|upright|An American [[police officer]] in October 2002 wears a helmet while equipped with a [[riot shield]].]]\nA [[shield]] is held in the hand or arm. Its purpose is to intercept attacks, either by stopping projectiles such as arrows or by glancing a blow to the side of the shield-user, and it can also be used offensively as a bludgeoning weapon. Shields vary greatly in size, ranging from large shields that protect the user's entire body to small shields that are mostly for use in hand-to-hand combat. Shields also vary a great deal in thickness; whereas some shields were made of thick wooden planking, to protect soldiers from spears and crossbow bolts, other shields were thinner and designed mainly for glancing blows away (such as a sword blow). In prehistory, shields were made of wood, animal hide, or wicker. In antiquity and in the Middle Ages, shields were used by foot soldiers and mounted soldiers. Even after the invention of gunpowder and firearms, shields continued to be used. In the 18th century, Scottish clans continued to use small shields, and in the 19th century, some non-industrialized peoples continued to use shields. In the 20th and 21st centuries, shields are used by military and police units that specialize in anti-terrorist action, [[Hostage|hostage rescue]], and siege-breaching.\n\n===Head===\n\nA [[combat helmet]] is among the oldest forms of [[personal protective equipment]], and is known to have been worn in [[ancient India]] around 1700&nbsp;BC and the [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]] around 900&nbsp;BC, followed by the [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], throughout the [[Middle Ages]], and up to the modern era.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/colo/Jthanout/HisArmur.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219224034/http://www.nps.gov/archive/colo/Jthanout/HisArmur.html |archivedate=2007-12-19 }}</ref> Their materials and construction became more advanced as weapons became more and more powerful. Initially constructed from [[leather]] and [[brass]], and then [[bronze]] and [[iron]] during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages, they soon came to be made entirely from forged [[steel]] in many societies after about AD&nbsp;950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/weaponswarfare/g/galea.htm|title=Galea|work=About.com Education|accessdate=12 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216225903/http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/weaponswarfare/g/galea.htm|archive-date=16 December 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> At that time, they were purely military equipment, protecting the head from cutting blows with [[sword]]s, flying [[arrow]]s, and low-velocity [[musket]]ry. Some late medieval helmets, like the [[Bascinet#Great bascinet|great bascinet]], rested on the shoulders and prevented the wearer from turning his head, greatly restricting mobility. During the 18th and 19th centuries, helmets were not widely used in warfare; instead, many armies used unarmored hats that offered no protection against blade or bullet. The arrival of World War I, with its trench warfare and wide use of artillery, led to mass adoption of metal helmets once again, this time with a shape that offered mobility, a low profile, and compatibility with gas masks. Today's militaries often use high-quality helmets made of ballistic materials such as [[Kevlar]] and [[Twaron]], which have excellent bullet and fragmentation stopping power. Some helmets also have good non-ballistic protective qualities, though many do not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olive-drab.com/od_soldiers_gear_kevlar_helmet.php|title=Kevlar PASGT Helmet|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref> The two most popular ballistic helmet models are the PASGT and the MICH. The [[Modular Integrated Communications Helmet]] (MICH) type helmet has a slightly smaller coverage at the sides which allows tactical headsets and other communication equipment. The MICH model has standard pad suspension and four-point chinstrap. The Personal Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT) helmet has been in use since 1983 and has slowly been replaced by the MICH helmet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engardebodyarmor.com/hardarmor.htm|title=Hard Armor and Helmets|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nA [[ballistic face mask]] is designed to protect the wearer from ballistic threats. Ballistic face masks are usually made of kevlar or other bullet-resistant materials and the inside of the mask may be padded for shock absorption, depending on the design. Due to weight restrictions, protection levels range only up to [[National Institute of Justice|NIJ]] Level IIIA.\n\n===Torso===\n{{Main|Cuirass}}\n[[File:US Navy 071211-N-9623R-010 Seabees attached to Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 17's Convoy Security Element (CSE) stand ready to defend.

Soft vests are made from many layers of woven or laminated fibers and can be capable of protecting the wearer from small caliber [[handgun]] and [[shotgun]] projectiles, and small fragments from explosives such as [[hand grenade]]s.\n\nMetal or ceramic plates can be used with a soft vest, providing additional protection from [[rifle]] rounds, and metallic components or tightly-woven fiber layers can give soft armor resistance to stab and slash attacks from a [[knife]] or [[bayonet]]. Soft vests are commonly worn by [[police]] forces, private citizens and private [[security guard]]s or [[bodyguard]]s, whereas hard-plate reinforced vests are mainly worn by combat soldiers, police tactical units and hostage rescue teams.\n\nA modern equivalent may combine a ballistic vest with other items of protective clothing, such as a [[combat helmet]]. Vests intended for police and military use may also include ballistic shoulder and side protection armor components, and explosive ordnance disposal technicians wear heavy armor and helmets with face visors and spine protection.\n\n===Limbs===\nMedieval armor often offered protection for all of the limbs, including metal boots for the lower legs, gauntlets for the hands and wrists, and greaves for the legs. Today, protection of [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] from bombs is provided by a [[bombsuit]]. Most modern soldiers sacrifice limb protection for mobility, since armor thick enough to stop bullets would greatly inhibit movement of the arms and legs.\n\n==Performance standards==\n{{main|List of body armor performance standards}}\n\nDue to the various different types of projectiles, it is often inaccurate to refer to a particular product as \"[[Bulletproofing|bulletproof]]\" because this implies that it will protect against any and all projectiles. Instead, the term '''bullet resistant''' is generally preferred.\n\nStandards are regional. Around the world ammunition varies and as a result the armor testing must reflect the threats found locally. According to statistics from the US [[National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial|National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund]], \"a law enforcement officer\u2019s job is extremely dangerous, with one officer being killed every 53 hours in the line of duty [in the United States].  Even more astounding is that this number is on the rise. In 2011, 173 officers were killed, with 68 of them being killed due to a gun-related incident.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyarmornews.com/how-to-increase-the-wear-rate-of-bulletproof-vests|title=How To Increase The Wear Rate Of Bulletproof Vests|author=Scott Burton|work=Body Armor News- BodyArmorNews.com|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile many standards exist, a few standards are widely used as models. The US [[National Institute of Justice]] ballistic and stab documents are examples of broadly-accepted standards. Since the time that NIJ started testing, the lives of more than 3,000 officers were saved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engardebodyarmor.com/NIJ-body-armor-standard.htm|title=Overview Of The NIJ Body Armor Standard|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref> In addition to the NIJ, the United Kingdom's Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB\u2014formerly the Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB)) standards are also used by a number of other countries and organizations.  These \"model\" standards are usually adapted by other countries by following the same basic test methodologies, while changing the specific ammunition tested.  NIJ Standard-0101.06 has specific performance [[standardization|standards]] for bullet resistant vests used by law enforcement. This rates vests on the following scale against penetration and also blunt trauma protection (deformation):<ref name=\"NIJ\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/223054.pdf |title=Ballistic Resistance of NIJ Standard-0101.06 |date=July 2008 |work=NIJ Standards |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the beginning of 2018, NIJ is expected to introduce the new NIJ Standard-0101.07.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyarmornews.com/nij-standard-010107/|title=NIJ Raises the Bar for Body Armor Manufacturers with NIJ Standard-0101.07|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}</ref> This new standard will completely replace the NIJ Standard-0101.06. The current system of using Roman numerals (II, IIIA, III, and IV) to indicate the level of threat will disappear and be replaced by a naming convention similar to the standard developed by UK Home Office Scientific Development Branch. HG (Hand Gun) is for soft armor and RF (Rifle) is for hard armor. Another important change is that the test-round velocity for conditioned armor will be the same as that for new armor during testing. For example, for NIJ Standard-0101.06 Level IIIA the .44 Magnum round is currently shot at 408&nbsp;m/s for conditioned armor and at 436&nbsp;m/s for new armor. For the NIJ Standard-0101.07, the velocity for both conditioned and new armor will be the same.\n\nIn January 2012, the NIJ introduced [[BA 9000]], body armor quality management system requirements as a quality standard not unlike [[ISO 9001]] (and much of the standards were based on ISO 9001). \n\nIn addition to the NIJ and HOSDB standards, other important standards include: the [[Law enforcement in Germany|German Police]]'s Technische Richtlinie (TR) Ballistische Schutzwesten,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pfa.nrw.de/PTI_Internet/pti-intern.dhpol.local/WG/Regelungen/Schutzweste/SchutzwesteTR_03-08_Revisionen-10-08_09-09.pdf.html |title=Technische Richtlinie (TR) Ballistische Schutzwesten |date=September 2009 |publisher=Polizeitechnisches Institut (PTI) der Deutschen Hochschule der Polizei (DHPol) |language=German |accessdate=November 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312041637/http://www.pfa.nrw.de/PTI_Internet/pti-intern.dhpol.local/WG/Regelungen/Schutzweste/SchutzwesteTR_03-08_Revisionen-10-08_09-09.pdf.html# |archive-date=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Draft [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] prEN ISO 14876,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso-standard.org/25202.html |title=pr EN ISO 14876-1-2002 |publisher=www.ISO-standard.org |accessdate=November 13, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso-standard.org/25203.html |title=pr EN ISO 14876-2-2002 |publisher=www.ISO-standard.org |accessdate=November 13, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso-standard.org/25204.html |title=pr EN ISO 14876-3-2002 |publisher=www.ISO-standard.org |accessdate=November 13, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and [[Underwriters Laboratories]] (UL Standard 752).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0752.html |title=Bullet-Resisting Equipment: UL 752: Scope |date=December 21, 2006 |publisher=[[Underwriters Laboratories]] |accessdate=November 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421190415/http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0752.html |archivedate=April 21, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nTextile armor is tested for both penetration resistance by bullets and for the impact energy transmitted to the wearer. The \"backface signature\" or transmitted impact energy is measured by shooting armor mounted in front of a backing material, typically oil-based [[modelling clay]]. The clay is used at a controlled temperature and verified for impact flow before testing. After the armor is impacted with the test bullet the vest is removed from the clay and the depth of the indentation in the clay is measured.<ref name=\"NIJ\" />\n\nThe backface signature allowed by different test standards can be difficult to compare. Both the clay materials and the bullets used for the test are not common. In general the British, German and other European standards allow 20\u201325&nbsp;mm of backface signature, while the US-NIJ standards allow for 44&nbsp;mm, which can potentially cause internal injury.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2007.02.028 |title=Injuries to law enforcement officers: The backface signature injury |journal=Forensic Science International |volume=174 |issue=1 |pages=6\u201311 |year=2008 |issn=0379-0738 |first=M |last=Wilhelm |author2=Bir, C |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=19964046 |pmid=17434273}}</ref> The allowable backface signature for this has been controversial from its introduction in the first NIJ test standard and the debate as to the relative importance of penetration-resistance vs. backface signature continues in the medical and testing communities.\n\nIn general a vest's textile material temporarily degrades when wet.   Neutral water at room temp does not affect para-aramid or [[Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene|UHMWPE]] but acidic, basic and some other solutions can permanently reduce para-aramid fiber tensile strength.<ref>Kevlar, Twaron, Dyneema, Spectra technical data</ref> (As a result of this, the major test standards call for wet testing of textile armor.<ref>NIJ, HOSDB, US-Army and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] ballistic test methods</ref>)  Mechanisms for this wet loss of performance are not known. Vests that will be tested after ISO-type water immersion tend to have heat-sealed enclosures and those that are tested under NIJ-type water spray methods tend to have water-resistant enclosures.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005, a large study of the environmental degradation of Zylon armor was undertaken by the US-NIJ.  This concluded that water, long-term use, and temperature exposure significantly affect tensile strength and the ballistic performance of PBO or Zylon fiber. This NIJ study on vests returned from the field demonstrated that environmental effects on Zylon resulted in ballistic failures under standard test conditions.<ref>\"Third Status Report to the Attorney General on Safety Initiative Testing and Activities\"</ref>\n\n===Ballistic testing V50 and V0===\n\nMeasuring the ballistic performance of armor is based on determining the [[kinetic energy]] of a bullet at impact. Because the energy of a bullet is a key factor in its penetrating capacity, velocity is used as the primary independent variable in ballistic testing. For most users the key measurement is the velocity at which no bullets will penetrate the armor. Measuring this zero penetration velocity (V0) must take into account variability in armor performance and test variability. Ballistic testing has a number of sources of variability: the armor, test backing materials, bullet, casing, powder, primer and the gun barrel, to name a few.\n\nVariability reduces the predictive power of a determination of V0.  If for example, the V0 of an armor design is measured to be {{convert|1600|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} with a 9&nbsp;mm FMJ bullet based on 30 shots, the test is only an estimate of the real V0 of this armor. The problem is variability. If the V0 is tested again with a second group of 30 shots on the same vest design, the result will not be identical.\n\nOnly a single low velocity penetrating shot is required to reduce the V0 value. The more shots made the lower the V0 will go. In terms of statistics, the zero penetration velocity is the tail end of the distribution curve. If the variability is known and the standard deviation can be calculated, one can rigorously set the V0 at a confidence interval.  Test Standards now define how many shots must be used to estimate a V0 for the armor certification. This procedure defines a confidence interval of an estimate of V0. (See \"NIJ and HOSDB test methods\".)\n\nV0 is difficult to measure, so a second concept has been developed in ballistic testing called V50. This is the velocity at which 50 percent of the shots go through and 50 percent are stopped by the armor. US military standards<ref>ARMY MIL-STD-662F V50 BALLISTIC TEST FOR ARMOR</ref> define a commonly used procedure for this test. The goal is to get three shots that penetrate and a second group of three shots that are stopped by the armor all within a specified velocity range. It is possible, and desirable to have a penetration velocity lower than a stop velocity.  These three stops and three penetrations can then be used to calculate a V50 velocity.<ref>Army MIL-STD-662F V50 BALLISTIC TEST FOR ARMOR</ref>\n\nIn practice this measurement of V50 often requires 1\u20132 vest panels and 10\u201320 shots. A very useful concept in armor testing is the offset velocity between the V0 and V50. If this offset has been measured for an armor design, then V50 data can be used to measure and estimate changes in V0. For vest manufacturing, field evaluation and life testing both V0 and V50 are used. However, as a result of the simplicity of making V50 measurements, this method is more important for control of armor after certification.\n\n==== Cunniff analysis ====\nUsing dimensionless analysis, Cuniff<ref>{{Citation | last = Cunniff | first = P.

Under the assumption that the energy of impact is dissipated in breaking the yarn, it was shown that\n:<math> V_{50} = (U^* )^{1/3} f\\left(\\frac{A_d}{A_p}\\right).</math>\nHere, \n:<math>U^* = \\frac{\\sigma\\epsilon}{2\\rho}\\sqrt\\frac{E}{\\rho}</math>\n:<math>\\sigma,\\epsilon,\\rho,E</math> are the failure stress, failure strain, density and elastic modulus of the yarn\n:<math>A_d</math> is the mass per unit area of the armor\n:<math>A_p</math> is the mass per unit area of the projectile\n\n===Military testing===\n\nAfter the [[Vietnam War]], military planners developed a concept of \"Casualty Reduction\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dusablon |first=L V |title=The Casualty Reduction Analysis Model for Personnel Armor Systems |publisher=U.S. Army Natick Research, Development and Engineering Center |date=December 1972}}</ref>  The large body of casualty data made clear that in a combat situation, fragments, not bullets, were the greatest threat to soldiers. After [[World War II|WWII]] vests were being developed and fragment testing was in its early stages.<ref>Design Information for Construction of Light Personnel Armor. Authors: Willard R. Beye 1950 MIDWEST RESEARCH INST KANSAS CITY MO</ref> Artillery shells, mortar shells, aerial bombs, grenades, and antipersonnel mines are all fragmentation devices. They all contain a steel casing that is designed to burst into small steel fragments or shrapnel, when their explosive core detonates. After considerable effort measuring fragment size distribution from various [[NATO]] and [[Soviet Bloc]] munitions, a fragment test was developed. Fragment simulators were designed and the most common shape is a Right Circular Cylinder or RCC simulator. This shape has a length equal to its diameter. These RCC Fragment Simulation Projectiles (FSPs) are tested as a group. The test series most often includes 2 grain (0.13&nbsp;g), 4 grain (0.263&nbsp;g), 16 grain (1.0&nbsp;g), and 64 grain (4.2&nbsp;g) mass RCC FSP testing. The 2-4-16-64 series is based on the measured fragment size distributions.  \n \nThe second part of \"Casualty Reduction\" strategy is a study of velocity distributions of fragments from munitions.<ref>Johnson, W., Collins, C., and Kindred, F., A Mathematical Model for Predicting Residual Velocities of Fragments After Perforating Helmets, Ballistic Research Laboratories Technical Note no. 1705, October 1968</ref> Warhead explosives have blast speeds of {{convert|20000|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30000|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. As a result, they are capable of ejecting fragments at very high speeds of over 1000&nbsp;m/s (3330&nbsp;ft/s), implying very high energy (where the energy of a fragment is {{frac|1|2}} mass \u00d7 velocity<sup>2</sup>, neglecting rotational energy). The military engineering data showed that like the fragment size the fragment velocities had characteristic distributions. It is possible to segment the fragment output from a warhead into velocity groups. For example, 95% of all fragments from a bomb blast under {{convert|4|gr}} have a velocity of {{convert|3000|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} or less. This established a set of goals for military ballistic vest design.\n\nThe random nature of fragmentation required the military vest specification to trade off mass vs. ballistic-benefit. Hard vehicle armor is capable of stopping all fragments, but military personnel can only carry a limited amount of gear and equipment, so the weight of the vest is a limiting factor in vest fragment protection. The 2-4-16-64 grain series at limited velocity can be stopped by an all-textile vest of approximately 5.4&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (1.1&nbsp;lb/ft<sup>2</sup>). In contrast to the design of vest for deformable lead bullets, fragments do not change shape; they are steel and can not be deformed by textile materials. The {{convert|2|gr|adj=on}} FSP (the smallest fragment projectile commonly used in testing) is about the size of a grain of rice; such small fast moving fragments can potentially slip through the vest, moving between yarns. As a result, fabrics optimized for fragment protection are tightly woven, although these fabrics are not as effective at stopping lead bullets.\n\nBy the 2010s, the development of body armor had been stymied in regards to weight, in that designers had trouble increasing the protective capability of body armor while still maintaining or decreasing its weight.<ref>https://www.soc.mil/ARSOF_History/articles/19oct_body_armor_page_1.html</ref>\n\n==See also ==\n* [[Bulletproof vest]]\n* [[International Medieval Combat Federation]]\n* [[Liquid Armor]]\n* [[Osprey body armour]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | last = Williams | first = Alan | title = The Knight and the Blast Furnace: A History of the Metallurgy of Armour in the Middle Ages & the Early Modern Period | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | location = Leiden, The Netherlands | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-90-04-12498-1 |series=History of Warfare Volume 12 |oclc=49386331 |ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.museumsyndicate.com/tag.php?id=51 Museum Syndicate: Armor]\n* [http://www.bodyarmornews.com Body Armor News Website]\n* [http://www.hardshell.ae/ Body Armor Manufacturer and supplier company]\n* {{cite web |url= https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43544.pdf |last1=James|first1=Nathan|title=Body Armor for Law Enforcement Officers: In Brief|date=January 28, 2016|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=October 14, 2016}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/974036/flexing-in-the-line-of-fire-lightweight-flexible-body-armor-for-the-future-force.aspx?source=GovD |last1=Novobilski|first1=Marisa|title=Flexing in the line of fire: Lightweight, flexible body armor for the future force|date=October 14, 2016|publisher=Air Force Research Laboratory|accessdate=October 14, 2016}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/06/02/air-force-cadet-creates-bulletproof-breakthrough.html|title=Air Force cadet creates bulletproof breakthrough|last=Burke|first=Kelly David|date=2 June 2017|website=|publisher=Fox News|access-date=}}\n\n{{Types of armour}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Body armor| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the 2007 action film|Body Armour (film)}}\n[[File:US Navy 100714-M-6044V-029 Marine Corps Sgt.

The iron was mined and refined in the area surrounding Gimhae (Gyeongsangnam Provence, South Korea). Using both vertical and triangular plate design, the plate armor sets consisted of 27 or more individual 1-2mm thick curved plates, which were secured together by nail or hinge. The recovered sets include accessories such as iron arm guards, neck guards, leg guards, and horse armor/bits. The use of these armor types disappeared from use on the Korean Peninsula after the fall of the Gaya Confederacy to the Silla Dynasty, during the three kingdoms era [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] in 562 CE.<ref>Korean Archaeological Society</ref>\n\n[[Chinese armour|Eastern armor]] has a long history, beginning in [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Ancient China]]. In East Asian history laminated armor such as [[lamellar armour|lamellar]], and styles similar to the [[coat of plates]], and [[brigandine]] were commonly used. Later cuirasses and plates were also used. In pre-Qin dynasty times, leather armor was made out of rhinoceros. Chinese influence in Japan would result in the Japanese adopting Chinese styles, their [[Samurai|samurai armor]] being a result of this influence.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Turkey.Bodrum073.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[plated mail]]]]\nIn [[European history]], well-known armor types include  the [[mail (armour)|mail]] [[hauberk]] of the early medieval age, and the full steel [[plate armour|plate harness]] worn by later [[Medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[knight]]s, and a few key components (breast and back plates) by heavy cavalry in several European countries until the first year of World War I (1914\u201315).\n\n====Plate====\n{{main|Plate armour}}\n{{further|Components of medieval armour}}\n\nGradually, small additional plates or discs of iron were added to the mail to protect vulnerable areas.  By the late 13th century, the knees were capped, and two circular discs, called [[besagew]]s were fitted to protect the underarms.\nA variety of methods for improving the protection provided by mail were used as armorers seemingly experimented.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Hardened leather and [[splint armour|splinted]] construction were used for arm and leg pieces. The [[coat of plates]] was developed, an armor made of large plates sewn inside a textile or leather coat.\n\nEarly plate in Italy, and elsewhere in the 13th to 15th centuries were made of iron. Iron armor could be [[Carburizing|carburized]] or  [[Case hardening|case hardened]] to give a surface of harder steel.{{sfn|Williams|2003|pp=740\u2013741}} Plate armor became cheaper than mail by the 15th century as it required much less labor and labor had become much more expensive after the [[Black Death]], though it did require larger furnaces to produce larger blooms.  Mail continued to be used to protect those joints which could not be adequately protected by plate, such as the armpit, crook of the elbow and groin. Another advantage of plate was that a lance rest could be fitted to the breast plate.{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=55}}\n[[File:Maratha Armour.jpg|thumb|Signature [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] helmet with curved back, side view]]\nThe small skull cap evolved into a bigger true helmet, the [[bascinet]], as it was lengthened downward to protect the back of the neck and the sides of the head.   Additionally, several new forms of fully enclosed helmets were introduced in the late 14th century to replace the [[great helm]], such as the [[sallet]] and [[barbute]] and later the [[armet]] and [[close helm]].\n\nProbably the most recognized style of armor in the world became the [[plate armour|plate armor]] associated with the [[knight]]s of the European [[Late Middle Ages]], but continuing to the early 17th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]] in all European countries.\n\nBy about 1400 the full harness of plate armor had been developed in armories of Lombardy{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=53}} Heavy cavalry dominated the battlefield for centuries in part because of their armor.\n\nIn the early 15th century, small \"[[hand cannon]]\" first began to be used, in the [[Hussite Wars]], in combination with [[Wagenburg]] tactics, allowing infantry to defeat armored knights on the battlefield. At the same time [[crossbow]]s were made more powerful to pierce armor, and the development of the Swiss [[Pike square]] formation also created substantial problems for heavy cavalry. Rather than dooming the use of body armor, the threat of small firearms intensified the use and further refinement of plate armor. There was a 150-year period in which better and more metallurgically advanced steel armor was being used, precisely because of the danger posed by the gun. Hence, guns and cavalry in plate armor were \"threat and remedy\" together on the battlefield for almost 400 years. By the 15th century Italian armor plates were almost always made of steel.{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=66}} In Southern Germany armorers began to harden their steel armor only in the late 15th century. They would continue to harden their steel for the next century because they [[quench]]ed and [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempered]] their product which allowed for the [[fire-gilding]] to be combined with tempering.{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=331}}\n\nThe quality of the metal used in armor deteriorated as armies became bigger and armor was made thicker, necessitating breeding of larger cavalry horses. If during the 14th and 15th centuries armor seldom weighed more than 15&nbsp;kg, then by the late 16th century it weighed 25&nbsp;kg.{{sfn|Williams|2003|p=916}} The increasing weight and thickness of late 16th-century armor therefore gave substantial resistance.\n\nIn the early years of pistol and [[arquebuses]], firearms were relatively low in velocity.  The full suits of armor, or breast plates actually stopped bullets fired from a modest distance. The front breast plates were, in fact, commonly shot as a test. The impact point would often be encircled with engraving to point it out. This was called the \"proof\". Armor often also bore an insignia of the maker, especially if it was of good quality.  Crossbow bolts, if still used, would seldom penetrate good plate, nor would any bullet unless fired from close range.\n\n[[File:Suits of armour for riders Berlin museum.jpg|thumb|Renaissance/Early Modern suits of armor appropriate for heavy cavalry]]\n\nIn effect, rather than making plate armor obsolete, the use of firearms stimulated the development of plate armor into its later stages. For most of that period, it allowed horsemen to fight while being the targets of defending arquebusiers without being easily killed. Full suits of armor were actually worn by generals and princely commanders right up to the 1710s.\n\n====Horse armor====\nThe horse was afforded protection from lances and infantry weapons by steel plate [[barding]].  This gave the horse protection and enhanced the visual impression of a mounted knight.  Late in the era, elaborate barding was used in parade armor.\n\n===Gunpowder era===\n[[File:Detaille - Lieutenant of cuirassiers.jpg|thumb|upright|French [[cuirassier]] of the 19th century (Drawing by [[\u00c9douard Detaille]], 1885)]]\nAs gunpowder weapons improved, it became cheaper and more effective to have groups of unarmored men with early guns than to have expensive knights, which caused armor to be largely discarded. Cavalry units continued to use armor. Examples include the German [[Reiter]], Polish heavy [[hussars]] and the back and breast worn by heavy cavalry units during the Napoleonic wars.\n\n===Late modern use===\n{{main|Bulletproof_vest#History}}\n[[File:Ministry of Information First World War Official Collection Q30161.jpg|thumb|World War I personal armour, including steel cap, steel plate vest, steel gauntlet/dagger and French splinter goggles]] \nMetal armor remained in limited use long after its general obsolescence. Soldiers in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865) bought iron and steel vests from peddlers (both sides had considered but rejected it for standard issue). The effectiveness of the vests varied widely\u2014some successfully deflected bullets and saved lives but others were poorly made and resulted in tragedy for the soldiers. In any case the vests were abandoned by many soldiers due to their weight on long marches as well as the stigma they got for being cowards from their fellow troops.\n\nAt the start of [[World War I]] in 1914, thousands of the French [[Cuirassier]]s rode out to engage the German Cavalry who likewise used helmets and armor. By that period, the shiny armor plate was covered in dark paint and a canvas wrap covered their elaborate Napoleonic-style helmets. Their armor was meant to protect only against [[sabre|saber]]s and [[lance]]s. The cavalry had to beware of high velocity [[rifle]]s and [[machine gun]]s like the foot soldiers, who at least had a [[trench]] to protect them.\n\n== Modern non-metallic armor ==\nSoldiers use metal or ceramic plates in their [[Bulletproof vest|bullet resistant vests]], providing additional protection from [[pistol]] and [[rifle]] bullets. Metallic components or tightly-woven fiber layers can give soft armor resistance to stab and slash attacks from [[knife|knives]] and [[bayonet]]s. [[Chain mail]] armored gloves continue to be used by butchers and abattoir workers to prevent cuts and wounds while cutting up carcasses.\n\n=== Fibers ===\nDuPont [[Kevlar]] is well known as a component of some bullet resistant vests and [[Ballistic face mask|bullet resistant face mask]]s. The [[Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops|PASGT helmet and vest]] used by [[United States]] military forces since the early 1980s both have Kevlar as a key component, as do their replacements. Civilian applications include Kevlar reinforced clothing for motorcycle riders to protect against abrasion injuries. Kevlar in non-woven long strand form is used inside an outer protective cover to form chaps that loggers use while operating a chainsaw. If the moving chain contacts and tears through the outer cover, the long fibers of Kevlar tangle, clog, and stop the chain from moving as they get drawn into the workings of the drive mechanism of the saw. Kevlar is used also in emergency services protection gear if it involves high heat, ''e.g.'', tackling a fire, and Kevlar such as vests for police officers, security, and [[SWAT]]. The latest Kevlar material that DuPont has developed is Kevlar XP. In comparison with \"normal\" Kevlar, Kevlar XP is more light-weight and more comfortable to wear, as its quilt stitch is not required for the ballistic package.\n\nOn the other hand, [[Twaron]] is similar to Kevlar. They both belong to the aramid family of synthetic fibers. The only difference is that Twaron was first developed by Akzo in the 1970s. Twaron was first commercially produced in 1986. Now, Twaron is being manufactured by [[Teijin Aramid]]. Like Kevlar, Twaron is a strong, synthetic fiber. It is also heat resistant and has many applications. It can be used in the production of several materials that include the military, construction, automotive, aerospace, and even sports market sectors. Among the examples of Twaron-made materials are body armor, helmets, ballistic vests, speaker woofers, drumheads, tires, turbo hoses, wire ropes, and cables.\n\nAnother fiber used to manufacture a bullet-resistant vest is Dyneema [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]]. Originated in the Netherlands, Dyneema has an extremely high strength-to-weight ratio (a 1-mm-diameter rope of Dyneema can bear up to a 240-kg load), is light enough that it can float on water, and has high energy absorption characteristics. Since the introduction of the Dyneema Force Multiplier Technology in 2013, many body armor manufacturers have switched to Dyneema for their high-end armor solutions.\n\n==Protected areas==\n{{Main|List of personal protective equipment by body area}}\n\n===Shield===\n[[File:Police officer in riot gear.jpg|thumb|upright|An American [[police officer]] in October 2002 wears a helmet while equipped with a [[riot shield]].]]\nA [[shield]] is held in the hand or arm. Its purpose is to intercept attacks, either by stopping projectiles such as arrows or by glancing a blow to the side of the shield-user, and it can also be used offensively as a bludgeoning weapon. Shields vary greatly in size, ranging from large shields that protect the user's entire body to small shields that are mostly for use in hand-to-hand combat. Shields also vary a great deal in thickness; whereas some shields were made of thick wooden planking, to protect soldiers from spears and crossbow bolts, other shields were thinner and designed mainly for glancing blows away (such as a sword blow). In prehistory, shields were made of wood, animal hide, or wicker. In antiquity and in the Middle Ages, shields were used by foot soldiers and mounted soldiers. Even after the invention of gunpowder and firearms, shields continued to be used. In the 18th century, Scottish clans continued to use small shields, and in the 19th century, some non-industrialized peoples continued to use shields. In the 20th and 21st centuries, shields are used by military and police units that specialize in anti-terrorist action, [[Hostage|hostage rescue]], and siege-breaching.\n\n===Head===\n\nA [[combat helmet]] is among the oldest forms of [[personal protective equipment]], and is known to have been worn in [[ancient India]] around 1700&nbsp;BC and the [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]] around 900&nbsp;BC, followed by the [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], throughout the [[Middle Ages]], and up to the modern era.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/colo/Jthanout/HisArmur.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219224034/http://www.nps.gov/archive/colo/Jthanout/HisArmur.html |archivedate=2007-12-19 }}</ref> Their materials and construction became more advanced as weapons became more and more powerful. Initially constructed from [[leather]] and [[brass]], and then [[bronze]] and [[iron]] during the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age|Iron]] Ages, they soon came to be made entirely from forged [[steel]] in many societies after about AD&nbsp;950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/weaponswarfare/g/galea.htm|title=Galea|work=About.com Education|accessdate=12 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216225903/http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/weaponswarfare/g/galea.htm|archive-date=16 December 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> At that time, they were purely military equipment, protecting the head from cutting blows with [[sword]]s, flying [[arrow]]s, and low-velocity [[musket]]ry. Some late medieval helmets, like the [[Bascinet#Great bascinet|great bascinet]], rested on the shoulders and prevented the wearer from turning his head, greatly restricting mobility. During the 18th and 19th centuries, helmets were not widely used in warfare; instead, many armies used unarmored hats that offered no protection against blade or bullet. The arrival of World War I, with its trench warfare and wide use of artillery, led to mass adoption of metal helmets once again, this time with a shape that offered mobility, a low profile, and compatibility with gas masks. Today's militaries often use high-quality helmets made of ballistic materials such as [[Kevlar]] and [[Twaron]], which have excellent bullet and fragmentation stopping power. Some helmets also have good non-ballistic protective qualities, though many do not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olive-drab.com/od_soldiers_gear_kevlar_helmet.php|title=Kevlar PASGT Helmet|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref> The two most popular ballistic helmet models are the PASGT and the MICH. The [[Modular Integrated Communications Helmet]] (MICH) type helmet has a slightly smaller coverage at the sides which allows tactical headsets and other communication equipment. The MICH model has standard pad suspension and four-point chinstrap. The Personal Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT) helmet has been in use since 1983 and has slowly been replaced by the MICH helmet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engardebodyarmor.com/hardarmor.htm|title=Hard Armor and Helmets|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nA [[ballistic face mask]] is designed to protect the wearer from ballistic threats. Ballistic face masks are usually made of kevlar or other bullet-resistant materials and the inside of the mask may be padded for shock absorption, depending on the design. Due to weight restrictions, protection levels range only up to [[National Institute of Justice|NIJ]] Level IIIA.\n\n===Torso===\n{{Main|Cuirass}}\n[[File:US Navy 071211-N-9623R-010 Seabees attached to Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 17's Convoy Security Element (CSE) stand ready to defend.

Soft vests are made from many layers of woven or laminated fibers and can be capable of protecting the wearer from small caliber [[handgun]] and [[shotgun]] projectiles, and small fragments from explosives such as [[hand grenade]]s.\n\nMetal or ceramic plates can be used with a soft vest, providing additional protection from [[rifle]] rounds, and metallic components or tightly-woven fiber layers can give soft armor resistance to stab and slash attacks from a [[knife]] or [[bayonet]]. Soft vests are commonly worn by [[police]] forces, private citizens and private [[security guard]]s or [[bodyguard]]s, whereas hard-plate reinforced vests are mainly worn by combat soldiers, police tactical units and hostage rescue teams.\n\nA modern equivalent may combine a ballistic vest with other items of protective clothing, such as a [[combat helmet]]. Vests intended for police and military use may also include ballistic shoulder and side protection armor components, and explosive ordnance disposal technicians wear heavy armor and helmets with face visors and spine protection.\n\n===Limbs===\nMedieval armor often offered protection for all of the limbs, including metal boots for the lower legs, gauntlets for the hands and wrists, and greaves for the legs. Today, protection of [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] from bombs is provided by a [[bombsuit]]. Most modern soldiers sacrifice limb protection for mobility, since armor thick enough to stop bullets would greatly inhibit movement of the arms and legs.\n\n==Performance standards==\n{{main|List of body armor performance standards}}\n\nDue to the various different types of projectiles, it is often inaccurate to refer to a particular product as \"[[Bulletproofing|bulletproof]]\" because this implies that it will protect against any and all projectiles. Instead, the term '''bullet resistant''' is generally preferred.\n\nStandards are regional. Around the world ammunition varies and as a result the armor testing must reflect the threats found locally. According to statistics from the US [[National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial|National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund]], \"a law enforcement officer\u2019s job is extremely dangerous, with one officer being killed every 53 hours in the line of duty [in the United States].  Even more astounding is that this number is on the rise. In 2011, 173 officers were killed, with 68 of them being killed due to a gun-related incident.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyarmornews.com/how-to-increase-the-wear-rate-of-bulletproof-vests|title=How To Increase The Wear Rate Of Bulletproof Vests|author=Scott Burton|work=Body Armor News- BodyArmorNews.com|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile many standards exist, a few standards are widely used as models. The US [[National Institute of Justice]] ballistic and stab documents are examples of broadly-accepted standards. Since the time that NIJ started testing, the lives of more than 3,000 officers were saved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engardebodyarmor.com/NIJ-body-armor-standard.htm|title=Overview Of The NIJ Body Armor Standard|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref> In addition to the NIJ, the United Kingdom's Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB\u2014formerly the Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB)) standards are also used by a number of other countries and organizations.  These \"model\" standards are usually adapted by other countries by following the same basic test methodologies, while changing the specific ammunition tested.  NIJ Standard-0101.06 has specific performance [[standardization|standards]] for bullet resistant vests used by law enforcement. This rates vests on the following scale against penetration and also blunt trauma protection (deformation):<ref name=\"NIJ\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/223054.pdf |title=Ballistic Resistance of NIJ Standard-0101.06 |date=July 2008 |work=NIJ Standards |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the beginning of 2018, NIJ is expected to introduce the new NIJ Standard-0101.07.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyarmornews.com/nij-standard-010107/|title=NIJ Raises the Bar for Body Armor Manufacturers with NIJ Standard-0101.07|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}</ref> This new standard will completely replace the NIJ Standard-0101.06. The current system of using Roman numerals (II, IIIA, III, and IV) to indicate the level of threat will disappear and be replaced by a naming convention similar to the standard developed by UK Home Office Scientific Development Branch. HG (Hand Gun) is for soft armor and RF (Rifle) is for hard armor. Another important change is that the test-round velocity for conditioned armor will be the same as that for new armor during testing. For example, for NIJ Standard-0101.06 Level IIIA the .44 Magnum round is currently shot at 408&nbsp;m/s for conditioned armor and at 436&nbsp;m/s for new armor. For the NIJ Standard-0101.07, the velocity for both conditioned and new armor will be the same.\n\nIn January 2012, the NIJ introduced [[BA 9000]], body armor quality management system requirements as a quality standard not unlike [[ISO 9001]] (and much of the standards were based on ISO 9001). \n\nIn addition to the NIJ and HOSDB standards, other important standards include: the [[Law enforcement in Germany|German Police]]'s Technische Richtlinie (TR) Ballistische Schutzwesten,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pfa.nrw.de/PTI_Internet/pti-intern.dhpol.local/WG/Regelungen/Schutzweste/SchutzwesteTR_03-08_Revisionen-10-08_09-09.pdf.html |title=Technische Richtlinie (TR) Ballistische Schutzwesten |date=September 2009 |publisher=Polizeitechnisches Institut (PTI) der Deutschen Hochschule der Polizei (DHPol) |language=German |accessdate=November 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312041637/http://www.pfa.nrw.de/PTI_Internet/pti-intern.dhpol.local/WG/Regelungen/Schutzweste/SchutzwesteTR_03-08_Revisionen-10-08_09-09.pdf.html# |archive-date=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Draft [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] prEN ISO 14876,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso-standard.org/25202.html |title=pr EN ISO 14876-1-2002 |publisher=www.ISO-standard.org |accessdate=November 13, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso-standard.org/25203.html |title=pr EN ISO 14876-2-2002 |publisher=www.ISO-standard.org |accessdate=November 13, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iso-standard.org/25204.html |title=pr EN ISO 14876-3-2002 |publisher=www.ISO-standard.org |accessdate=November 13, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and [[Underwriters Laboratories]] (UL Standard 752).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0752.html |title=Bullet-Resisting Equipment: UL 752: Scope |date=December 21, 2006 |publisher=[[Underwriters Laboratories]] |accessdate=November 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421190415/http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0752.html |archivedate=April 21, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nTextile armor is tested for both penetration resistance by bullets and for the impact energy transmitted to the wearer. The \"backface signature\" or transmitted impact energy is measured by shooting armor mounted in front of a backing material, typically oil-based [[modelling clay]]. The clay is used at a controlled temperature and verified for impact flow before testing. After the armor is impacted with the test bullet the vest is removed from the clay and the depth of the indentation in the clay is measured.<ref name=\"NIJ\" />\n\nThe backface signature allowed by different test standards can be difficult to compare. Both the clay materials and the bullets used for the test are not common. In general the British, German and other European standards allow 20\u201325&nbsp;mm of backface signature, while the US-NIJ standards allow for 44&nbsp;mm, which can potentially cause internal injury.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2007.02.028 |title=Injuries to law enforcement officers: The backface signature injury |journal=Forensic Science International |volume=174 |issue=1 |pages=6\u201311 |year=2008 |issn=0379-0738 |first=M |last=Wilhelm |author2=Bir, C |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=19964046 |pmid=17434273}}</ref> The allowable backface signature for this has been controversial from its introduction in the first NIJ test standard and the debate as to the relative importance of penetration-resistance vs. backface signature continues in the medical and testing communities.\n\nIn general a vest's textile material temporarily degrades when wet.   Neutral water at room temp does not affect para-aramid or [[Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene|UHMWPE]] but acidic, basic and some other solutions can permanently reduce para-aramid fiber tensile strength.<ref>Kevlar, Twaron, Dyneema, Spectra technical data</ref> (As a result of this, the major test standards call for wet testing of textile armor.<ref>NIJ, HOSDB, US-Army and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] ballistic test methods</ref>)  Mechanisms for this wet loss of performance are not known. Vests that will be tested after ISO-type water immersion tend to have heat-sealed enclosures and those that are tested under NIJ-type water spray methods tend to have water-resistant enclosures.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005, a large study of the environmental degradation of Zylon armor was undertaken by the US-NIJ.  This concluded that water, long-term use, and temperature exposure significantly affect tensile strength and the ballistic performance of PBO or Zylon fiber. This NIJ study on vests returned from the field demonstrated that environmental effects on Zylon resulted in ballistic failures under standard test conditions.<ref>\"Third Status Report to the Attorney General on Safety Initiative Testing and Activities\"</ref>\n\n===Ballistic testing V50 and V0===\n\nMeasuring the ballistic performance of armor is based on determining the [[kinetic energy]] of a bullet at impact. Because the energy of a bullet is a key factor in its penetrating capacity, velocity is used as the primary independent variable in ballistic testing. For most users the key measurement is the velocity at which no bullets will penetrate the armor. Measuring this zero penetration velocity (V0) must take into account variability in armor performance and test variability. Ballistic testing has a number of sources of variability: the armor, test backing materials, bullet, casing, powder, primer and the gun barrel, to name a few.\n\nVariability reduces the predictive power of a determination of V0.  If for example, the V0 of an armor design is measured to be {{convert|1600|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} with a 9&nbsp;mm FMJ bullet based on 30 shots, the test is only an estimate of the real V0 of this armor. The problem is variability. If the V0 is tested again with a second group of 30 shots on the same vest design, the result will not be identical.\n\nOnly a single low velocity penetrating shot is required to reduce the V0 value. The more shots made the lower the V0 will go. In terms of statistics, the zero penetration velocity is the tail end of the distribution curve. If the variability is known and the standard deviation can be calculated, one can rigorously set the V0 at a confidence interval.  Test Standards now define how many shots must be used to estimate a V0 for the armor certification. This procedure defines a confidence interval of an estimate of V0. (See \"NIJ and HOSDB test methods\".)\n\nV0 is difficult to measure, so a second concept has been developed in ballistic testing called V50. This is the velocity at which 50 percent of the shots go through and 50 percent are stopped by the armor. US military standards<ref>ARMY MIL-STD-662F V50 BALLISTIC TEST FOR ARMOR</ref> define a commonly used procedure for this test. The goal is to get three shots that penetrate and a second group of three shots that are stopped by the armor all within a specified velocity range. It is possible, and desirable to have a penetration velocity lower than a stop velocity.  These three stops and three penetrations can then be used to calculate a V50 velocity.<ref>Army MIL-STD-662F V50 BALLISTIC TEST FOR ARMOR</ref>\n\nIn practice this measurement of V50 often requires 1\u20132 vest panels and 10\u201320 shots. A very useful concept in armor testing is the offset velocity between the V0 and V50. If this offset has been measured for an armor design, then V50 data can be used to measure and estimate changes in V0. For vest manufacturing, field evaluation and life testing both V0 and V50 are used. However, as a result of the simplicity of making V50 measurements, this method is more important for control of armor after certification.\n\n==== Cunniff analysis ====\nUsing dimensionless analysis, Cuniff<ref>{{Citation | last = Cunniff | first = P.

Under the assumption that the energy of impact is dissipated in breaking the yarn, it was shown that\n:<math> V_{50} = (U^* )^{1/3} f\\left(\\frac{A_d}{A_p}\\right).</math>\nHere, \n:<math>U^* = \\frac{\\sigma\\epsilon}{2\\rho}\\sqrt\\frac{E}{\\rho}</math>\n:<math>\\sigma,\\epsilon,\\rho,E</math> are the failure stress, failure strain, density and elastic modulus of the yarn\n:<math>A_d</math> is the mass per unit area of the armor\n:<math>A_p</math> is the mass per unit area of the projectile\n\n===Military testing===\n\nAfter the [[Vietnam War]], military planners developed a concept of \"Casualty Reduction\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dusablon |first=L V |title=The Casualty Reduction Analysis Model for Personnel Armor Systems |publisher=U.S. Army Natick Research, Development and Engineering Center |date=December 1972}}</ref>  The large body of casualty data made clear that in a combat situation, fragments, not bullets, were the greatest threat to soldiers. After [[World War II|WWII]] vests were being developed and fragment testing was in its early stages.<ref>Design Information for Construction of Light Personnel Armor. Authors: Willard R. Beye 1950 MIDWEST RESEARCH INST KANSAS CITY MO</ref> Artillery shells, mortar shells, aerial bombs, grenades, and antipersonnel mines are all fragmentation devices. They all contain a steel casing that is designed to burst into small steel fragments or shrapnel, when their explosive core detonates. After considerable effort measuring fragment size distribution from various [[NATO]] and [[Soviet Bloc]] munitions, a fragment test was developed. Fragment simulators were designed and the most common shape is a Right Circular Cylinder or RCC simulator. This shape has a length equal to its diameter. These RCC Fragment Simulation Projectiles (FSPs) are tested as a group. The test series most often includes 2 grain (0.13&nbsp;g), 4 grain (0.263&nbsp;g), 16 grain (1.0&nbsp;g), and 64 grain (4.2&nbsp;g) mass RCC FSP testing. The 2-4-16-64 series is based on the measured fragment size distributions.  \n \nThe second part of \"Casualty Reduction\" strategy is a study of velocity distributions of fragments from munitions.<ref>Johnson, W., Collins, C., and Kindred, F., A Mathematical Model for Predicting Residual Velocities of Fragments After Perforating Helmets, Ballistic Research Laboratories Technical Note no. 1705, October 1968</ref> Warhead explosives have blast speeds of {{convert|20000|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30000|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. As a result, they are capable of ejecting fragments at very high speeds of over 1000&nbsp;m/s (3330&nbsp;ft/s), implying very high energy (where the energy of a fragment is {{frac|1|2}} mass \u00d7 velocity<sup>2</sup>, neglecting rotational energy). The military engineering data showed that like the fragment size the fragment velocities had characteristic distributions. It is possible to segment the fragment output from a warhead into velocity groups. For example, 95% of all fragments from a bomb blast under {{convert|4|gr}} have a velocity of {{convert|3000|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} or less. This established a set of goals for military ballistic vest design.\n\nThe random nature of fragmentation required the military vest specification to trade off mass vs. ballistic-benefit. Hard vehicle armor is capable of stopping all fragments, but military personnel can only carry a limited amount of gear and equipment, so the weight of the vest is a limiting factor in vest fragment protection. The 2-4-16-64 grain series at limited velocity can be stopped by an all-textile vest of approximately 5.4&nbsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (1.1&nbsp;lb/ft<sup>2</sup>). In contrast to the design of vest for deformable lead bullets, fragments do not change shape; they are steel and can not be deformed by textile materials. The {{convert|2|gr|adj=on}} FSP (the smallest fragment projectile commonly used in testing) is about the size of a grain of rice; such small fast moving fragments can potentially slip through the vest, moving between yarns. As a result, fabrics optimized for fragment protection are tightly woven, although these fabrics are not as effective at stopping lead bullets.\n\nBy the 2010s, the development of body armor had been stymied in regards to weight, in that designers had trouble increasing the protective capability of body armor while still maintaining or decreasing its weight.<ref>https://www.soc.mil/ARSOF_History/articles/19oct_body_armor_page_1.html</ref>\n\n==See also ==\n* [[Bulletproof vest]]\n* [[International Medieval Combat Federation]]\n* [[Liquid Armor]]\n* [[Osprey body armour]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | last = Williams | first = Alan | title = The Knight and the Blast Furnace: A History of the Metallurgy of Armour in the Middle Ages & the Early Modern Period | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | location = Leiden, The Netherlands | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-90-04-12498-1 |series=History of Warfare Volume 12 |oclc=49386331 |ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.museumsyndicate.com/tag.php?id=51 Museum Syndicate: Armor]\n* [http://www.bodyarmornews.com Body Armor News Website]\n* [http://www.hardshell.ae/ Body Armor Manufacturer and supplier company]\n* {{cite web |url= https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43544.pdf |last1=James|first1=Nathan|title=Body Armor for Law Enforcement Officers: In Brief|date=January 28, 2016|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=October 14, 2016}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/974036/flexing-in-the-line-of-fire-lightweight-flexible-body-armor-for-the-future-force.aspx?source=GovD |last1=Novobilski|first1=Marisa|title=Flexing in the line of fire: Lightweight, flexible body armor for the future force|date=October 14, 2016|publisher=Air Force Research Laboratory|accessdate=October 14, 2016}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/06/02/air-force-cadet-creates-bulletproof-breakthrough.html|title=Air Force cadet creates bulletproof breakthrough|last=Burke|first=Kelly David|date=2 June 2017|website=|publisher=Fox News|access-date=}}\n\n{{Types of armour}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Body armor| ]]\n", "name_user": "58.179.172.145", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_armor"}

Thinking of this as a step-by-step procedure (namely, take a number {{mvar|x}}, multiply it by 5, then subtract 7 from the result), to reverse this and get {{mvar|x}} back from some output value, say {{mvar|y}}, we should undo each step in reverse order. In this case that means that we should add 7 to {{mvar|y}} and then divide the result by 5. In functional notation this inverse function would be given by,\n:<math>g(y) = \\frac{y + 7}{5}.</math>\nWith {{math|1=''y'' = 5''x'' \u2212 7}} we have that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}} and {{math|1=''g''(''y'') = ''x''}}.\n\nNot all functions have inverse functions;<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB1\"/> those which do are called '''invertible'''. In order for a function {{math|''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} to have an inverse, it must have the property that [[for every]] {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|Y}} there must be [[uniqueness quantification|one, and only one]] {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}} so that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}}. This property ensures that a function {{math|''g'': ''Y'' \u2192 ''X''}} will exist having the necessary relationship with {{mvar|f}}.\n\n==Definitions==\n[[Image:Inverse Functions Domain and Range.png|thumb|right|240px|If {{mvar|f}} maps {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}}, then {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} maps {{mvar|Y}} back to {{mvar|X}}.]]\n\nLet {{mvar|f}} be a function whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|X}}, and whose [[Range of a function|image (range)]] is the set {{mvar|Y}}. Then {{mvar|f}} is ''invertible'' if there exists a function {{mvar|g}} with domain {{mvar|Y}} and image {{mvar|X}}, with the property:\n:<math>f(x) = y\\,\\,\\Leftrightarrow\\,\\,g(y) = x.</math>\n\nIf {{mvar|f}} is invertible, the function {{mvar|g}} is [[unique (mathematics)|unique]],<ref>{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 101, Theorem 4.5.1}}</ref> which means that there is exactly one function {{mvar|g}} satisfying this property (no more, no less). That function {{mvar|g}} is then called ''the'' inverse of {{mvar|f}}, and is usually denoted as {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}}.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB2\"/>\n\nStated otherwise, a function, considered as a [[binary relation]], has an inverse if and only if the [[converse relation]] is a function on the range {{mvar|Y}}, in which case the converse relation is the inverse function.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Eggen|St. Andre|2006|loc=p. 202, Theorem 4.9}}</ref>\n\nNot all functions have an inverse. For a function to have an inverse, each element {{math|''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}} must correspond to no more than one {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}}; a function {{mvar|f}} with this property is called one-to-one or an [[injective function|injection]]. If {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} is to be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on {{mvar|Y}}, then each element {{math|''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}} must correspond to some {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}}. Functions with this property are called [[surjective function|surjections]]. This property is satisfied by definition if {{mvar|Y}} is the image (range) of {{mvar|f}}, but may not hold in a more general context. To be invertible, a function must be both an injection and a surjection. Such functions are called [[bijections]]. The inverse of an injection {{math| ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} that is not a bijection, that is, a function that is not a surjection, is only a [[partial function]] on {{mvar|Y}}, which means that for some {{math|''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}}, {{math|''f''<sup> \u22121</sup>(''y'')}} is undefined. If a function {{mvar|f}} is invertible, then both it and its inverse function {{math|''f''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} are bijections.\n\nThere is another convention used in the definition of functions. This can be referred to as the \"set-theoretic\" or \"graph\" definition using [[ordered pair]]s in which a [[codomain]] is never referred to.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|1998|loc=p.198}}</ref> Under this convention all functions are surjections,<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB3\"/> and so, being a bijection simply means being an injection. Authors using this convention may use the phrasing that a function is invertible if and only if it is an injection.<ref>{{harvnb|Fletcher|Patty|1988|loc=p. 116 Theorem 5.1}}</ref> The two conventions need not cause confusion as long as it is remembered that in this alternate convention the codomain of a function is always taken to be the range of the function.\n\n===Example: Squaring and square root functions===\nThe function {{math|''f'': \u211d \u2192 [0,\u221e)}} given by {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is not injective since each possible result ''y'' (except 0) corresponds to two different starting points in {{mvar|X}} \u2013 one positive and one negative, and so this function is not invertible. With this type of function it is impossible to deduce an input from its output. Such a function is called non-[[Injective function|injective]] or, in some applications, information-losing.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIf the domain of the function is restricted to the nonnegative reals, that is, the function is redefined to be {{math|''f'': [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e)}} with the same ''rule'' as before, then the function is bijective and so, invertible.<ref>{{harvnb|Lay|2006|loc=p.69 Example 7.24}}</ref> The inverse function here is called the ''(positive) square root function''.\n<!-- Repetitive. To be held for a short time until refactor is finished. \n===Inverses in higher mathematics===\nThe definition given above is commonly adopted in [[set theory]] and [[calculus]]. In higher mathematics, the notation\n:<math>f\\colon X \\to Y </math>\nmeans \"{{mvar|f}} is a function mapping elements of a set {{mvar|X}} to elements of a set {{mvar|Y\u2009}}\".  The source, {{mvar|X}}, is called the domain of {{mvar|f}}, and the target, {{mvar|Y}}, is called the [[codomain]].  The codomain contains the range of {{mvar|f}} as a [[subset]], and is part of the definition of {{mvar|f}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Eggen|St. Andre|2006|loc=p. 179}}</ref>\n\nWhen using codomains, the inverse of a function {{math| ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} is required to have domain {{mvar|Y}} and codomain {{mvar|X}}.  For the inverse to be defined on all of {{mvar|Y}}, every element of {{mvar|Y}} must lie in the range of the function {{mvar|f}}.  A function with this property is called ''onto'' or ''[[Surjective function|surjective]]''.  Thus, a function with a codomain is invertible if and only if it is both ''[[Injective function|injective]]'' (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).  Such a function is called a one-to-one correspondence or a [[bijection]], and has the property that every element {{math| ''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}} corresponds to exactly one element {{math| ''x'' \u2208 ''X''}}.\n-->\n\n==={{anchor|Compositional inverse}}Inverses and composition===\n{{See also|Inverse element}}\n\nIf {{mvar|f}} is an invertible function with domain {{mvar|X}} and range {{mvar|Y}}, then\n\n:<math> f^{-1}\\left( \\, f(x) \\, \\right) = x</math>, for every <math>x \\in X. </math>\n\nUsing the [[composition of functions]] we can rewrite this statement as follows:\n\n:<math> f^{-1} \\circ f = \\operatorname{id}_X, </math>\n\nwhere {{math|id<sub>''X''</sub>}} is the [[identity function]] on the set {{mvar|X}}; that is, the function that leaves its argument unchanged. In [[category theory]], this statement is used as the definition of an inverse [[morphism]].\n\nConsidering function composition helps to understand the notation {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}}. Repeatedly composing a function with itself is called [[iterated function|iteration]]. If {{mvar|f}} is applied {{mvar|n}} times, starting with the value {{mvar|x}}, then this is written as {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009''n''</sup>(''x'')}}; so {{math|''f''<sup>\u20092</sup>(''x'') {{=}} ''f'' (''f'' (''x''))}}, etc. Since {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>(''f'' (''x'')) {{=}} ''x''}}, composing {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} and {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009''n''</sup>}} yields {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009''n''\u22121</sup>}}, \"undoing\" the effect of one application of {{mvar|f}}.\n\n===Notation===\n\nWhile the notation {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>(''x'')}} might be misunderstood, {{math|(''f''(''x''))<sup>\u22121</sup>}} certainly denotes the [[multiplicative inverse]] of {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and has nothing to do with the inverse function of {{mvar|f}}.\n\nIn keeping with the general notation, some English<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/> authors use expressions like {{math|sin<sup>\u22121</sup>(''x'')}} to denote the inverse of the sine function applied to {{mvar|x}} (actually a [[#Partial inverses|partial inverse]]; see below)<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1972|loc=pp. 304-309}}</ref> Other authors feel that this may be confused with the notation for the multiplicative inverse of {{math|sin\u200a(''x'')}}, which can be denoted as {{math|(sin\u200a(''x''))<sup>\u22121</sup>}}. To avoid any confusion, an [[inverse trigonometric function]] is often indicated by the prefix \"[[arc (function prefix)|arc]]\" (for Latin ''arcus'').<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/><ref name=\"Korn_2000\"/><ref name=\"Atlas_2009\"/> For instance, the inverse of the sine function is typically called the [[arcsine]] function, written as {{math|[[arcsin]](''x'')}}.<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/><ref name=\"Korn_2000\"/><ref name=\"Atlas_2009\"/> Similarly, the inverse of a [[hyperbolic function]] is indicated by the prefix \"[[ar (function prefix)|ar]]\" (for Latin ''area'').<ref name=\"Atlas_2009\"/> For instance, the inverse of the [[hyperbolic sine]] function is typically written as {{math|[[arsinh]](''x'')}}.<ref name=\"Atlas_2009\"/> Other inverse special functions are sometimes prefixed with the prefix \"inv\" if the ambiguity of the {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} notation should be avoided.<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/><ref name=\"Atlas_2009\"/>\n\n==Properties==\nSince a function is a special type of [[binary relation]], many of the properties of an inverse function correspond to properties of [[converse relation]]s.\n\n===Uniqueness===\nIf an inverse function exists for a given function {{mvar|f}}, then it is unique.<ref name=\"Wolf72\">{{harvnb|Wolf|1998|loc=p. 208 Theorem 7.2}}</ref> This follows since the inverse function must be the converse relation which is completely determined by {{mvar|f}}.\n\n===Symmetry===\nThere is a symmetry between a function and its inverse. Specifically, if {{mvar|f}} is an invertible function with domain {{mvar|X}} and range {{mvar|Y}}, then its inverse {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} has domain {{mvar|Y}} and range {{mvar|X}}, and the inverse of {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} is the original function {{mvar|f}}.

An inverse function would output which child was born in a given year. However, if the family children born in the same year (for instance, twins or triplets, etc.) then the output cannot be known when the input is the common birth year. As well, if a year is given in which no child was born then a child cannot be named. But if each child was born in a separate year, and if we restrict attention to the three years in which a child was born, then we do have an inverse function.

The inverse function [H+]=10^-pH is used.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Partial inverses===\n[[Image:Inverse square graph.svg|thumb|right|The square root of {{mvar|x}} is a partial inverse to {{math|1= ''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}.]]\nEven if a function {{mvar|f}} is not one-to-one, it may be possible to define a '''partial inverse''' of {{mvar|f}} by [[Function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restricting]] the domain.  For example, the function\n\n:<math>f(x) = x^2</math>\n\nis not one-to-one, since {{math|1= ''x''<sup>2</sup> = (\u2212''x'')<sup>2</sup>}}.  However, the function becomes one-to-one if we restrict to the domain {{math| ''x'' \u2265 0}}, in which case\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(y) = \\sqrt{y} . </math>\n\n(If we instead restrict to the domain {{math| ''x'' \u2264 0}}, then the inverse is the negative of the square root of {{mvar|y}}.)  Alternatively, there is no need to restrict the domain if we are content with the inverse being a [[multivalued function]]:\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(y) = \\pm\\sqrt{y} . </math>\n\n[[File:Inversa d'una c\u00fabica gr\u00e0fica.png|right|thumb|The inverse of this [[cubic function]] has three branches.]]\nSometimes this multivalued inverse is called the '''full inverse''' of {{mvar|f}}, and the portions (such as {{sqrt|{{mvar|x}}}} and \u2212{{sqrt|{{mvar|x}}}}) are called ''branches''.  The most important branch of a multivalued function (e.g. the positive square root) is called the ''[[principal branch]]'', and its value at {{mvar|y}} is called the ''principal value'' of {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>(''y'')}}.\n\nFor a continuous function on the real line, one branch is required between each pair of [[minima and maxima|local extrema]].  For example, the inverse of a [[cubic function]] with a local maximum and a local minimum has three branches (see the adjacent picture).\n\n[[Image:Gr\u00e0fica del arcsinus.png|right|thumb|The [[arcsine]] is a partial inverse of the [[sine]] function.]]\nThese considerations are particularly important for defining the inverses of [[trigonometric functions]].  For example, the [[sine function]] is not one-to-one, since\n\n:<math>\\sin(x + 2\\pi) = \\sin(x)</math>\n\nfor every real {{mvar|x}} (and more generally {{math|1= sin(''x'' + 2{{pi}}''n'') = sin(''x'')}} for every [[integer]] {{mvar|n}}).  However, the sine is one-to-one on the interval\n{{closed-closed|\u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}},\u2009{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}}, and the corresponding partial inverse is called the [[arcsine]].  This is considered the principal branch of the inverse sine, so the principal value of the inverse sine is always between \u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}.  The following table describes the principal branch of each inverse trigonometric function:<ref>{{harvnb|Briggs|Cochran|2011|loc=pp. 39-42}}</ref>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!function\n!Range of usual [[principal value]]\n|-\n| arcsin || {{math|\u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} \u2264 sin<sup>\u22121</sup>(''x'') \u2264 {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}}\n|-\n| arccos || {{math|0 \u2264 cos<sup>\u22121</sup>(''x'') \u2264 {{pi}}}}\n|-\n| arctan || {{math|\u2212{{sfrac|\u03c0|2}} < tan<sup>\u22121</sup>(''x'') < {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}}\n|-\n| arccot || {{math|0 < cot<sup>\u22121</sup>(''x'') < {{pi}}}}\n|-\n| arcsec || {{math|0 \u2264 sec<sup>\u22121</sup>(''x'') \u2264 {{pi}}}}\n|-\n| arccsc || {{math|\u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} \u2264 csc<sup>\u22121</sup>(''x'') \u2264 {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}}\n|-\n|}\n\n===Left and right inverses===\nIf {{math|''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}}, a '''left inverse''' for {{mvar|f}} (or ''[[retract (category theory)|retraction]]'' of {{mvar|f}} ) is a function {{math| ''g'': ''Y'' \u2192 ''X''}} such that composing {{mvar|f}} with {{mvar|g}} from the left gives the identity function:\n\n: <math>g \\circ f = \\operatorname{id}_X . </math>\n\nThat is, the function {{mvar|g}} satisfies the rule\n\n: <math>\\text{If } f(x) = y, \\text{ then } g(y) = x .</math>\n\nThus, {{mvar|g}} must equal the inverse of {{mvar|f}} on the image of {{mvar|f}}, but may take any values for elements of {{mvar|Y}} not in the image. A function {{mvar|f}} with a left inverse is necessarily injective. In classical mathematics, every injective function {{mvar|f}} with a nonempty domain necessarily has a left inverse; however, this may fail in [[constructive mathematics]]. For instance, a left inverse of the inclusion {{math|{0,1} \u2192 '''R'''}} of the two-element set in the reals violates [[indecomposability]] by giving a [[Retract (category theory)|retraction]] of the real line to the set {{math|{0,1}\u200a}}.\n\nA '''right inverse''' for {{mvar|f}} (or ''[[section (category theory)|section]]'' of {{mvar|f}} ) is a function {{math| ''h'': ''Y'' \u2192 ''X''}} such that\n\n:<math>f \\circ h = \\operatorname{id}_Y . </math>\n\nThat is, the function {{mvar|h}} satisfies the rule\n\n:If <math>\\displaystyle h(y) = x</math>, then <math>\\displaystyle f(x) = y .</math>\n\nThus, {{math|''h''(''y'')}} may be any of the elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|y}} under {{mvar|f}}.  A function {{mvar|f}} has a right inverse if and only if it is surjective (though constructing such an inverse in general requires the [[axiom of choice]]).\n\nAn inverse which is both a left and right inverse must be unique. However, if {{mvar|g}} is a left inverse for {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|g}} may or may not be a right inverse for {{mvar|f}}; and if {{mvar|g}} is a right inverse for {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|g}} is not necessarily a left inverse for {{mvar|f}}. For example, let {{math|''f'': '''R''' &rarr; {{closed-open|0,\u2009\u221e}}}} denote the squaring map, such that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|'''R'''}}, and let  {{math|{{mvar|g}}: {{closed-open|0,\u2009\u221e}} &rarr; '''R'''}} denote the square root map, such that {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} }}{{radic|{{mvar|x}}}} for all {{math|''x'' \u2265 0}}. Then {{math|1=''f''(''g''(''x'')) = ''x''}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{closed-open|0,\u2009\u221e}}; that is, {{mvar|g}} is a right inverse to {{mvar|f}}. However, {{mvar|g}} is not a left inverse to {{mvar|f}}, since, e.g., {{math|1=''g''(''f''(\u22121)) = 1 \u2260 \u22121}}.\n\n===Preimages===\nIf {{math|''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} is any function (not necessarily invertible), the '''preimage''' (or '''inverse image''') of an element {{math| ''y'' &isin; ''Y''}} is the set of all elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|y}}:\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(\\{y\\}) = \\left\\{ x\\in X : f(x) = y \\right\\} . </math>\n\nThe preimage of {{mvar|y}} can be thought of as the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of {{mvar|y}} under the (multivalued) full inverse of the function {{mvar|f}}.\n\nSimilarly, if {{mvar|S}} is any [[subset]] of {{mvar|Y}}, the preimage of {{mvar|S}} is the set of all elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|S}}:\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(S) = \\left\\{ x\\in X : f(x) \\in S \\right\\} . </math>\n\nFor example, take a function {{math|''f'': '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}}, where {{math|''f'': ''x'' \u21a6 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}. This function is not invertible for reasons discussed [[#Example: squaring and square root functions|above]]. Yet preimages may be defined for subsets of the codomain:\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(\\left\\{1,4,9,16\\right\\}) = \\left\\{-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4\\right\\}</math>\n\nThe preimage of a single element {{math| ''y'' &isin; ''Y''}} \u2013 a [[singleton set]] {{math|{''y''}\u200a}} \u2013 is sometimes called the ''[[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]]'' of {{mvar|y}}.  When {{mvar|Y}} is the set of real numbers, it is common to refer to {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>({''y''})}} as a ''[[level set]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lagrange inversion theorem]], gives the Taylor series expansion of the inverse function of an analytic function\n* [[Inverse Fourier transform]]\n* [[Reversible computing]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB1\">It is a common practice, when no ambiguity can arise, to leave off the term \"function\" and just refer to an \"inverse\".</ref>\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB2\">Not to be confused with numerical exponentiation such as taking the multiplicative inverse of a nonzero real number.</ref>\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB3\">So this term is never used in this convention.</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Keisler\">{{cite web |url=http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/chapter_2a.pdf |title=Differentiation |author-last=Keisler |author-first=Howard Jerome |author-link=Howard Jerome Keisler |access-date=2015-01-24 |quote=\u00a72.4}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Scheinerman_2013\">{{cite book |author-last=Scheinerman |author-first=Edward R. |author-link=Edward R.

Thinking of this as a step-by-step procedure (namely, take a number {{mvar|x}}, multiply it by 5, then subtract 7 from the result), to reverse this and get {{mvar|x}} back from some output value, say {{mvar|y}}, we should undo each step in reverse order. In this case that means that we should add 7 to {{mvar|y}} and then divide the result by 5. In functional notation this inverse function would be given by,\n:<math>g(y) = \\frac{y + 7}{5}.</math>\nWith {{math|1=''y'' = 5''x'' \u2212 7}} we have that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}} and {{math|1=''g''(''y'') = ''x''}}.\n\nNot all functions have inverse functions;<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB1\"/> those which do are called '''invertible'''. In order for a function {{math|''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} to have an inverse, it must have the property that [[for every]] {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|Y}} there must be [[uniqueness quantification|one, and only one]] {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}} so that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}}. This property ensures that a function {{math|''g'': ''Y'' \u2192 ''X''}} will exist having the necessary relationship with {{mvar|f}}.\n\n==Definitions==\n[[Image:Inverse Functions Domain and Range.png|thumb|right|240px|If {{mvar|f}} maps {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}}, then {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} maps {{mvar|Y}} back to {{mvar|X}}.]]\n\nLet {{mvar|f}} be a function whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|X}}, and whose [[Range (mathematics)|image (range)]] is the set {{mvar|Y}}.

For a function to have an inverse, each element {{math|''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}} must correspond to no more than one {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}}; a function {{mvar|f}} with this property is called one-to-one or an [[injective function|injection]]. If {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} is to be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on {{mvar|Y}}, then each element {{math|''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}} must correspond to some {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}}. Functions with this property are called [[surjective function|surjections]]. This property is satisfied by definition if {{mvar|Y}} is the image (range) of {{mvar|f}}, but may not hold in a more general context. To be invertible, a function must be both an injection and a surjection. Such functions are called [[bijections]]. The inverse of an injection {{math| ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} that is not a bijection, that is, a function that is not a surjection, is only a [[partial function]] on {{mvar|Y}}, which means that for some {{math|''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}}, {{math|''f''<sup> \u22121</sup>(''y'')}} is undefined. If a function {{mvar|f}} is invertible, then both it and its inverse function {{math|''f''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} are bijections.\n\nThere is another convention used in the definition of functions. This can be referred to as the \"set-theoretic\" or \"graph\" definition using [[ordered pair]]s in which a [[codomain]] is never referred to.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|1998|loc=p.198}}</ref> Under this convention all functions are surjections,<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB3\"/> and so, being a bijection simply means being an injection.

With this type of function it is impossible to deduce an input from its output. Such a function is called non-[[Injective function|injective]] or, in some applications, information-losing.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIf the domain of the function is restricted to the nonnegative reals, that is, the function is redefined to be {{math|''f'': [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e)}} with the same ''rule'' as before, then the function is bijective and so, invertible.<ref>{{harvnb|Lay|2006|loc=p.69 Example 7.24}}</ref> The inverse function here is called the ''(positive) square root function''.\n<!-- Repetitive. To be held for a short time until refactor is finished. \n===Inverses in higher mathematics===\nThe definition given above is commonly adopted in [[set theory]] and [[calculus]]. In higher mathematics, the notation\n:<math>f\\colon X \\to Y </math>\nmeans \"{{mvar|f}} is a function mapping elements of a set {{mvar|X}} to elements of a set {{mvar|Y\u2009}}\".  The source, {{mvar|X}}, is called the domain of {{mvar|f}}, and the target, {{mvar|Y}}, is called the [[codomain]].  The codomain contains the range of {{mvar|f}} as a [[subset]], and is part of the definition of {{mvar|f}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Eggen|St. Andre|2006|loc=p. 179}}</ref>\n\nWhen using codomains, the inverse of a function {{math| ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} is required to have domain {{mvar|Y}} and codomain {{mvar|X}}.  For the inverse to be defined on all of {{mvar|Y}}, every element of {{mvar|Y}} must lie in the range of the function {{mvar|f}}.  A function with this property is called ''onto'' or ''[[Surjective function|surjective]]''.  Thus, a function with a codomain is invertible if and only if it is both ''[[Injective function|injective]]'' (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).  Such a function is called a one-to-one correspondence or a [[bijection]], and has the property that every element {{math| ''y'' \u2208 ''Y''}} corresponds to exactly one element {{math| ''x'' \u2208 ''X''}}.\n-->\n\n==={{anchor|Compositional inverse}}Inverses and composition===\n{{See also|Inverse element}}\n\nIf {{mvar|f}} is an invertible function with domain {{mvar|X}} and range {{mvar|Y}}, then\n\n:<math> f^{-1}\\left( \\, f(x) \\, \\right) = x</math>, for every <math>x \\in X. </math>\n\nUsing the [[composition of functions]] we can rewrite this statement as follows:\n\n:<math> f^{-1} \\circ f = \\operatorname{id}_X, </math>\n\nwhere {{math|id<sub>''X''</sub>}} is the [[identity function]] on the set {{mvar|X}}; that is, the function that leaves its argument unchanged. In [[category theory]], this statement is used as the definition of an inverse [[morphism]].\n\nConsidering function composition helps to understand the notation {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}}. Repeatedly composing a function with itself is called [[iterated function|iteration]]. If {{mvar|f}} is applied {{mvar|n}} times, starting with the value {{mvar|x}}, then this is written as {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009''n''</sup>(''x'')}}; so {{math|''f''<sup>\u20092</sup>(''x'') {{=}} ''f'' (''f'' (''x''))}}, etc. Since {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>(''f'' (''x'')) {{=}} ''x''}}, composing {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} and {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009''n''</sup>}} yields {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009''n''\u22121</sup>}}, \"undoing\" the effect of one application of {{mvar|f}}.\n\n===Notation===\n\nWhile the notation {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>(''x'')}} might be misunderstood, {{math|(''f''(''x''))<sup>\u22121</sup>}} certainly denotes the [[multiplicative inverse]] of {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and has nothing to do with the inverse function of {{mvar|f}}.\n\nIn keeping with the general notation, some English<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/> authors use expressions like {{math|sin<sup>\u22121</sup>(''x'')}} to denote the inverse of the sine function applied to {{mvar|x}} (actually a [[#Partial inverses|partial inverse]]; see below)<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1972|loc=pp. 304-309}}</ref> Other authors feel that this may be confused with the notation for the multiplicative inverse of {{math|sin\u200a(''x'')}}, which can be denoted as {{math|(sin\u200a(''x''))<sup>\u22121</sup>}}. To avoid any confusion, an [[inverse trigonometric function]] is often indicated by the prefix \"[[arc (function prefix)|arc]]\" (for Latin ''arcus'').<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/><ref name=\"Korn_2000\"/><ref name=\"Atlas_2009\"/> For instance, the inverse of the sine function is typically called the [[arcsine]] function, written as {{math|[[arcsin]](''x'')}}.<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/><ref name=\"Korn_2000\"/><ref name=\"Atlas_2009\"/> Similarly, the inverse of a [[hyperbolic function]] is indicated by the prefix \"[[ar (function prefix)|ar]]\" (for Latin ''area'').<ref name=\"Atlas_2009\"/> For instance, the inverse of the [[hyperbolic sine]] function is typically written as {{math|[[arsinh]](''x'')}}.<ref name=\"Atlas_2009\"/> Other inverse special functions are sometimes prefixed with the prefix \"inv\" if the ambiguity of the {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} notation should be avoided.<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/><ref name=\"Atlas_2009\"/>\n\n==Properties==\nSince a function is a special type of [[binary relation]], many of the properties of an inverse function correspond to properties of [[converse relation]]s.\n\n===Uniqueness===\nIf an inverse function exists for a given function {{mvar|f}}, then it is unique.<ref name=\"Wolf72\">{{harvnb|Wolf|1998|loc=p. 208 Theorem 7.2}}</ref> This follows since the inverse function must be the converse relation which is completely determined by {{mvar|f}}.\n\n===Symmetry===\nThere is a symmetry between a function and its inverse. Specifically, if {{mvar|f}} is an invertible function with domain {{mvar|X}} and range {{mvar|Y}}, then its inverse {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} has domain {{mvar|Y}} and range {{mvar|X}}, and the inverse of {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} is the original function {{mvar|f}}.

Such a function is called an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]].\n\n==Inverses in calculus==\nSingle-variable [[calculus]] is primarily concerned with functions that map real numbers to real numbers. Such functions are often defined through [[formula]]s, such as:\n:<math>f(x) = (2x + 8)^3 .</math>\nA surjective function {{mvar|f}} from the real numbers to the real numbers possesses an inverse as long as it is one-to-one, i.e. as long as the graph of {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} has, for each possible {{mvar|y}} value only one corresponding {{mvar|x}} value, and thus passes the [[horizontal line test]].\n\nThe following table shows several standard functions and their inverses:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n!align=\"center\"| Function {{math|''f''(''x'')}}\n!align=\"center\"| Inverse {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>(''y'')}}\n!align=\"center\"| Notes\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|''x'' [[addition|+]] ''a''}}\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|''y'' [[subtraction|\u2212]] ''a''}}\n|\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|''a'' \u2212 ''x''}}\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|''a'' \u2212 ''y''}}\n|\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[multiplication|{{math|''mx''}}]]\n|align=\"center\"| [[division (mathematics)|{{sfrac|{{mvar|y}}|{{mvar|m}}}}]]\n| {{math|''m'' \u2260 0}}\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| {{sfrac|1|{{mvar|x}}}} (i.e. {{math|''x''<sup>\u22121</sup>}})\n|align=\"center\"| {{sfrac|1|{{mvar|y}}}} (i.e. {{math|''y''<sup>\u22121</sup>}})\n| {{math|''x'',\u2009''y'' \u2260 0}}\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup>}}\n|align=\"center\"| [[square root|{{sqrt|{{mvar|y}}}}]] (i.e. {{math|''y''<sup>1/2</sup>}})\n| {{math|''x'',\u2009''y'' \u2265 0}} only\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[cube (algebra)|{{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>}}]]\n|align=\"center\"| [[cube root|{{radic|{{mvar|y}}|3}}]] (i.e. {{math|''y''<sup>1/3</sup>}})\n| no restriction on {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|''x''<sup>''p''</sup>}}\n|align=\"center\"| {{radic|{{mvar|y}}|{{mvar|p}}}} (i.e. {{math|''y''<sup>1/''p''</sup>}})\n| {{math|''x'',\u2009''y'' \u2265 0}} if {{math|p}} is even; integer {{math|''p'' > 0}}\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|2<sup>''x''</sup>}}\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|[[binary logarithm|lb]]\u200a''y''}}\n| {{math|''y'' > 0}}\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|[[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']]<sup>''x''</sup>}}\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|[[natural logarithm|ln]]\u200a''y''}}\n| {{math|''y'' > 0}}\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|10<sup>''x''</sup>}}\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|[[decadic logarithm|log]]\u200a''y''}}\n| {{math|''y'' > 0}}\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|''a''<sup>''x''</sup>}}\n|align=\"center\"| {{math|[[logarithm|log]]<sub>''a''</sub>\u200a''y''}}\n| {{math|''y'' > 0}} and {{math|''a'' > 0}}\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[trigonometric function]]s\n|align=\"center\"| [[inverse trigonometric function]]s\n| various restrictions (see table below)\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[hyperbolic function]]s\n|align=\"center\"| [[inverse hyperbolic function]]s\n| various restrictions\n|}\n\n===Formula for the inverse===\nOne approach to finding a formula for {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}}, if it exists, is to solve the [[equation]] {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') }} for {{mvar|x}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 101}}</ref>  For example, if {{mvar|f}} is the function\n\n:<math>f(x) = (2x + 8)^3 </math>\n\nthen we must solve the equation {{math|1= ''y'' = (2''x'' + 8)<sup>3</sup>}} for {{mvar|x}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n      y         & = (2x+8)^3 \\\\\n  \\sqrt[3]{y}   & = 2x + 8   \\\\\n\\sqrt[3]{y} - 8 & = 2x       \\\\\n\\dfrac{\\sqrt[3]{y} - 8}{2} & = x .\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThus the inverse function {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} is given by the formula\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(y) = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{y} - 8} 2.</math>\n\nSometimes the inverse of a function cannot be expressed by a formula with a finite number of terms.

For example, the function\n\n:<math>f(x) = x^3 + x</math>\n\nis invertible, since the [[derivative]]\n{{math|1= ''f&prime;''(''x'') = 3''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 }} is always positive.\n\nIf the function {{mvar|f}} is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] on an interval {{mvar|I}} and {{math| ''f&prime;''(''x'') \u2260 0}} for each {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''I''}}, then the inverse {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} will be differentiable on {{math|''f''(''I'')}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Lay|2006|loc=p. 246 Theorem 26.10}}</ref>  If {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}}, the derivative of the inverse is given by the [[inverse function theorem]],\n:<math>\\left(f^{-1}\\right)^\\prime (y)  = \\frac{1}{f'\\left(x \\right)}. </math>\nUsing [[Leibniz's notation]] the formula above can be written as\n:<math>\\frac{dx}{dy} = \\frac{1}{dy / dx}. </math>\nThis result follows from the [[chain rule]] (see the article on [[inverse functions and differentiation]]).\n\nThe inverse function theorem can be generalized to functions of several variables.  Specifically, a differentiable [[real multivariable function|multivariable function]] {{math| ''f '': '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is invertible in a neighborhood of a point {{mvar|p}} as long as the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]] of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|p}} is [[invertible matrix|invertible]].  In this case, the Jacobian of {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>}} at {{math|''f''(''p'')}} is the [[matrix inverse]] of the Jacobian of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|p}}.\n\n== Real-world examples ==\n* Let {{mvar|f}} be the function that converts a temperature in degrees [[Celsius]] to a temperature in degrees [[Fahrenheit]],\n::<math> F = f(C) = \\tfrac95 C + 32 ;</math>\n:then its inverse function converts degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius,\n::<math> C = f^{-1}(F) = \\tfrac59 (F - 32) ,</math>\n:since\n::<math>\n\\begin{align}\nf^{-1} (f(C)) = {} & f^{-1}\\left(  \\tfrac95 C + 32 \\right) = \\tfrac59 \\left( (\\tfrac95 C + 32 ) - 32 \\right) =  C, \\\\\n& \\text{for every value of } C, \\text{ and } \\\\[6pt]\nf\\left(f^{-1}(F)\\right) = {} & f\\left(\\tfrac59 (F - 32)\\right) = \\tfrac95 \\left(\\tfrac59 (F - 32)\\right) + 32 = F, \\\\\n& \\text{for every value of } F.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n* Suppose {{mvar|f}} assigns each child in a family its birth year. An inverse function would output which child was born in a given year. However, if the family children born in the same year (for instance, twins or triplets, etc.) then the output cannot be known when the input is the common birth year. As well, if a year is given in which no child was born then a child cannot be named. But if each child was born in a separate year, and if we restrict attention to the three years in which a child was born, then we do have an inverse function. For example,\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n f(\\text{Allan})&=2005 , \\quad & f(\\text{Brad})&=2007 , \\quad & f(\\text{Cary})&=2001 \\\\\n f^{-1}(2005)&=\\text{Allan} , \\quad & f^{-1}(2007)&=\\text{Brad} , \\quad & f^{-1}(2001)&=\\text{Cary}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n* Let {{mvar|R}} be the function that leads to an {{mvar|x}} percentage rise of some quantity, and {{mvar|F}} be the function producing an {{mvar|x}} percentage fall. Applied to $100 with {{mvar|x}} = 10%, we find that applying the first function followed by the second does not restore the original value of $100, demonstrating the fact that, despite appearances, these two functions are not inverses of each other.\n\n* The formula to calculate the pH of a solution is pH=-log10[H+]. In many cases we need to find the concentration of acid from a pH measurement. The inverse function [H+]=10^-pH is used.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Partial inverses===\n[[Image:Inverse square graph.svg|thumb|right|The square root of {{mvar|x}} is a partial inverse to {{math|1= ''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}.]]\nEven if a function {{mvar|f}} is not one-to-one, it may be possible to define a '''partial inverse''' of {{mvar|f}} by [[Function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restricting]] the domain.  For example, the function\n\n:<math>f(x) = x^2</math>\n\nis not one-to-one, since {{math|1= ''x''<sup>2</sup> = (\u2212''x'')<sup>2</sup>}}.  However, the function becomes one-to-one if we restrict to the domain {{math| ''x'' \u2265 0}}, in which case\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(y) = \\sqrt{y} . </math>\n\n(If we instead restrict to the domain {{math| ''x'' \u2264 0}}, then the inverse is the negative of the square root of {{mvar|y}}.)  Alternatively, there is no need to restrict the domain if we are content with the inverse being a [[multivalued function]]:\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(y) = \\pm\\sqrt{y} . </math>\n\n[[File:Inversa d'una c\u00fabica gr\u00e0fica.png|right|thumb|The inverse of this [[cubic function]] has three branches.]]\nSometimes this multivalued inverse is called the '''full inverse''' of {{mvar|f}}, and the portions (such as {{sqrt|{{mvar|x}}}} and \u2212{{sqrt|{{mvar|x}}}}) are called ''branches''.  The most important branch of a multivalued function (e.g. the positive square root) is called the ''[[principal branch]]'', and its value at {{mvar|y}} is called the ''principal value'' of {{math|''f''<sup>\u2009\u22121</sup>(''y'')}}.\n\nFor a continuous function on the real line, one branch is required between each pair of [[minima and maxima|local extrema]].  For example, the inverse of a [[cubic function]] with a local maximum and a local minimum has three branches (see the adjacent picture).\n\n[[Image:Gr\u00e0fica del arcsinus.png|right|thumb|The [[arcsine]] is a partial inverse of the [[sine]] function.]]\nThese considerations are particularly important for defining the inverses of [[trigonometric functions]].  For example, the [[sine function]] is not one-to-one, since\n\n:<math>\\sin(x + 2\\pi) = \\sin(x)</math>\n\nfor every real {{mvar|x}} (and more generally {{math|1= sin(''x'' + 2{{pi}}''n'') = sin(''x'')}} for every [[integer]] {{mvar|n}}).  However, the sine is one-to-one on the interval\n{{closed-closed|\u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}},\u2009{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}}, and the corresponding partial inverse is called the [[arcsine]].  This is considered the principal branch of the inverse sine, so the principal value of the inverse sine is always between \u2212{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}.

A function {{mvar|f}} with a left inverse is necessarily injective. In classical mathematics, every injective function {{mvar|f}} with a nonempty domain necessarily has a left inverse; however, this may fail in [[constructive mathematics]]. For instance, a left inverse of the inclusion {{math|{0,1} \u2192 '''R'''}} of the two-element set in the reals violates [[indecomposability]] by giving a [[Retract (category theory)|retraction]] of the real line to the set {{math|{0,1}\u200a}}.\n\nA '''right inverse''' for {{mvar|f}} (or ''[[section (category theory)|section]]'' of {{mvar|f}} ) is a function {{math| ''h'': ''Y'' \u2192 ''X''}} such that\n\n:<math>f \\circ h = \\operatorname{id}_Y . </math>\n\nThat is, the function {{mvar|h}} satisfies the rule\n\n:If <math>\\displaystyle h(y) = x</math>, then <math>\\displaystyle f(x) = y .</math>\n\nThus, {{math|''h''(''y'')}} may be any of the elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|y}} under {{mvar|f}}.  A function {{mvar|f}} has a right inverse if and only if it is surjective (though constructing such an inverse in general requires the [[axiom of choice]]).\n\nAn inverse which is both a left and right inverse must be unique. However, if {{mvar|g}} is a left inverse for {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|g}} may or may not be a right inverse for {{mvar|f}}; and if {{mvar|g}} is a right inverse for {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|g}} is not necessarily a left inverse for {{mvar|f}}. For example, let {{math|''f'': '''R''' &rarr; {{closed-open|0,\u2009\u221e}}}} denote the squaring map, such that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup>}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|'''R'''}}, and let  {{math|{{mvar|g}}: {{closed-open|0,\u2009\u221e}} &rarr; '''R'''}} denote the square root map, such that {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} }}{{radic|{{mvar|x}}}} for all {{math|''x'' \u2265 0}}. Then {{math|1=''f''(''g''(''x'')) = ''x''}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{closed-open|0,\u2009\u221e}}; that is, {{mvar|g}} is a right inverse to {{mvar|f}}. However, {{mvar|g}} is not a left inverse to {{mvar|f}}, since, e.g., {{math|1=''g''(''f''(\u22121)) = 1 \u2260 \u22121}}.\n\n===Preimages===\nIf {{math|''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} is any function (not necessarily invertible), the '''preimage''' (or '''inverse image''') of an element {{math| ''y'' &isin; ''Y''}} is the set of all elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|y}}:\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(\\{y\\}) = \\left\\{ x\\in X : f(x) = y \\right\\} . </math>\n\nThe preimage of {{mvar|y}} can be thought of as the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of {{mvar|y}} under the (multivalued) full inverse of the function {{mvar|f}}.\n\nSimilarly, if {{mvar|S}} is any [[subset]] of {{mvar|Y}}, the preimage of {{mvar|S}} is the set of all elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|S}}:\n\n:<math>f^{-1}(S) = \\left\\{ x\\in X : f(x) \\in S \\right\\} . </math>\n\nFor example, take a function {{math|''f'': '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}}, where {{math|''f'': ''x'' \u21a6 ''x''<sup>2</sup>}}.

Although Cantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, the most common modern construction is the '''Cantor ternary set''', built by removing the middle third of a line segment and then repeating the process with the remaining shorter segments. Cantor himself mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a [[perfect set]] that is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]].\n\n==Construction and formula of the ternary set==\nThe Cantor ternary set <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is created by iteratively deleting the [[open interval|''open'']] middle third from a set of line segments. One starts by deleting the open middle third ({{sfrac|1|3}},&nbsp;{{sfrac|2|3}}) from the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,&nbsp;1], leaving two line segments: [0,&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}]&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;[{{sfrac|2|3}},&nbsp;1].

The Cantor ternary set is an example of a [[fractal string]].\n\n[[File:Cantor set binary tree.svg|400px]]\n\nIn arithmetical terms, the Cantor set consists of all real numbers of the [[unit interval]] <math>[0,1]</math> that do not require the digit 1 in order to be expressed as a [[Ternary numeral system|ternary]] (base 3) fraction. As the above diagram illustrates, each point in the Cantor set is uniquely located by a path through an infinitely deep binary tree, where the path turns left or right at each level according to which side of a deleted segment the point lies on. Representing each left turn with 0 and each right turn with 2 yields the ternary fraction for a point. Replacing the \"2\" digits in these fractions with \"1\" digits produces a [[surjective]] (and not [[injective]]) mapping between the Cantor set and the set of infinite binary sequences.\n\n== Composition ==\nSince the Cantor set is defined as the set of points not excluded, the proportion (i.e., [[Lebesgue measure|measure]]) of the unit interval remaining can be found by total length removed.  This total is the [[geometric progression]]\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{2^n}{3^{n+1}} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{4}{27} + \\frac{8}{81} + \\cdots =  \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{2}{3}}\\right) = 1.</math>\n\nSo that the proportion left is  1 &ndash; 1 = 0.\n\nThis calculation suggests that the Cantor set cannot contain any [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of non-zero length. It may seem surprising that there should be anything left&mdash;after all, the sum of the lengths of the removed intervals is equal to the length of the original interval. However, a closer look at the process reveals that there must be something left, since removing the \"middle third\" of each interval involved removing [[open set]]s (sets that do not include their endpoints). So removing the line segment (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>) from the original interval [0,&nbsp;1] leaves behind the points <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>  and <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>. Subsequent steps do not remove these (or other) endpoints, since the intervals removed are always internal to the intervals remaining.  So the Cantor set is not empty, and in fact contains an uncountably infinite number of points (as follows from the above description in terms of paths in an infinite binary tree).\n\nIt may appear that ''only'' the endpoints of the construction segments are left, but that is not the case either. The number <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, for example, has the unique ternary form 0.020202... = {{overline|0.|02}}. It is in the bottom third, and the top third of that third, and the bottom third of that top third, and so on. Since it is never in one of the middle segments, it is never removed. Yet it is also not an endpoint of any middle segment, because it is not a multiple of any power of 1/3.<ref name=\"College\">{{citation\n | last1 = Belcastro | first1 = Sarah-Marie\n | last2 = Green | first2 = Michael\n | date = January 2001\n | doi = 10.2307/2687224\n | issue = 1\n | journal = The College Mathematics Journal\n | page = 55\n | title = The Cantor set contains <math>\\tfrac{1}{4}</math>?

To see this, we show that there is a function ''f'' from the Cantor set <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> to the closed interval [0,1] that is [[Surjective function|surjective]] (i.e. ''f'' maps from <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> onto [0,1]) so that the [[cardinality]] of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is no less than that of [0,1].  Since <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is a subset of [0,1], its cardinality is also no greater, so the two cardinalities must in fact be equal, by the [[Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schr\u00f6der theorem]].\n\nTo construct this function, consider the points in the [0,&nbsp;1] interval in terms of base 3 (or [[ternary numeral system|ternary]]) notation. \nRecall that the proper ternary fractions, more precisely: the elements of <math>\\bigl(\\Z \\smallsetminus \\{0\\}\\bigr) \\cdot 3^{-\\N_0}</math>, admit more than one representation in this notation, as for example <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>, that can be written as 0.1<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.1|0}}<sub>3</sub>, but also as 0.0222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.0|2}}<sub>3</sub>, and <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>, that can be written as 0.2<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.2|0}}<sub>3</sub> but also as 0.1222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.1|2}}<sub>3</sub>.<ref>This alternative recurring representation of a number with a terminating numeral occurs in any [[Numeral system#Positional systems in detail|positional system]] with [[Absolute value (algebra)#Types of absolute value|Archimedean absolute value]].</ref>\nWhen we remove the middle third, this contains the numbers with ternary numerals of the form 0.1xxxxx...<sub>3</sub> where xxxxx...<sub>3</sub> is strictly between 00000...<sub>3</sub> and 22222...<sub>3</sub>. So the numbers remaining after the first step consist of\n* Numbers of the form 0.0xxxxx...<sub>3</sub> (including 0.022222...<sub>3</sub> = 1/3)\n* Numbers of the form 0.2xxxxx...<sub>3</sub> (including 0.222222...<sub>3</sub> = 1)\n\nThis can be summarized by saying that those numbers with a ternary representation such that the first digit after the [[radix point]] is not 1 are the ones remaining after the first step.\n\nThe second step removes numbers of the form 0.01xxxx...<sub>3</sub> and 0.21xxxx...<sub>3</sub>, and (with appropriate care for the endpoints) it can be concluded that the remaining numbers are those with a ternary numeral where neither of the first ''two'' digits is 1.\n\nContinuing in this way, for a number not to be excluded at step ''n'', it must have a ternary representation whose ''n''th digit is not 1.  For a number to be in the Cantor set, it must not be excluded at any step, it must admit a numeral representation consisting entirely of 0s and 2s.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that numbers like 1, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> = 0.1<sub>3</sub> and <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> = 0.21<sub>3</sub> are in the Cantor set, as they have ternary numerals consisting entirely of 0s and 2s: 1 = 0.222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.|2}}<sub>3</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> = 0.0222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.0|2}}<sub>3</sub> and <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> = 0.20222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.20|2}}<sub>3</sub>.\nAll the latter numbers are \u201cendpoints\u201d, and these examples are right [[limit point]]s of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>. The same is true for the left limit points of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>, e.&nbsp;g. <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> = 0.1222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.1|2}}<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.2|0}}<sub>3</sub> and <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> = 0.21222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.21|2}}<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.22|0}}<sub>3</sub>. All these endpoints are ''proper ternary'' [[Rational number|fractions]] (elements of <math>\\Z \\cdot 3^{-\\N_0}</math>) of the form <sup>''p''</sup>&frasl;<sub>''q''</sub>, where denominator ''q'' is a power of 3 when the fraction is in its [[Irreducible fraction|irreducible]] form.<ref name=\"College\"/> The ternary representation of these fractions terminates (i.&nbsp;e. is finite) or &mdash; recall from above that proper ternary fractions each have 2 representations &mdash; is infinite and \u201cends\u201d in either infinitely many recurring 0s or infinitely many recurring 2s. Such a fraction is a left [[limit point]] of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> if its ternary representation contains no 1's and \u201cends\u201d in infinitely many recurring 0s. Similarly, a proper ternary fraction is a right limit point of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> if it again its ternary expansion contains no 1's and \u201cends\u201d in infinitely many recurring 2s.\n\nThis set of endpoints is [[Dense set|dense]] in <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> (but not dense in [0, 1]) and makes up a [[countably infinite]] set. The numbers in <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> which are ''not'' endpoints also have only 0s and 2s in their ternary representation, but they cannot end in an infinite repetition of the digit 0, nor of the digit 2, because then it would be an endpoint.\n\nThe function from <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> to [0,1] is defined by taking the ternary numerals that do consist entirely of 0s and 2s, replacing all the 2s by 1s, and interpreting the sequence as a [[Binary numeral system#Representing real numbers|binary]] representation of a real number.  In a formula,\n\n:<math>f \\bigg( \\sum_{k\\in \\N} a_k 3^{-k} \\bigg) = \\sum_{k\\in \\N} \\frac{a_k}{2} 2^{-k}</math> &nbsp; where &nbsp; <math>\\forall k\\in \\N : a_k \\in \\{0,2\\} .</math>\n\nFor any number ''y'' in [0,1], its binary representation can be translated into a ternary representation of a number ''x'' in <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> by replacing all the 1s by 2s.  With this, ''f''(''x'') = ''y'' so that ''y'' is in the [[Range of a function|range]] of ''f''.  For instance if ''y'' = <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> = 0.100110011001...<sub>2</sub> = {{overline|0.|1001}}, we write ''x'' = {{overline|0.|2002}} = 0.200220022002...<sub>3</sub> = <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>.  Consequently, ''f'' is surjective. However, ''f'' is ''not'' [[injective function|injective]] &mdash; the values for which ''f''(''x'') coincides are those at opposing ends of one of the ''middle thirds'' removed.  For instance, take\n:<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.0|2}}<sub>3</sub> (which is a right limit point of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> and a left limit point of the middle third [<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>,<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>]) &nbsp; and\n:<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.2|0}}<sub>3</sub> (which is a left limit point of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> and a right limit point of the middle third [<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>,<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>])\nso\n:<math>\\begin{array}{lcl}\nf\\bigl({}^1\\!\\!/\\!_3 \\bigr) = f(0.0\\overline{2}_3) = 0.0\\overline{1}_2 = \\!\\! & \\!\\! 0.1_2 \\!\\! & \\!\\! = 0.1\\overline{0}_2 = f(0.2\\overline{0}_3) = f\\bigl({}^2\\!\\!/\\!_3 \\bigr) . \\\\\n& \\parallel \\\\\n& {}^1\\!\\!/\\!_2\n\\end{array}</math>\nThus there are as many points in the Cantor set as there are in the interval [0,&nbsp;1] (which has the [[Uncountable set|uncountable]] cardinality {{nowrap|<math>\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}</math>).}} However, the set of endpoints of the removed intervals is countable, so there must be uncountably many numbers in the Cantor set which are not interval endpoints. As noted above, one example of such a number is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, which can be written as 0.020202...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.|02}} in ternary notation.  In fact, given any <math>a\\in[-1,1]</math>, there exist <math>x,y\\in\\mathcal{C}</math> such that <math>a = y-x</math>.  This was first demonstrated by [[Hugo Steinhaus|Steinhaus]] in 1917, who proved, via a geometric argument, the equivalent assertion that <math>\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2 \\, | \\, y=x+a\\} \\; \\cap \\; (\\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{C}) \\neq\\emptyset</math> for every <math>a\\in[-1,1]</math>.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Real Analysis|last=Carothers|first=N.

Assuming that <math>|A\\times A|=|A|</math> for any infinite set <math>A</math> (a statement shown to be equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]] by [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]), this provides another demonstration that <math>|\\mathcal{C}|=\\mathfrak{c}</math>.\n\nThe Cantor set contains as many points as the interval from which it is taken, yet itself contains no interval of nonzero length. The irrational numbers have the same property, but the Cantor set has the additional property of being closed, so it is not even [[Dense set|dense]] in any interval, unlike the irrational numbers which are dense in every interval.\n\nIt has been conjectured that all [[algebraic number|algebraic]] irrational numbers are [[normal number|normal]].  Since members of the Cantor set are not normal, this would imply that all members of the Cantor set are either rational or [[transcendental number|transcendental]].\n\n=== Self-similarity ===\nThe Cantor set is the prototype of a [[fractal]]. It is [[self-similar]], because it is equal to two copies of itself, if each copy is shrunk by a factor of 3 and translated. More precisely, the Cantor set is equal to the union of two functions, the left and right self-similarity transformations of itself, <math>T_L(x)=x/3</math> and <math>T_R(x)=(2+x)/3</math>, which leave the Cantor set invariant up to [[homeomorphism]]: <math>T_L(\\mathcal{C})\\cong T_R(\\mathcal{C})\\cong \\mathcal{C}=T_L(\\mathcal{C})\\cup T_R(\\mathcal{C}).</math>\n\nRepeated [[iterated function|iteration]] of <math>T_L</math> and <math>T_R</math> can be visualized as an infinite [[binary tree]]. That is, at each node of the tree, one may consider the subtree to the left or to the right. Taking the set <math>\\{T_L,T_R\\}</math> together with [[function composition]] forms a [[monoid]], the [[dyadic monoid]].\n\nThe [[automorphism]]s of the binary tree are its hyperbolic rotations, and are given by the [[modular group]]. Thus, the Cantor set is a [[homogeneous space]] in the sense that for any two points <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in the Cantor set <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>, there exists a homeomorphism <math>h:\\mathcal{C}\\to \\mathcal{C}</math> with <math>h(x)=y</math>. An explicit construction of <math>h</math> can be described more easily if we see the Cantor set [[Cantor set#Topological and analytical properties|as a product space]] of  countably many copies of the discrete space <math>\\{0,1\\}</math>. Then the map <math>h:\\{0,1\\}^\\N\\to\\{0,1\\}^\\N </math> defined by <math>h_n(u):=u_n+x_n+y_n \\mod 2</math> is an involutive homeomorphism exchanging  <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>.\n\n=== Conservation law===\n\nIt has been found that some form of conservation law is always responsible behind scaling and self-similarity. In the case of Cantor set it can be seen that the <math>d_f</math>th moment (where <math>d_f=\\ln(2)/\\ln(3)</math> is the fractal dimension) of all the surviving intervals at any stage of the construction process is equal to constant which is equal to one in the case of Cantor set <ref name=\"KBN95\">{{cite journal | first1=P.

Since the Cantor set is the complement of a [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[open set]]s, it itself is a [[closed set|closed]] subset of the reals, and therefore a [[complete space|complete]] [[metric space]]. Since it is also [[totally bounded]], the [[Heine\u2013Borel theorem]] says that it must be [[compact space|compact]].\n\nFor any point in the Cantor set and any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point, there is some other number with a ternary numeral of only 0s and 2s, as well as numbers whose ternary numerals contain 1s.  Hence, every point in the Cantor set is an [[accumulation point]] (also called a cluster point or limit point) of the Cantor set, but none is an [[interior point]]. A closed set in which every point is an accumulation point is also called a [[perfect set]] in [[topology]], while a closed subset of the interval with no interior points is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]] in the interval.\n\nEvery point of the Cantor set is also an accumulation point of the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of the Cantor set.\n\nFor any two points in the Cantor set, there will be some ternary digit where they differ &mdash; one will have 0 and the other 2.  By splitting the Cantor set into \"halves\" depending on the value of this digit, one obtains a partition of the Cantor set into two closed sets that separate the original two points.  In the [[relative topology]] on the Cantor set, the points have been separated by a [[clopen set]].  Consequently, the Cantor set is [[totally disconnected]].  As a compact totally disconnected [[Hausdorff space]], the Cantor set is an example of a [[Stone space]].\n\nAs a [[topological space]], the Cantor set is naturally [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[product topology|product]] of [[countable|countably many]] copies of the space <math>\\{0, 1\\}</math>, where each copy carries the [[discrete space|discrete topology]]. This is the space of all [[sequence]]s in two digits \n:<math>2^\\mathbb{N}=\\{(x_n)\\mid x_n\\in \\{0,1\\} \\text{ for } n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\}</math>,\n\nwhich can also be identified with the set of [[p-adic numbers|2-adic integers]]. The [[basis (topology)|basis]] for the open sets of the product topology are [[cylinder set]]s; the homeomorphism maps these to the [[subspace topology]] that the Cantor set inherits from the natural topology on the real number line. This characterization of the [[Cantor space]] as a product of compact spaces gives a second proof that Cantor space is compact, via [[Tychonoff's theorem]].\n\nFrom the above characterization, the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the [[p-adic numbers|p-adic integers]], and, if one point is removed from it, to the [[p-adic numbers]].\n\nThe Cantor set is a subset of the reals, which are a [[metric space]] with respect to the [[absolute difference|ordinary distance metric]]; therefore the Cantor set itself is a metric space, by using that same metric. Alternatively, one can use the [[p-adic metric]] on <math>2^\\mathbb{N}</math>: given two sequences <math>(x_n),(y_n)\\in 2^\\mathbb{N}</math>, the distance between them is <math>d((x_n),(y_n)) = 2^{-k}</math>, where <math>k</math> is the smallest index such that <math>x_k \\ne y_k</math>; if there is no such index, then the two sequences are the same, and one defines the distance to be zero. These two metrics generate the same [[topological space|topology]] on the Cantor set.\n\nWe have seen above that the Cantor set is a totally disconnected perfect compact metric space. Indeed, in a sense it is the only one: every nonempty totally disconnected perfect compact metric space is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. See [[Cantor space]] for more on spaces homeomorphic to the Cantor set.\n\nThe Cantor set is sometimes regarded as \"universal\" in the [[Category theory|category]] of [[Compact space|compact]] [[metric space]]s, since any compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set; however this construction is not unique and so the Cantor set is not [[universal property|universal]] in the precise categorical sense. The \"universal\" property has important applications in [[functional analysis]], where it is sometimes known as the ''representation theorem for compact metric spaces''.<ref>{{cite book | first=Stephen | last=Willard | title=General Topology | publisher=Addison-Wesley | date=1968 | asin=B0000EG7Q0}}</ref>\n\nFor any integer ''q'' \u2265 2, the topology on the group G='''Z'''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>\u03c9</sup> (the countable direct sum) is discrete. Although the [[Pontrjagin dual]] \u0393 is also '''Z'''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>\u03c9</sup>, the topology of \u0393 is compact. One can see that \u0393 is totally disconnected and perfect - thus it is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. It is easiest to write out the homeomorphism explicitly in the case ''q''=2. (See Rudin 1962 p 40.)\n\nThe [[geometric mean]] of the Cantor set is approximately 0.274974.<ref>[https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1889476 Cantor Set Geometric Mean]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Measure and probability===\nThe Cantor set can be seen as the [[compact group]] of binary sequences, and as such, it is endowed with a natural [[Haar measure]]. When normalized so that the measure of the set is 1, it is a model of an infinite sequence of coin tosses. Furthermore, one can show that the usual [[Lebesgue measure]] on the interval is an image of the Haar measure on the Cantor set, while the natural injection into the ternary set is a canonical example of a [[singular measure]]. It can also be shown that the Haar measure is an image of any [[probability]], making the Cantor set a universal probability space in some ways.\n\nIn [[Lebesgue measure]] theory, the Cantor set is an example of a set which is uncountable and has zero measure.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://theoremoftheweek.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/theorem-36-the-cantor-set-is-an-uncountable-set-with-zero-measure/ | title=Theorem 36: the Cantor set is an uncountable set with zero measure | first=Laura | last=Irvine | website=Theorem of the week}}</ref>\n\n===Cantor numbers===\nIf we define a Cantor number as a member of the Cantor set, then<ref>{{cite book | title=Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws: Minutes from an Infinite Paradise  | first=Manfred | last=Schroeder | publisher=Dover | date=1991 | pages=164\u2013165 | isbn=0486472043}}</ref>\n*(1) Every real number in [0, 2] is the sum of two Cantor numbers.\n*(2) Between any two Cantor numbers there is a number that is not a Cantor number.\n\n=== Descriptive set theory ===\nThe Cantor set is a [[Meagre set|meager set]] (or a set of first category) as a subset of [0,1] (although not as a subset of itself, since it is a [[Baire space]]).  The Cantor set thus demonstrates that notions of \"size\" in terms of cardinality, measure, and (Baire) category need not coincide.  Like the set <math>\\mathbb{Q}\\cap[0,1]</math>, the Cantor set <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is \"small\" in the sense that it is a null set (a set of measure zero) and it is a meager subset of [0,1].  However, unlike <math>\\mathbb{Q}\\cap[0,1]</math>, which is countable and has a \"small\" cardinality, <math>\\aleph_0</math>, the cardinality of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is the same as that of [0,1], the continuum <math>\\mathfrak{c}</math>, and is \"large\" in the sense of cardinality.  In fact, it is also possible to construct a subset of [0,1] that is meager but of positive measure and a subset that is non-meager but of measure zero:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Counterexamples in analysis|last=Gelbaum, Bernard R.|date=1964|publisher=Holden-Day|others=Olmsted, John M.

In the case where the middle <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> of the interval is removed, we get a remarkably accessible case &mdash; the set consists of all numbers in [0,1] that can be written as a decimal consisting entirely of 0s and 9s.  If a fixed percentage is removed at each stage, then the limiting set will have measure zero, since the length of the remainder <math>(1-f)^n\\to 0</math> as <math>n\\to\\infty</math> for any ''f'' such that <math>0<f\\leq 1</math>.\n\nOn the other hand, \"fat Cantor sets\" of positive measure can be generated by removal of smaller fractions of the middle of the segment in each iteration.  Thus, one can construct sets homeomorphic to the Cantor set that have positive Lebesgue measure while still being nowhere dense.  If an interval of length <math>r^n</math> (<math>r\\leq 1/3</math>) is removed from the middle of each segment at the ''n''th iteration, then the total length removed is <math display=\"inline\">\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 2^{n-1}r^n=r/(1-2r)</math>, and the limiting set will have a [[Lebesgue measure]] of <math>\\lambda=(1-3r)/(1-2r)</math>.  Thus, in a sense, the middle-thirds Cantor set is a limiting case with <math>r=1/3</math>.  If <math>0<r<1/3</math>, then the remainder will have positive measure with <math>0<\\lambda<1</math>.

Although Cantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, the most common modern construction is the '''Cantor ternary set''', built by removing the middle third of a line segment and then repeating the process with the remaining shorter segments. Cantor himself mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a [[perfect set]] that is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]].\n\n==Construction and formula of the ternary set==\nThe Cantor ternary set <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is created by iteratively deleting the [[open interval|''open'']] middle third from a set of line segments. One starts by deleting the open middle third ({{sfrac|1|3}},&nbsp;{{sfrac|2|3}}) from the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,&nbsp;1], leaving two line segments: [0,&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}]&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;[{{sfrac|2|3}},&nbsp;1].  Next, the open middle third of each of these remaining segments is deleted, leaving four line segments: [0,&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|9}}]&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;[{{sfrac|2|9}},&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}]&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;[{{sfrac|2|3}},&nbsp;{{sfrac|7|9}}]&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;[{{sfrac|8|9}},&nbsp;1].

The Cantor ternary set is an example of a [[fractal string]].\n\n[[File:Cantor set binary tree.svg|400px]]\n\nIn arithmetical terms, the Cantor set consists of all real numbers of the [[unit interval]] <math>[0,1]</math> that do not require the digit 1 in order to be expressed as a [[Ternary numeral system|ternary]] (base 3) fraction. As the above diagram illustrates, each point in the Cantor set is uniquely located by a path through an infinitely deep binary tree, where the path turns left or right at each level according to which side of a deleted segment the point lies on. Representing each left turn with 0 and each right turn with 2 yields the ternary fraction for a point. Replacing the \"2\" digits in these fractions with \"1\" digits produces a [[surjective]] (and not [[injective]]) mapping between the Cantor set and the set of infinite binary sequences.\n\n== Composition ==\nSince the Cantor set is defined as the set of points not excluded, the proportion (i.e., [[Lebesgue measure|measure]]) of the unit interval remaining can be found by total length removed.  This total is the [[geometric progression]]\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{2^n}{3^{n+1}} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{4}{27} + \\frac{8}{81} + \\cdots =  \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{2}{3}}\\right) = 1.</math>\n\nSo that the proportion left is  1 &ndash; 1 = 0.\n\nThis calculation suggests that the Cantor set cannot contain any [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of non-zero length. It may seem surprising that there should be anything left&mdash;after all, the sum of the lengths of the removed intervals is equal to the length of the original interval. However, a closer look at the process reveals that there must be something left, since removing the \"middle third\" of each interval involved removing [[open set]]s (sets that do not include their endpoints). So removing the line segment (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>) from the original interval [0,&nbsp;1] leaves behind the points <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>  and <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>. Subsequent steps do not remove these (or other) endpoints, since the intervals removed are always internal to the intervals remaining.  So the Cantor set is not empty, and in fact contains an uncountably infinite number of points (as follows from the above description in terms of paths in an infinite binary tree).\n\nIt may appear that ''only'' the endpoints of the construction segments are left, but that is not the case either. The number <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, for example, has the unique ternary form 0.020202... = {{overline|0.|02}}. It is in the bottom third, and the top third of that third, and the bottom third of that top third, and so on. Since it is never in one of the middle segments, it is never removed. Yet it is also not an endpoint of any middle segment, because it is not a multiple of any power of 1/3.<ref name=\"College\">{{citation\n | last1 = Belcastro | first1 = Sarah-Marie\n | last2 = Green | first2 = Michael\n | date = January 2001\n | doi = 10.2307/2687224\n | issue = 1\n | journal = The College Mathematics Journal\n | page = 55\n | title = The Cantor set contains <math>\\tfrac{1}{4}</math>?

To see this, we show that there is a function ''f'' from the Cantor set <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> to the closed interval [0,1] that is [[Surjective function|surjective]] (i.e. ''f'' maps from <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> onto [0,1]) so that the [[cardinality]] of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is no less than that of [0,1].  Since <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is a subset of [0,1], its cardinality is also no greater, so the two cardinalities must in fact be equal, by the [[Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schr\u00f6der theorem]].\n\nTo construct this function, consider the points in the [0,&nbsp;1] interval in terms of base 3 (or [[ternary numeral system|ternary]]) notation. \nRecall that the proper ternary fractions, more precisely: the elements of <math>\\bigl(\\Z \\smallsetminus \\{0\\}\\bigr) \\cdot 3^{-\\N_0}</math>, admit more than one representation in this notation, as for example <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>, that can be written as 0.1<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.1|0}}<sub>3</sub>, but also as 0.0222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.0|2}}<sub>3</sub>, and <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>, that can be written as 0.2<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.2|0}}<sub>3</sub> but also as 0.1222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.1|2}}<sub>3</sub>.<ref>This alternative recurring representation of a number with a terminating numeral occurs in any [[Numeral system#Positional systems in detail|positional system]] with [[Absolute value (algebra)#Types of absolute value|Archimedean absolute value]].</ref>\nWhen we remove the middle third, this contains the numbers with ternary numerals of the form 0.1xxxxx...<sub>3</sub> where xxxxx...<sub>3</sub> is strictly between 00000...<sub>3</sub> and 22222...<sub>3</sub>.

For a number to be in the Cantor set, it must not be excluded at any step, it must admit a numeral representation consisting entirely of 0s and 2s.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that numbers like 1, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> = 0.1<sub>3</sub> and <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> = 0.21<sub>3</sub> are in the Cantor set, as they have ternary numerals consisting entirely of 0s and 2s: 1 = 0.222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.|2}}<sub>3</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> = 0.0222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.0|2}}<sub>3</sub> and <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> = 0.20222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.20|2}}<sub>3</sub>.\nAll the latter numbers are \u201cendpoints\u201d, and these examples are right [[limit point]]s of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>. The same is true for the left limit points of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>, e.&nbsp;g. <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> = 0.1222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.1|2}}<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.2|0}}<sub>3</sub> and <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> = 0.21222...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.21|2}}<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.22|0}}<sub>3</sub>. All these endpoints are ''proper ternary'' [[Rational number|fractions]] (elements of <math>\\Z \\cdot 3^{-\\N_0}</math>) of the form <sup>''p''</sup>&frasl;<sub>''q''</sub>, where denominator ''q'' is a power of 3 when the fraction is in its [[Irreducible fraction|irreducible]] form.<ref name=\"College\"/> The ternary representation of these fractions terminates (i.&nbsp;e. is finite) or &mdash; recall from above that proper ternary fractions each have 2 representations &mdash; is infinite and \u201cends\u201d in either infinitely many recurring 0s or infinitely many recurring 2s. Such a fraction is a left [[limit point]] of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> if its ternary representation contains no 1's and \u201cends\u201d in infinitely many recurring 0s. Similarly, a proper ternary fraction is a right limit point of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> if it again its ternary expansion contains no 1's and \u201cends\u201d in infinitely many recurring 2s.\n\nThis set of endpoints is [[Dense set|dense]] in <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> (but not dense in [0, 1]) and makes up a [[countably infinite]] set. The numbers in <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> which are ''not'' endpoints also have only 0s and 2s in their ternary representation, but they cannot end in an infinite repetition of the digit 0, nor of the digit 2, because then it would be an endpoint.\n\nThe function from <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> to [0,1] is defined by taking the ternary numerals that do consist entirely of 0s and 2s, replacing all the 2s by 1s, and interpreting the sequence as a [[Binary numeral system#Representing real numbers|binary]] representation of a real number.  In a formula,\n\n:<math>f \\bigg( \\sum_{k\\in \\N} a_k 3^{-k} \\bigg) = \\sum_{k\\in \\N} \\frac{a_k}{2} 2^{-k}</math> &nbsp; where &nbsp; <math>\\forall k\\in \\N : a_k \\in \\{0,2\\} .</math>\n\nFor any number ''y'' in [0,1], its binary representation can be translated into a ternary representation of a number ''x'' in <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> by replacing all the 1s by 2s.  With this, ''f''(''x'') = ''y'' so that ''y'' is in the [[Range (mathematics)|range]] of ''f''.  For instance if ''y'' = <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> = 0.100110011001...<sub>2</sub> = {{overline|0.|1001}}, we write ''x'' = {{overline|0.|2002}} = 0.200220022002...<sub>3</sub> = <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>.  Consequently, ''f'' is surjective. However, ''f'' is ''not'' [[injective function|injective]] &mdash; the values for which ''f''(''x'') coincides are those at opposing ends of one of the ''middle thirds'' removed.  For instance, take\n:<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.0|2}}<sub>3</sub> (which is a right limit point of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> and a left limit point of the middle third [<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>,<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>]) &nbsp; and\n:<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.2|0}}<sub>3</sub> (which is a left limit point of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> and a right limit point of the middle third [<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>,<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>])\nso\n:<math>\\begin{array}{lcl}\nf\\bigl({}^1\\!\\!/\\!_3 \\bigr) = f(0.0\\overline{2}_3) = 0.0\\overline{1}_2 = \\!\\! & \\!\\! 0.1_2 \\!\\! & \\!\\! = 0.1\\overline{0}_2 = f(0.2\\overline{0}_3) = f\\bigl({}^2\\!\\!/\\!_3 \\bigr) . \\\\\n& \\parallel \\\\\n& {}^1\\!\\!/\\!_2\n\\end{array}</math>\nThus there are as many points in the Cantor set as there are in the interval [0,&nbsp;1] (which has the [[Uncountable set|uncountable]] cardinality {{nowrap|<math>\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}</math>).}} However, the set of endpoints of the removed intervals is countable, so there must be uncountably many numbers in the Cantor set which are not interval endpoints. As noted above, one example of such a number is <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>, which can be written as 0.020202...<sub>3</sub> = {{overline|0.|02}} in ternary notation.  In fact, given any <math>a\\in[-1,1]</math>, there exist <math>x,y\\in\\mathcal{C}</math> such that <math>a = y-x</math>.  This was first demonstrated by [[Hugo Steinhaus|Steinhaus]] in 1917, who proved, via a geometric argument, the equivalent assertion that <math>\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2 \\, | \\, y=x+a\\} \\; \\cap \\; (\\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{C}) \\neq\\emptyset</math> for every <math>a\\in[-1,1]</math>.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Real Analysis|last=Carothers|first=N.

Assuming that <math>|A\\times A|=|A|</math> for any infinite set <math>A</math> (a statement shown to be equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]] by [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]), this provides another demonstration that <math>|\\mathcal{C}|=\\mathfrak{c}</math>.\n\nThe Cantor set contains as many points as the interval from which it is taken, yet itself contains no interval of nonzero length. The irrational numbers have the same property, but the Cantor set has the additional property of being closed, so it is not even [[Dense set|dense]] in any interval, unlike the irrational numbers which are dense in every interval.\n\nIt has been conjectured that all [[algebraic number|algebraic]] irrational numbers are [[normal number|normal]].  Since members of the Cantor set are not normal, this would imply that all members of the Cantor set are either rational or [[transcendental number|transcendental]].\n\n=== Self-similarity ===\nThe Cantor set is the prototype of a [[fractal]]. It is [[self-similar]], because it is equal to two copies of itself, if each copy is shrunk by a factor of 3 and translated. More precisely, the Cantor set is equal to the union of two functions, the left and right self-similarity transformations of itself, <math>T_L(x)=x/3</math> and <math>T_R(x)=(2+x)/3</math>, which leave the Cantor set invariant up to [[homeomorphism]]: <math>T_L(\\mathcal{C})\\cong T_R(\\mathcal{C})\\cong \\mathcal{C}=T_L(\\mathcal{C})\\cup T_R(\\mathcal{C}).</math>\n\nRepeated [[iterated function|iteration]] of <math>T_L</math> and <math>T_R</math> can be visualized as an infinite [[binary tree]]. That is, at each node of the tree, one may consider the subtree to the left or to the right. Taking the set <math>\\{T_L,T_R\\}</math> together with [[function composition]] forms a [[monoid]], the [[dyadic monoid]].\n\nThe [[automorphism]]s of the binary tree are its hyperbolic rotations, and are given by the [[modular group]]. Thus, the Cantor set is a [[homogeneous space]] in the sense that for any two points <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in the Cantor set <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>, there exists a homeomorphism <math>h:\\mathcal{C}\\to \\mathcal{C}</math> with <math>h(x)=y</math>. An explicit construction of <math>h</math> can be described more easily if we see the Cantor set [[Cantor set#Topological and analytical properties|as a product space]] of  countably many copies of the discrete space <math>\\{0,1\\}</math>. Then the map <math>h:\\{0,1\\}^\\N\\to\\{0,1\\}^\\N </math> defined by <math>h_n(u):=u_n+x_n+y_n \\mod 2</math> is an involutive homeomorphism exchanging  <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>.\n\n=== Conservation law===\n\nIt has been found that some form of conservation law is always responsible behind scaling and self-similarity. In the case of Cantor set it can be seen that the <math>d_f</math>th moment (where <math>d_f=\\ln(2)/\\ln(3)</math> is the fractal dimension) of all the surviving intervals at any stage of the construction process is equal to constant which is equal to one in the case of Cantor set <ref name=\"KBN95\">{{cite journal | first1=P.

Since the Cantor set is the complement of a [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[open set]]s, it itself is a [[closed set|closed]] subset of the reals, and therefore a [[complete space|complete]] [[metric space]]. Since it is also [[totally bounded]], the [[Heine\u2013Borel theorem]] says that it must be [[compact space|compact]].\n\nFor any point in the Cantor set and any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point, there is some other number with a ternary numeral of only 0s and 2s, as well as numbers whose ternary numerals contain 1s.  Hence, every point in the Cantor set is an [[accumulation point]] (also called a cluster point or limit point) of the Cantor set, but none is an [[interior point]]. A closed set in which every point is an accumulation point is also called a [[perfect set]] in [[topology]], while a closed subset of the interval with no interior points is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]] in the interval.\n\nEvery point of the Cantor set is also an accumulation point of the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of the Cantor set.\n\nFor any two points in the Cantor set, there will be some ternary digit where they differ &mdash; one will have 0 and the other 2.  By splitting the Cantor set into \"halves\" depending on the value of this digit, one obtains a partition of the Cantor set into two closed sets that separate the original two points.  In the [[relative topology]] on the Cantor set, the points have been separated by a [[clopen set]].  Consequently, the Cantor set is [[totally disconnected]].  As a compact totally disconnected [[Hausdorff space]], the Cantor set is an example of a [[Stone space]].\n\nAs a [[topological space]], the Cantor set is naturally [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[product topology|product]] of [[countable|countably many]] copies of the space <math>\\{0, 1\\}</math>, where each copy carries the [[discrete space|discrete topology]]. This is the space of all [[sequence]]s in two digits \n:<math>2^\\mathbb{N}=\\{(x_n)\\mid x_n\\in \\{0,1\\} \\text{ for } n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\}</math>,\n\nwhich can also be identified with the set of [[p-adic numbers|2-adic integers]]. The [[basis (topology)|basis]] for the open sets of the product topology are [[cylinder set]]s; the homeomorphism maps these to the [[subspace topology]] that the Cantor set inherits from the natural topology on the real number line. This characterization of the [[Cantor space]] as a product of compact spaces gives a second proof that Cantor space is compact, via [[Tychonoff's theorem]].\n\nFrom the above characterization, the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the [[p-adic numbers|p-adic integers]], and, if one point is removed from it, to the [[p-adic numbers]].\n\nThe Cantor set is a subset of the reals, which are a [[metric space]] with respect to the [[absolute difference|ordinary distance metric]]; therefore the Cantor set itself is a metric space, by using that same metric. Alternatively, one can use the [[p-adic metric]] on <math>2^\\mathbb{N}</math>: given two sequences <math>(x_n),(y_n)\\in 2^\\mathbb{N}</math>, the distance between them is <math>d((x_n),(y_n)) = 2^{-k}</math>, where <math>k</math> is the smallest index such that <math>x_k \\ne y_k</math>; if there is no such index, then the two sequences are the same, and one defines the distance to be zero. These two metrics generate the same [[topological space|topology]] on the Cantor set.\n\nWe have seen above that the Cantor set is a totally disconnected perfect compact metric space. Indeed, in a sense it is the only one: every nonempty totally disconnected perfect compact metric space is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. See [[Cantor space]] for more on spaces homeomorphic to the Cantor set.\n\nThe Cantor set is sometimes regarded as \"universal\" in the [[Category theory|category]] of [[Compact space|compact]] [[metric space]]s, since any compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set; however this construction is not unique and so the Cantor set is not [[universal property|universal]] in the precise categorical sense. The \"universal\" property has important applications in [[functional analysis]], where it is sometimes known as the ''representation theorem for compact metric spaces''.<ref>{{cite book | first=Stephen | last=Willard | title=General Topology | publisher=Addison-Wesley | date=1968 | asin=B0000EG7Q0}}</ref>\n\nFor any integer ''q'' \u2265 2, the topology on the group G='''Z'''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>\u03c9</sup> (the countable direct sum) is discrete. Although the [[Pontrjagin dual]] \u0393 is also '''Z'''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>\u03c9</sup>, the topology of \u0393 is compact. One can see that \u0393 is totally disconnected and perfect - thus it is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. It is easiest to write out the homeomorphism explicitly in the case ''q''=2. (See Rudin 1962 p 40.)\n\nThe [[geometric mean]] of the Cantor set is approximately 0.274974.<ref>[https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1889476 Cantor Set Geometric Mean]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Measure and probability===\nThe Cantor set can be seen as the [[compact group]] of binary sequences, and as such, it is endowed with a natural [[Haar measure]]. When normalized so that the measure of the set is 1, it is a model of an infinite sequence of coin tosses. Furthermore, one can show that the usual [[Lebesgue measure]] on the interval is an image of the Haar measure on the Cantor set, while the natural injection into the ternary set is a canonical example of a [[singular measure]]. It can also be shown that the Haar measure is an image of any [[probability]], making the Cantor set a universal probability space in some ways.\n\nIn [[Lebesgue measure]] theory, the Cantor set is an example of a set which is uncountable and has zero measure.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://theoremoftheweek.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/theorem-36-the-cantor-set-is-an-uncountable-set-with-zero-measure/ | title=Theorem 36: the Cantor set is an uncountable set with zero measure | first=Laura | last=Irvine | website=Theorem of the week}}</ref>\n\n===Cantor numbers===\nIf we define a Cantor number as a member of the Cantor set, then<ref>{{cite book | title=Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws: Minutes from an Infinite Paradise  | first=Manfred | last=Schroeder | publisher=Dover | date=1991 | pages=164\u2013165 | isbn=0486472043}}</ref>\n*(1) Every real number in [0, 2] is the sum of two Cantor numbers.\n*(2) Between any two Cantor numbers there is a number that is not a Cantor number.\n\n=== Descriptive set theory ===\nThe Cantor set is a [[Meagre set|meager set]] (or a set of first category) as a subset of [0,1] (although not as a subset of itself, since it is a [[Baire space]]).  The Cantor set thus demonstrates that notions of \"size\" in terms of cardinality, measure, and (Baire) category need not coincide.  Like the set <math>\\mathbb{Q}\\cap[0,1]</math>, the Cantor set <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is \"small\" in the sense that it is a null set (a set of measure zero) and it is a meager subset of [0,1].  However, unlike <math>\\mathbb{Q}\\cap[0,1]</math>, which is countable and has a \"small\" cardinality, <math>\\aleph_0</math>, the cardinality of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is the same as that of [0,1], the continuum <math>\\mathfrak{c}</math>, and is \"large\" in the sense of cardinality.  In fact, it is also possible to construct a subset of [0,1] that is meager but of positive measure and a subset that is non-meager but of measure zero:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Counterexamples in analysis|last=Gelbaum, Bernard R.|date=1964|publisher=Holden-Day|others=Olmsted, John M.

In the case where the middle <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> of the interval is removed, we get a remarkably accessible case &mdash; the set consists of all numbers in [0,1] that can be written as a decimal consisting entirely of 0s and 9s.  If a fixed percentage is removed at each stage, then the limiting set will have measure zero, since the length of the remainder <math>(1-f)^n\\to 0</math> as <math>n\\to\\infty</math> for any ''f'' such that <math>0<f\\leq 1</math>.\n\nOn the other hand, \"fat Cantor sets\" of positive measure can be generated by removal of smaller fractions of the middle of the segment in each iteration.  Thus, one can construct sets homeomorphic to the Cantor set that have positive Lebesgue measure while still being nowhere dense.  If an interval of length <math>r^n</math> (<math>r\\leq 1/3</math>) is removed from the middle of each segment at the ''n''th iteration, then the total length removed is <math display=\"inline\">\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 2^{n-1}r^n=r/(1-2r)</math>, and the limiting set will have a [[Lebesgue measure]] of <math>\\lambda=(1-3r)/(1-2r)</math>.  Thus, in a sense, the middle-thirds Cantor set is a limiting case with <math>r=1/3</math>.  If <math>0<r<1/3</math>, then the remainder will have positive measure with <math>0<\\lambda<1</math>.   The case <math>r=1/4</math> is known as the [[Smith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set]], which has a Lebesgue measure of <math>1/2</math>.\n\n===Stochastic Cantor set===\n\nOne can modify the construction of the Cantor set by dividing randomly instead of equally. Besides, to incorporate time we can divide only one of the available intervals at each step instead of dividing all the available intervals.

I'd turned down everything and stopped working for four years. I said, 'I'm going to stop doing that rubbish and keep some dignity.' But when I read the script for 'Monsieur Ibrahim,' I phoned the producers immediately. I said, 'Hang on, I'm coming, wait for me.' My problem is finding parts. When you're young and successful, they write or adapt parts for you. But when you're an old chap, let's be frank, you don't sell tickets anymore. If they need an old Englishman, American or Italian, there are plenty of actors around. So what's open for me? Old Arabs.

Players included [[Benito Garozzo]], (considered by many as the greatest bridge player of all time) plus his Italian compatriots [[Pietro Forquet]] and [[Giorgio Belladonna]] and Frenchman Claude Delmouly.\n\nIn 1970, Sharif and the circus went to London's famous [[Le M\u00e9ridien Piccadilly Hotel|Piccadilly Hotel]] for an 80-rubber match against British experts Jeremy Flint and Jonathan Cansino. The stakes were \u00a31 per point, huge stakes even by today's standards. The event was to present bridge as a rich, exciting spectacle and to break through into television to bring the game within the reach of millions. The Circus ultimately won the match by 5,470 points, but Sharif still incurred a net loss after paying all related expenses.\n\nThe Circus, under the management of [[Michael Ledeen|Mike Ledeen]], toured Canada and the U.S. in 1970\u201371.

He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, taking influence from other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', in 1996. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May 1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has earned a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults, frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy from conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other anthropomorphic aquatic creatures.

He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', in 1996. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May 1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has earned a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults, frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time.
