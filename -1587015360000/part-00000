The others are: Saint Tugdual de Tr\u00e9guier, Saint Paterne de Vannes, Saint Samson of Dol, Saint Pol de L\u00e9on, Saint Malo and Saint Brieuc. The ''Tro Breiz'', which in Breton means \"tour of Brittany\", is a Catholic pilgrimage that connects the cities of the seven legendary saints of Brittany, monks from Wales and Cornwall who brought Christianity to Armorica and founded the first bishoprics in the fifth century and sixth century. \n\nCorentin's life is told in the book ''Vita de saint Corentin'', written by Dom Plaine around 1220\u20131235.

He became a [[hermit]] in the city of [[Plomodiern]], adjacent to M\u00e9nez-Hom, where he was already changing lives through his devotion to people. His selflessness was renowned across France, and through the medium of scriptures and word of mouth, his humanitarianism was recognised in Europe also.\n\nLegend has it that near where he was living, a miraculous fish would present itself to Saint Corentin in a fountain. He would cut a small piece of the fish to feed himself, and that piece would regrow<ref>[http://www.laportelatine.org/district/prieure/lanvallay/SainteAnne204.pdf Les Sept Saints Fondateurs de la Bretagne : Saint Corentin]</ref> (he would otherwise feed himself with herbs and roots found in the forest). \n\nWhen King Gradlon decided to create the [[diocese]] of [[Quimper]], he called on Corentin and asked him to become the first [[bishop]]. He sent Corentin to the city of [[Tours]] so that he could be consecrated by [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]]. He was accompanied by his disciples, Saint Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9, founder of [[Land\u00e9vennec Abbey]], and Saint Tudy were contemporaries and disciples of Corentin.\n\nGradlon also gave him a palace on the location where the [[Quimper Cathedral]] now stands.\n\nAfter his death, he was buried in front of the altar of the Quimper Cathedral. An abbey was dedicated to him in 1201 by King [[Philippe-Auguste|Philippe Auguste]], near [[Mantes-la-Ville|Mantes]]; it was called Saint Corentin Abbey.\n\nHe is also known in Cornwall, where [[St Corentine's Church, Cury|St. Corentine's Church, Cury]] is dedicated to him.<ref>[[Doble, G. H.]] (1962) ''The Saints of Cornwall'': part 2.

The Christianization of the Celts was concurrent with the fall of Rome, and so the mercy of Corentin towards Gradlon symbolized the cultural transition. Prior to Christianity, the Celtic lifestyle was based around estuarine aquaculture dependent upon the pattern of the tides. In lowland environments where flooding is a major hazard, megaliths served as an astronomical calendar to predict the movement of water. Coastal Celts (also called [[Armorica]]ns) used a system of dikes and locks to provide irrigation on an alternating basis, allowing separate plots of land to switch between producing cereals and shellfish. Corentin is a patron saint of seafood and, through him, inland aquaculture demonstrates the sustainability of [[Celtic Christianity]] over prior practices.\n\nLater tales blamed the caprice of Princess [[Dahut]] for the cataclysm at Ys. Some tales refer to her as a descendant of faeries sent to beguile King [[Gradlon]] into ruin. Others depict her as a princess seduced by the devil into opening the floodgates. The tales share a common plot point: King Gradlon and Princess Dahut magically escaping to shore on horseback where they are waylaid by Saint Corentin, (or in some versions Saint Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9) who decries the excess of Dahut, causing her to fall into the water and become a [[Morgen (mythological creature)|morgen]] or [[Siren (mythology)|siren]].<ref>Francoise Le Roux and Christian-J.  Guyonvarc'h , The legend of the city of Is , Ouest-France editions,  May 2000, p. 78-86</ref>\n\nSaint Corentin then absconds to his hermitage while the king embarks on a hunting party. Gradlon becomes lost and hungry enough to request food when he stumbles upon Corentin's hermitage. Corentin offers the king a morsel of his miraculous, regenerative fish, symbolizing the gift of Christianity.\n\n==Iconography== \nHe is represented with a whole fish or a half of fish (reminder of the fish he shared with the hunter) that he holds in his hand or at his feet where he is sometimes associated with a fountain.     \n\n== See also ==\n*[[Argol Parish close]]\n*Blessed [[Julian Maunoir]], \"Apostle of Brittany\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{in lang|fr}} [http://perso.orange.fr/damien.jullemier/sts/st-corentin.htm Saint Corentin]\n*{{in lang|fr}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013143/http://la-france-orthodoxe.net/fr/saint/corentin Saint Corentin, \u00e9v\u00eaque de Quimper]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corentin Of Quimper}}\n[[Category:Breton bishops]]\n[[Category:Medieval Breton saints]]\n[[Category:French hermits]]\n[[Category:Bishops of Quimper]]\n[[Category:460 deaths]]\n[[Category:5th-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:5th-century bishops]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{Infobox saint\n|name= Saint Corentin of Quimper \n|birth_date=\n|death_date=~460 AD\n|feast_day= December 12 \n|venerated_in= [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n|image= St Corentin Banner.jpg\n|imagesize= 300px\n|caption= St Corentin, pictured on the [[banner]] of the parish church of [[Locronan]], [[Brittany]].\n|birth_place= \n|death_place=\n|titles= \n|beatified_date=  \n|beatified_place=\n|beatified_by=\n|canonized_date=\n|canonized_place=\n|canonized_by=Pre-Congregation\n|attributes=fish; episcopal attire\n|patronage=\n|major_shrine= Quimper\n|suppressed_date=\n|issues= \n}}\n'''Saint Corentin''' (Corentinus; in [[Breton language|Breton]], ''Sant Kaourintin'') (d. 460 AD) is a [[Breton people|Breton]] [[saint]].

The Christianization of the Celts was concurrent with the fall of Rome, and so the mercy of Corentin towards Gradlon symbolized the cultural transition. Prior to Christianity, the Celtic lifestyle was based around estuarine aquaculture dependent upon the pattern of the tides. In lowland environments where flooding is a major hazard, megaliths served as an astronomical calendar to predict the movement of water. Coastal Celts (also called [[Armorica]]ns) used a system of dikes and locks to provide irrigation on an alternating basis, allowing separate plots of land to switch between producing cereals and shellfish. Corentin is a patron saint of seafood and, through him, inland aquaculture demonstrates the sustainability of [[Celtic Christianity]] over prior practices.\n\nLater tales blamed the caprice of Princess [[Dahut]] for the cataclysm at Ys. Some tales refer to her as a descendant of faeries sent to beguile King [[Gradlon]] into ruin. Others depict her as a princess seduced by the devil into opening the floodgates. The tales share a common plot point: King Gradlon and Princess Dahut magically escaping to shore on horseback where they are waylaid by Saint Corentin, (or in some versions Saint Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9) who decries the excess of Dahut, causing her to fall into the water and become a [[Morgen (mythological creature)|morgen]] or [[Siren (mythology)|siren]].<ref>Francoise Le Roux and Christian-J.

Gradlon becomes lost and hungry enough to request food when he stumbles upon Corentin's hermitage. Corentin offers the king a morsel of his miraculous, regenerative fish, symbolizing the gift of Christianity.\n\n==Iconography== \nHe is represented with a whole fish or a half of fish (reminder of the fish he shared with the hunter) that he holds in his hand or at his feet where he is sometimes associated with a fountain.     \n\n== See also ==\n*[[Argol Parish close]]\n*Blessed [[Julian Maunoir]], \"Apostle of Brittany\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{in lang|fr}} [http://perso.orange.fr/damien.jullemier/sts/st-corentin.htm Saint Corentin]\n*{{in lang|fr}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013143/http://la-france-orthodoxe.net/fr/saint/corentin Saint Corentin, \u00e9v\u00eaque de Quimper]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corentin Of Quimper}}\n[[Category:Breton bishops]]\n[[Category:Medieval Breton saints]]\n[[Category:French hermits]]\n[[Category:Bishops of Quimper]]\n[[Category:460 deaths]]\n[[Category:5th-century Christian saints]]\n[[Category:5th-century bishops]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n", "name_user": "Manannan67", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corentin_of_Quimper"}
