Ibn Sina's chief reward for this service was access to the royal library of the Samanids, well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Ibn Sina accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labors, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nAt 22 years old, Avicenna lost his father. The Samanid dynasty came to its end in December 1004. Avicenna seems to have declined the offers of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], and proceeded westwards to [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]] in modern [[Turkmenistan]], where the [[vizier]], regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of [[Nishapur]] and [[Merv]] to the borders of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], seeking an opening for his talents. [[Qabus]], the generous ruler of [[Tabaristan]], himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find asylum, was on about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Avicenna himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness. Finally, at [[Gorgan]], near the [[Caspian Sea]], Avicenna met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Avicenna lectured on [[logic]] and [[astronomy]]. Several of his treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his ''Canon of Medicine'' also dates from his stay in [[Hyrcania]].<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nAvicenna subsequently settled at [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], in the vicinity of modern [[Tehran]], the home town of [[Al-Razi|Rhazes]]; where [[Abu Taleb Rostam|Majd Addaula]], a son of the last [[Buwayhid]] emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ([[Seyyedeh Khatun]]). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, [[Shams al-Daula]], however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] he passed southwards to Hamad\u00e3n where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the ''Canon'' and the ''Sanatio'', were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an [[apothecary]], where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nMeanwhile, he had written to Abu Ya'far, the prefect of the dynamic city of [[Isfahan]], offering his services. The new emir of Hamadan, hearing of this correspondence and discovering where Ibn Sina was hiding, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and Hamad\u00e3n; in 1024 the former captured Hamadan and its towns, expelling the Tajik mercenaries. When the storm had passed, Ibn Sina returned with the emir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labors. Later, however, accompanied by his brother, a favorite pupil, and two slaves, Ibn Sina escaped from the city in the dress of a [[Sufi]] [[ascetic]]. After a perilous journey, they reached Isfahan, receiving an honorable welcome from the prince.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\n=== Later life and death ===\n[[File:Avicenna canon 1597.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of a manuscript of Avicenna's ''Canon'', dated 1596/7 (Yale, Medical Historical Library, Cushing Arabic ms. 5)]]\nThe remaining ten or twelve years of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101's life were spent in the service of the [[Kakuyid]] ruler [[Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar]] (also known as Ala al-Dawla), whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nDuring these years he began to study literary matters and [[philology]], instigated, it is asserted, by criticisms on his style. A severe [[colic]], which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadan, was checked by remedies so violent that Ibn Sina could scarcely stand. On a similar occasion the disease returned; with difficulty he reached Hamadan, where, finding the disease gaining ground, he refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned himself to his fate.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nHis friends advised him to slow down and take life moderately.

Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from [[Occasionalism]] can be seen in what is left of his work.\n\nFollowing al-Farabi's lead, Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (''Mahiat'') and existence (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence cannot be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an [[Causality|agent-cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.<ref name=\"Islam in Britannica\">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam |accessdate=2007-11-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222082832/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam |archivedate=22 December 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAvicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (''mumkin bi-dhatihi'') has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (''wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi''). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (''wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi'') is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.<ref>Avicenna, ''Kitab al-shifa', Metaphysics II'', (eds.) G.C.

In general these treatises linked his philosophical writings to Islamic religious ideas; for example, the body's afterlife.\n\nThere are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that Avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion. He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory, if prophecy could be questioned, and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly, without digressing to consider [[epistemological]] matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers.<ref>James W.

It was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al-Razi which eventually came to predominate in the [[madrasahs]].<ref>James W.

One of these texts included the ''Proof of Prophecies'', in which he comments on several Quranic verses and holds the Quran in high esteem. Avicenna argued that the Islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers.<ref>Jules Janssens (2004), \"Avicenna and the Qur'an: A Survey of his Qur'anic commentaries\", ''MIDEO'' '''25''', p.&nbsp;177\u2013192.</ref> \n\n=== Thought experiments ===\n{{Main|Floating man}}\nWhile he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his famous \"[[floating man|Floating Man]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 literally falling man&nbsp;\u2013 [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul. Avicenna believed his \"Floating Man\" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]], which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance.<ref>See a discussion of this in connection with an analytic take on the philosophy of mind in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Avicenna and the Problem of Consciousness', in ''Consciousness and the Great Philosophers'', eds. S. Leach and J. Tartaglia (London: Routledge, 2016), 45\u201353</ref> The conceivability of this \"Floating Man\" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human [[nous|intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], which he believed to be the [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] by which God communicates [[truth]] to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature. Following is an English translation of the argument:\n\n{{quote|One of us (i.e. a human being) should be imagined as having been created in a single stroke; created perfect and complete but with his vision obscured so that he cannot perceive external entities; created falling through air or a void, in such a manner that he is not struck by the firmness of the air in any way that compels him to feel it, and with his limbs separated so that they do not come in contact with or touch each other. Then contemplate the following: can he be assured of the existence of himself? He does not have any doubt in that his self exists, without thereby asserting that he has any exterior limbs, nor any internal organs, neither heart nor brain, nor any one of the exterior things at all; but rather he can affirm the existence of himself, without thereby asserting there that this self has any extension in space. Even if it were possible for him in that state to imagine a hand or any other limb, he would not imagine it as being a part of his self, nor as a condition for the existence of that self; for as you know that which is asserted is different from that which is not asserted and that which is inferred is different from that which is not inferred. Therefore the self, the existence of which has been asserted, is a unique characteristic, in as much that it is not as such the same as the body or the limbs, which have not been ascertained. Thus that which is ascertained (i.e. the self), does have a way of being sure of the existence of the soul as something other than the body, even something non-bodily; this he knows, this he should understand intuitively, if it is that he is ignorant of it and needs to be beaten with a stick [to realize it].|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul<ref name=\"Nader El-Bizri 2000\" /><ref>Ibn Sina, ''\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062f\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644'' (Beirut, Lebanon.: M.A.J.D Enterprise Universitaire d'Etude et de Publication S.A.R.L)\n{{quote|{{lang|ar|\u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0648\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0643\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u062e\u0644\u0642 \u062f\u0641\u0639\u0629\u064b \u0648\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u062d\u062c\u0628 \u0628\u0635\u0631\u0647 \u0639\u0646 \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0648\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u064a\u0647\u0648\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u0648 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0647\u0648\u064a\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0635\u062f\u0645\u0647 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0642\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0635\u062f\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u0648\u062c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u0633 \u0648\u0641\u0631\u0642 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0641\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0633 \u062b\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u0623\u0645\u0644 \u0647\u0644 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0634\u0643\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0625\u062b\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0645\u0639 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0637\u0631\u0641\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0637\u0646\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0634\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0642\u0644\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062f\u0645\u0627\u063a\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c \u0628\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0631\u0636\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0645\u0642\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0623\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644 \u064a\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0623\u0648 \u0639\u0636\u0648\u0627\u064b \u0622\u062e\u0631  \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644\u0647 \u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627  \u0634\u0631\u0637\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0628\u062a \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0628\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0628\u0647 \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0623\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u062e\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0628\u0639\u064a\u0646\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u0633\u0645\u0647 \u0648\u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0647 \u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0633\u0645 \u0628\u0644 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u0633\u0645 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u0647\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u062a\u0627\u062c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0639 \u0639\u0635\u0627\u0647.}}|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation.

Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of \"How does one acquire the first principles of a science?\" He asked how a scientist would arrive at \"the initial [[axiom]]s or [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] science without inferring them from some more basic premises?\" He explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a \"relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty\". Avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the [[first principle]]s: the ancient Aristotelian method of [[inductive reasoning|induction]] (''istiqra''), and the method of [[Hypothesis|examination]] and [[experiment]]ation (''tajriba''). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that \"it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide.\" In its place, he develops a \"method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McGinnis |first=Jon |date=July 2003 |title=Scientific Methodologies in Medieval Islam |url=https://irl.umsl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=philosophy-faculty |journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=307\u2013327 |doi=10.1353/hph.2003.0033}}</ref>\n\n=== Logic ===\nAn early formal system of [[temporal logic]] was studied by Avicenna.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.</ref> Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between ''temporalis'' and the implication.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Temporal Logic: From Ancient Ideas to Artificial Intelligence |last=Peter \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m |last2=Per Hasle |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |page=72}}</ref> Avicenna's work was further developed by [[Najm al-D\u012bn al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b al-K\u0101tib\u012b]] and became the dominant system of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic]] until modern times.<ref>{{Citation |last=Tony Street |title=Toward a History of Syllogistic After Avicenna: Notes on Rescher's Studies on Arabic Modal Logic |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=209\u2013228 |year=2000 |doi=10.1093/jis/11.2.209}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy |last=Street |first=Tony |date=2005-01-01 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52069-0 |editor-last=Peter Adamson |pages=247\u2013265 |chapter=Logic |editor-last2=Richard C.

Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Avicenna's Psychology.

The novel was adapted into a feature film, ''[[The Physician (2013 film)|The Physician]]'', in 2013. Avicenna was played by [[Ben Kingsley]].\n\n== Arabic works ==\nThe treatises of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 influenced later Muslim thinkers in many areas including theology, philology, mathematics, astronomy, physics, and music. His works numbered almost 450 volumes on a wide range of subjects, of which around 240 have survived. In particular, 150 volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and 40 of them concentrate on medicine.<ref name=\"MacTutor Biography|id=Avicenna\" />\nHis most famous works are ''The Book of Healing'', and ''The Canon of Medicine''.\n\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 wrote at least one treatise on alchemy, but several others have been falsely attributed to him.  His ''Logic'', ''Metaphysics'', ''Physics'', and ''De Caelo'', are treatises giving a synoptic view of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian doctrine]],<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> though  ''Metaphysics'' demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of [[Neoplatonism]] known as Aristotelianism in Ibn S\u012bn\u0101's world;\nArabic philosophers{{who|date=February 2015}}{{year needed|date=February 2015}} have hinted at the idea that Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 was attempting to \"re-Aristotelianise\" Muslim philosophy in its entirety, unlike his predecessors, who accepted the conflation of Platonic, Aristotelian, Neo- and Middle-Platonic works transmitted into the Muslim world.\n\nThe ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics'' have been extensively reprinted, the latter, e.g., at Venice in 1493, 1495, and 1546. Some of his shorter essays on medicine, logic, etc., take a poetical form (the poem on logic was published by Schmoelders in 1836).<ref>Thought Experiments: Popular Thought Experiments in Philosophy, Physics, Ethics, Computer Science & Mathematics by Fredrick Kennard, p. 115</ref> Two encyclopedic treatises, dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned. The larger, ''[[The Book of Healing|Al-Shifa']]'' (''Sanatio''), exists nearly complete in manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] and elsewhere; part of it on the ''De Anima'' appeared at Pavia (1490) as the ''Liber Sextus Naturalium'', and the long account of Ibn Sina's philosophy given by [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the Al-Shifa'. A shorter form of the work is known as the An-najat (''Liberatio'').

Ibn Sina's chief reward for this service was access to the royal library of the Samanids, well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Ibn Sina accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labors, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nAt 22 years old, Avicenna lost his father. The Samanid dynasty came to its end in December 1004. Avicenna seems to have declined the offers of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], and proceeded westwards to [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]] in modern [[Turkmenistan]], where the [[vizier]], regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of [[Nishapur]] and [[Merv]] to the borders of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], seeking an opening for his talents. [[Qabus]], the generous ruler of [[Tabaristan]], himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find asylum, was on about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Avicenna himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness. Finally, at [[Gorgan]], near the [[Caspian Sea]], Avicenna met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Avicenna lectured on [[logic]] and [[astronomy]]. Several of his treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his ''Canon of Medicine'' also dates from his stay in [[Hyrcania]].<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nAvicenna subsequently settled at [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], in the vicinity of modern [[Tehran]], the home town of [[Al-Razi|Rhazes]]; where [[Abu Taleb Rostam|Majd Addaula]], a son of the last [[Buwayhid]] emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ([[Seyyedeh Khatun]]). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, [[Shams al-Daula]], however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] he passed southwards to Hamad\u00e3n where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the ''Canon'' and the ''Sanatio'', were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an [[apothecary]], where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nMeanwhile, he had written to Abu Ya'far, the prefect of the dynamic city of [[Isfahan]], offering his services. The new emir of Hamadan, hearing of this correspondence and discovering where Ibn Sina was hiding, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and Hamad\u00e3n; in 1024 the former captured Hamadan and its towns, expelling the Tajik mercenaries. When the storm had passed, Ibn Sina returned with the emir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labors. Later, however, accompanied by his brother, a favorite pupil, and two slaves, Ibn Sina escaped from the city in the dress of a [[Sufi]] [[ascetic]]. After a perilous journey, they reached Isfahan, receiving an honorable welcome from the prince.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\n=== Later life and death ===\n[[File:Avicenna canon 1597.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of a manuscript of Avicenna's ''Canon'', dated 1596/7 (Yale, Medical Historical Library, Cushing Arabic ms. 5)]]\nThe remaining ten or twelve years of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101's life were spent in the service of the [[Kakuyid]] ruler [[Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar]] (also known as Ala al-Dawla), whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nDuring these years he began to study literary matters and [[philology]], instigated, it is asserted, by criticisms on his style. A severe [[colic]], which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadan, was checked by remedies so violent that Ibn Sina could scarcely stand.

Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from [[Occasionalism]] can be seen in what is left of his work.\n\nFollowing al-Farabi's lead, Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (''Mahiat'') and existence (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence cannot be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an [[Causality|agent-cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.<ref name=\"Islam in Britannica\">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam |accessdate=2007-11-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222082832/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam |archivedate=22 December 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAvicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (''mumkin bi-dhatihi'') has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (''wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi''). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (''wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi'') is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.<ref>Avicenna, ''Kitab al-shifa', Metaphysics II'', (eds.) G.C.

He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory, if prophecy could be questioned, and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly, without digressing to consider [[epistemological]] matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers.<ref>James W. Morris (1992), \"The Philosopher-Prophet in Avicenna's Political Philosophy\", in C.

It was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al-Razi which eventually came to predominate in the [[madrasahs]].<ref>James W.

One of these texts included the ''Proof of Prophecies'', in which he comments on several Quranic verses and holds the Quran in high esteem. Avicenna argued that the Islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers.<ref>Jules Janssens (2004), \"Avicenna and the Qur'an: A Survey of his Qur'anic commentaries\", ''MIDEO'' '''25''', p.&nbsp;177\u2013192.</ref> \n\n=== Thought experiments ===\n{{Main|Floating man}}\nWhile he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his famous \"[[floating man|Floating Man]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 literally falling man&nbsp;\u2013 [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul. Avicenna believed his \"Floating Man\" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]], which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance.<ref>See a discussion of this in connection with an analytic take on the philosophy of mind in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Avicenna and the Problem of Consciousness', in ''Consciousness and the Great Philosophers'', eds. S. Leach and J. Tartaglia (London: Routledge, 2016), 45\u201353</ref> The conceivability of this \"Floating Man\" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human [[nous|intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], which he believed to be the [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] by which God communicates [[truth]] to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature. Following is an English translation of the argument:\n\n{{quote|One of us (i.e. a human being) should be imagined as having been created in a single stroke; created perfect and complete but with his vision obscured so that he cannot perceive external entities; created falling through air or a void, in such a manner that he is not struck by the firmness of the air in any way that compels him to feel it, and with his limbs separated so that they do not come in contact with or touch each other. Then contemplate the following: can he be assured of the existence of himself? He does not have any doubt in that his self exists, without thereby asserting that he has any exterior limbs, nor any internal organs, neither heart nor brain, nor any one of the exterior things at all; but rather he can affirm the existence of himself, without thereby asserting there that this self has any extension in space. Even if it were possible for him in that state to imagine a hand or any other limb, he would not imagine it as being a part of his self, nor as a condition for the existence of that self; for as you know that which is asserted is different from that which is not asserted and that which is inferred is different from that which is not inferred. Therefore the self, the existence of which has been asserted, is a unique characteristic, in as much that it is not as such the same as the body or the limbs, which have not been ascertained. Thus that which is ascertained (i.e. the self), does have a way of being sure of the existence of the soul as something other than the body, even something non-bodily; this he knows, this he should understand intuitively, if it is that he is ignorant of it and needs to be beaten with a stick [to realize it].|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul<ref name=\"Nader El-Bizri 2000\" /><ref>Ibn Sina, ''\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062f\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644'' (Beirut, Lebanon.: M.A.J.D Enterprise Universitaire d'Etude et de Publication S.A.R.L)\n{{quote|{{lang|ar|\u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0648\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0643\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u062e\u0644\u0642 \u062f\u0641\u0639\u0629\u064b \u0648\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u062d\u062c\u0628 \u0628\u0635\u0631\u0647 \u0639\u0646 \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0648\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u064a\u0647\u0648\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u0648 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0647\u0648\u064a\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0635\u062f\u0645\u0647 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0642\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0635\u062f\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u0648\u062c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u0633 \u0648\u0641\u0631\u0642 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0641\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0633 \u062b\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u0623\u0645\u0644 \u0647\u0644 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0634\u0643\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0625\u062b\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0645\u0639 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0637\u0631\u0641\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0637\u0646\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0634\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0642\u0644\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062f\u0645\u0627\u063a\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c \u0628\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0631\u0636\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0645\u0642\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0623\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644 \u064a\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0623\u0648 \u0639\u0636\u0648\u0627\u064b \u0622\u062e\u0631  \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644\u0647 \u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627  \u0634\u0631\u0637\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0628\u062a \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0628\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0628\u0647 \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0623\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u062e\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0628\u0639\u064a\u0646\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u0633\u0645\u0647 \u0648\u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0647 \u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0633\u0645 \u0628\u0644 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u0633\u0645 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u0647\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u062a\u0627\u062c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0639 \u0639\u0635\u0627\u0647.}}|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation.

Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of \"How does one acquire the first principles of a science?\" He asked how a scientist would arrive at \"the initial [[axiom]]s or [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] science without inferring them from some more basic premises?\" He explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a \"relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty\". Avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the [[first principle]]s: the ancient Aristotelian method of [[inductive reasoning|induction]] (''istiqra''), and the method of [[Hypothesis|examination]] and [[experiment]]ation (''tajriba''). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that \"it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide.\" In its place, he develops a \"method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McGinnis |first=Jon |date=July 2003 |title=Scientific Methodologies in Medieval Islam |url=https://irl.umsl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=philosophy-faculty |journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=307\u2013327 |doi=10.1353/hph.2003.0033}}</ref>\n\n=== Logic ===\nAn early formal system of [[temporal logic]] was studied by Avicenna.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.</ref> Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between ''temporalis'' and the implication.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Temporal Logic: From Ancient Ideas to Artificial Intelligence |last=Peter \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m |last2=Per Hasle |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |page=72}}</ref> Avicenna's work was further developed by [[Najm al-D\u012bn al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b al-K\u0101tib\u012b]] and became the dominant system of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic]] until modern times.<ref>{{Citation |last=Tony Street |title=Toward a History of Syllogistic After Avicenna: Notes on Rescher's Studies on Arabic Modal Logic |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=209\u2013228 |year=2000 |doi=10.1093/jis/11.2.209}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy |last=Street |first=Tony |date=2005-01-01 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52069-0 |editor-last=Peter Adamson |pages=247\u2013265 |chapter=Logic |editor-last2=Richard C.

Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Avicenna's Psychology.

The novel was adapted into a feature film, ''[[The Physician (2013 film)|The Physician]]'', in 2013. Avicenna was played by [[Ben Kingsley]].\n\n== Arabic works ==\nThe treatises of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 influenced later Muslim thinkers in many areas including theology, philology, mathematics, astronomy, physics, and music. His works numbered almost 450 volumes on a wide range of subjects, of which around 240 have survived. In particular, 150 volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and 40 of them concentrate on medicine.<ref name=\"MacTutor Biography|id=Avicenna\" />\nHis most famous works are ''The Book of Healing'', and ''The Canon of Medicine''.\n\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 wrote at least one treatise on alchemy, but several others have been falsely attributed to him.  His ''Logic'', ''Metaphysics'', ''Physics'', and ''De Caelo'', are treatises giving a synoptic view of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian doctrine]],<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> though  ''Metaphysics'' demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of [[Neoplatonism]] known as Aristotelianism in Ibn S\u012bn\u0101's world;\nArabic philosophers{{who|date=February 2015}}{{year needed|date=February 2015}} have hinted at the idea that Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 was attempting to \"re-Aristotelianise\" Muslim philosophy in its entirety, unlike his predecessors, who accepted the conflation of Platonic, Aristotelian, Neo- and Middle-Platonic works transmitted into the Muslim world.\n\nThe ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics'' have been extensively reprinted, the latter, e.g., at Venice in 1493, 1495, and 1546. Some of his shorter essays on medicine, logic, etc., take a poetical form (the poem on logic was published by Schmoelders in 1836).<ref>Thought Experiments: Popular Thought Experiments in Philosophy, Physics, Ethics, Computer Science & Mathematics by Fredrick Kennard, p. 115</ref> Two encyclopedic treatises, dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned. The larger, ''[[The Book of Healing|Al-Shifa']]'' (''Sanatio''), exists nearly complete in manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] and elsewhere; part of it on the ''De Anima'' appeared at Pavia (1490) as the ''Liber Sextus Naturalium'', and the long account of Ibn Sina's philosophy given by [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the Al-Shifa'. A shorter form of the work is known as the An-najat (''Liberatio'').
