Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton.

The origins of Newcastle United Football Club itself can be traced back to the formation of a football club by the Stanley Cricket Club of [[Byker]] in November 1881. This team was renamed [[Newcastle East End F.C.]] in October 1882, to avoid confusion with the cricket club in [[Stanley, County Durham]]. Rosewood F.C. of Byker merged with Newcastle East End a short time later. In 1886, Newcastle East End moved from Byker to Heaton. In August 1882, [[Newcastle West End F.C.]] formed from West End Cricket Club, and in May 1886, the club moved into [[St James' Park]].<ref name=formation>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/ClubHistory/0,,10278~2108980,00.html\n |title=The Formation of Newcastle United\n |author=P.

Its lease was then bought by [[Newcastle East End F.C.]] in 1892, before they changed their name to Newcastle United. At the turn of the 19th century, the ground's capacity was given as 30,000 before being redeveloped between 1900 and 1905, increasing the capacity to 60,000 and making it the biggest stadium in England for a time. For most of the 20th century, the stadium changed very little, despite various plans for development of the ground. The old West Stand was replaced with the Milburn Stand in 1987, the Sir John Hall Stand replacing the Leazes End in 1993, and the rest of the ground renovated making the ground a 37,000 capacity [[all-seater stadium]]. Between 1998 and 2000, double tiers were added to the Milburn and John Hall stands to bring the venue up to its current capacity of 52,354. There were plans to build a new 90,000 seater stadium in Leazes park, just behind St James' with Newcastle Falcons taking over St James' Park, but due to protests the plans were dropped. St James' Park currently seats 52,354 people, but club owner [[Mike Ashley (businessman)|Mike Ashley]] would consider taking the roof off The Gallowgate end and adding another 6,000 seats making the total capacity to 58,420, but only if the team manage to finish in the top six places of the Premier League.<ref name=formation /><ref name=st_james>{{cite web|title=The Sports Direct Arena Story |work=nufc.co.uk |url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |accessdate=13 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113184643/http://www.nufc.co.uk/page/Club/History/SportsDirectArena |archivedate=13 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, Mike Ashley announced that he planned to lease the name of the ground in a bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium.<ref name=off_market /><ref name=direct>{{cite news\n| url        = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8342406.stm\n| title      = Newcastle reveal new stadium name\n|work=BBC Sport\n| date       = 4 November 2009\n| accessdate =4 November 2009\n| location   = London\n}}</ref> This name was only supposed to be used until the end of the [[2009\u201310 Newcastle United F.C. season|2009\u201310 season]], but lasted until November 2011.<ref name=direct /><ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Newcastle-owner-Mike-Ashley-has-spent-a-staggering-285-8million-on-the-club-so-far-it-can-be-revealed-today-article718115.html\n| title       = Newcastle 'have cost Ashley \u00a3285.8m so far'\n| first       = Simon\n| last        = Bird\n| date        = 29 March 2011\n| work=Daily Mirror |location=UK\n| accessdate  =13 April 2011\n}}</ref> On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this was an interim name to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium.

These species possess a unique [[Electroreception|electroreceptive]] organ known as ''[[ampullae of Lorenzini]]'' which can detect a slight variation in electric potential.  These organs are made up of mucus-filled canals that connect from the skin's pores to small sacs within the animal's flesh that are also filled with mucus.  The ampullae of Lorenzini are capable of detecting DC currents and have been proposed to be used in the sensing of the weak electric fields of prey and predators. These organs could also possibly sense magnetic fields, by means of [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]: as a conductor moves through a magnetic field an electric potential is generated. In this case the conductor is the animal moving through a magnetic field, and the potential induced depends on the time varying rate of flux through the conductor according to\n<center><math>V_{ind}=-\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}</math>.</center>\nThese organs detect very small fluctuations in the potential difference between the pore and the base of the electroreceptor sack. An increase in potential results in a decrease in the rate of nerve activity, and a decrease in potential results in an increase in the rate of nerve activity. This is analogous to the behavior of a current carrying conductor; with a fixed channel resistance, an increase in potential would decrease the amount of current detected, and vice versa.{{Clarify | date = August 2019 | reason = The two previous sentences make it sound obvious, but it isn't really obvious.

Various ''Drosophila'' strains have been trained to respond to magnetic fields.<ref name=\"Gegear2008\" /> In a [[Preference tests (animals)|choice test]] flies were loaded into an apparatus with two arms that were surrounded by electric coils.

The flies in this T-maze were tested on their native ability to recognize the presence of the magnetic field in an arm and on their response following training where the magnetic field was paired with a sucrose reward. Many of the strains of flies showed a learned preference for the magnetic field following training. However, when the only cryptochrome found in ''Drosophila'', type 1 Cry, is altered, either through a [[missense mutation]] or replacement of the Cry gene, the flies exhibit a loss of magnetosensitivity. Furthermore, when light is filtered to only allow wavelengths greater than 420&nbsp;nm through, ''Drosophila'' loses its trained response to magnetic fields. This response to filtered light is likely linked to the action spectrum of fly-cryptochrome which has a range from 350&nbsp;nm \u2013 400&nbsp;nm and plateaus from 430-450&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = VanVickle-Chavez | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Van Gelder | first2 = R.

This was done by using satellite and aerial images of herds of cattle and field observations of grazing roe deer.  Body orientation of both species was random on pastures under or near power lines.  Moreover, cattle exposed to various magnetic fields directly beneath or in the vicinity of power lines trending in various magnetic directions exhibited distinct patterns of alignment.

These species possess a unique [[Electroreception|electroreceptive]] organ known as ''[[ampullae of Lorenzini]]'' which can detect a slight variation in electric potential.  These organs are made up of mucus-filled canals that connect from the skin's pores to small sacs within the animal's flesh that are also filled with mucus.  The ampullae of Lorenzini are capable of detecting DC currents and have been proposed to be used in the sensing of the weak electric fields of prey and predators. These organs could also possibly sense magnetic fields, by means of [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]: as a conductor moves through a magnetic field an electric potential is generated. In this case the conductor is the animal moving through a magnetic field, and the potential induced depends on the time varying rate of flux through the conductor according to\n<center><math>V_{ind}=-\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}</math>.</center>\nThese organs detect very small fluctuations in the potential difference between the pore and the base of the electroreceptor sack. An increase in potential results in a decrease in the rate of nerve activity, and a decrease in potential results in an increase in the rate of nerve activity.

Experimental techniques such as gene knockouts have allowed a closer examination of possible magnetoreception in these fruit flies. Various ''Drosophila'' strains have been trained to respond to magnetic fields.<ref name=\"Gegear2008\" /> In a [[Preference tests (animals)|choice test]] flies were loaded into an apparatus with two arms that were surrounded by electric coils. Current was run through each of the coils, but only one was configured to produce a 5-Gauss magnetic field at a time. The flies in this T-maze were tested on their native ability to recognize the presence of the magnetic field in an arm and on their response following training where the magnetic field was paired with a sucrose reward. Many of the strains of flies showed a learned preference for the magnetic field following training. However, when the only cryptochrome found in ''Drosophila'', type 1 Cry, is altered, either through a [[missense mutation]] or replacement of the Cry gene, the flies exhibit a loss of magnetosensitivity. Furthermore, when light is filtered to only allow wavelengths greater than 420&nbsp;nm through, ''Drosophila'' loses its trained response to magnetic fields. This response to filtered light is likely linked to the action spectrum of fly-cryptochrome which has a range from 350&nbsp;nm \u2013 400&nbsp;nm and plateaus from 430-450&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = VanVickle-Chavez | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Van Gelder | first2 = R.

His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada's [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada by time in office|third longest-serving]] Prime Minister, behind [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and [[John A. Macdonald]].\n\nTrudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer, intellectual, and activist in [[Qu\u00e9bec]] politics. He joined the Liberal Party and was elected to the [[Canadian Parliament]] in 1965, quickly being appointed as Prime Minister [[Lester&nbsp;B. Pearson|Lester&nbsp;B.

Trudeau was the co-founder and editor of ''[[Cit\u00e9 Libre]]'', a dissident journal that helped provide the intellectual basis for the Quiet Revolution. In 1956 he edited an important book on the subject, ''La gr\u00e8ve de l'amiante'', which argued that the asbestos miners' strike of 1949 was a seminal event in Qu\u00e9bec's history, marking the beginning of resistance to the conservative, [[Francophone]] clerical establishment and [[English language|Anglophone]] business class that had long ruled the province.<ref name=\"Vintage_English_Citizen_2007\"/>{{rp|289,292}}\n\n==Career==\nBecause of his labour union activities in Asbestos, Trudeau was blacklisted by Premier Duplessis and he was unable to teach law at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.<ref name=\"economist_obituary_20001005\"/> He surprised his closest friends in Quebec when he became a civil servant in Ottawa in 1949.

He admired the labour unions, which were tied to the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), and tried to infuse his Liberal party with some of their reformist zeal. By the late 1950s Trudeau began to reject social democratic and labour parties, arguing that they should put their narrow goals aside and join forces with Liberals to fight for democracy first.<ref>Christo Aivalis, \"In the Name of Liberalism: Pierre Trudeau, Organized Labour, and the Canadian Social Democratic Left, 1949\u20131959,\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' (June 2013) 94#7 pp 263\u2013288 {{DOI|10.3138/chr.1498}}</ref> In economic theory he was influenced by professors [[Joseph Schumpeter]] and [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] while he was at Harvard.

These \"three wise men\" ran successfully for the Liberals in the [[1965 Canadian federal election|1965 election]]. Trudeau himself was elected in the safe Liberal riding of [[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal]], in western Montreal. He would hold this seat until his retirement from politics in 1984, winning each election with large majorities. His decision to join the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] rather than the CCF's successor, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) was partly based on his belief that the federal NDP could not achieve power. He also doubted the feasibility of the centralizing policies of the party. He felt that the party leadership tended toward a \"''deux nations''\" approach he could not support.{{sfn|English (2006)|pp=364\u2013365}}\n\nUpon arrival in Ottawa, Trudeau was appointed as Prime Minister Lester Pearson's parliamentary secretary, and spent much of the next year travelling abroad, representing Canada at international meetings and bodies, including the [[United Nations]].

His energetic campaign attracted massive media attention and mobilized many young people, who saw Trudeau as a symbol of generational change. Going into the leadership convention, Trudeau was the front-runner and a clear favourite with the Canadian public. However, many Liberals still had reservations given that he joined the Liberal Party in 1965 and that his views, particularly those on divorce, abortion, and homosexuality, were seen as radical and opposed by a substantial segment of the party. During the convention, prominent Cabinet Minister [[Judy LaMarsh]] was caught on television profanely stating that Trudeau wasn't a Liberal.<ref name=\"Don't let the bastard win\">\n{{cite web |title = The Style is the Man Himself |url = http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/prime-ministers/pierre-elliott-trudeau-philosopher-and-prime-minister/canada-must-be-a-just-society.html |work = Pierre Trudeau: 'Canada must be a just society' |publisher = CBC Archives |accessdate = 2013-12-21 |author = CBC News |location = Toronto |date = 1968-09-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131215153238/http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/prime-ministers/pierre-elliott-trudeau-philosopher-and-prime-minister/canada-must-be-a-just-society.html |archivedate = 2013-12-15 |url-status = live |ref = harv }}\n</ref>\n\nNevertheless, at the April [[1968 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election|1968 Liberal leadership convention]], Trudeau was elected as the leader on the fourth ballot, with the support of 51% of the delegates.

Trudeau's main national opponents were [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|PC]] leader [[Robert Stanfield]] and [[New Democratic Party of Canada|NDP]] leader [[Tommy Douglas]], both popular figures who had been Premiers, respectively, of Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan (albeit in Trudeau's native Qu\u00e9bec, the main competition to the Liberals was from the [[Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste]], led by [[R\u00e9al Caouette]]). As a candidate Trudeau espoused [[participatory democracy]] as a means of making Canada a \"[[Just Society]]\". He defended vigorously the newly implemented [[universal health care]] and [[regional development]] programmes, as well as the recent reforms found in the Omnibus bill.\n\nOn the eve of the election, during the annual [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day]] parade in Montreal, rioting [[Quebec separatism|Qu\u00e9bec sovereignists]] threw rocks and bottles at the grandstand where Trudeau was seated, chanting \"Trudeau au poteau!\" (Trudeau \u2013 to the stake!).

Five days later Qu\u00e9bec Labour Minister [[Pierre Laporte]] was also kidnapped. Trudeau, with the acquiescence of Premier of Quebec Robert Bourassa, responded by invoking the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' which gave the government sweeping powers of arrest and detention without trial. Trudeau presented a determined public stance during the crisis, answering the question of how far he would go to stop the violence by saying \"[[Just watch me]]\".

Stanfield proposed the immediate introduction of [[wage and price controls]] to help end the increasing [[inflation]] Canada was currently facing.

The breadth of the legislation, which touched on many powers traditionally considered the purview of the provinces, prompted [[Reference re Anti-Inflation Act|a Supreme Court reference]] that only upheld the legislation as an [[Peace, Order, and Good Government|emergency requiring Federal intervention]] under the ''[[British North America Act]]''. During the annual 1975 Christmas interview with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], Trudeau discussed the economy, citing market failures and stating that more state intervention would be necessary. However, the academic wording and hypothetical solutions posed during the complex discussion led much of the public to believe he had declared capitalism itself a failure, creating a lasting distrust among increasingly [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] business leaders.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=290-94}}\n\nTrudeau continued his attempts at increasing Canada's international profile, including joining the [[G7]] group of major economic powers in 1976 at the behest of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Gerald Ford]].{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|p=?}} On July 14, 1976, after long and emotional debate, Bill C-84 was passed by the House of Commons by a vote of 130 to 124, abolishing the [[Capital punishment in Canada|death penalty]] completely and instituting a life sentence without parole for 25 years for first-degree murder.<ref name=\"Radio Canada\">{{cite web |title = Le grandes etapes de l'abolition |url = http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Dossiers/peinedemort/contenu_bas_03a.asp |publisher = [[Radio Canada]]|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nTrudeau faced increasing challenges in Qu\u00e9bec, starting with bitter relations with Bourassa and his [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] government in Qu\u00e9bec. After a rise in the polls after the rejection of the Victoria Charter, the Qu\u00e9bec Liberals had taken a more confrontational approach with the Federal government on the constitution, [[Bill 22|French language laws]], and the language of [[air traffic control]] in Qu\u00e9bec.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=302-306}} Trudeau responded with increasing anger at what he saw as nationalist provocations against the Federal government's bilingualism and constitutional initiatives, at times expressing his personal contempt for Bourassa.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=302-306}}\n\nPartially in an attempt to shore up his support, Bourassa called a [[1976 Quebec general election|surprise election in 1976]] that resulted in [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]] and the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] (PQ) winning a majority government. The PQ had chiefly campaigned on a \"good government\" platform, but promised a referendum on independence to be held within their first mandate. Trudeau and L\u00e9vesque had been personal rivals, with Trudeau's intellectualism contrasting with L\u00e9vesque's more working-class image. While Trudeau claimed to welcome the \"clarity\" provided by the PQ victory, the unexpected rise of the sovereignist movement became, in his view, his biggest challenge.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=308}}\n\nAs the PQ began to take power, Trudeau faced the prolonged failure of his marriage, which was covered in lurid detail on a day-by-day basis by the English language press.

They changed for the better when Trudeau and [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter (1977-81)]] found a better rapport. The late 1970s saw a more sympathetic American attitude toward Canadian political and economic needs, the pardoning of draft evaders who had moved to Canada, and the passing of old sore points such as Watergate and the Vietnam War. Canada more than ever welcomed American investments during the \"[[stagflation]]\" (high inflation and high unemployment at the same time) that hurt both nations in the 1970s.<ref>Lily Gardner Feldman, \"Canada and the United States in the 1970s: Rift and Reconciliation.\" ''The World Today'' 34.12 (1978): 484-492.

Trudeau and his advisors, to contrast with the mild-mannered Clark, based their campaign on Trudeau's decisive personality and his grasp of the Constitution file, despite the general public's apparent wariness of both. The traditional Liberal rally at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] saw Trudeau stressing the importance of major constitutional reform to general ennui, and his campaign \"photo-ops\" were typically surrounded by picket lines and protesters. Though polls portended disaster, Clark's struggles justifying his party's populist platform and a strong Trudeau performance in the election debate helped bring the Liberals to the point of contention.{{sfn|English (2009)|loc=chpt. 13}}\n\nThough winning the popular vote by four points, the Liberal vote was concentrated in Qu\u00e9bec and faltered in industrial Ontario, allowing the PCs to win the seat-count handily and form a minority government. Trudeau soon announced his intention to resign as Liberal Party leader and favoured Donald Macdonald to be his successor.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=265}}\n\nHowever, before a [[leadership convention]] could be held, with Trudeau's blessing and [[Allan MacEachen]]'s manoeuvring in the house, the Liberals supported an NDP subamendment to Clark's budget stating that the House had no confidence in the budget. In Canada, as in most other countries with a [[Westminster system]], budget votes are indirectly considered to be votes of confidence in the government, and their [[loss of supply|failure]] automatically brings down the government. Liberal and NDP votes and Social Credit abstentions led to the subamendment passing 139-133, thereby toppling Clark's government and triggering a new election for a House less than a year old. The Liberal caucus, along with friends and advisers persuaded Trudeau to stay on as leader and fight the election, with Trudeau's main impetus being the upcoming referendum on Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=265\u201366}}\n\nTrudeau and the Liberals engaged in a new strategy for the February 1980 election: facetiously called the \"low bridge\", it involved dramatically underplaying Trudeau's role and avoiding media appearances, to the point of refusing a televised debate.

He was succeeded by John Turner, a former [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet minister]] under both Trudeau and Lester Pearson.\n\nThe Liberal victory in 1980 highlighted a sharp geographical divide in the country: the party had won no seats west of [[Manitoba]]. Trudeau, in an attempt to represent Western interests, offered to form a coalition government with Ed Broadbent's NDP, which had won 22 seats in the west, but was rebuffed by Broadbent out of fear the party would have no influence in a majority government.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=446-7}}\n\nThe first challenge Trudeau faced upon re-election was the May 20, [[1980 Quebec referendum]] on Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty, called by the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government under Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque. Trudeau immediately initiated federal involvement in the referendum, reversing the Clark government's policy of leaving the issue to the Qu\u00e9bec Liberals and [[Claude Ryan]]. He appointed Jean Chr\u00e9tien as the nominal spokesman for the federal government, helping to push the \"Non\" cause to working-class voters who tuned out the intellectual Ryan and Trudeau. Unlike Ryan and the Liberals, he refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the referendum question, and noted that the \"association\" required consent from the other provinces.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=454}}\n\nIn the debates in the legislature during the campaign leading up to the referendum L\u00e9vesque said that Trudeau's middle name was Scottish, and that Trudeau's aristocratic upbringing proved that he was more Scottish than French.<ref name=\"CBC_Reflections_20010923\">{{Cite AV media| publisher = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC),  Melbar Entertainment Group| people = McKenna, Terence (Director), [[Ann-Marie MacDonald]] (Contributor), Michael Bliss (Contributor), [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] (Contributor), [[Joe Clark]](Contributor)| series = Biography| title = Reflections: The Trudeau Legacy| date = September 23, 2001}}</ref> A week prior to the referendum, Trudeau delivered one of his most well-known speeches, in which he extolled the virtues of federalism and questioned the ambiguous language of the referendum question.

It became one of the Liberal's most contentious policies. The NEP was fiercely protested by the Western provinces. The western provinces blamed the devastating oil bust of the 1980s on the NEB which led to what many termed \"[[Western alienation]]\".

He described his own decline in popularity as \"long walk in the snow\". On February 29, after what he described as a \"long walk in the snow\", Trudeau announced he would not lead the Liberals into the next election.<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\"/>\n\nBefore handing power to Turner, Trudeau took the unusual step of appointing Liberal [[Senate of Canada|Senators]] from Western provinces to Cabinet, in the 22nd Canadian Ministry. He advised [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Jeanne Sauv\u00e9]] to appoint over 200 Liberals to [[patronage]] positions.  He and Turner then crafted a legal agreement calling for Turner to advise an additional 70 patronage appointments. The sheer volume of appointments, combined with questions about the appointees' qualifications, led to condemnation from across the political spectrum.<ref name=\"Mulroney 1991\">''Mulroney: The Politics of Ambition'', by [[John Sawatsky]], Toronto 1991, McFarlane, Walter, and Ross publishers.</ref> However, an apparent rebound in the polls prompted Turner to call an election for September 1984, almost a year before it was due. Turner's appointment deal with Trudeau came back to haunt the Liberals at the English-language debate, when Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize for not advising that the appointments be canceled\u2014advice that Sauv\u00e9 would have been required to follow by convention. Turner claimed that \"I had no option\" but to let the appointments stand, prompting Mulroney to tell him, \"[[You had an option, sir]]--to say 'no'--and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn the [[1984 Canadian federal election]], Mulroney won the largest landslide majority government (by total number of seats) in Canadian history. The Liberals, with Turner as leader, lost 95 seats, in what was then, the worst defeat of a sitting government at the federal level. In the [[1993 Canadian federal election]], the Progressive Conservatives faced a larger defeat, when cut to two seats.\n\n===Patriation of the constitution===\n\nIn 1982 Trudeau succeeded in repatriating the Constitution.<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\"/> The British Parliament passed an act ceding to the Canadian federal government, full responsibility for amending Canada's national charter.<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\"/> Earlier in his tenure, he had met with opposition from the provincial governments, most notably with the Victoria Charter. Provincial premiers were united in their concerns regarding an amending formula, a court-enforced Charter of Rights, and a further devolution of powers to the provinces. In 1980, Chr\u00e9tien was tasked with creating a constitutional settlement following the Qu\u00e9bec referendum in which Quebecers voted to remain in Canada.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=459}}\n\nAfter chairing a series of increasingly acrimonious conferences with first ministers on the issue, Trudeau announced the intention of the federal government to proceed with a request to the British parliament to patriate the constitution, with additions to be approved by a referendum without input from provincial governments. Trudeau was backed by the NDP, Ontario Premier [[Bill Davis]], and New Brunswick Premier [[Richard Hatfield]] and was opposed by the remaining premiers and PC leader Joe Clark. After numerous provincial governments challenged the legality of the decision using their [[Reference question|reference power]], conflicting decisions prompted a [[Patriation Reference|Supreme Court decision]] that stated unilateral patriation was legal, but was in contravention of a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that the provinces be consulted and have general agreement to the changes.\n\nAfter the court decision, which prompted some reservations in the British parliament of accepting a unilateral request,<ref>\n{{Cite journal |first = Andrew |last = Heard |title = Canadian Independence |year = 1990 |place = Vancouver |publisher = Simon Fraser University |url = https://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/324/Independence.html |accessdate = 2010-08-25 }}</ref> Trudeau agreed to meet with the premiers one more time before proceeding. At the meeting, Trudeau reached an agreement with nine of the premiers on patriating the constitution and implementing the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, with the caveat that provincial legislatures would have the ability to use a [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] to protect some laws from judicial oversight. The notable exception was L\u00e9vesque, who, Trudeau believed, would never have signed an agreement. The objection of the Qu\u00e9bec government to the new constitution became a source of continued acrimony between the federal and Qu\u00e9bec governments, and would forever stain Trudeau's reputation amongst nationalists in the province.\n\nThe ''[[Canada Act]]'', which included the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' and the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'', was proclaimed by Queen Elizabeth II, as [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]], on April 17, 1982.\n\n==Retirement==\nTrudeau joined the Montreal law firm [[Heenan Blaikie]] as counsel and settled in the historic [[Maison Cormier]] in Montreal following his retirement from politics.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Annmarie|last2=Macdonell|first2=Cameron|title=Making Himself at Home: Cormier, Trudeau, and the Architecture of Domestic Masculinity|journal=Winterthur Portfolio|date=2016|volume=50|issue=2/3|pages=151\u2013189|doi=10.1086/689984}}</ref> Though he rarely gave speeches or spoke to the press, his interventions into public debate had a significant impact when they occurred. Trudeau wrote and spoke out against both the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]] proposals to amend the Canadian constitution, arguing that they would weaken federalism and the Charter of Rights if implemented. His opposition to both Accords was considered one of the major factors leading to the defeat of the two proposals.\n\nHe also continued to speak against the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and the sovereignty movement with less effect.\n\nTrudeau also remained active in international affairs, visiting foreign leaders and participating in international associations such as the [[Club of Rome]].  He met with Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and other leaders in 1985; shortly afterwards Gorbachev met President [[Ronald Reagan]] to discuss easing world tensions.\n\nHe published his memoirs in 1993.<ref name=\"Trudeau_Memoirs_1993\">{{cite book |title=Memoirs |location=Toronto |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |date=1993 |isbn=0-7710-8588-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/memoirs00trud/page/n15/mode/2up |access-date=February 21, 2020}}</ref> The book sold hundreds of thousands of copies in several editions, and became one of the most successful Canadian books ever published.\n\nIn his [[old age]], he was afflicted with [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[prostate cancer]], and became less active, although he continued to work at his law practice until a few months before his death at the age of 80.

While mostly private about his beliefs, he made it clear that he was a believer, stating, in an interview with the ''United Church Observer'' in 1971: \"I believe in life after death, I believe in God and I'm a Christian.\" Trudeau maintained, however, that he preferred to impose constraints on himself rather than have them imposed from the outside. In this sense, he believed he was more like a Protestant than a Catholic of the era in which he was schooled.{{sfn|Trudeau (1996)|pp=302\u2013303}}\n\nMichael W. Higgins, a former President of [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]], has researched Trudeau's spirituality and finds that it incorporated elements of three Catholic traditions. The first of these was the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who provided his education up to the college level. Trudeau frequently displayed the logic and love of argument consistent with that tradition. A second great spiritual influence in Trudeau's life was [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]. According to Michel Gourgues, professor at [[Dominican University College]], Trudeau \"considered himself a lay Dominican\".{{attribution needed|date=May 2016}} He studied philosophy under Dominican Father [[Louis-Marie R\u00e9gis]] and remained close to him throughout his life, regarding R\u00e9gis as \"spiritual director and friend\". Another skein in Trudeau's spirituality was a [[Contemplation|contemplative]] aspect acquired from his association with the [[Benedictine]] tradition. According to Higgins, Trudeau was convinced of the centrality of [[Christian meditation|meditation]] in a life fully lived. Trudeau meditated regularly after being initiated into [[Transcendental Meditation]] by the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Maharishi : the biography of the man who gave transcendental meditation to the world|last=Mason, Paul, 1952-|isbn=1852305711|location=Shaftesbury, Dorset|oclc=31133549|year = 1994}}</ref> He took retreats at [[Saint-Beno\u00eet-du-Lac, Qu\u00e9bec]] and regularly attended [[Liturgy of the Hours|Hours]] and the [[Eucharist]] at Montreal's Benedictine community.{{sfn|Higgins, M.

Regina, Saskatchewan. Retrieved: 2015-09-24.</ref>\n\nTrudeau's most enduring legacy may lie in his contribution to [[Canadian nationalism]], and of pride in Canada in and for itself rather than as a derivative of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. His role in this effort, and his related battles with Qu\u00e9bec on behalf of Canadian unity, cemented his political position when in office despite the controversies he faced\u2014and remain the most remembered aspect of his tenure afterwards.\n\nSome consider Trudeau's economic policies to have been a weak point. Inflation and unemployment marred much of his tenure as prime minister. When Trudeau took office in 1968 Canada had a debt of $18&nbsp;billion (24% of GDP) which was largely left over from World War II, when he left office in 1984, that debt stood at $200&nbsp;billion (46% of GDP), an increase of 83% in real terms.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.csls.ca/data/ipt2006.pdf | title=GDP figures | publisher=Centre for the Study of Living Standards | date=2006 | accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref> However, these trends were present in most western countries at the time, including the United States.\n\nMany politicians still use the term \"taking a walk in the snow\", the line Trudeau used to describe how he arrived at the decision to leave office in 1984. Other popular Trudeauisms frequently used are \"[[just watch me]]\", the \"[[Finger (gesture)|Trudeau Salute]]\", and \"[[Fuddle duddle|Fuddle Duddle]]\".\n\n[[Maclean's]] 1997 and 2011 scholarly surveys [[Historical rankings of Canadian prime ministers|ranked him twice]] as the fifth best Canadian prime minister.<ref>{{cite magazine |url = http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/canadas-best-prime-ministers/ |title = Canada's best prime ministers |magazine = [[Maclean's]] |date = 10 June 2011 |accessdate = 25 August 2015 |author = Hillmer. Norman and Stephen Azzi }}</ref>\n\n===Constitutional legacy===\nOne of Trudeau's most enduring legacies is the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution\u2014which replaced Canada's ties to Britain with its own constitution, the 1982 ''1982 Constitution Act''.<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\">{{cite news |newspaper=New York Times |title=Pierre Trudeau Is Dead at 80; Dashing Fighter for Canada |first=Michael T. |last=Kaufman |date=September 29, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/world/pierre-trudeau-is-dead-at-80-dashing-fighter-for-canada.html|access-date=February 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525032137/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/world/pierre-trudeau-is-dead-at-80-dashing-fighter-for-canada.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |archive-date=May 25, 2013}}</ref>\nThis included a domestic amending formula and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is seen as advancing [[civil rights]] and liberties and has become a cornerstone of Canadian values for most Canadians. It also represented the final step in Trudeau's liberal vision of a fully independent Canada based on fundamental human rights and the protection of individual freedoms as well as those of linguistic and cultural minorities. Court challenges based on the Charter of Rights have been used to advance the cause of women's equality, re-establish French school boards in provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, and to mandate the adoption of [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] all across Canada. [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|Section 35]] of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', has clarified issues of aboriginal and equality rights, including establishing the previously denied aboriginal rights of [[Metis (people)|M\u00e9tis]]. Section 15, dealing with equality rights, has been used to remedy societal discrimination against minority groups. The coupling of the direct and indirect influences of the charter has meant that it has grown to influence every aspect of Canadian life and the override (notwithstanding clause) of the charter has been infrequently used.\n\n[[Canadian conservatism|Canadian conservatives]] claim the constitution has resulted in too much [[judicial activism]] on the part of the courts in Canada. It is also heavily criticized by [[Quebec nationalism|Qu\u00e9bec nationalists]], who resent that the 1982 amendments to the constitution were never ratified by any [[Politics of Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec government]] and the constitution does not recognize a constitutional veto for Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n===Bilingualism===\n{{See also|Bilingualism in Canada}}\nBilingualism is one of Trudeau's most lasting accomplishments, having been fully integrated into the Federal government's services, documents, and broadcasting (though not, however, in provincial governments, except for Ontario, New Brunswick, and Manitoba). While official bilingualism has settled some of the grievances Francophones had towards the federal government, many Francophones had hoped that Canadians would be able to function in the official language of their choice no matter where in the country they were.\n\nHowever, Trudeau's ambitions in this arena have been overstated: Trudeau once said that he regretted the use of the term \"bilingualism\", because it appeared to demand that all Canadians speak two languages. In fact, Trudeau's vision was to see Canada as a bilingual confederation in which ''all'' cultures would have a place. In this way, his conception broadened beyond simply the relationship of Qu\u00e9bec to Canada.\n\n===Multiculturalism===\nOn October 8, 1971, Pierre Trudeau introduced the Multiculturalism Policy in the House of Commons.  It was the first of its kind in the world,{{sfn|English (2009)|p=142}} and was then emulated in several provinces, such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and other countries most notably Australia, which has had a similar history and immigration pattern.  Beyond the specifics of the policy itself, this action signalled an openness to the world and coincided with a more open immigration policy that had been brought in by Trudeau's predecessor Lester B. Pearson.\n\n===Cultural legacy===\nIn the last years of his tenure, he ensured both the [[National Gallery of Canada]] and the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] had proper homes in the national capital region. The Trudeau government also implemented programs which mandated [[Canadian content]] in film, and broadcasting, and gave substantial subsidies to develop the Canadian media and cultural industries. Though the policies remain controversial, Canadian media industries have become stronger since Trudeau's arrival.\n\n===Legacy in western Canada===\nTrudeau's posthumous reputation in the Western Provinces is notably less favourable than in the rest of English-speaking Canada, and he is sometimes regarded as the \"father of Western alienation\".  To many westerners, Trudeau's policies seemed to favour other parts of the country, especially [[Ontario]] and Qu\u00e9bec, at their expense. Outstanding among such policies was the National Energy Program, which was seen as unfairly depriving western provinces of the full economic benefit from their oil and gas resources, in order to pay for nationwide social programs, and make regional transfer payments to poorer parts of the country. Sentiments of this kind were especially strong in oil-rich [[Alberta]] where unemployment rose from 4% to 10% following passage of the NEP.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alberta|title=Alberta, section Alberta's economy|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref> Estimates have placed Alberta's losses between $50&nbsp;billion and $100&nbsp;billion because of the NEP.<ref>{{cite journal |first = Mary Elizabeth |last = Vicente |title = The National Energy Program |journal = Canada's Digital Collections |publisher = Heritage Community Foundation |year = 2005 |url = http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/events/issues_nep.html |accessdate = 2008-04-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first = Robert |last = Mansell |author2 = Schlenker, Ron |author3 = Anderson, John |title = Energy, Fiscal Balances and National Sharing |publisher = Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy/[[University of Calgary]] |year = 2005 |url = http://www.iseee.ca/files/iseee/ISEEEResearchReportNov1805.pdf |accessdate = 2008-04-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626113516/http://www.iseee.ca/files/iseee/ISEEEResearchReportNov1805.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-26 }}</ref>\n\nMore particularly, two incidents involving Trudeau are remembered as having fostered Western alienation, and as emblematic of it. During a visit to [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met with a group of farmers who were protesting the [[Canadian Wheat Board]]. The widely remembered perception is that Trudeau dismissed the protesters' concerns with  \"Why should ''I'' sell your wheat?\"&nbsp;\u2013 however, he had asked the [[rhetorical question|question rhetorically]] and then proceeded to answer it himself.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/chretien-accused-of-lying|title=Chr\u00e9tien Accused of Lying|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 21, 2019}}, [[Maclean's]], December 23, 1996</ref> Years later, on a train trip through [[Salmon Arm, British Columbia]], he \"gave the finger\" to a group of protesters through the carriage window&nbsp;\u2013 less widely remembered is that the protesters were shouting anti-French slogans at the train.<ref>Anthony Westell, ''Paradox: Trudeau as Prime Minister''.</ref>\n\n===Legacy in Qu\u00e9bec===\nTrudeau's legacy in Qu\u00e9bec is mixed. Many credit his actions during the October Crisis as crucial in terminating the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) as a force in Qu\u00e9bec, and ensuring that the campaign for Qu\u00e9bec separatism took a democratic and peaceful route. However, his [[War Measures Act#The October Crisis|imposition of the ''War Measures Act'']]\u2014which received majority support at the time\u2014is remembered by some in Qu\u00e9bec and elsewhere as an attack on democracy. Trudeau is also credited by many for the defeat of the 1980 Quebec referendum.\n\nAt the federal level, Trudeau faced almost no strong political opposition in Qu\u00e9bec during his time as Prime Minister. For instance, his Liberal party captured 74 out of 75 Qu\u00e9bec seats in the [[List of Canadian federal general elections|1980 federal election]]. Provincially, though, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois twice elected the pro-sovereignty Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Moreover, there were not at that time any pro-sovereignty federal parties such as the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]. Since the signing of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' in 1982 and until 2015, the Liberal Party of Canada had not succeeded in winning a majority of seats in Qu\u00e9bec. He was disliked by the Quebecois nationalists.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070213210244/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/trudeau.htm Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Quebec and the Constitution], marianopolis.edu; retrieved 2011-07-07.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy with respect to indigenous peoples in Canada ===\nIn 1969, Trudeau along with his then Minister of Indian Affairs Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Trudeau proposed the [[1969 White Paper]] (officially entitled Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian policy). Under the legislation of the White Paper, Indian Status would be eliminated. First Nations Peoples would be incorporated fully into provincial government responsibilities as equal Canadian citizens, and reserve status would be removed imposing the laws of private property in indigenous communities. Any special programs or considerations that had been allowed to First Nations people under previous legislation would be terminated, as the special considerations were seen by the Government to act as a means to further separate Indian peoples from Canadian citizens. This proposal was seen by many as racist and an attack on Canada's aboriginal population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kerr|first=Elisabetta|date=September 2017|title=Pierre Trudeau's White Paper and the Struggle for Aboriginal Rights in Canada|url=https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=gljuh|journal=The Great Lakes Journal of Undergraduate History|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facinghistory.org/stolen-lives-indigenous-peoples-canada-and-indian-residential-schools/chapter-8/white-paper-red-paper|title=White Paper, Red Paper|website=Facing History and Ourselves|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> The Paper proposed the general assimilation of First Nations into the Canadian body politic through the elimination of the ''[[Indian Act]]'' and Indian status, the parcelling of reserve land to private owners, and the elimination of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. The White Paper prompted the first major national mobilization of Indian and Aboriginal activists against the federal government's proposal, leading to Trudeau setting aside the legislation.\n\n===Intellectual contributions===\nTrudeau was a strong advocate for a [[federalism|federalist]] model of government in Canada, developing and promoting his ideas in response and contrast to strengthening Qu\u00e9bec nationalist movements, for instance the social and political atmosphere created during Maurice Duplessis' time in power.<ref>Gagnon (2000).</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}\n\nFederalism in this context can be defined as \"a particular way of sharing political power among different peoples within a state...Those who believe in federalism hold that different peoples do not need states of their own in order to enjoy self-determination. Peoples&nbsp;... may agree to share a single state while retaining substantial degrees of self-government over matters essential to their identity as peoples\".<ref>Ignatieff, quoted in Balthazar (1995), p. 6.</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}\n\nAs a social democrat, Trudeau sought to combine and harmonize his theories on [[social democracy]] with those of federalism so that both could find effective expression in Canada. He noted the ostensible conflict between socialism, with its usually strong centralist government model, and federalism, which expounded a division and cooperation of power by both federal and provincial levels of government.{{sfn|English (2009)|p={{page needed|date=May 2016}}}} In particular, Trudeau stated the following about socialists:{{quote|[R]ather than water down&nbsp;... their socialism, must constantly seek ways of adapting it to a bicultural society governed under a federal constitution. And since the future of Canadian federalism lies clearly in the direction of co-operation, the wise socialist will turn his thoughts in that direction, keeping in mind the importance of establishing buffer zones of joint sovereignty and co-operative zones of joint administration between the two levels of government{{sfn|English (2009)|p=141}}}}\n\nTrudeau pointed out that in sociological terms, Canada is inherently a federalist society, forming unique regional identities and priorities, and therefore a federalist model of spending and jurisdictional powers is most appropriate. He argues, \"in the age of the mass society, it is no small advantage to foster the creation of quasi-sovereign communities at the provincial level, where power is that much less remote from the people.\"{{sfn|English (2009)|p=133}}\n\nTrudeau's idealistic plans for a cooperative Canadian federalist state were resisted and hindered as a result of his narrowness on ideas of identity and socio-cultural pluralism: \"While the idea of a 'nation' in the sociological sense is acknowledged by Trudeau, he considers the allegiance which it generates\u2014emotive and particularistic\u2014to be contrary to the idea of cohesion between humans, and as such creating fertile ground for the internal fragmentation of states and a permanent state of conflict\".<ref name=\"Gagnon2000pp16-17\">Gagnon (2000), 16\u201317.</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}\n\nThis position garnered significant criticism for Trudeau, in particular from Qu\u00e9bec and First Nations peoples on the basis that his theories denied their rights to nationhood.<ref name=\"Gagnon2000pp16-17\"/>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}   First Nations communities raised particular concerns with the proposed 1969 White Paper, developed under Trudeau by Jean Chr\u00e9tien.\n\n==Supreme Court appointments==\nTrudeau chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] by the Governor General:\n\n* [[Bora Laskin]] (March 19, 1970 \u2013 March 17, 1984; as Chief Justice, December 27, 1973)\n* [[Joseph Honor\u00e9 G\u00e9rald Fauteux]] (as

His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada's [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada by time in office|third longest-serving]] Prime Minister, behind [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and [[John A. Macdonald]].\n\nTrudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer, intellectual, and activist in [[Qu\u00e9bec]] politics. He joined the Liberal Party and was elected to the [[Canadian Parliament]] in 1965, quickly being appointed as Prime Minister [[Lester&nbsp;B. Pearson|Lester&nbsp;B. Pearson's]] [[Parliamentary Secretary]]. In 1967, he was appointed [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]]. Trudeau's outgoing personality caused a media sensation, inspiring \"[[Trudeaumania]]\", and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968, when he was appointed Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nFrom the late 1960s until the early 1980s, Trudeau's personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life. After his appointment as Prime Minister, he won the [[1968 Canadian federal election|1968]], [[1972 Canadian federal election|1972]] and [[1974 Canadian federal election|1974]] elections, before narrowly losing in [[1979 Canadian federal election|1979]]. He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards, in [[1980 Canadian federal election|1980]], and eventually retired from politics shortly before the [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984 election]].\n\nDespite his personal motto, \"Reason before passion\",<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\"/> his personality and political career aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office. Admirers praised what they consider to be the force of Trudeau's intellect{{sfn| Mallick (2000-09-30)|p=P04}} and his political acumen, maintaining national unity over the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], suppressing a Qu\u00e9bec [[October Crisis|terrorist crisis]], fostering a pan-Canadian identity, and in achieving sweeping institutional reform, including the implementation of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|official bilingualism]], [[patriation]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]], and the establishment of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''.{{sfn|The Globe and Mail (2000-09-29)|p=A20}} Critics accused him of arrogance, of economic mismanagement, and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Qu\u00e9bec and the economy of the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]].{{sfn|Fortin (2000-10-09)|p=A17}}\n\nHis eldest son, [[Justin Trudeau]], became the 23rd and current Prime Minister, following the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 election]] and [[2019 Canadian federal election|2019 election]], and is the first prime minister of Canada to be a descendant of a former prime minister.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/election/trudeau-s-win-ushers-in-canada-s-first-political-dynasty-1.2618093|title=Trudeau's win ushers in Canada's first political dynasty|last=Coorsh|first=Karolyn|date=2015-10-20|website=CTVNews|language=en|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nThe Trudeau family can be traced to [[Marcillac-Lanville]] in [[France]] in the 16th century and to a Robert Truteau (1544\u20131589).{{sfn|G\u00e9n\u00e9alogie du Qu\u00e9bec (2012)}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/robert-truteau_20306861?geo_a=r&geo_s=us&geo_t=us&geo_v=2.0.0&o_xid=62916&o_lid=62916&o_sch=Partners |title = Robert Truteau |publisher = Ancestry.com |accessdate = 2015-11-04 }}</ref> In 1659, the first Trudeau to arrive in Canada was \u00c9tienne Trudeau or Truteau (1641\u20131712), a carpenter and home builder from [[La Rochelle]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nosorigines.qc.ca/GenealogieQuebec.aspx?genealogie=Etienne_Trudeau&pid=6568&lng=fr&partID=6569 |title = G\u00e9n\u00e9alogie Etienne Trudeau |publisher = Nosorigines.qc.ca |date = 2007-01-14 |accessdate = 2014-08-16 }}</ref>\n\nPierre Trudeau was born at home at 5779 Durocher Avenue, [[Outremont, Quebec|Outremont, Montreal]], [[Canada]], on October 18, 1919,<ref name=\"English_Just_2009\">{{cite book |last= English |first= John |title= Just Watch Me: The Life of Pierre Elliott Trudeau Volume Two: 1968\u20132000 |location   = Toronto |publisher  = [[Alfred A.

His decision to join the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] rather than the CCF's successor, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) was partly based on his belief that the federal NDP could not achieve power.

Going into the leadership convention, Trudeau was the front-runner and a clear favourite with the Canadian public. However, many Liberals still had reservations given that he joined the Liberal Party in 1965 and that his views, particularly those on divorce, abortion, and homosexuality, were seen as radical and opposed by a substantial segment of the party.

During the annual 1975 Christmas interview with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], Trudeau discussed the economy, citing market failures and stating that more state intervention would be necessary.

The PQ had chiefly campaigned on a \"good government\" platform, but promised a referendum on independence to be held within their first mandate. Trudeau and L\u00e9vesque had been personal rivals, with Trudeau's intellectualism contrasting with L\u00e9vesque's more working-class image.

They changed for the better when Trudeau and [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter (1977-81)]] found a better rapport. The late 1970s saw a more sympathetic American attitude toward Canadian political and economic needs, the pardoning of draft evaders who had moved to Canada, and the passing of old sore points such as Watergate and the Vietnam War. Canada more than ever welcomed American investments during the \"[[stagflation]]\" (high inflation and high unemployment at the same time) that hurt both nations in the 1970s.<ref>Lily Gardner Feldman, \"Canada and the United States in the 1970s: Rift and Reconciliation.\" ''The World Today'' 34.12 (1978): 484-492.

Trudeau and his advisors, to contrast with the mild-mannered Clark, based their campaign on Trudeau's decisive personality and his grasp of the Constitution file, despite the general public's apparent wariness of both. The traditional Liberal rally at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] saw Trudeau stressing the importance of major constitutional reform to general ennui, and his campaign \"photo-ops\" were typically surrounded by picket lines and protesters. Though polls portended disaster, Clark's struggles justifying his party's populist platform and a strong Trudeau performance in the election debate helped bring the Liberals to the point of contention.{{sfn|English (2009)|loc=chpt. 13}}\n\nThough winning the popular vote by four points, the Liberal vote was concentrated in Qu\u00e9bec and faltered in industrial Ontario, allowing the PCs to win the seat-count handily and form a minority government. Trudeau soon announced his intention to resign as Liberal Party leader and favoured Donald Macdonald to be his successor.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=265}}\n\nHowever, before a [[leadership convention]] could be held, with Trudeau's blessing and [[Allan MacEachen]]'s manoeuvring in the house, the Liberals supported an NDP subamendment to Clark's budget stating that the House had no confidence in the budget. In Canada, as in most other countries with a [[Westminster system]], budget votes are indirectly considered to be votes of confidence in the government, and their [[loss of supply|failure]] automatically brings down the government. Liberal and NDP votes and Social Credit abstentions led to the subamendment passing 139-133, thereby toppling Clark's government and triggering a new election for a House less than a year old. The Liberal caucus, along with friends and advisers persuaded Trudeau to stay on as leader and fight the election, with Trudeau's main impetus being the upcoming referendum on Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=265\u201366}}\n\nTrudeau and the Liberals engaged in a new strategy for the February 1980 election: facetiously called the \"low bridge\", it involved dramatically underplaying Trudeau's role and avoiding media appearances, to the point of refusing a televised debate. On election day Ontario returned to the Liberal fold, and Trudeau and the Liberals defeated Clark and won a [[majority government]].<ref>{{cite book |author = Stephen Clarkson |title = The Big Red Machine: How the Liberal Party Dominates Canadian Politics |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rY64Ph2yjWoC&pg=PA103 |year = 2011 |publisher = UBC Press |pages = 87\u2013105 |isbn = 9780774840408 }}</ref>\n\n==Prime Minister, 1980\u201384==\n[[File:Pierre Elliot Trudeau-2.jpg|right|thumb|Prime Minister Trudeau in 1980]]\n\nAs a result of the February 18, [[1980 Canadian federal election]], the [[32nd Canadian Parliament]] was controlled by a Liberal Party majority, led by Prime Minister Trudeau and the [[22nd Canadian Ministry]]. \nTrudeau formally retired on June 30, ending his 15-year tenure as Prime Minister. He was succeeded by John Turner, a former [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet minister]] under both Trudeau and Lester Pearson.\n\nThe Liberal victory in 1980 highlighted a sharp geographical divide in the country: the party had won no seats west of [[Manitoba]]. Trudeau, in an attempt to represent Western interests, offered to form a coalition government with Ed Broadbent's NDP, which had won 22 seats in the west, but was rebuffed by Broadbent out of fear the party would have no influence in a majority government.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=446-7}}\n\nThe first challenge Trudeau faced upon re-election was the May 20, [[1980 Quebec referendum]] on Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty, called by the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government under Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque. Trudeau immediately initiated federal involvement in the referendum, reversing the Clark government's policy of leaving the issue to the Qu\u00e9bec Liberals and [[Claude Ryan]]. He appointed Jean Chr\u00e9tien as the nominal spokesman for the federal government, helping to push the \"Non\" cause to working-class voters who tuned out the intellectual Ryan and Trudeau. Unlike Ryan and the Liberals, he refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the referendum question, and noted that the \"association\" required consent from the other provinces.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=454}}\n\nIn the debates in the legislature during the campaign leading up to the referendum L\u00e9vesque said that Trudeau's middle name was Scottish, and that Trudeau's aristocratic upbringing proved that he was more Scottish than French.<ref name=\"CBC_Reflections_20010923\">{{Cite AV media| publisher = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC),  Melbar Entertainment Group| people = McKenna, Terence (Director), [[Ann-Marie MacDonald]] (Contributor), Michael Bliss (Contributor), [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] (Contributor), [[Joe Clark]](Contributor)| series = Biography| title = Reflections: The Trudeau Legacy| date = September 23, 2001}}</ref> A week prior to the referendum, Trudeau delivered one of his most well-known speeches, in which he extolled the virtues of federalism and questioned the ambiguous language of the referendum question.

It became one of the Liberal's most contentious policies. The NEP was fiercely protested by the Western provinces. The western provinces blamed the devastating oil bust of the 1980s on the NEB which led to what many termed \"[[Western alienation]]\".

He described his own decline in popularity as \"long walk in the snow\". On February 29, after what he described as a \"long walk in the snow\", Trudeau announced he would not lead the Liberals into the next election.<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\"/>\n\nBefore handing power to Turner, Trudeau took the unusual step of appointing Liberal [[Senate of Canada|Senators]] from Western provinces to Cabinet, in the 22nd Canadian Ministry. He advised [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Jeanne Sauv\u00e9]] to appoint over 200 Liberals to [[patronage]] positions.  He and Turner then crafted a legal agreement calling for Turner to advise an additional 70 patronage appointments. The sheer volume of appointments, combined with questions about the appointees' qualifications, led to condemnation from across the political spectrum.<ref name=\"Mulroney 1991\">''Mulroney: The Politics of Ambition'', by [[John Sawatsky]], Toronto 1991, McFarlane, Walter, and Ross publishers.</ref> However, an apparent rebound in the polls prompted Turner to call an election for September 1984, almost a year before it was due. Turner's appointment deal with Trudeau came back to haunt the Liberals at the English-language debate, when Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize for not advising that the appointments be canceled\u2014advice that Sauv\u00e9 would have been required to follow by convention. Turner claimed that \"I had no option\" but to let the appointments stand, prompting Mulroney to tell him, \"[[You had an option, sir]]--to say 'no'--and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn the [[1984 Canadian federal election]], Mulroney won the largest landslide majority government (by total number of seats) in Canadian history. The Liberals, with Turner as leader, lost 95 seats, in what was then, the worst defeat of a sitting government at the federal level. In the [[1993 Canadian federal election]], the Progressive Conservatives faced a larger defeat, when cut to two seats.\n\n===Patriation of the constitution===\n\nIn 1982 Trudeau succeeded in repatriating the Constitution.<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\"/> The British Parliament passed an act ceding to the Canadian federal government, full responsibility for amending Canada's national charter.<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\"/> Earlier in his tenure, he had met with opposition from the provincial governments, most notably with the Victoria Charter. Provincial premiers were united in their concerns regarding an amending formula, a court-enforced Charter of Rights, and a further devolution of powers to the provinces. In 1980, Chr\u00e9tien was tasked with creating a constitutional settlement following the Qu\u00e9bec referendum in which Quebecers voted to remain in Canada.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=459}}\n\nAfter chairing a series of increasingly acrimonious conferences with first ministers on the issue, Trudeau announced the intention of the federal government to proceed with a request to the British parliament to patriate the constitution, with additions to be approved by a referendum without input from provincial governments. Trudeau was backed by the NDP, Ontario Premier [[Bill Davis]], and New Brunswick Premier [[Richard Hatfield]] and was opposed by the remaining premiers and PC leader Joe Clark. After numerous provincial governments challenged the legality of the decision using their [[Reference question|reference power]], conflicting decisions prompted a [[Patriation Reference|Supreme Court decision]] that stated unilateral patriation was legal, but was in contravention of a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that the provinces be consulted and have general agreement to the changes.\n\nAfter the court decision, which prompted some reservations in the British parliament of accepting a unilateral request,<ref>\n{{Cite journal |first = Andrew |last = Heard |title = Canadian Independence |year = 1990 |place = Vancouver |publisher = Simon Fraser University |url = https://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/324/Independence.html |accessdate = 2010-08-25 }}</ref> Trudeau agreed to meet with the premiers one more time before proceeding. At the meeting, Trudeau reached an agreement with nine of the premiers on patriating the constitution and implementing the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, with the caveat that provincial legislatures would have the ability to use a [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] to protect some laws from judicial oversight. The notable exception was L\u00e9vesque, who, Trudeau believed, would never have signed an agreement. The objection of the Qu\u00e9bec government to the new constitution became a source of continued acrimony between the federal and Qu\u00e9bec governments, and would forever stain Trudeau's reputation amongst nationalists in the province.\n\nThe ''[[Canada Act]]'', which included the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' and the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'', was proclaimed by Queen Elizabeth II, as [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]], on April 17, 1982.\n\n==Retirement==\nTrudeau joined the Montreal law firm [[Heenan Blaikie]] as counsel and settled in the historic [[Maison Cormier]] in Montreal following his retirement from politics.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Annmarie|last2=Macdonell|first2=Cameron|title=Making Himself at Home: Cormier, Trudeau, and the Architecture of Domestic Masculinity|journal=Winterthur Portfolio|date=2016|volume=50|issue=2/3|pages=151\u2013189|doi=10.1086/689984}}</ref> Though he rarely gave speeches or spoke to the press, his interventions into public debate had a significant impact when they occurred. Trudeau wrote and spoke out against both the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]] proposals to amend the Canadian constitution, arguing that they would weaken federalism and the Charter of Rights if implemented. His opposition to both Accords was considered one of the major factors leading to the defeat of the two proposals.\n\nHe also continued to speak against the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and the sovereignty movement with less effect.\n\nTrudeau also remained active in international affairs, visiting foreign leaders and participating in international associations such as the [[Club of Rome]].  He met with Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and other leaders in 1985; shortly afterwards Gorbachev met President [[Ronald Reagan]] to discuss easing world tensions.\n\nHe published his memoirs in 1993.<ref name=\"Trudeau_Memoirs_1993\">{{cite book |title=Memoirs |location=Toronto |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |date=1993 |isbn=0-7710-8588-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/memoirs00trud/page/n15/mode/2up |access-date=February 21, 2020}}</ref> The book sold hundreds of thousands of copies in several editions, and became one of the most successful Canadian books ever published.\n\nIn his [[old age]], he was afflicted with [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[prostate cancer]], and became less active, although he continued to work at his law practice until a few months before his death at the age of 80.

While mostly private about his beliefs, he made it clear that he was a believer, stating, in an interview with the ''United Church Observer'' in 1971: \"I believe in life after death, I believe in God and I'm a Christian.\" Trudeau maintained, however, that he preferred to impose constraints on himself rather than have them imposed from the outside. In this sense, he believed he was more like a Protestant than a Catholic of the era in which he was schooled.{{sfn|Trudeau (1996)|pp=302\u2013303}}\n\nMichael W. Higgins, a former President of [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]], has researched Trudeau's spirituality and finds that it incorporated elements of three Catholic traditions. The first of these was the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who provided his education up to the college level. Trudeau frequently displayed the logic and love of argument consistent with that tradition. A second great spiritual influence in Trudeau's life was [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]. According to Michel Gourgues, professor at [[Dominican University College]], Trudeau \"considered himself a lay Dominican\".{{attribution needed|date=May 2016}} He studied philosophy under Dominican Father [[Louis-Marie R\u00e9gis]] and remained close to him throughout his life, regarding R\u00e9gis as \"spiritual director and friend\". Another skein in Trudeau's spirituality was a [[Contemplation|contemplative]] aspect acquired from his association with the [[Benedictine]] tradition. According to Higgins, Trudeau was convinced of the centrality of [[Christian meditation|meditation]] in a life fully lived. Trudeau meditated regularly after being initiated into [[Transcendental Meditation]] by the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Maharishi : the biography of the man who gave transcendental meditation to the world|last=Mason, Paul, 1952-|isbn=1852305711|location=Shaftesbury, Dorset|oclc=31133549|year = 1994}}</ref> He took retreats at [[Saint-Beno\u00eet-du-Lac, Qu\u00e9bec]] and regularly attended [[Liturgy of the Hours|Hours]] and the [[Eucharist]] at Montreal's Benedictine community.{{sfn|Higgins, M.

Regina, Saskatchewan. Retrieved: 2015-09-24.</ref>\n\nTrudeau's most enduring legacy may lie in his contribution to [[Canadian nationalism]], and of pride in Canada in and for itself rather than as a derivative of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. His role in this effort, and his related battles with Qu\u00e9bec on behalf of Canadian unity, cemented his political position when in office despite the controversies he faced\u2014and remain the most remembered aspect of his tenure afterwards.\n\nSome consider Trudeau's economic policies to have been a weak point. Inflation and unemployment marred much of his tenure as prime minister. When Trudeau took office in 1968 Canada had a debt of $18&nbsp;billion (24% of GDP) which was largely left over from World War II, when he left office in 1984, that debt stood at $200&nbsp;billion (46% of GDP), an increase of 83% in real terms.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.csls.ca/data/ipt2006.pdf | title=GDP figures | publisher=Centre for the Study of Living Standards | date=2006 | accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref> However, these trends were present in most western countries at the time, including the United States.\n\nMany politicians still use the term \"taking a walk in the snow\", the line Trudeau used to describe how he arrived at the decision to leave office in 1984. Other popular Trudeauisms frequently used are \"[[just watch me]]\", the \"[[Finger (gesture)|Trudeau Salute]]\", and \"[[Fuddle duddle|Fuddle Duddle]]\".\n\n[[Maclean's]] 1997 and 2011 scholarly surveys [[Historical rankings of Canadian prime ministers|ranked him twice]] as the fifth best Canadian prime minister.<ref>{{cite magazine |url = http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/canadas-best-prime-ministers/ |title = Canada's best prime ministers |magazine = [[Maclean's]] |date = 10 June 2011 |accessdate = 25 August 2015 |author = Hillmer. Norman and Stephen Azzi }}</ref>\n\n===Constitutional legacy===\nOne of Trudeau's most enduring legacies is the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution\u2014which replaced Canada's ties to Britain with its own constitution, the 1982 ''1982 Constitution Act''.<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\">{{cite news |newspaper=New York Times |title=Pierre Trudeau Is Dead at 80; Dashing Fighter for Canada |first=Michael T. |last=Kaufman |date=September 29, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/world/pierre-trudeau-is-dead-at-80-dashing-fighter-for-canada.html|access-date=February 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525032137/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/world/pierre-trudeau-is-dead-at-80-dashing-fighter-for-canada.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |archive-date=May 25, 2013}}</ref>\nThis included a domestic amending formula and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is seen as advancing [[civil rights]] and liberties and has become a cornerstone of Canadian values for most Canadians. It also represented the final step in Trudeau's liberal vision of a fully independent Canada based on fundamental human rights and the protection of individual freedoms as well as those of linguistic and cultural minorities. Court challenges based on the Charter of Rights have been used to advance the cause of women's equality, re-establish French school boards in provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, and to mandate the adoption of [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] all across Canada. [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|Section 35]] of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', has clarified issues of aboriginal and equality rights, including establishing the previously denied aboriginal rights of [[Metis (people)|M\u00e9tis]]. Section 15, dealing with equality rights, has been used to remedy societal discrimination against minority groups. The coupling of the direct and indirect influences of the charter has meant that it has grown to influence every aspect of Canadian life and the override (notwithstanding clause) of the charter has been infrequently used.\n\n[[Canadian conservatism|Canadian conservatives]] claim the constitution has resulted in too much [[judicial activism]] on the part of the courts in Canada. It is also heavily criticized by [[Quebec nationalism|Qu\u00e9bec nationalists]], who resent that the 1982 amendments to the constitution were never ratified by any [[Politics of Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec government]] and the constitution does not recognize a constitutional veto for Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n===Bilingualism===\n{{See also|Bilingualism in Canada}}\nBilingualism is one of Trudeau's most lasting accomplishments, having been fully integrated into the Federal government's services, documents, and broadcasting (though not, however, in provincial governments, except for Ontario, New Brunswick, and Manitoba). While official bilingualism has settled some of the grievances Francophones had towards the federal government, many Francophones had hoped that Canadians would be able to function in the official language of their choice no matter where in the country they were.\n\nHowever, Trudeau's ambitions in this arena have been overstated: Trudeau once said that he regretted the use of the term \"bilingualism\", because it appeared to demand that all Canadians speak two languages. In fact, Trudeau's vision was to see Canada as a bilingual confederation in which ''all'' cultures would have a place. In this way, his conception broadened beyond simply the relationship of Qu\u00e9bec to Canada.\n\n===Multiculturalism===\nOn October 8, 1971, Pierre Trudeau introduced the Multiculturalism Policy in the House of Commons.  It was the first of its kind in the world,{{sfn|English (2009)|p=142}} and was then emulated in several provinces, such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and other countries most notably Australia, which has had a similar history and immigration pattern.  Beyond the specifics of the policy itself, this action signalled an openness to the world and coincided with a more open immigration policy that had been brought in by Trudeau's predecessor Lester B. Pearson.\n\n===Cultural legacy===\nIn the last years of his tenure, he ensured both the [[National Gallery of Canada]] and the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] had proper homes in the national capital region. The Trudeau government also implemented programs which mandated [[Canadian content]] in film, and broadcasting, and gave substantial subsidies to develop the Canadian media and cultural industries. Though the policies remain controversial, Canadian media industries have become stronger since Trudeau's arrival.\n\n===Legacy in western Canada===\nTrudeau's posthumous reputation in the Western Provinces is notably less favourable than in the rest of English-speaking Canada, and he is sometimes regarded as the \"father of Western alienation\".  To many westerners, Trudeau's policies seemed to favour other parts of the country, especially [[Ontario]] and Qu\u00e9bec, at their expense. Outstanding among such policies was the National Energy Program, which was seen as unfairly depriving western provinces of the full economic benefit from their oil and gas resources, in order to pay for nationwide social programs, and make regional transfer payments to poorer parts of the country. Sentiments of this kind were especially strong in oil-rich [[Alberta]] where unemployment rose from 4% to 10% following passage of the NEP.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alberta|title=Alberta, section Alberta's economy|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref> Estimates have placed Alberta's losses between $50&nbsp;billion and $100&nbsp;billion because of the NEP.<ref>{{cite journal |first = Mary Elizabeth |last = Vicente |title = The National Energy Program |journal = Canada's Digital Collections |publisher = Heritage Community Foundation |year = 2005 |url = http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/events/issues_nep.html |accessdate = 2008-04-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first = Robert |last = Mansell |author2 = Schlenker, Ron |author3 = Anderson, John |title = Energy, Fiscal Balances and National Sharing |publisher = Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy/[[University of Calgary]] |year = 2005 |url = http://www.iseee.ca/files/iseee/ISEEEResearchReportNov1805.pdf |accessdate = 2008-04-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626113516/http://www.iseee.ca/files/iseee/ISEEEResearchReportNov1805.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-26 }}</ref>\n\nMore particularly, two incidents involving Trudeau are remembered as having fostered Western alienation, and as emblematic of it. During a visit to [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met with a group of farmers who were protesting the [[Canadian Wheat Board]]. The widely remembered perception is that Trudeau dismissed the protesters' concerns with  \"Why should ''I'' sell your wheat?\"&nbsp;\u2013 however, he had asked the [[rhetorical question|question rhetorically]] and then proceeded to answer it himself.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/chretien-accused-of-lying|title=Chr\u00e9tien Accused of Lying|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 21, 2019}}, [[Maclean's]], December 23, 1996</ref> Years later, on a train trip through [[Salmon Arm, British Columbia]], he \"gave the finger\" to a group of protesters through the carriage window&nbsp;\u2013 less widely remembered is that the protesters were shouting anti-French slogans at the train.<ref>Anthony Westell, ''Paradox: Trudeau as Prime Minister''.</ref>\n\n===Legacy in Qu\u00e9bec===\nTrudeau's legacy in Qu\u00e9bec is mixed. Many credit his actions during the October Crisis as crucial in terminating the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) as a force in Qu\u00e9bec, and ensuring that the campaign for Qu\u00e9bec separatism took a democratic and peaceful route. However, his [[War Measures Act#The October Crisis|imposition of the ''War Measures Act'']]\u2014which received majority support at the time\u2014is remembered by some in Qu\u00e9bec and elsewhere as an attack on democracy. Trudeau is also credited by many for the defeat of the 1980 Quebec referendum.\n\nAt the federal level, Trudeau faced almost no strong political opposition in Qu\u00e9bec during his time as Prime Minister. For instance, his Liberal party captured 74 out of 75 Qu\u00e9bec seats in the [[List of Canadian federal general elections|1980 federal election]]. Provincially, though, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois twice elected the pro-sovereignty Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Moreover, there were not at that time any pro-sovereignty federal parties such as the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]. Since the signing of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' in 1982 and until 2015, the Liberal Party of Canada had not succeeded in winning a majority of seats in Qu\u00e9bec. He was disliked by the Quebecois nationalists.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070213210244/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/trudeau.htm Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Quebec and the Constitution], marianopolis.edu; retrieved 2011-07-07.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy with respect to indigenous peoples in Canada ===\nIn 1969, Trudeau along with his then Minister of Indian Affairs Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Trudeau proposed the [[1969 White Paper]] (officially entitled Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian policy). Under the legislation of the White Paper, Indian Status would be eliminated. First Nations Peoples would be incorporated fully into provincial government responsibilities as equal Canadian citizens, and reserve status would be removed imposing the laws of private property in indigenous communities. Any special programs or considerations that had been allowed to First Nations people under previous legislation would be terminated, as the special considerations were seen by the Government to act as a means to further separate Indian peoples from Canadian citizens. This proposal was seen by many as racist and an attack on Canada's aboriginal population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kerr|first=Elisabetta|date=September 2017|title=Pierre Trudeau's White Paper and the Struggle for Aboriginal Rights in Canada|url=https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=gljuh|journal=The Great Lakes Journal of Undergraduate History|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facinghistory.org/stolen-lives-indigenous-peoples-canada-and-indian-residential-schools/chapter-8/white-paper-red-paper|title=White Paper, Red Paper|website=Facing History and Ourselves|access-date=2019-07-31}}</ref> The Paper proposed the general assimilation of First Nations into the Canadian body politic through the elimination of the ''[[Indian Act]]'' and Indian status, the parcelling of reserve land to private owners, and the elimination of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. The White Paper prompted the first major national mobilization of Indian and Aboriginal activists against the federal government's proposal, leading to Trudeau setting aside the legislation.\n\n===Intellectual contributions===\nTrudeau was a strong advocate for a [[federalism|federalist]] model of government in Canada, developing and promoting his ideas in response and contrast to strengthening Qu\u00e9bec nationalist movements, for instance the social and political atmosphere created during Maurice Duplessis' time in power.<ref>Gagnon (2000).</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}\n\nFederalism in this context can be defined as \"a particular way of sharing political power among different peoples within a state...Those who believe in federalism hold that different peoples do not need states of their own in order to enjoy self-determination. Peoples&nbsp;... may agree to share a single state while retaining substantial degrees of self-government over matters essential to their identity as peoples\".<ref>Ignatieff, quoted in Balthazar (1995), p. 6.</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}\n\nAs a social democrat, Trudeau sought to combine and harmonize his theories on [[social democracy]] with those of federalism so that both could find effective expression in Canada. He noted the ostensible conflict between socialism, with its usually strong centralist government model, and federalism, which expounded a division and cooperation of power by both federal and provincial levels of government.{{sfn|English (2009)|p={{page needed|date=May 2016}}}} In particular, Trudeau stated the following about socialists:{{quote|[R]ather than water down&nbsp;... their socialism, must constantly seek ways of adapting it to a bicultural society governed under a federal constitution. And since the future of Canadian federalism lies clearly in the direction of co-operation, the wise socialist will turn his thoughts in that direction, keeping in mind the importance of establishing buffer zones of joint sovereignty and co-operative zones of joint administration between the two levels of government{{sfn|English (2009)|p=141}}}}\n\nTrudeau pointed out that in sociological terms, Canada is inherently a federalist society, forming unique regional identities and priorities, and therefore a federalist model of spending and jurisdictional powers is most appropriate. He argues, \"in the age of the mass society, it is no small advantage to foster the creation of quasi-sovereign communities at the provincial level, where power is that much less remote from the people.\"{{sfn|English (2009)|p=133}}\n\nTrudeau's idealistic plans for a cooperative Canadian federalist state were resisted and hindered as a result of his narrowness on ideas of identity and socio-cultural pluralism: \"While the idea of a 'nation' in the sociological sense is acknowledged by Trudeau, he considers the allegiance which it generates\u2014emotive and particularistic\u2014to be contrary to the idea of cohesion between humans, and as such creating fertile ground for the internal fragmentation of states and a permanent state of conflict\".<ref name=\"Gagnon2000pp16-17\">Gagnon (2000), 16\u201317.</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}\n\nThis position garnered significant criticism for Trudeau, in particular from Qu\u00e9bec and First Nations peoples on the basis that his theories denied their rights to nationhood.<ref name=\"Gagnon2000pp16-17\"/>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}   First Nations communities raised particular concerns with the proposed 1969 White Paper, developed under Trudeau by Jean Chr\u00e9tien.\n\n==Supreme Court appointments==\nTrudeau chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] by the Governor General:\n\n* [[Bora Laskin]] (March 19, 1970 \u2013 March 17, 1984; as Chief Justice, December 27, 1973)\n* [[Joseph Honor\u00e9 G\u00e9rald Fauteux]] (as
