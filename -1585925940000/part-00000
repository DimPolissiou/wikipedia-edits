A major influence was the original Jamaican [[dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]] sound. Another feature of the style is the complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]].<ref name=\"Amen Break video on youtube.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SaFTm2bcac|title=Video explains the world's most important 6-sec drum loop|last=Proctor|first=Landon|date=21 February 2006|website=|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nDrum and bass subgenres include [[breakcore]], [[ragga jungle]], [[hardstep]], [[darkstep]], [[techstep]], [[neurofunk]], ambient drum and bass, [[liquid funk]] (aka liquid drum and bass), jump up, drumfunk, [[funkstep]], [[sambass]], and [[drill 'n' bass]]. From its roots in the UK, the style has established itself around the world. Drum and bass has influenced many other genres like [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[big beat]], [[dubstep]], [[house music|house]], [[trip hop]], [[ambient music]], [[techno]], [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]]. Drum and bass is dominated by a relatively small group of record labels. Major international music labels had shown very little interest in the drum and bass scene until [[BMG Rights Management]] acquired [[Ram Records (UK)|RAM]] in February 2016.<ref name=\"bmg.com\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.bmg.com/uk/news/bmg-invests-ram-records.html| title=BMG Invests In Drum & Bass Powerhouse RAM | work=BMG | number= | date=3 February 2016 | accessdate= 18 August 2017}}</ref> Drum and bass remains most popular in the UK, although it has developed scenes all around the world.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of drum and bass}}\n{{See also|Breakbeat hardcore|hardcore jungle}}\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, a growing [[nightclub]] and overnight outdoor event culture gave birth to new genres in the [[rave]] scene including [[breakbeat hardcore]], [[darkcore]], and [[hardcore jungle]], which combined sampled [[syncopated]] beats, or breakbeats, and other samples from a wide range of different musical genres and, occasionally, samples of music, dialogue and effects from films and television programmes. From as early as 1991, tracks were beginning to strip away some of the heavier sampling and \"hardcore noises\" and create more bassline and breakbeat led tracks. Some tracks increasingly took their influence from reggae and this style would become known as [[hardcore jungle]] (later to become simply [[Jungle (music)|jungle]]), whilst [[darkcore]] (with producers such as [[Goldie]], [[Doc Scott]], Jack Smooth, Foul Play, [[4hero]], and [[2 Bad Mice]]) were experimenting with sounds and creating a blueprint for drum and bass, especially noticeable by late 1993.\n\nBy 1994, [[Jungle (music)|jungle]] had begun to gain mainstream popularity, and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the [[MDMA|ecstasy]]-fuelled rave scene, jungle also inherited associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dancehall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.\n}}</ref>\n\nAs the genre became generally more polished and sophisticated technically, it began to expand its reach from pirate radio to commercial stations and gain widespread acceptance (circa 1995\u20131997). It also began to split into recognisable subgenres such as jump-up and [[Hardstep]]. As a lighter and often jazz-influenced style of drum and bass called \"intelligent drum and bass\" gained mainstream appeal, additional subgenres emerged including [[techstep]] (circa 1996\u20131997), which drew greater influence from [[techno]] music and the [[soundscape]]s of science fiction and [[anime]] films.\n\nThe popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other genres native to the UK, including [[big beat]] and [[hard house]]. Towards the turn of the millennium, however, its popularity was deemed to have dwindled, as the [[UK garage]] offshoot known as [[speed garage]] yielded several hit singles. Speed garage shared high tempos and heavy basslines with drum and bass, but otherwise followed the established conventions of \"house music\", with this and its freshness giving it an advantage commercially. di Vogli says, \"It is often forgotten by my students that a type of music called \"[[garage house]]\" existed in the late 1980s alongside [[hip house]], [[acid house]] and other forms of house music.\" He continues, \"This new garage of the mid-90s was not a form of house or a progression of garage house. The beats and tempo that define house are entirely different. This did cause further confusion in the presence of new house music of the mid-1990s being played alongside what was now being called garage.\"\n\nDespite this, the emergence of further subgenres and related styles such as [[liquid funk]] brought a wave of new artists incorporating new ideas and techniques, supporting continual evolution of the genre. To this day, drum and bass makes frequent appearances in mainstream media and popular culture including in [[television]], as well as being a major reference point for subsequent genres such as [[Grime (music)|grime]] and [[dubstep]],<ref name=\"Global Bass landscape\">[http://rhythmtravels.com/music/global-bass Global Bass on the music landscape]</ref> and producing successful artists including [[Chase & Status]], [[Netsky (musician)|Netsky]], [[Metrik]], and [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]].\n\n==Musical features==\nDrum and bass incorporates a number of scenes and styles, from the highly electronic, [[industrial music|industrial]] sounds of techstep to the use of conventional, acoustic instrumentation that characterise the more jazz-influenced end of the spectrum.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"SimonReynoldsOnTechstep\"/> The sounds of drum and bass are extremely varied due to the range of influences behind the music. Drum and bass could at one time be defined as a strictly electronic musical genre, with the only \"live\" element being the DJ's selection and mixing of records during a set. \"Live\" drum and bass using electric, electronic and acoustic instruments played by musicians on stage emerged over the ensuing years of the genre's development.<ref>New Dawn \u2013 City Clubs Take Back The Night article,

A more recent commonly used break is the \"Tramen\", which combines the [[Amen break]], a [[James Brown]] funk breakbeat (\"[[Tighten Up (Archie Bell & the Drells song)|Tighten Up]]\" or \"Samurai\" break) and an [[Alex Reece]] drum and bass breakbeat.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| title = Dom & Roland interview by Ben Willmott at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724011252/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| archivedate = 24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe relatively fast drum beat forms a canvas on which a producer can create tracks to appeal to almost any taste and often will form only a background to the other elements of the music. [[Syncopated]] breakbeats remain the most distinctive element as without these a high-tempo [[Time signature|4/4]] dance track could be classified as [[techno]] or [[gabber]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| title = Life in The Fast Lane: An Overview of Drum and Bass by George Broyer at drumbum.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807102130/http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| archive-date = 7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]] is another facet of production on which producers can spend a very large amount of time. The [[Amen break]] is generally acknowledged to have been the most-used (and often considered the most powerful) break in drum and bass.<ref name=\"Amen Break video on youtube.com\" />\n\n===Bass elements===\nThe genre places great importance on the [[bassline]], in this case a deep [[sub-bass]] musical pattern which can be felt physically through powerful sound systems due to the low-range frequencies favoured. There has been considerable exploration of different [[timbre]]s in the bass line region, particularly within [[techstep]]. The bass lines most notably originate from [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] sources or [[synthesizer]]s. Bass lines performed with a bass instrument, whether it is electric, acoustic or a [[double bass]], are less common, but examples can be found in the work of artists such as [[Shapeshifter (band)|Shapeshifter]], [[Squarepusher]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Roni Size]] and [[STS9]].\n\n===Atmospheric elements===\nAtmospheric pads and samples may be added over the fundamental drum and bass to provide different feels.   These have included \"light\" elements such as ambient pads as found in ambient electronica and samples of jazz and world musics, or \"dark\" elements such as [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] pads and sci-fi samples to induce anxiety in the dancer.\n\n===Vocal and Melody elements===\nOld-school DnB usually included an MC providing vocals.   Some styles (such as jazz influenced DnB) also include melodic instruments soloing over the music.\n\n===Tempo===\nDrum and bass is usually between 160\u2013180 BPM, in contrast to other [[breakbeat]]-based dance styles such as [[nu skool breaks]], which maintain a slower pace at around 130\u2013140 BPM. A general upward trend in tempo has been observed during the evolution of drum and bass. The earliest forms of drum and bass clocked in at around 130 bpm in 1990/1991, speeding up to around 155\u2013165 BPM by 1993. Since around 1996, drum and bass tempos have predominantly stayed in the 170\u2013180 range. Recently, some producers have started to once again produce tracks with slower tempos (that is, in the 150-170 bpm range), but the mid-170s tempo is still a hallmark of the drum and bass sound.<ref name = \"Zinc\"/><ref name = \"Fabio3\"/>\n\nA track combining the same elements (broken beat, bass, production techniques) as a drum and bass track, but with a slower tempo (say 140 BPM), might not be drum and bass, but  instead may qualify as a drum and bass-influenced breakbeat track.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| title = Remix Mag Interview with Rob Playford, drum and bass pioneer at remixmag.com| accessdate = 5 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207105625/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| archivedate = 7 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Drop===\nMany mixing points begin or end with a \"[[drop (music)|drop]]\". The drop is the point in a track where a switch of rhythm or bassline occurs and usually follows a recognisable build section and [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]. Sometimes, the drop is used to switch between tracks, layering components of different tracks, as the two records may be simply ambient breakdowns at this point. Some DJs prefer to combine breakbeats, a more difficult exercise. Some drops are so popular that the DJ will \"rewind\" or \"reload\" or \"lift up\" the record by spinning it back and restarting it at the build. The drop is often a key point from the point of view of the dance floor, since the drum breaks often fade out to leave an ambient intro playing. When the beats re-commence they are often more complex and accompanied by a heavier bassline, encouraging the crowd to begin dancing.\n\n==Live performance==\n\n[[File:Pendulumsamuelnordstrom.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]] performing live in 2010]]\n\nDrum and bass exhibits a full frequency response which can sometimes only be fully appreciated on sound systems which can handle very low frequencies, including [[sub-bass]] frequencies that are often felt more than heard. As befits its name, the bass element of the music is particularly pronounced, with the comparatively sparse arrangements of drum and bass tracks allowing room for basslines that are deeper than most other forms of dance music. Consequently, drum and bass parties are often advertised as featuring uncommonly loud and bass-heavy sound systems.\n\nThere are however many albums specifically designed for personal listening. The DJ mix is a particularly popular form of release, with a popular DJ or producer mixing live, or on a computer, a variety of tracks for personal listening. Additionally, there are many albums containing unmixed tracks, suited for home or car listening.<ref>\"The Good Life, No Such Thing As Society\", ''The Independent'', 23 July 2003</ref>\n\n===DJ performance===\n\nAlthough this practice has declined in popularity,<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = When the drum and bass gradually fell into the orbit of techno, the MC \u2014 both as a samplesource taken from dancehall and rap records and as a live partner of the DJ in the club \u2014 began to disappear from the music.\n}}</ref> DJs are often accompanied by one or more [[Master of Ceremonies|MCs]], drawing on the genre's roots in [[hip hop]] and [[reggae]]/[[ragga]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD2OTWHppzs | title = Goldie in Shanghai on youtube.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nMCs do not generally receive the same level of recognition as producer/DJs, and some events are specifically marketed as being MC-free.

With the emergence of drum and bass into mainstream music markets, more albums, compilations and [[DJ mixes]] started to be sold on CDs. As digital music became more popular, websites focused on electronic music, such as [[Beatport]], began to sell drum and bass in digital format.\n\n====Distributors (wholesale)====\nThe bulk of drum and bass vinyl records and CDs are distributed globally and regionally by a relatively small number of companies such as SRD (Southern Record Distributors), ST Holdings, & Nu Urban Music Limited.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| title = Distribution feature at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070309024815/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| archive-date = 9 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nAs of 11 September 2012, Nu Urban ceased trading and RSM Tenon were instructed to assist in convening statutory meetings of members and creditors to appoint a liquidator.

There are strong scenes in other English-speaking countries including Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and New Zealand.<ref>\"Drum & Bass Keeps The Beat\", ''Boston Globe'', 6 February 2003.</ref>\n\n====Continental Europe====\nDnB is popular in continental [[Europe]]. The [[Czech Republic]] currently hosts the largest drum and bass festival in the world, LET IT ROLL, with an annual attendance of approximately 30,000. The genre is also encountered in [[Slovakia]], and local producers in both countries such as A-Cray, Rido, Forbidden Society, L Plus, B-Complex, Changing Faces, Lixx, Dephzac, and Gabanna are becoming well known worldwide. There are several other drum and bass festivals being held each year in these countries, including Trident Festival, Exploration Festival, or Hoofbeats Open Air in the summer, or one-night events such as LET IT ROLL Winter, Imagination Festival, and LET IT ROLL Winter [[Slovakia]] in the colder months. During club season, promoters race between each other to organise better events, often resulting in up to ten parties being held during one weekend, with no more than a two-hour travel between them.\n\nAustria has a large emerging DnB scene with many artists such as [[Camo & Krooked]], Mefjus, Fourward, Body & Soul, [[Ill.Skillz]] and mainly the Mainframe record label being all based in or around [[Vienna]]. Notable venues and events include \"The Hive\" and \"Beat It\" held at [[Flex (club)|Flex]] almost every Thursday and Saturday, \"Vollkontakt\" at Fluc, \"Switch\" at Flex, and the monthly Mainframe Recordings Label Night hosted at Arena by label head Disaszt.\n\nIn Ireland, the biggest scene by far is in Dublin, with a night every Sunday by the Initial Kru mostly showcasing local DJ's but occasionally bringing over international guests such as Spirit and Seba. Record label Boey Audio also run events showcasing local, national and international acts, as well as promoters such as S\u00f3l F\u00fad, Ragga Jungle Dublin and Springfield Crew Massive. There are much smaller regional scenes in areas such as Limerick, Cork and Galway which usually have monthly nights.\n\n====South America====\nBrazilian drum and bass is sometimes referred to as \"[[sambass]]\", with a specific [[samba]]-influenced style and sound made popular by artists like [[DJ Marky]] and [[Xerxes de Oliveira|XRS]].\n\nIn Venezuela and Mexico, artists have created their own forms of drum and bass, combining it with experimental musical forms.\n\nIn Colombia, there is a large underground scene. RE.set and Bogot\u00e1 Project are two collectives that organise drum and bass events in the city, as well as a bi-annual event called Radikal Styles that brings together local talent and international big names.\n\n====New Zealand====\nNew Zealand's drum and bass scene is increasing every day, most of the drum and bass made in New Zealand is directly derived from the \"[[UK]]\". Drum and bass is commonly played in house parties and festivals with New Zealand hosting some of the biggest drum and bass names during the festival season (November to April).\n\n===Media presence===\nToday, drum and bass is widely promoted using different methods such as [[video sharing service]]s like [[YouTube]] and [[Dailymotion]], [[blog]]s, [[radio]], and [[television]], the latter being the most uncommon method. More recently, music networking websites such as [[SoundCloud]] and [[Mixcloud]] have become powerful tools for artist recognition, providing a vast platform that enables quick responses to new tracks. Record labels have adopted the use of [[podcast]]s. Prior to the rise of the internet, drum and bass was commonly broadcast over [[pirate radio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|title=Pirate Radio Stations - A Brief Timeline of the UK scene|website=www.fantazia.org.uk|access-date=15 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006104728/http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|archive-date=6 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Radio====\nThe three highest-profile radio stations playing drum and bass shows are [[BBC Radio 1]] with The Drum and Bass Show - formerly with [[DJ Friction (UK)|Friction]], who was replaced with [[Ren\u00e9 LaVice]] in 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ukf.com/news/friction-announces-departure-from-radio-1-1xtra-rene-lavice-to-takeover-from-november/20518|title=Friction announces departure from Radio 1 & 1Xtra, Rene LaVice to takeover from November|website=www.ukf.com|access-date=8 January 2018|date=11 October 2017}}</ref> simulcast in the US and Canada on Sirius XM, and [[DJ Hype]] on [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]] in London.

Radio 1 also had a 'One in the Jungle' show.\n\nThe BBC's \"urban\" station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] used to feature the genre heavily, with DJ Bailey (show axed as of 29 August 2012) and Crissy Criss (show axed as of August 2014)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04f8m00|title=27/08/2014, D&B with Crissy Criss - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref> as its advocates. The network also organises a week-long tour of the UK each year called [[Xtra Bass]]. London pirate radio stations have been instrumental in the development of drum and bass, with stations such as [[Kool FM]] (which continues to broadcast today having done so since 1991), Origin FM, [[Don FM]] (the only drum and bass pirate to have gained a temporary legal licence), [http://www.renegaderadio.co.uk Renegade Radio 107.2FM], Rude FM, Wax FM and Eruption among the most influential.\n\nAs of 2014, despite higher profile stations such as 1Xtra scaling back their drum and bass specialist coverage, the genre has made its way into UK top 10 charts with drum and bass inspired tracks from artists such as Rudimental and Sigma. Earlier in August 2014, before Crissy Criss' show was axed, the BBC held a whole prime time evening event dedicated to showcasing drum and bass by allowing four major labels to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04dm0p1|title=D&B Soundclash Special, MistaJam - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs of November 2014, there have been 6 drum & bass songs reaching the no.1 spot on the UK's top 40 chart, since the genre was first being played on the radio, around 1993. The first of these was in 2012. The fact that all 6 of these songs have reached number 1 in only two years shows the increase in popularity and commercialisation of the genre in recent years. The artists that produced these songs are [[Sigma (group)|Sigma]], [[Rudimental]] and [[DJ Fresh]] (all have had two No.1 hits).\n\n=====Internet radio=====\nInternet radio stations, acting in the same light as pirate stations, have also been an instrumental part in promoting drum and bass music; the majority of them funded by listener and artist donations.\n\nDrum and bass was supported by [[Ministry of Sound]] radio from the early 2000s until 2014 and later featuring Tuesday shows from labels such as [[Metalheadz]], [[Fabio]] & [[Grooverider]], DJ Marky, Viper Recordings, [[Shogun Audio]] and [[Hospital Records]]. From September 2014, Ministry abruptly dropped all non-mainstream genres to focus on mainstream EDM, causing disappointment amongst the fans of the D&B community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kmag.co.uk/ministry-of-sound-radio-drops-drum-bass/|title=Ministry Of Sound Radio Drops Drum & Bass|last1=Steven|first1=Colin|date=26 September 2014|website=K Mag|access-date=}}</ref> The leading Drum & Bass radio Station is now Denver's [https://dnbradio.com DnB Radio], established in 2003 by M.

The rotating DJs include Kid Hops, whose shows are made up mostly of drum and bass. In Columbus, Ohio WCBE 90.5 has a two-hour electronic only showcase, \"All Mixed Up,\" Saturday nights at 10 pm.

Drum and bass has influenced many other genres like [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[big beat]], [[dubstep]], [[house music|house]], [[trip hop]], [[ambient music]], [[techno]], [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]]. Drum and bass is dominated by a relatively small group of record labels.

From as early as 1991, tracks were beginning to strip away some of the heavier sampling and \"hardcore noises\" and create more bassline and breakbeat led tracks. Some tracks increasingly took their influence from reggae and this style would become known as [[hardcore jungle]] (later to become simply [[Jungle (music)|jungle]]), whilst [[darkcore]] (with producers such as [[Goldie]], [[Doc Scott]], Jack Smooth, Foul Play, [[4hero]], and [[2 Bad Mice]]) were experimenting with sounds and creating a blueprint for drum and bass, especially noticeable by late 1993.\n\nBy 1994, [[Jungle (music)|jungle]] had begun to gain mainstream popularity, and fans of the music (often referred to as [[junglist]]s) became a more recognisable part of youth subculture. The genre further developed, incorporating and fusing elements from a wide range of existing musical genres, including the [[raggamuffin music|raggamuffin]] sound, [[dancehall]], [[Rapping|MC]] chants, dub basslines, and increasingly complex, heavily edited breakbeat percussion. Despite the affiliation with the [[MDMA|ecstasy]]-fuelled rave scene, jungle also inherited associations with violence and criminal activity, both from the gang culture that had affected the UK's hip-hop scene and as a consequence of jungle's often aggressive or menacing sound and themes of violence (usually reflected in the choice of samples). However, this developed in tandem with the often positive reputation of the music as part of the wider rave scene and dancehall-based Jamaican music culture prevalent in London. By 1995, whether as a reaction to, or independently of this cultural schism, some jungle producers began to move away from the ragga-influenced style and create what would become collectively labelled, for convenience, as drum and bass.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = So when I talk about the vibe disappearing from drum and bass, I'm talking about the blackness going as the ragga samples get phased out, the bass loses its reggae feels and becomes more linear and propulsive rather than moving around the beat with a syncopated relation with the drum.\n}}</ref>\n\nAs the genre became generally more polished and sophisticated technically, it began to expand its reach from pirate radio to commercial stations and gain widespread acceptance (circa 1995\u20131997). It also began to split into recognisable subgenres such as jump-up and [[Hardstep]]. As a lighter and often jazz-influenced style of drum and bass called \"intelligent drum and bass\" gained mainstream appeal, additional subgenres emerged including [[techstep]] (circa 1996\u20131997), which drew greater influence from [[techno]] music and the [[soundscape]]s of science fiction and [[anime]] films.\n\nThe popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other genres native to the UK, including [[big beat]] and [[hard house]]. Towards the turn of the millennium, however, its popularity was deemed to have dwindled, as the [[UK garage]] offshoot known as [[speed garage]] yielded several hit singles. Speed garage shared high tempos and heavy basslines with drum and bass, but otherwise followed the established conventions of \"house music\", with this and its freshness giving it an advantage commercially. di Vogli says, \"It is often forgotten by my students that a type of music called \"[[garage house]]\" existed in the late 1980s alongside [[hip house]], [[acid house]] and other forms of house music.\" He continues, \"This new garage of the mid-90s was not a form of house or a progression of garage house. The beats and tempo that define house are entirely different. This did cause further confusion in the presence of new house music of the mid-1990s being played alongside what was now being called garage.\"\n\nDespite this, the emergence of further subgenres and related styles such as [[liquid funk]] brought a wave of new artists incorporating new ideas and techniques, supporting continual evolution of the genre. To this day, drum and bass makes frequent appearances in mainstream media and popular culture including in [[television]], as well as being a major reference point for subsequent genres such as [[Grime (music)|grime]] and [[dubstep]],<ref name=\"Global Bass landscape\">[http://rhythmtravels.com/music/global-bass Global Bass on the music landscape]</ref> and producing successful artists including [[Chase & Status]], [[Netsky (musician)|Netsky]], [[Metrik]], and [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]].\n\n==Musical features==\nDrum and bass incorporates a number of scenes and styles, from the highly electronic, [[industrial music|industrial]] sounds of techstep to the use of conventional, acoustic instrumentation that characterize the more jazz-influenced end of the spectrum.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"SimonReynoldsOnTechstep\"/> The sounds of drum and bass are extremely varied due to the range of influences behind the music. Drum and bass could at one time be defined as a strictly electronic musical genre, with the only \"live\" element being the DJ's selection and mixing of records during a set. \"Live\" drum and bass using electric, electronic and acoustic instruments played by musicians on stage emerged over the ensuing years of the genre's development.<ref>New Dawn \u2013 City Clubs Take Back The Night article,

One of his more famous basslines (Reese \u2013 \"Just Want Another Chance\", Incognito Records, 1988) was indeed sampled on Renegade's ''Terrorist'' and countless others since, being known simply as the 'Reese' bassline.

A more recent commonly used break is the \"Tramen\", which combines the [[Amen break]], a [[James Brown]] funk breakbeat (\"[[Tighten Up (Archie Bell & the Drells song)|Tighten Up]]\" or \"Samurai\" break) and an [[Alex Reece]] drum and bass breakbeat.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| title = Dom & Roland interview by Ben Willmott at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110724011252/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1610&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| archivedate = 24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe relatively fast drum beat forms a canvas on which a producer can create tracks to appeal to almost any taste and often will form only a background to the other elements of the music. [[Syncopated]] breakbeats remain the most distinctive element as without these a high-tempo [[Time signature|4/4]] dance track could be classified as [[techno]] or [[gabber]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| title = Life in The Fast Lane: An Overview of Drum and Bass by George Broyer at drumbum.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807102130/http://store.drumbum.com/drums/drum-n-bass-drum-and-bass.htm| archive-date = 7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]] is another facet of production on which producers can spend a very large amount of time. The [[Amen break]] is generally acknowledged to have been the most-used (and often considered the most powerful) break in drum and bass.<ref name=\"Amen Break video on youtube.com\" />\n\n===Bass elements===\nThe genre places great importance on the [[bassline]], in this case a deep [[sub-bass]] musical pattern which can be felt physically through powerful sound systems due to the low-range frequencies favoured. There has been considerable exploration of different [[timbre]]s in the bass line region, particularly within [[techstep]]. The bass lines most notably originate from [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] sources or [[synthesizer]]s. Bass lines performed with a bass instrument, whether it is electric, acoustic or a [[double bass]], are less common, but examples can be found in the work of artists such as [[Shapeshifter (band)|Shapeshifter]], [[Squarepusher]], [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]], [[Roni Size]] and [[STS9]].\n\n===Atmospheric elements===\nAtmospheric pads and samples may be added over the fundamental drum and bass to provide different feels.   These have included \"light\" elements such as ambient pads as found in ambient electronica and samples of jazz and world musics, or \"dark\" elements such as [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] pads and sci-fi samples to induce anxiety in the dancer.\n\n===Vocal and Melody elements===\nOld-school DnB usually included an MC providing vocals.   Some styles (such as jazz influenced DnB) also include melodic instruments soloing over the music.\n\n===Tempo===\nDrum and bass is usually between 160\u2013180 BPM, in contrast to other [[breakbeat]]-based dance styles such as [[nu skool breaks]], which maintain a slower pace at around 130\u2013140 BPM. A general upward trend in tempo has been observed during the evolution of drum and bass. The earliest forms of drum and bass clocked in at around 130 bpm in 1990/1991, speeding up to around 155\u2013165 BPM by 1993. Since around 1996, drum and bass tempos have predominantly stayed in the 170\u2013180 range. Recently, some producers have started to once again produce tracks with slower tempos (that is, in the 150-170 bpm range), but the mid-170s tempo is still a hallmark of the drum and bass sound.<ref name = \"Zinc\"/><ref name = \"Fabio3\"/>\n\nA track combining the same elements (broken beat, bass, production techniques) as a drum and bass track, but with a slower tempo (say 140 BPM), might not be drum and bass, but  instead may qualify as a drum and bass-influenced breakbeat track.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| title = Remix Mag Interview with Rob Playford, drum and bass pioneer at remixmag.com| accessdate = 5 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207105625/http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_drumnbasspioneer_rob_playford/| archivedate = 7 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Drop===\nMany mixing points begin or end with a \"[[drop (music)|drop]]\". The drop is the point in a track where a switch of rhythm or bassline occurs and usually follows a recognisable build section and [[breakdown (music)|breakdown]]. Sometimes, the drop is used to switch between tracks, layering components of different tracks, as the two records may be simply ambient breakdowns at this point. Some DJs prefer to combine breakbeats, a more difficult exercise. Some drops are so popular that the DJ will \"rewind\" or \"reload\" or \"lift up\" the record by spinning it back and restarting it at the build. The drop is often a key point from the point of view of the dance floor, since the drum breaks often fade out to leave an ambient intro playing. When the beats re-commence they are often more complex and accompanied by a heavier bassline, encouraging the crowd to begin dancing.\n\n==Live performance==\n\n[[File:Pendulumsamuelnordstrom.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]] performing live in 2010]]\n\nDrum and bass exhibits a full frequency response which can sometimes only be fully appreciated on sound systems which can handle very low frequencies, including [[sub-bass]] frequencies that are often felt more than heard. As befits its name, the bass element of the music is particularly pronounced, with the comparatively sparse arrangements of drum and bass tracks allowing room for basslines that are deeper than most other forms of dance music. Consequently, drum and bass parties are often advertised as featuring uncommonly loud and bass-heavy sound systems.\n\nThere are however many albums specifically designed for personal listening. The DJ mix is a particularly popular form of release, with a popular DJ or producer mixing live, or on a computer, a variety of tracks for personal listening. Additionally, there are many albums containing unmixed tracks, suited for home or car listening.<ref>\"The Good Life, No Such Thing As Society\", ''The Independent'', 23 July 2003</ref>\n\n===DJ performance===\n\nAlthough this practice has declined in popularity,<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Reynolds\n|first = Simon\n|title = Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture\n|year = 2013\n|publisher = Soft Skull Press\n|quote = When the drum and bass gradually fell into the orbit of techno, the MC \u2014 both as a samplesource taken from dancehall and rap records and as a live partner of the DJ in the club \u2014 began to disappear from the music.\n}}</ref> DJs are often accompanied by one or more [[Master of Ceremonies|MCs]], drawing on the genre's roots in [[hip hop]] and [[reggae]]/[[ragga]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD2OTWHppzs | title = Goldie in Shanghai on youtube.com| accessdate = 6 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nMCs do not generally receive the same level of recognition as producer/DJs, and some events are specifically marketed as being MC-free.

With the emergence of drum and bass into mainstream music markets, more albums, compilations and [[DJ mixes]] started to be sold on CDs. As digital music became more popular, websites focused on electronic music, such as [[Beatport]], began to sell drum and bass in digital format.\n\n====Distributors (wholesale)====\nThe bulk of drum and bass vinyl records and CDs are distributed globally and regionally by a relatively small number of companies such as SRD (Southern Record Distributors), ST Holdings, & Nu Urban Music Limited.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| title = Distribution feature at knowledgemag.co.uk| accessdate = 6 September 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070309024815/http://www.knowledgemag.co.uk/features.asp?ReviewID=1574&PageNumber=1&SectionID=1031| archive-date = 9 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nAs of 11 September 2012, Nu Urban ceased trading and RSM Tenon were instructed to assist in convening statutory meetings of members and creditors to appoint a liquidator.

There are strong scenes in other English-speaking countries including Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and New Zealand.<ref>\"Drum & Bass Keeps The Beat\", ''Boston Globe'', 6 February 2003.</ref>\n\n====Continental Europe====\nDnB is popular in continental [[Europe]]. The [[Czech Republic]] currently hosts the largest drum and bass festival in the world, LET IT ROLL, with an annual attendance of approximately 30,000. The genre is also encountered in [[Slovakia]], and local producers in both countries such as A-Cray, Rido, Forbidden Society, L Plus, B-Complex, Changing Faces, Lixx, Dephzac, and Gabanna are becoming well known worldwide. There are several other drum and bass festivals being held each year in these countries, including Trident Festival, Exploration Festival, or Hoofbeats Open Air in the summer, or one-night events such as LET IT ROLL Winter, Imagination Festival, and LET IT ROLL Winter [[Slovakia]] in the colder months. During club season, promoters race between each other to organize better events, often resulting in up to ten parties being held during one weekend, with no more than a two-hour travel between them.\n\nAustria has a large emerging DnB scene with many artists such as [[Camo & Krooked]], Mefjus, Fourward, Body & Soul, [[Ill.Skillz]] and mainly the Mainframe record label being all based in or around [[Vienna]]. Notable venues and events include \"The Hive\" and \"Beat It\" held at [[Flex (club)|Flex]] almost every Thursday and Saturday, \"Vollkontakt\" at Fluc, \"Switch\" at Flex, and the monthly Mainframe Recordings Label Night hosted at Arena by label head Disaszt.\n\nIn Ireland, the biggest scene by far is in Dublin, with a night every Sunday by the Initial Kru mostly showcasing local DJ's but occasionally bringing over international guests such as Spirit and Seba. Record label Boey Audio also run events showcasing local, national and international acts, as well as promoters such as S\u00f3l F\u00fad, Ragga Jungle Dublin and Springfield Crew Massive. There are much smaller regional scenes in areas such as Limerick, Cork and Galway which usually have monthly nights.\n\n====South America====\nBrazilian drum and bass is sometimes referred to as \"[[sambass]]\", with a specific [[samba]]-influenced style and sound made popular by artists like [[DJ Marky]] and [[Xerxes de Oliveira|XRS]].\n\nIn Venezuela and Mexico, artists have created their own forms of drum and bass, combining it with experimental musical forms.\n\nIn Colombia, there is a large underground scene. RE.set and Bogot\u00e1 Project are two collectives that organize drum and bass events in the city, as well as a bi-annual event called Radikal Styles that brings together local talent and international big names.\n\n====New Zealand====\nNew Zealand's drum and bass scene is increasing every day, most of the drum and bass made in New Zealand is directly derived from the \"[[UK]]\". Drum and bass is commonly played in house parties and festivals with New Zealand hosting some of the biggest drum and bass names during the festival season (November to April).\n\n===Media presence===\nToday, drum and bass is widely promoted using different methods such as [[video sharing service]]s like [[YouTube]] and [[Dailymotion]], [[blog]]s, [[radio]], and [[television]], the latter being the most uncommon method. More recently, music networking websites such as [[SoundCloud]] and [[Mixcloud]] have become powerful tools for artist recognition, providing a vast platform that enables quick responses to new tracks. Record labels have adopted the use of [[podcast]]s. Prior to the rise of the internet, drum and bass was commonly broadcast over [[pirate radio]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|title=Pirate Radio Stations - A Brief Timeline of the UK scene|website=www.fantazia.org.uk|access-date=15 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006104728/http://www.fantazia.org.uk/radio/pirateradio_timeline.htm|archive-date=6 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Radio====\nThe three highest-profile radio stations playing drum and bass shows are [[BBC Radio 1]] with The Drum and Bass Show - formerly with [[DJ Friction (UK)|Friction]], who was replaced with [[Ren\u00e9 LaVice]] in 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ukf.com/news/friction-announces-departure-from-radio-1-1xtra-rene-lavice-to-takeover-from-november/20518|title=Friction announces departure from Radio 1 & 1Xtra, Rene LaVice to takeover from November|website=www.ukf.com|access-date=8 January 2018|date=11 October 2017}}</ref> simulcast in the US and Canada on Sirius XM, and [[DJ Hype]] on [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]] in London.

Radio 1 also had a 'One in the Jungle' show.\n\nThe BBC's \"urban\" station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] used to feature the genre heavily, with DJ Bailey (show axed as of 29 August 2012) and Crissy Criss (show axed as of August 2014)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04f8m00|title=27/08/2014, D&B with Crissy Criss - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref> as its advocates. The network also organizes a week-long tour of the UK each year called [[Xtra Bass]]. London pirate radio stations have been instrumental in the development of drum and bass, with stations such as [[Kool FM]] (which continues to broadcast today having done so since 1991), Origin FM, [[Don FM]] (the only drum and bass pirate to have gained a temporary legal license), [http://www.renegaderadio.co.uk Renegade Radio 107.2FM], Rude FM, Wax FM and Eruption among the most influential.\n\nAs of 2014, despite higher profile stations such as 1Xtra scaling back their drum and bass specialist coverage, the genre has made its way into UK top 10 charts with drum and bass inspired tracks from artists such as Rudimental and Sigma. Earlier in August 2014, before Crissy Criss' show was axed, the BBC held a whole prime time evening event dedicated to showcasing drum and bass by allowing four major labels to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04dm0p1|title=D&B Soundclash Special, MistaJam - BBC Radio 1Xtra|website=BBC|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs of November 2014, there have been 6 drum & bass songs reaching the no.1 spot on the UK's top 40 chart, since the genre was first being played on the radio, around 1993. The first of these was in 2012. The fact that all 6 of these songs have reached number 1 in only two years shows the increase in popularity and commercialisation of the genre in recent years. The artists that produced these songs are [[Sigma (group)|Sigma]], [[Rudimental]] and [[DJ Fresh]] (all have had two No.1 hits).\n\n=====Internet radio=====\nInternet radio stations, acting in the same light as pirate stations, have also been an instrumental part in promoting drum and bass music; the majority of them funded by listener and artist donations.\n\nDrum and bass was supported by [[Ministry of Sound]] radio from the early 2000s until 2014 and later featuring Tuesday shows from labels such as [[Metalheadz]], [[Fabio]] & [[Grooverider]], DJ Marky, Viper Recordings, [[Shogun Audio]] and [[Hospital Records]]. From September 2014, Ministry abruptly dropped all non-mainstream genres to focus on mainstream EDM, causing disappointment amongst the fans of the D&B community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kmag.co.uk/ministry-of-sound-radio-drops-drum-bass/|title=Ministry Of Sound Radio Drops Drum & Bass|last1=Steven|first1=Colin|date=26 September 2014|website=K Mag|access-date=}}</ref> The leading Drum & Bass radio Station is now Denver's [https://dnbradio.com DnB Radio], established in 2003 by M.

For these restaurants, the business was generally better than at their old premises, with restaurant owners noting increased takings, and their patrons were also satisfied with the new location. However, there was also much unhappiness among restaurant owners and customers over the inconvenience of the seafood centre.<ref name=\":4\"/> In 1990, renovations were carried out at the restaurants. That same year, all the restaurants at the centre were fined, while two, Golden Lagoon and Jumbo, were suspended for two weeks for violations of health regulations, such as poor hygiene practices. Nevertheless, business did not seem to be affected, with a ''Straits Times'' reporter noting that they still drew large crowds in the evening.<ref name=\":9\"/>\n\nThrough the rest of the 1980s and 1990s, the restaurants at the centre generally did well, and many tourists patronised them. However, by 2015, customer numbers had decreased considerably, with those at Red House Seafood falling by 35 percent in the previous two years. In March 2015, Red House Seafood closed, with a landscaped lawn taking its place, and with their leases having expired, two other restaurants, No Signboard Seafood and Fisherman's Village, also closed.<ref name=\":6\"/>\n\n===Marine Cove===\n[[File:Marine Cove, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|250px|right|{{Center|Marine Cove}}]]\nMarine Cove (formerly known as the East Coast Recreation Centre), is a building complex in Area&nbsp;C at East Coast Park where in the past, many [[caf\u00e9]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s were located. It also used to have a [[bowling alley]] and a [[billiards]] saloon.\n\nConstruction of the East Coast Recreation Centre began in April 1980, and it was completed in early 1982 at a cost of $3.5&nbsp;million.

Among the changes were the construction of a room and a building to house [[Sega]] gaming machines. With the renovation, all tenants but [[McDonalds]] moved out.<ref name=\":A\"/>\n\nThe location was sold to Rock Productions, [[New Creation Church]]'s business arm, in 2002, and it was subsequently renamed Marine Cove. With the land handed back to NParks in 2011, the area was closed for redevelopment the following year.<ref name=\":5\"/> The new Marine Cove featuring a greater variety of dining options and a {{cvt|3,500|m2}} children's playground at the redeveloped facility, reopened on 28&nbsp;June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marine Cove at East Coast Park to reopen end-June|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/marine-cove-at-east-coast/2900694.html}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|title = 2 new developments to offer visitors more recreational options at East Coast park|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/2-new-developments-to-offer-visitors-more-recreational-options-at-east-coast|website = The Straits Times|access-date = 13 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716011727/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/2-new-developments-to-offer-visitors-more-recreational-options-at-east-coast |archive-date=16 July 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Bedok Jetty===\n'''Bedok Jetty''' is the longest fishing jetty\u2014{{cvt|250|m}}\u2014in [[Singapore]].

He did this to facilitate the importation of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, it was in a poor state, with ''The Straits Times'' noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams. In March that year, the Public Works Department closed the jetty for a $1.1&nbsp;million facelift, consisting of repairs to the jetty's deck and supports.<ref>{{cite news |title=$1m facelift for Bedok's favourite fishing spot |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880223-1.2.24.17 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park, Singapore - 20101120.jpg|thumb|{{Center|View of Bedok Jetty}} {{Center|from East Coast Park}}]]\n\n===Siglap Canal===\nLocated near Area C4, a new lawn and lookout deck in the East Coast Park was opened to provide visitors with an additional area for recreational activities as well as a community space.

He did this to facilitate the importation of scrap metal from the Americans who were engaged in the Vietnam war at the time. It was built in the reclaimed land of East Coast under the East Coast reclamation. It was used by the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] in 1975 to receive the refugees after the surrender of Saigon to the North Vietnamese forces. An SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services to all Singapore bound refugee boats fleeing South Vietnam following the [[fall of Saigon]] in 1975.\n\nIn the 1980s, the jetty became popular among fishing enthusiasts. However, by 1988, it was in a poor state, with ''The Straits Times'' noting its corroded railings and cracked support beams. In March that year, the Public Works Department closed the jetty for a $1.1&nbsp;million facelift, consisting of repairs to the jetty's deck and supports.<ref>{{cite news |title=$1m facelift for Bedok's favourite fishing spot |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880223-1.2.24.17 |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=23 February 1988 |accessdate=12 November 2019 |via=NewspaperSG |page=10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View of Bedok Jetty from East Coast Park, Singapore - 20101120.jpg|thumb|{{Center|View of Bedok Jetty}} {{Center|from East Coast Park}}]]\n\n===Siglap Canal===\nLocated near Area C4, a new lawn and lookout deck in the East Coast Park was opened to provide visitors with an additional area for recreational activities as well as a community space. The enhancements were carried out with drainage upgrading for a {{cvt|230|m}} section of the Siglap Canal to the sea.\n\n===Parkland Green===\nParkland Green is a {{convert|4|ha|acres|abbr=on}} cluster of restaurants, cafes and shops next to Carpark C1. \n\nParkland Green opened to much fanfare in September 2014, and in its first few months of operation, experienced high footfall, especially on weekends. However, with the imposition of parking fees for its carpark and the opening of Marine Cove in June 2016, customer numbers and revenues decreased sharply in the second half of 2016.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news |last=Singh |first=Bryna |date=11 December 2016 |title=Where are the crowds? |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/where-are-the-crowds |work=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |accessdate=8 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808142457/https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/where-are-the-crowds |archive-date=8 August 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe park is accessible by East Coast Park Service Road with numerous exits along the [[East Coast Parkway]]. The place provides ample parking space with many carparks situated along with various areas of the park.

[[Underpass]]es link the park to the nearby [[Marine Parade]] housing estate.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe park is also connected to other parks in Singapore through the Park Connector Network, being part of the Eastern Coastal Park Connector Network.

{"title_page": "Margaret Elizabeth Egan", "text_new": "{{short description|American librarian}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2016}}\n\n'''Margaret Elizabeth Egan''' (March 14, 1905 \u2013 January 26, 1959) was an American librarian and communication scholar who is best known for \u201cFoundations of a Theory in Bibliography,\u201d published in ''Library Quarterly'' in 1952 and co-authored with [[Jesse Shera|Jesse Hauk Shera]]. This article marked the first appearance of the term \"[[social epistemology]]\" in connection with library science.\n\n==Biography==\nMargaret Egan was born in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], in 1905. She obtained a B.A. at the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1939 and completed graduate work at both [[Yale University]] (1940\u201341) and the [[University of Chicago]] (1941\u201343). She worked at the [[Cincinnati Public Library]] from 1933 to 1940; in 1943 Egan joined the Industrial Relations Center of the [[University of Chicago]] as librarian and began teaching in the [[Graduate Library School]] (GLS). She was appointed as an assistant professor in the GLS in 1946 and was an associate editor of ''Library Quarterly'' from 1952 to 1955. She left Chicago in 1955 and joined [[Jesse Shera]] at the [[School of Library Science]] at [[Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], where she first served as a research associate at the newly formed Center for Documentation and Communication Research. In 1956 she was appointed as an associate professor.\n\nEgan died of a heart attack in 1959 at the age of 53.\n\n==Social Epistemology==\n[[Social epistemology]], \u201cthe production, distribution, and utilization of intellectual products\u201d (Egan and Shera 1952), correlates the production and consumption of information to that of material goods. Shera later wrote that social [[epistemology]] \u201cis the study of knowledge in society,\u201d distinct from previous investigations of individual knowledge.\n\nFurner (2004) lists the following contributions made in \u201cFoundations of a Theory of Bibliography\u201d:\n* Establishing \u201cinformed social action\u201d as the goal of library service.\n* Establishing the extent to which librarianship contributes to attaining this goal as \u201cthe primary criterion by which [bibliographic services] may be evaluated.\u201d\n* Providing \u201ca theoretical framework \u2026 for the study of [[information-seeking]] behavior, knowledge organization, and bibliometrics,\u201d which is then treated as \u201ca theoretical foundation for library and information science.\u201d\n* Using the term \u201c[[social epistemology]]\u201d in this context for the first time.\n\n==Errors of Attribution==\nAlthough Egan was the first author on \u201cFoundations of a Theory of Bibliography,\u201d her untimely death (and Shera\u2019s prolific publishing that followed) have led to frequent omissions of her name when citing the work. In 1978, Shera wrote that \"both the term and the concept [of social epistemology] were hers, but because I have given it wide currency, despite frequent disclaimers, it has generally been attributed to me.\u201d<ref>J.H. Shera, \"Egan, Margaret Elizabeth (1905\u20131959)\", in B. S.

This article marked the first appearance of the term \"[[social epistemology]]\" in connection with library science.\n\n==Biography==\nMargaret Egan was born in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], in 1905. She obtained a B.A. at the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1939 and completed graduate work at both [[Yale University]] (1940\u201341) and the [[University of Chicago]] (1941\u201343). She worked at the [[Cincinnati Public Library]] from 1933 to 1940; in 1943 Egan joined the Industrial Relations Center of the [[University of Chicago]] as librarian and began teaching in the [[Graduate Library School]] (GLS). She was appointed as an assistant professor in the GLS in 1946 and was an associate editor of ''Library Quarterly'' from 1952 to 1955. She left Chicago in 1955 and joined [[Jesse Shera]] at the [[School of Library Science]] at [[Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], where she first served as a research associate at the newly formed Center for Documentation and Communication Research. In 1956 she was appointed as an associate professor.\n\nEgan died of a heart attack in 1959 at the age of 53.\n\n==Social Epistemology==\n[[Social epistemology]], \u201cthe production, distribution, and utilization of intellectual products\u201d (Egan and Shera 1952), correlates the production and consumption of information to that of material goods. Shera later wrote that social [[epistemology]] \u201cis the study of knowledge in society,\u201d distinct from previous investigations of individual knowledge.\n\nFurner (2004) lists the following contributions made in \u201cFoundations of a Theory of Bibliography\u201d:\n* Establishing \u201cinformed social action\u201d as the goal of library service.\n* Establishing the extent to which librarianship contributes to attaining this goal as \u201cthe primary criterion by which [bibliographic services] may be evaluated.\u201d\n* Providing \u201ca theoretical framework \u2026 for the study of [[information-seeking]] behavior, knowledge organization, and bibliometrics,\u201d which is then treated as \u201ca theoretical foundation for library and information science.\u201d\n* Using the term \u201c[[social epistemology]]\u201d in this context for the first time.\n\n==Errors of Attribution==\nAlthough Egan was the first author on \u201cFoundations of a Theory of Bibliography,\u201d her untimely death (and Shera\u2019s prolific publishing that followed) have led to frequent omissions of her name when citing the work. In 1978, Shera wrote that \"both the term and the concept [of social epistemology] were hers, but because I have given it wide currency, despite frequent disclaimers, it has generally been attributed to me.\u201d<ref>J.H.
