The mission of the Chi Psi Fraternity is to create and maintain an enduring society which encourages the sharing of traditions and values, respect for oneself and others, and responsibility to the university and community.\n\nChi Psi was founded on Thursday May 20, 1841, by 10 students at [[Union College]] in [[Schenectady, New York]] with the idea of emphasizing the fraternal and social principles of a brotherhood. It was the first Greek-letter organization to be founded on these grounds, rather than the literary characteristics of the seven then-existing societies. In 1846, Chi Psi was the first fraternity in the nation to establish a [[North American fraternity and sorority housing|fraternity house]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chipsi.org/?page=AboutChiPsi|title=About Chi Psi - Chi Psi Fraternity|website=www.chipsi.org|access-date=2018-01-10}}</ref> The first fraternity house was located at the [[University of Michigan]]. Thanks to the building's resemblance to a [[hunting lodge]], Chi Psi now refers to all its houses as Lodges.<ref>''The Chi Psi Story'', p. 70</ref>\n\nChi Psi's official colors are Royal Purple and Gold. Chi Psi's national headquarters, the Central Office, is in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\n==History==\nChi Psi was founded on Thursday May 20, 1841, by 10 students at [[Union College]] with the idea of emphasizing the fraternal and social principles of a brotherhood. The 10 founding members were: [[Philip Spencer]] (later hanged on charges of mutiny aboard the [[brig]] [[USS Somers (1842)|USS ''Somers'']]), Robert Heyward McFaddin (1822\u20131858) of Greensboro, Alabama, Jacob Henry Farrell, John Brush Jr., Samuel Titus Taber, James Lafayette Witherspoon (cousin of McFaddin), William Force Terhune, Alexander Peter Berthoud, [[James Chatham Duane]], and Patrick Upshaw Major.\n\n==Values and the Chi Psi Gentleman==\nChi Psi is founded upon the fraternal aspects of brotherhood and embraces a number of values in its pursuit to establish this brotherhood. These values were first adopted at its founding in 1841, and later, a restatement of principles was given at the 122nd National Convention in 1963.

The mission of the Chi Psi Fraternity is to create and maintain an enduring society which encourages the sharing of traditions and values, respect for oneself and others, and responsibility to the university and community.\n\nChi Psi was founded on Thursday May 20, 1841, by 10 students at [[Union College]] in [[Schenectady, New York]] with the idea of emphasizing the fraternal and social principles of a brotherhood. It was the first Greek-letter organization to be founded on these grounds, rather than the literary characteristics of the seven then-existing societies. In 1846, Chi Psi was the first fraternity in the nation to establish a [[North American fraternity and sorority housing|fraternity house]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chipsi.org/?page=AboutChiPsi|title=About Chi Psi - Chi Psi Fraternity|website=www.chipsi.org|access-date=2018-01-10}}</ref> The first fraternity house was located at the [[University of Michigan]]. Thanks to the building's resemblance to a [[hunting lodge]], Chi Psi now refers to all its houses as Lodges.<ref>''The Chi Psi Story'', p. 70</ref>\n\nChi Psi's official colors are Royal Purple and Gold. Chi Psi's national headquarters, the Central Office, is in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\n==History==\nChi Psi was founded on Thursday May 20, 1841, by 10 students at [[Union College]] with the idea of emphasizing the fraternal and social principles of a brotherhood. The 10 founding members were: [[Philip Spencer]] (later hanged on charges of mutiny aboard the [[brig]] [[USS Somers (1842)|USS ''Somers'']]), Robert Heyward McFaddin (1822\u20131858) of Greensboro, Alabama, Jacob Henry Farrell, John Brush Jr., Samuel Titus Taber, James Lafayette Witherspoon (cousin of McFaddin), William Force Terhune, Alexander Peter Berthoud, [[James Chatham Duane]], and Patrick Upshaw Major.\n\n==Values and the Chi Psi Gentleman==\nChi Psi is founded upon the fraternal aspects of brotherhood and embraces a number of values in its pursuit to establish this brotherhood. These values were first adopted at its founding in 1841, and later, a restatement of principles was given at the 122nd National Convention in 1963. Some of these values are as follows: Chi Psi is defined by the values which are collectively accepted by its members. The extent to which these values are practiced is the measure of our fraternity; Chi Psi is committed to the growth of the individual in a social environment which nurtures integrity, dignity, and maturity while enjoying shared experiences and college sociability; and Chi Psi recognizing that academic achievement is fundamental to the development of the individual, stands for intellectual growth and the attainment of human potential.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chipsi.org/?page=Governance_Council|title=Governance - Executive Council - Chi Psi Fraternity|author=|date=|website=www.chipsi.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nChi Psi also embraces the idea of being a true gentleman, by following the definition of a gentleman as put forward by John Walter Wayland's \"The True Gentleman\":\n\n{{cquote\n|The True Gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from goodwill and an acute sense of propriety and whose self-control is equal to all emergencies; who does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity, or any man of his inferiority or deformity; who is himself humbled if necessity compels him to humble another; who does not flatter wealth, cringe before power, or boast of his own possessions or achievements; who speaks with frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy; whose deed follows his word; who thinks of the rights and feelings of others rather than his own; and who appears well in any company; a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe.<ref>''The Chi Psi Story'', p. 19</ref>}}\n\n===Program for Excellence===\nIn pursuit of the values the fraternity put forth and in order to make up for a lack of leadership opportunities available on college campuses, the Chi Psi Educational Trust has funded the Program for Excellence.

Lowe, in late 1858 a group of students met in Lowe's room in the Dowdell boarding house to discuss means to regain control of the Neotrophian Society and return control to the students at large. The underlying controversy was that the Neotrophian Society, in the opinion of the eight men who formed Delta Tau Delta, had awarded a literary prize after a rigged vote.<ref>[http://www.pitt.edu/~delts/about.html University of Pittsburgh Delta Tau Delta website]</ref> A constitution, name, badge, ritual and motto were devised, and Delta Tau Delta was born.<ref>[http://www.albion.edu/delts/history.asp Albion College Delta Tau Delta website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202075720/http://albion.edu/delts/history.asp |date=2009-02-02 }}</ref>\n\nMember Henry King Bell of Lexington, Kentucky, heard of the Civil War's effects on Bethany College and the membership of Delta Tau Delta.  After riding to Bethany and realizing that the longevity of Delta Tau Delta was at risk, Bell traveled to Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. On February 22, 1861, Bell rode to Jefferson College (would later merge with Washington Academy to become the present day [[Washington & Jefferson College]]) from Bethany to bring the designation of the Alpha Chapter and the governance of the Fraternity back to his home campus.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}. In response to Jefferson College merging with the Washington Academy, an election was held at the General Convention (later to be renamed the Karnea). Ohio Wesleyan then assumed the Alpha designation. Before the Alpha designation was finally transferred to [[Allegheny College]] (its current location), the Ohio Wesleyan chapter dissolved temporarily because of a lack of membership.\n[[File:Delta Tau Delta-Cincinnati.jpg|thumb|Delta Tau Delta Fraternity House at [[University of Cincinnati]]]]\n\nAfter the Ohio Wesleyan chapter disappeared in 1875, the Allegheny College chapter, the fourth and final chapter to hold Alpha designation, assumed control of the fraternity. Allegheny College member James S. Eaton, traveled to Delaware, Ohio, to collect what remained of the organization's records and to investigate what had happened the Ohio Wesleyan chapter which returned in 1890. Eaton brought the \"Alpha\" designation back with him to Allegheny College, where a group of undergraduates managed the larger organization as well as their own chapter. During that time a magazine was established and 15 chapters were founded, of which eight survive (several others were reestablished later).\n\nIn 1886, Delta Tau Delta merged with the secret society known as the [[Rainbow Fraternity]], a southern fraternity founded in 1848 at the [[University of Mississippi]].<ref>{{cite news |work=The News York Times |title=Two Secret Societies United: Delta Tau Delta and the Rainbow Society Join Hands |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/03/28/102965283.pdf |date=1885-03-28 | format=PDF}}</ref> As an ode to the merged fraternity, Delta Tau Delta Chapters perform a public ceremony, the Rite of Iris.

Lowe, in late 1858 a group of students met in Lowe's room in the Dowdell boarding house to discuss means to regain control of the Neotrophian Society and return control to the students at large. The underlying controversy was that the Neotrophian Society, in the opinion of the eight men who formed Delta Tau Delta, had awarded a literary prize after a rigged vote.<ref>[http://www.pitt.edu/~delts/about.html University of Pittsburgh Delta Tau Delta website]</ref> A constitution, name, badge, ritual and motto were devised, and Delta Tau Delta was born.<ref>[http://www.albion.edu/delts/history.asp Albion College Delta Tau Delta website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202075720/http://albion.edu/delts/history.asp |date=2009-02-02 }}</ref>\n\nMember Henry King Bell of Lexington, Kentucky, heard of the Civil War's effects on Bethany College and the membership of Delta Tau Delta.  After riding to Bethany and realizing that the longevity of Delta Tau Delta was at risk, Bell traveled to Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. On February 22, 1861, Bell rode to Jefferson College (would later merge with Washington Academy to become the present day [[Washington & Jefferson College]]) from Bethany to bring the designation of the Alpha Chapter and the governance of the Fraternity back to his home campus.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}. In response to Jefferson College merging with the Washington Academy, an election was held at the General Convention (later to be renamed the Karnea). Ohio Wesleyan then assumed the Alpha designation. Before the Alpha designation was finally transferred to [[Allegheny College]] (its current location), the Ohio Wesleyan chapter dissolved temporarily because of a lack of membership.\n[[File:Delta Tau Delta-Cincinnati.jpg|thumb|Delta Tau Delta Fraternity House at [[University of Cincinnati]]]]\n\nAfter the Ohio Wesleyan chapter disappeared in 1875, the Allegheny College chapter, the fourth and final chapter to hold Alpha designation, assumed control of the fraternity. Allegheny College member James S. Eaton, traveled to Delaware, Ohio, to collect what remained of the organization's records and to investigate what had happened the Ohio Wesleyan chapter which returned in 1890. Eaton brought the \"Alpha\" designation back with him to Allegheny College, where a group of undergraduates managed the larger organization as well as their own chapter. During that time a magazine was established and 15 chapters were founded, of which eight survive (several others were reestablished later).\n\nIn 1886, Delta Tau Delta merged with the secret society known as the [[Rainbow Fraternity]], a southern fraternity founded in 1848 at the [[University of Mississippi]].<ref>{{cite news |work=The News York Times |title=Two Secret Societies United: Delta Tau Delta and the Rainbow Society Join Hands |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/03/28/102965283.pdf |date=1885-03-28 | format=PDF}}</ref> As an ode to the merged fraternity, Delta Tau Delta Chapters perform a public ceremony, the Rite of Iris.

On April 30, 1922, Delta Chi became a general membership social fraternity, eliminating the requirement for men to be studying law, and opening membership to all areas of study. Delta Chi became one of the first international fraternities to abolish \"hell week\", when it did so on April 22, 1929. Delta Chi is a charter member of the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deltachi.org/history/|title=Our History \u2013 The Delta Chi Fraternity|website=deltachi.org}}</ref> As of Fall 2019, Delta Chi has initiated over 116,000 members at over 110 Chapters and Colonies, with 34 Alumni Chapters. Its headquarters is in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana.<ref name=\"deltachi.org\"/>\n\n==History of Delta Chi==\n\n===Founding===\n\nAccording to Frederick Moore Whitney, there were two or three groups working on the idea of a new law fraternity during the spring of 1889. After the class election, there were meetings held in Myron Mckee Crandall's apartment as well as in Monroe Marsh Sweetland's law office. It is not clear how these two groups came together, though there seem to have been some individuals who had attended both groups.\n\nOver the summer of 1890, many of the details of the organization were worked out by Myron Mckee Crandall, who had stayed in Ithaca until after school opened. In regard to the adoption of the constitution, Albert Sullard Barnes wrote the following in his 1907 ''Quarterly'' article:\n\n''\"As I recall it, after refreshing my recollection from the original minutes now in my possession, on the evening of October 13, 1890, six students in the Law School, Brothers John M. Gorham, Thomas J. Sullivan, F.K. Stephens, A.D. Stillman and the writer, together with Myron Crandall and O.L. Potter, graduate students, and Monroe Sweetland, a former Student in the Law School, met in a brother's room and adopted the constitution and by-laws, and organized the Delta Chi Fraternity.\"''\n\nThe minutes from that meeting state, \"Charter granted to Cornell Chapter,\" indicating from the beginning the intent to start a national fraternity.\n\n===Delta Chi goes single membership===\n\nIn 1909 in Ithaca, New York, the 15th Convention of Delta Chi adopted an amendment to the Constitution prohibiting dual-membership (i.e. initiating members of other fraternities, and prohibiting Delta Chi members from joining other fraternities). As a professional law fraternity, Delta Chi had originally allowed members from other general fraternities to join. The change in policy led to the loss of chapters in New York Law, West Virginia, Northwestern and Washington University in St. Louis.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://deltachi.org/delta-chi-history/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813124535/http://deltachi.org/delta-chi-history/ |archive-date=August 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Delta Chi becomes a general fraternity===\n\nDuring [[World War I]], a majority of the members of the active chapters dropping their college courses and enlisting in the armed forces. Chapter houses became almost deserted, and a convention in August 1917 was skipped. At the end of the war, members returned to the universities to complete their courses. The chapter finances were generally in bad condition as were the houses. Attempting to rebuild, many chapters stretched the recruiting restrictions by initiating men who had no intention of studying law.\n\nStarting in 1919 in Minneapolis at the 20th Convention, the issue of becoming a general fraternity was debated. In 1921 in [[Columbus, Ohio]] at the 21st Convention, two amendments were proposed, for and against general membership respectively. For three days votes were held, until (on a swing vote by the Buffalo Alumni Chapter representative), the Wadsworth amendment was adopted. Ratified in 1922, the amendment made Delta Chi a general fraternity, no longer requiring its members to be law students at their respective universities and colleges.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Founding fathers==\n[[File:Founders of Delta Chi.jpeg|thumb|The founders of the Delta Chi Fraternity]]\n*Albert Sullard Barnes\n*Myron McKee Crandall\n*John Milton Gorham, (First \"BB\")\n*Peter Schermerhorn Johnson\n*Edward Richard O'Malley\n*Owen Lincoln Potter, (First \"AA\")\n*Alphonso Derwin Stillman\n*Thomas Allen Joseph Sullivan\n*Monroe Marsh Sweetland\n*Thomas David Watkins\n*Frederick Moore Whitney\n\n==Philanthropy==\nIn 2006, the fraternity named the [[V Foundation]] as its official philanthropic organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimmyv.org/partners/delta-chi/|title=Delta Chi \u2022 V Foundation|publisher=}}</ref> Since then, Delta Chi has raised over one million dollars for the V foundation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jimmyv.org/partners/delta-chi/|title=Delta Chi \u2022 V Foundation|work=V Foundation|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Organization of the fraternity==\n\n===Undergraduate officer positions===\nDelta Chi chapters and colonies have six permanent officer positions.

On April 30, 1922, Delta Chi became a general membership social fraternity, eliminating the requirement for men to be studying law, and opening membership to all areas of study. Delta Chi became one of the first international fraternities to abolish \"hell week\", when it did so on April 22, 1929. Delta Chi is a charter member of the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deltachi.org/history/|title=Our History \u2013 The Delta Chi Fraternity|website=deltachi.org}}</ref> As of Fall 2019, Delta Chi has initiated over 116,000 members at over 110 Chapters and Colonies, with 34 Alumni Chapters. Its headquarters is in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana.<ref name=\"deltachi.org\"/>\n\n==History of Delta Chi==\n\n===Founding===\n\nAccording to Frederick Moore Whitney, there were two or three groups working on the idea of a new law fraternity during the spring of 1889. After the class election, there were meetings held in Myron Mckee Crandall's apartment as well as in Monroe Marsh Sweetland's law office. It is not clear how these two groups came together, though there seem to have been some individuals who had attended both groups.\n\nOver the summer of 1890, many of the details of the organization were worked out by Myron Mckee Crandall, who had stayed in Ithaca until after school opened. In regard to the adoption of the constitution, Albert Sullard Barnes wrote the following in his 1907 ''Quarterly'' article:\n\n''\"As I recall it, after refreshing my recollection from the original minutes now in my possession, on the evening of October 13, 1890, six students in the Law School, Brothers John M. Gorham, Thomas J. Sullivan, F.K. Stephens, A.D. Stillman and the writer, together with Myron Crandall and O.L. Potter, graduate students, and Monroe Sweetland, a former Student in the Law School, met in a brother's room and adopted the constitution and by-laws, and organized the Delta Chi Fraternity.\"''\n\nThe minutes from that meeting state, \"Charter granted to Cornell Chapter,\" indicating from the beginning the intent to start a national fraternity.\n\n===Delta Chi goes single membership===\n\nIn 1909 in Ithaca, New York, the 15th Convention of Delta Chi adopted an amendment to the Constitution prohibiting dual-membership (i.e. initiating members of other fraternities, and prohibiting Delta Chi members from joining other fraternities). As a professional law fraternity, Delta Chi had originally allowed members from other general fraternities to join. The change in policy led to the loss of chapters in New York Law, West Virginia, Northwestern and Washington University in St. Louis.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://deltachi.org/delta-chi-history/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813124535/http://deltachi.org/delta-chi-history/ |archive-date=August 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Delta Chi becomes a general fraternity===\n\nDuring [[World War I]], a majority of the members of the active chapters dropping their college courses and enlisting in the armed forces. Chapter houses became almost deserted, and a convention in August 1917 was skipped. At the end of the war, members returned to the universities to complete their courses. The chapter finances were generally in bad condition as were the houses. Attempting to rebuild, many chapters stretched the recruiting restrictions by initiating men who had no intention of studying law.\n\nStarting in 1919 in Minneapolis at the 20th Convention, the issue of becoming a general fraternity was debated. In 1921 in [[Columbus, Ohio]] at the 21st Convention, two amendments were proposed, for and against general membership respectively. For three days votes were held, until (on a swing vote by the Buffalo Alumni Chapter representative), the Wadsworth amendment was adopted. Ratified in 1922, the amendment made Delta Chi a general fraternity, no longer requiring its members to be law students at their respective universities and colleges.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Founding fathers==\n[[File:Founders of Delta Chi.jpeg|thumb|The founders of the Delta Chi Fraternity]]\n*Albert Sullard Barnes\n*Myron McKee Crandall\n*John Milton Gorham, (First \"BB\")\n*Peter Schermerhorn Johnson\n*Edward Richard O'Malley\n*Owen Lincoln Potter, (First \"AA\")\n*Alphonso Derwin Stillman\n*Thomas Allen Joseph Sullivan\n*Monroe Marsh Sweetland\n*Thomas David Watkins\n*Frederick Moore Whitney\n\n==Philanthropy==\nIn 2006, the fraternity named the [[V Foundation]] as its official philanthropic organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimmyv.org/partners/delta-chi/|title=Delta Chi \u2022 V Foundation|publisher=}}</ref> Since then, Delta Chi has raised over one million dollars for the V foundation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jimmyv.org/partners/delta-chi/|title=Delta Chi \u2022 V Foundation|work=V Foundation|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Organization of the fraternity==\n\n===Undergraduate officer positions===\nDelta Chi chapters and colonies have six permanent officer positions.

('''\u03a3\u0392\u03a1''', also '''SigRho''') is a national, collegiate, multicultural, [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|Greek-lettered fraternity]]. Sigma Beta Rho was founded on August 16, 1996, at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]].\n\n==Organization==\n\nThe '''National Executive Board''' (NEB) is the governing body of Sigma Beta Rho, and presides over the nationwide fraternity, which is divided into eight interim regions. Each region is appointed a Regional Governor (RG) by the NEB, who acts as the envoy to his respective region on the behalf of the NEB. Under each RG, there is also a Regional Advisory Committee (RAC).\n\nThe fraternity\u2019s national philanthropic focus is on its partnership with [[SOS Children's Villages]].<ref name=SigRhoserv>{{Cite web |url=http://society.sigrho.com/home/ |title=Sigma Beta Rho Community Channel |publisher=Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity |accessdate=2010-06-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127092149/http://society.sigrho.com/home/# |archive-date=2010-01-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Sigma Beta Rho is currently working on establishing an internet-based newsletter, the Seven Star Journal.<ref name=sevstar>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sevenstarjournal.com/ |title=Seven Star Journal |publisher=Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity |accessdate=2010-06-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901040049/http://sevenstarjournal.com/ |archivedate=September 1, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nSigma Beta Rho is a charter member of the National APIDA Panhellenic Association (NAPA).

Sigma Beta Rho\u2019s pronouncement, however, occurred upon the establishment of its Beta chapter at Binghamton University on August 22, 1998. That same year the fraternity incorporated under the State Department of New York. Since 1998, Sigma Beta Rho has expanded to over 60 chapters and colonies in the United States, and has a total membership of over 3500 brothers.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Diversification===\n\nIn its first few years of existence, Sigma Beta Rho changed its focus from a South-Asian interest fraternity to one with a multicultural mission. The fraternity's mission advocates the idea that the United States is a [[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|cultural salad bowl]], and that members should actively embrace both their own cultural heritage, as well as a work towards a better understanding of the greater community.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Entities==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" border=\"1\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|+ '''Entities of Sigma Beta Rho'''<ref name=SigRhoEntities>{{Cite web |url=http://sigrho.com/chapters/ |title=Chapters - Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity |publisher=Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref>\n|-\n!

They were Brother Cesidio A. Guarini, Brother Ferdinand F. DiBartolo, Brother Anthony T. Frascati, Brother Nicholas Frunzi, Brother Otto Gelormini, Brother Dominic T. Ciolli, and Brother Joseph Cangiamila.\n\nSoon after its founding, Alpha Phi Delta spread from Syracuse and became a national fraternity. Alpha Phi Delta is traditionally an Italian-American heritage fraternity; however, since September 2, 1965, it has welcomed young men of all racial backgrounds.\n\n==Founding==\nAfter the creation of the Alpha Chapter at Syracuse University, Nicholas Frunzi transferred to Columbia University in 1916. He became friends with the brothers of a fraternity that had similar values as Alpha Phi Delta, Sigma Gamma Phi. After convincing the founding fathers of Sigma Gamma Phi to merge, Columbia University became the Beta Chapter of Alpha Phi Delta, hence becoming a national fraternity.

They were Brother Cesidio A. Guarini, Brother Ferdinand F. DiBartolo, Brother Anthony T. Frascati, Brother Nicholas Frunzi, Brother Otto Gelormini, Brother Dominic T. Ciolli, and Brother Joseph Cangiamila.\n\nSoon after its founding, Alpha Phi Delta spread from Syracuse and became a national fraternity. Alpha Phi Delta is traditionally an Italian-American heritage fraternity; however, since September 2, 1965, it has welcomed young men of all racial backgrounds.\n\n==Founding==\nAfter the creation of the Alpha Chapter at Syracuse University, Nicholas Frunzi transferred to Columbia University in 1916. He became friends with the brothers of a fraternity that had similar values as Alpha Phi Delta, Sigma Gamma Phi. After convincing the founding fathers of Sigma Gamma Phi to merge, Columbia University became the Beta Chapter of Alpha Phi Delta, hence becoming a national fraternity. As time passed the fraternity grew bigger. Unfortunately, a lot of chapters have been shut down due to inactivity. So far the fraternity has around +40 collegiate chapters. In 2015, the fraternity reached 20,000 lifelong members.<ref>[http://www.apd.org/about/about.php Alpha Phi Delta - Fraternity<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927105835/http://www.apd.org/about/about.php |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref>\n\n==Active Chapters and Colonies==\n*Mu: [[Cornell University]]\n*Chi: [[Pennsylvania State University]]\n*Psi: [[Duquesne University]]\n*Beta Beta: [[Manhattan College]]\n*Theta Beta: [[New York University]]\n*Beta Eta: [[Brooklyn College]]\n*Beta Theta: [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]]\n*Beta Iota: [[Utica College]]\n*Beta Lambda: [[St. Francis University]]\n*Beta Xi: [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]]\n*Beta Omicron: [[Youngstown State University]]\n*Beta Pi: [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University (Queens Campus)]]\n*Beta Rho: [[Gannon University]]\n*Beta Sigma: [[St. Francis College]]\n*Beta Phi: [[Rowan University]]\n*\n*Gamma Iota: [[Pace University |Pace University (Pleasantville Campus)]]\n*Gamma Kappa: [[College of Staten Island]]\n*Gamma Mu: [[The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey]]\n*Gamma Nu: [[William Paterson University]] Permanently Barred since March 2018 \n*Gamma Xi: [[Southern Connecticut State University]]\n*Gamma Omicron: [[State University of New York Stony Brook|S.U.N.Y at Stony Brook]]\n*Gamma Pi: [[Ramapo College|Ramapo College of New Jersey]]\n*Gamma Sigma: [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University, Staten Island Campus]]\n*Delta Beta: [[Rutgers University-New Brunswick|Rutgers University, New Brunswick Campus]]\n*Delta Delta: [[Wesley College (Delaware)]]\n*Delta Epsilon: [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]]\n*Delta Theta: [[Marist College]]\n*Delta Xi: [[Seton Hall University]]\n*Delta Omicron: [[Rutgers University\u2013Newark|Rutgers University Newark Campus]]\n*Delta Rho: [[State University of New York at Oneonta|State University of New York - College at Oneonta]]\n*Delta Upsilon: [[Robert Morris University]]\n*Delta Chi: [[University of Colorado]]\n*Delta Psi: [[Lynn University]]\n*Epsilon Beta: [[La Salle University]]\n*Epsilon Gamma: [[St. Joseph's College (New York)|St. Joseph's College]] ([[Patchogue]] Campus)\n*Epsilon Delta: [[Montclair State University]]\n*Epsilon Epsilon: [[Farmingdale State College]]\n*Epsilon Zeta: [[St. Joseph's College (Brooklyn/Patchogue, New York)]]\n*Epsilon Eta: [[University at Albany, SUNY]]\n*Epsilon Iota: [[Centenary University]]\n*Epsilon Lambda: [[University of New Haven]]\n*Epsilon Mu: [[Queens College, City University of New York]] \n*Epsilon Nu: [[Penn State Altoona]] \n*Epsilon Xi: [[Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology]] \n*Epsilon Omicron: [[Fitchburg State University]]\n*Epsilon Pi: State University of New York at Cortland\n*[[Briarcliff College]] Colony\n*[[Dowling College]] Colony\n*[[Misericordia University]] Colony\n*[[State University of New York at New Paltz]] Colony\n*\n\nAlpha Phi Delta is the top represented fraternity in the [[New York City]] Tri-State Area, and among the top on the East coast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apdnyc.org/apd/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219091416/http://apdnyc.org/apd/ |archivedate=2008-02-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable Brothers==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2011}}\n* [[Al DeMao]], professional football player, [[Washington Redskins]]\n* [[Joe DeNardo]], Emmy-winning Pittsburgh meteorologist\n* [[Aldo Donelli]], professional football player, Pittsburgh Steelers\n* [[Orlando DiGirolamo]], jazz musician\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], honorary member, actor, ''Law And Order: Criminal Intent'', ''Full Metal Jacket'', and ''Men in Black'' \n* [[Harvey Golub]], former CEO of [[American Express]]; current CEO of the [[American International Group]]\n* [[Henry Mancini]], honorary member; [[Academy Award]]-winning musician\n* [[Ray Mancini]], honorary member; two-time world boxing lightweight champion<ref>[http://www.apdfoundation.org/kleos/Kleos_2009_Summer.pdf Alpha Phi Delta Kleos V 80 No 3 Summer 2009, page 9]</ref>\n* [[Armand Niccolai]], professional football player, Pittsburgh Steelers\n* [[John A.

The fraternity is a member of the [[North American Interfraternity Conference]] (NIC) and a member of the [[National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations]] (NALFO).\n\n==History==\nThe concept of forming Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity, Inc. began in 1978.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lsu79.org/identity/history |title=Our Story |publisher=Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity, Incorporated }}</ref> During the period of the mid to late 1970s protests and acts of civil disobedience became commonplace as students asserted their disappointment with Rutgers University, professors' tenure, national issues, and Latino student rights.<ref>\"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qw80AAAAIBAJ&sjid=iSMIAAAAIBAJ&pg=1365,3968697&dq=protest+rutger+university&hl=en Students still protest-prone]\"  ''Bangor Daily News Article'' August 12, 1981</ref> The protest became so fervent they began closing down institutions and buildings, specifically the Livingston Library<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/28/archives/new-jersey-weekly-tensions-on-rutgers-campus-in-new-brunswick-are.html|title=Tensions on Rutgers Campus; in New Brunswick Are Easing|first=Mark H.|last=Jaffe|date=28 May 1978|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> as well as Rutgers men's basketball games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/26/archives/negotiations-fail-on-rutgers-rebels-effort-to-avoid-discipline-for.html|title=Negotiations Fail on Rutgers Rebels; Effort to Avoid Discipline for Protest Fruitless|first=Special To The New York|last=Times|date=26 February 1974|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nAs the acts of civil disobedience continued, students began to meet and be acquainted with each other from the protests. Some students were particularly upset with the treatment of Latino student interests and issues. A small group of these students began to meet at the Livingston Student Center and discuss the formation of an organization that would help students meet their goals and provide a family away from home. As the discussion continued, more men began to join the conversation eventually the group reached 20 members. Most of these men had met, at some time or another, during the protests or acts of civil disobedience, and thus shared common interests in the need for taking action to bring about positive change.\n\n==Formation==\nIn the spring of 1979, after speaking for a number of weeks, these 20 students suggested that the group form their own brotherhood, a Latino Social Fellowship. These men decided that a Social Fellowship would best provide support, focus, and family for the Latino community on college and university campuses. These men began to meet on a regular basis, holding their final meeting in Tillett Hall at Rutgers University, Livingston Campus on April 5, 1979, at which time Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Social Fellowship, Inc. was established.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lsu79.org/identity/history |title=Formation |publisher=Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity, Incorporated }}</ref> The official motto of the fellowship was \"Latinos Siempre Unidos\" (Latinos Always United), thus the acronym \"LSU\". They effectively became the catalyst for change, and a vehicle for pertinent conversation regarding relevant issues between student and the university administration at Rutgers University.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=lJ0hFQlKx4oC&oi=fnd&pg=PA104#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Brothers and Sisters|work=google.ca}}</ref>\n\n==Founding Fathers==\n[[File:15 of our 20 founding fathers.jpg|15 of our 20 founding fathers|thumb|This photo contains 15 of the 20<br />founding fathers of Lambda Sigma Upsilon.]]{{Hispanic and Latino Americans}}<!-- Deleted image removed: [[image:Tainousa.png|thumb|Taino Nation.]] -->\n\nThe twenty founders<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lsu79.org/identity/history |title=Founding Fathers |publisher=Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity, Incorporated }}</ref> of Lambda Sigma Upsilon are: \n* Jorge Ball\n* Felix Cabral\n* Jose DeLeon\n* Jorge Duthil\n* Raphael Equavil\n* Frankie Gonzalez\n* Luis Gonzalez\n* Nelson Gonzalez\n* Cesar LeDuc\n* Eleuterio \"Junior\" Maldonado\n* Julio Maldonado\n* Angel Melendez\n* Nelson Molina\n* Waldo Morin\n* Roberto Muniz\n* Alberto Rivera\n* Miguel Rivera\n* Osvaldo Rodriguez\n* Jose Sabater\n* Raul Torres\n\n==Goals==\nThe 20 founders of LSU were men who believed that underrepresented groups, particularly ethnic minorities, at colleges and universities were not getting the attention or services needed to advance their academic successes.  They created Lambda Sigma Upsilon to act as a support group for these groups, as well as to provide a family away from home. The founders developed four Goals<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lsu79.org/identity/mission |title=Our Goals |publisher=Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity, Incorporated }}</ref> that would embody the purpose of Lambda Sigma Upsilon. These goals are:\n\n* '''Academic excellence'''\n* '''Cultural awareness and diversity'''\n* '''Being role models to the community'''\n* '''Brotherhood'''\n\n==From Fellowship to Fraternity==\n\nAfter the establishment of the Pioneros Chapter at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, the brothers of this chapter saw certain difficulties in sustaining the chapter due to the organization's designation as a social fellowship. Not being designated \"fraternity\" disallowed them from participating in certain events as well as creating and hosting some of their own events and programs with the support of their institutions. They also saw the great difficulty in their ability to promote the organization as many special rights were given only to \"Greek\" organizations.\nThis eventually led to a debate within the organization surrounding the idea of changing the designation from \"Social Fellowship\" to \"Fraternity\". This debate centered on the idea of giving in to a \"Greek\" system that the founders of the organization originally sought to avoid. In the fall of 1987, a proposal was submitted by the brothers of Pioneros Chapter to the governing board of Lambda Sigma Upsilon. An organization-wide vote was held to change the designation and was passed, thus changing the official name of the organization to \"Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity\".\n\n==Affiliations==\n\nLambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity is a Member of the National Greek council [[North American Interfraternity Conference]] (NIC). NIC is a confederation of 73 men's college fraternities with over 5,500 chapters on more than 800 campuses throughout Canada and the United States. The NIC represents over 350,000 collegiate members and four and a half million alumni. Its volunteer leaders and professional staff serve fraternity leaders in university, government, and media relations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lsu79.org/identity/affiliations |title=Affiliations |publisher=Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity, Incorporated }}</ref>\n\nLambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity is also a Member of the [[National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations]] (NALFO). The purpose of NALFO is to promote and foster positive inter-fraternal relations, communication, and development of all Latino fraternal organizations through mutual respect, leadership, honesty, professionalism, and education. Currently, NALFO consists of 19 different organizations.\n\n==National Chapters== \n{{main|List of Lambda Sigma Upsilon chapters}}\n{{Lambda Sigma Upsilon articles}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=50%\n|-\n!Chapter Name\n!College / University\n!City, State\n!Established\n|-\n|1.

The fraternity is a member of the [[North American Interfraternity Conference]] (NIC) and a member of the [[National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations]] (NALFO).\n\n==History==\nThe concept of forming Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity, Inc. began in 1978.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lsu79.org/identity/history |title=Our Story |publisher=Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity, Incorporated }}</ref> During the period of the mid to late 1970s protests and acts of civil disobedience became commonplace as students asserted their disappointment with Rutgers University, professors' tenure, national issues, and Latino student rights.<ref>\"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qw80AAAAIBAJ&sjid=iSMIAAAAIBAJ&pg=1365,3968697&dq=protest+rutger+university&hl=en Students still protest-prone]\"  ''Bangor Daily News Article'' August 12, 1981</ref> The protest became so fervent they began closing down institutions and buildings, specifically the Livingston Library<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/28/archives/new-jersey-weekly-tensions-on-rutgers-campus-in-new-brunswick-are.html|title=Tensions on Rutgers Campus; in New Brunswick Are Easing|first=Mark H.|last=Jaffe|date=28 May 1978|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> as well as Rutgers men's basketball games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/02/26/archives/negotiations-fail-on-rutgers-rebels-effort-to-avoid-discipline-for.html|title=Negotiations Fail on Rutgers Rebels; Effort to Avoid Discipline for Protest Fruitless|first=Special To The New York|last=Times|date=26 February 1974|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nAs the acts of civil disobedience continued, students began to meet and be acquainted with each other from the protests. Some students were particularly upset with the treatment of Latino student interests and issues. A small group of these students began to meet at the Livingston Student Center and discuss the formation of an organization that would help students meet their goals and provide a family away from home. As the discussion continued, more men began to join the conversation eventually the group reached 20 members. Most of these men had met, at some time or another, during the protests or acts of civil disobedience, and thus shared common interests in the need for taking action to bring about positive change.\n\n==Formation==\nIn the spring of 1979, after speaking for a number of weeks, these 20 students suggested that the group form their own brotherhood, a Latino Social Fellowship. These men decided that a Social Fellowship would best provide support, focus, and family for the Latino community on college and university campuses. These men began to meet on a regular basis, holding their final meeting in Tillett Hall at Rutgers University, Livingston Campus on April 5, 1979, at which time Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Social Fellowship, Inc. was established.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lsu79.org/identity/history |title=Formation |publisher=Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity, Incorporated }}</ref> The official motto of the fellowship was \"Latinos Siempre Unidos\" (Latinos Always United), thus the acronym \"LSU\".

They created Lambda Sigma Upsilon to act as a support group for these groups, as well as to provide a family away from home. The founders developed four Goals<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lsu79.org/identity/mission |title=Our Goals |publisher=Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity, Incorporated }}</ref> that would embody the purpose of Lambda Sigma Upsilon. These goals are:\n\n* '''Academic excellence'''\n* '''Cultural awareness and diversity'''\n* '''Being role models to the community'''\n* '''Brotherhood'''\n\n==From Fellowship to Fraternity==\n\nAfter the establishment of the Pioneros Chapter at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, the brothers of this chapter saw certain difficulties in sustaining the chapter due to the organization's designation as a social fellowship. Not being designated \"fraternity\" disallowed them from participating in certain events as well as creating and hosting some of their own events and programs with the support of their institutions. They also saw the great difficulty in their ability to promote the organization as many special rights were given only to \"Greek\" organizations.\nThis eventually led to a debate within the organization surrounding the idea of changing the designation from \"Social Fellowship\" to \"Fraternity\". This debate centered on the idea of giving in to a \"Greek\" system that the founders of the organization originally sought to avoid. In the fall of 1987, a proposal was submitted by the brothers of Pioneros Chapter to the governing board of Lambda Sigma Upsilon. An organization-wide vote was held to change the designation and was passed, thus changing the official name of the organization to \"Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity\".\n\n==Affiliations==\n\nLambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity is a Member of the National Greek council [[North American Interfraternity Conference]] (NIC). NIC is a confederation of 73 men's college fraternities with over 5,500 chapters on more than 800 campuses throughout Canada and the United States. The NIC represents over 350,000 collegiate members and four and a half million alumni. Its volunteer leaders and professional staff serve fraternity leaders in university, government, and media relations.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lsu79.org/identity/affiliations |title=Affiliations |publisher=Lambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity, Incorporated }}</ref>\n\nLambda Sigma Upsilon Latino Fraternity is also a Member of the [[National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations]] (NALFO). The purpose of NALFO is to promote and foster positive inter-fraternal relations, communication, and development of all Latino fraternal organizations through mutual respect, leadership, honesty, professionalism, and education. Currently, NALFO consists of 19 different organizations.\n\n==National Chapters== \n{{main|List of Lambda Sigma Upsilon chapters}}\n{{Lambda Sigma Upsilon articles}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=50%\n|-\n!Chapter Name\n!College / University\n!City, State\n!Established\n|-\n|1.

In the 1970s the cane was shortened so brothers could \"twirl\" and tap the cane in the choreography with high [[wiktionary:dexterity|dexterity]].

Jesse Jerome Peters, later to become the eighth Grand [[Polemarch]], was chairman of the committee, during the administration of W. Ellis Stewart as Grand Polemarch.\n\nGuide Right is administrated by a National Director and a Guide Right Commission. The Guide Right Commission consists of the Director and twelve Province Guide Right Coordinators, one from each Province, appointed by their respective Province [[Polemarch]]s. The Director is uniquely qualified to perform the duties of this office and is appointed by the Grand Polemarch.

Steward brought the idea to Los Angeles from Dayton, Ohio, where he had worked closely with Jay Crosby to expand the guide right activities of Dayton (OH) Alumni chapter. The Kappa League is a series of activities designed to help young high school male students develop their leadership talents. The activities provide both challenging and rewarding experiences to enhance their lives. The goal of the League is to help the students achieve worthy goals for themselves and to make meaningful contributions to their communities. The League includes a series of workshops to achieve its goals.

Each Province sponsors a pageant during its Council. In the year of a Grand Chapter Meeting, the Province winners compete at the Grand Chapter Meeting. The first Student of the Year Pageant was held on May 20, 1972 at [[Drexel University]], under the direction of Mel Davis.

Many African-American students rarely saw each other on campus and were discouraged or prohibited from attending student functions and extracurricular activities by white college administrators and fellow students. African-American students were denied membership on athletic teams with the exception of track and field.

In 1920, Xi chapter was chartered at [[Howard University]]. In 1921, the fraternity installed the Omicron chapter at [[Columbia University]], its first at an [[Ivy League]] university.

The kappa canes were longer in the 1950s than in later decades. In the early 1960s, the cane was decorated with the fraternity colors. In the 1970s the cane was shortened so brothers could \"twirl\" and tap the cane in the choreography with high [[wiktionary:dexterity|dexterity]]. The process of covering the cane in the fraternal colors is considered as 'wrapping' and is done very specifically.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nIn the 1960s the national organization did not condone the use of canes or Kappa Alpha Psi's participation in step shows contending that \"the hours spent in step practices by chapters each week would be better devoted to academic or civic achievement.\"<ref name=bryson2003/>  Senior Grand Vice Polemarch Ullysses McBride complained about the vulgar language and obscene gestures sometimes engaged in by cane-stepping participants during these stepshows.<ref name=bryson2003/> In 1986, during the fraternity's 66th national meeting, cane stepping was finally recognized as an important staple of Kappa Alpha Psi.<ref name=bryson2003/>\n\n==National programs==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:KappaHQ.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Kappa Alpha Psi's International Headquarters in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].]] -->\n\n===Guide Right===\nGuide Right is a program for the educational and occupational guidance of youth, primarily inspirational and informational in character.

Ellis Stewart as Grand Polemarch.\n\nGuide Right is administrated by a National Director and a Guide Right Commission. The Guide Right Commission consists of the Director and twelve Province Guide Right Coordinators, one from each Province, appointed by their respective Province [[Polemarch]]s.

David II, the third Grand Polemarch. David was first Grand Polemarch who had not been nurtured by the Alpha chapter under the influence of the Founders, proposed dividing the Fraternity into supervisory districts. The idea originated with his father who was a Presiding Elder of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|A.M.E.]] Church. Grand Polemarch David II, implemented the division of the Fraternity into three districts. Past Grand Polemarch Irven Armstrong was assigned the first; Harrison R. Duke, the second; and Harold M. Tyler, the third district. The three districts grew into four \"regions\". Fifth Grand Polemarch Earl B. Dickerson changed the designation of \"Region\" to \"Province\" and \"Regional Director\" to \"Province Polemarch\" at the 15th Grand Chapter Meeting in 1925. And during the original establishment of provinces, the following provinces were established: Eastern, Middle Eastern, Central, Great Lakes, Northwestern, Western, Southern, and Southeastern Provinces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kapsi-np.org/NPHistory.htm |title=Fraternity History |publisher=kapsi-np.org |accessdate=2007-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008094043/http://www.kapsi-np.org/NPHistory.htm |archive-date=2007-10-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Currently there are 12 provinces with the following names:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Northern (States Covered: Northwest OH, MI, Western NY)\n* Eastern (States Covered: DC, MD, VA, Bermuda) \n* Southern (States Covered: AL, FL, The Bahamas, Republic of Panama, U.S. Virgin Islands)\n* Western (States Covered: AZ, CA, NV, AK, OR, WA, ID, UT, HI, Japan, South Korea)\n* North Eastern (States Covered: DE, CT, MA, NJ, Eastern PA, RI, Eastern NY, ME, NH, VT, Germany, United Kingdom)\n* South Eastern (States Covered: GA, SC, South Africa)\n* South Western (States Covered: AR, LA, Southern MS, NM, TX)\n* North Central (States Covered: IA, IL, IN, WI, MN)\n* East Central (States Covered: OH, Western PA, Northern WV)\n* South Central (States Covered: KY, TN, Northern MS)\n* Middle Eastern (States Covered: NC, Southern WV) \n* Middle Western (States Covered: CO, KS, MO, NE, OK)\n}}\n\n==Chapters==\n{{Main|List of Kappa Alpha Psi chapters}}\nKappa Alpha Psi has chartered over 721 undergraduate, alumni, and international chapters.
