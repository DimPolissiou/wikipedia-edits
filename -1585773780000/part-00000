The third element of the triple is often used to create an effect of surprise with the audience,<ref name=\"critiquecircle.com\"/> and is frequently the [[punch line]] of the joke itself. For instance, jokes might feature three stereotyped individuals\u2014such as [[an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman]]; or a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead\u2014where the surprise or punch line of the joke comes from the third character.\n\nThe comedic rule of three is often paired with quick timing, ensuring that viewers have less time to catch on to the pattern before the punch line hits. As a whole, the comedic rule of threes relies on setting up a pattern of two items and then subverting viewer expectations by breaking that pattern with the third item. One particularly notable example comes from ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' - \"Can I get you anything? Cup of coffee? Doughnut? Toupee?\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriple|title=The Triple|website=TV Tropes|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\nJust like most comedic writing, the rule of threes in comedy relies on building tension to a comedic release. In the case of the rule of threes, tension is built with the first two items in the pattern and then released with the final item, which should be the funniest of the three. Most triples are short in length, often only two or three sentences, but the rule can also be implemented effectively at longer length as long as base formula is still followed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/there-are-no-rules/comedy-writing-secrets-triples|title=Comedy Writing Secrets: Triple the Funny|last=Henshey|first=Chelsea|date=2016-02-11|website=WritersDigest.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\n==Fairy tales==\nIn [[storytelling]], authors often create triplets or structures in three parts. In its simplest form, this is merely ''beginning, middle, and end'', from [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]. [[Syd Field]] wrote a popular handbook of [[screenwriting]], in which he touted the advantages of [[three-act structure]] over the more traditional [[Act (drama)|five-act structure]] used by [[William Shakespeare]] and many other famous playwrights.\n\n[[File:Franz J\u00fcttner Schneewittchen 4.jpg|thumb|[[Snow White]] receives three visits from her wicked stepmother.]]\n\n[[Vladimir Propp]], in his ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', concluded that any of the elements in a folktale could be negated twice so that it would repeat thrice.<ref>Propp, Vladimir. ''Morphology of the Folk Tale''. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1968, p. 74, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}</ref> This is common not only in the Russian tales he studied but throughout [[Folklore|folk tales]] and [[fairy tale]]s: most commonly, perhaps, in that the [[youngest son]] is usually the third, although fairy tales often display the rule of three in the most blatant form. A small sample of the latter includes:\n* [[Rumpelstiltskin]] spins thrice for the heroine and lets her guess his name thrice over a period of three days.\n* In ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'', the heroine receives three gifts while searching for her lost husband; when she finds where he is held prisoner, she must use them to thrice bribe her way to the hero (the first two times she was unable to tell her story because he lay in a drugged sleep).\n* In ''[[Brother and Sister]]'', Brother is transformed into a deer when he drinks from the third stream that their wicked stepmother enchanted, and when Sister is killed by the same stepmother, she visits her child's room thrice, being caught and restored the third time.\n* In ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', a woman says she will bear the king three marvelous children; when they reappear, their envious aunts attempt to kill them by sending them on three quests, after the three marvelous things of the title.\n* In ''[[The Silent Princess]]'', a prince breaks a peasant woman's pitcher thrice, and is cursed; when he finds the title princess, he must persuade her to speak thrice.\n* In ''[[The Love for Three Oranges (fairy tale)|The Love for Three Oranges]]'', the hero picks three magical oranges, and only with the third is he able to keep the woman who springs out of it.\n\n==Literature==\n* In [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', [[Jacob Marley|Marley]]'s Ghost tells [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] he will receive visits from three spirits: [[The Ghost of Christmas Past]], [[The Ghost of Christmas Present]], and finally [[The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]], to which Scrooge says, \"Spirit, I fear you most of all.\"\n* In the musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', [[Tevye]] must give his three eldest daughters away, one after another. Each match progressively challenges his faith, as represented by a monologue in which he argues with himself using the phrase \"on the other hand\" to play the [[devil's advocate]] and convince himself to side with his daughters. This is subverted with the youngest daughter who wishes to marry a [[Gentile]], for which Tevye concludes that \"No, there is no other hand.\"\n* In [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', [[Mark Antony]] starts his speech by using the rule of three: [[Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears]], to which the commoners start to listen.\n\n==Rhetoric and public speaking==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe use of a series of three elements is also a well-known feature of public oratory. Max Atkinson, in his book on oratory entitled ''Our Masters' Voices'',<ref>Atkinson, J. Maxwell. ''Our Masters' Voices: The Language and Body Language of Politics''. London: Methuen, 1984. {{ISBN|0-416-37690-8}}</ref> gives interesting examples of how public speakers use three-part phrases to generate what he calls 'claptraps', evoking audience applause.\n\n[[Martin Luther King Jr.]], the civil rights activist and preacher, was known for his uses of tripling and the rule of three throughout his many influential speeches. For example, the speech \"Non-Violence and Racial Justice\" contained a binary opposition made up of the rule of three: \"insult, injustice and exploitation\", followed a few lines later by \"justice, good will, and brotherhood\".<ref>{{Cite web|title =Nonviolence and Racial Justice |url = http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol4/6-Feb-1957_NonviolenceAndRacialJustice.pdf|website = www.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref>  Conversely, segregationist Alabama governor [[George Wallace]] inveighed: \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\" during his [[George Wallace's 1963 Inaugural Address|1963 inaugural address]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Inaugural Address (1963) The \"Segregation Now, Segregation Forever\" Speech |author=Governor George Wallace of Alabama |url = http://web.utk.edu/~mfitzge1/docs/374/wallace_seg63.pdf|website = web.utk.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref>\n\nThe appeal of the three-fold pattern is also illustrated by the transformation of [[Winston Churchill]]'s reference to \"[[blood, toil, tears and sweat]]\" (echoing [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) in popular recollection to \"blood, sweat and tears\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat|url = http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/92-blood-toil-tears-and-sweat|website = www.winstonchurchill.org|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Presentation Skills 3.

This has been reduced to the commonly heard triad \"nasty, brutish and short\".\n\nThe [[Welsh Triads]] and [[Triads of Ireland|Irish Triads]] suggest the use of threes was also a mnemonic device\u2014easy-to-learn verses that were pointers to other information also committed to memory by Druids.\n\n==Law==\nA common feature of legal documents which give property or grant rights as drafted by legal professionals perpetuates old English practice in which the rule of three echoes the intended Act by the varying restatement of the act in triplicate.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}} For example, in a Will or Trust instrument the phrase \"I give, devise and bequeath ...\"\n\nUsually (in court) a common example is quoted: \"tell us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.<ref>{{Cite web|title = N.D.R.Ct. 6.10 Courtroom Oaths|url = http://www.ndcourts.gov/court/rules/ndroc/rule6.10.htm|website = www.ndcourts.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref>{{Relevance inline|date=March 2017}}\n\n==See also ==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n{{Portal |Children's literature}}\n* [[Hendiatris]] (or ''tripartite motto'')\n* [[Rule of thirds]]; a similar concept applied to visual art\n* [[Tricolon]]\n* [[Three classic laws of thought#Aristotle|The Three Classic Laws of thought]]\n* [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel#Triads|Triads]]\n* [[Triple deity]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n[[Category:Recurrent elements in fairy tales]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2009}}\n{{Original research|date=December 2014}}\n}}\n{{About|one meaning of \"rule of three\", in writing|other meanings|Rule of three (disambiguation){{!}}Rule of three}}\n[[File:The3bears-30.jpg|right|thumb|The story of [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]] uses the rule of three extensively, with the protagonist examining three sets of three items in a house, finding only the third of each set to be satisfactory]]\n\nThe '''rule of three''' is a [[writing]] principle that suggests that a [[wiktionary:trio|trio]] of events or characters is more humorous, satisfying, or effective than other numbers.<ref>{{Cite web|title = How to Use the \"Rule of Three\" to Create Engaging Content - Copyblogger|url = http://www.copyblogger.com/rule-of-three/|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref> The audience of this form of text is also thereby more likely to remember the information conveyed because having three entities combines both brevity and rhythm with having the smallest amount of information to create a pattern.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What is the mysterious \u2018Rule of Three\u2019? {{!}} Copywriters of Distinction|url = http://rule-of-three.co.uk/what-is-the-rule-of-three-copywriting/|website = rule-of-three.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref><ref name=\"Jonathan crossfield\">{{Cite web|title = Writing: The power of three|url = http://www.jonathancrossfield.com/blog/2009/06/writing-the-power-of-three.html|website = www.jonathancrossfield.com|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}</ref> It makes the author or speaker appear knowledgeable while being both simple and catchy.\n\nSlogans, film titles and a variety of other things have been structured in threes, a tradition that grew out of oral storytelling.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.toastmasters.org/~/media/258B5612D2D547DBA5C95D1890972E70.ashx|title = Toastmasters, November 2013|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Toastmaster|last = |first = |page = 17}}</ref> Examples include the [[Three Little Pigs]], [[Three Billy Goats Gruff]], and the [[Three Musketeers]].

Austin: University of Texas Press, 1968, p. 74, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}</ref> This is common not only in the Russian tales he studied but throughout [[Folklore|folk tales]] and [[fairy tale]]s: most commonly, perhaps, in that the [[youngest son]] is usually the third, although fairy tales often display the rule of three in the most blatant form. A small sample of the latter includes:\n* [[Rumpelstiltskin]] spins thrice for the heroine and lets her guess his name thrice over a period of three days.\n* In ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'', the heroine receives three gifts while searching for her lost husband; when she finds where he is held prisoner, she must use them to thrice bribe her way to the hero (the first two times she was unable to tell her story because he lay in a drugged sleep).\n* In ''[[Brother and Sister]]'', Brother is transformed into a deer when he drinks from the third stream that their wicked stepmother enchanted, and when Sister is killed by the same stepmother, she visits her child's room thrice, being caught and restored the third time.\n* In ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', a woman says she will bear the king three marvelous children; when they reappear, their envious aunts attempt to kill them by sending them on three quests, after the three marvelous things of the title.\n* In ''[[The Silent Princess]]'', a prince breaks a peasant woman's pitcher thrice, and is cursed; when he finds the title princess, he must persuade her to speak thrice.\n* In ''[[The Love for Three Oranges (fairy tale)|The Love for Three Oranges]]'', the hero picks three magical oranges, and only with the third is he able to keep the woman who springs out of it.\n\n==Literature==\n* In [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', [[Jacob Marley|Marley]]'s Ghost tells [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] he will receive visits from three spirits: [[The Ghost of Christmas Past]], [[The Ghost of Christmas Present]], and finally [[The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]], to which Scrooge says, \"Spirit, I fear you most of all.\"\n* In the musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', [[Tevye]] must give his three eldest daughters away, one after another. Each match progressively challenges his faith, as represented by a monologue in which he argues with himself using the phrase \"on the other hand\" to play the [[devil's advocate]] and convince himself to side with his daughters. This is subverted with the youngest daughter who wishes to marry a [[Gentile]], for which Tevye concludes that \"No, there is no other hand.\"\n* In [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', [[Mark Antony]] starts his speech by using the rule of three: [[Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears]], to which the commoners start to listen.\n\n==Rhetoric and public speaking==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe use of a series of three elements is also a well-known feature of public oratory. Max Atkinson, in his book on oratory entitled ''Our Masters' Voices'',<ref>Atkinson, J. Maxwell. ''Our Masters' Voices: The Language and Body Language of Politics''. London: Methuen, 1984. {{ISBN|0-416-37690-8}}</ref> gives interesting examples of how public speakers use three-part phrases to generate what he calls 'claptraps', evoking audience applause.\n\n[[Martin Luther King Jr.]], the civil rights activist and preacher, was known for his uses of tripling and the rule of three throughout his many influential speeches. For example, the speech \"Non-Violence and Racial Justice\" contained a binary opposition made up of the rule of three: \"insult, injustice and exploitation\", followed a few lines later by \"justice, good will, and brotherhood\".<ref>{{Cite web|title =Nonviolence and Racial Justice |url = http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol4/6-Feb-1957_NonviolenceAndRacialJustice.pdf|website = www.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref>  Conversely, segregationist Alabama governor [[George Wallace]] inveighed: \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\" during his [[George Wallace's 1963 Inaugural Address|1963 inaugural address]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Inaugural Address (1963) The \"Segregation Now, Segregation Forever\" Speech |author=Governor George Wallace of Alabama |url = http://web.utk.edu/~mfitzge1/docs/374/wallace_seg63.pdf|website = web.utk.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref>\n\nThe appeal of the three-fold pattern is also illustrated by the transformation of [[Winston Churchill]]'s reference to \"[[blood, toil, tears and sweat]]\" (echoing [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) in popular recollection to \"blood, sweat and tears\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat|url = http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/92-blood-toil-tears-and-sweat|website = www.winstonchurchill.org|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Presentation Skills 3.

Interrupted genes are universal in eukaryotes; yeasts may display single interruptions of a minority of genes, while in higher organisms most genes are interrupted.  Some eukaryotes may contain multiple interruptions with introns that can be longer than exons.  Introns are well-conserved across evolutionary history, suggesting their structure has some importance for the organism. They are longer in advanced organisms (higher plants and animals). Longer growth and development requires longer sequences of gene activation and down-regulation.

The idea that genome density decreases as the complexity of the organism increases hold true. This is due to the fact that eukaryotes have a much stronger presence of introns than prokaryotes. For example, prokaryotes contain about 1000 genes/Mb while humans contain about 6 genes/Mb.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson, James D., 1928-|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/839779760|title=Molecular biology of the gene|date=cop. 2014|publisher=Pearson|isbn=0-321-85149-8|oclc=839779760}}</ref> Another example are lower [[Eukaryote|eukaryotes]], such as [[yeast]], that have many uninterrupted regions.

Interrupted genes are universal in eukaryotes; yeasts may display single interruptions of a minority of genes, while in higher organisms most genes are interrupted.  Some eukaryotes make contain multiple interruptions with introns that can be longer than exons.  Introns are well-conserved across evolutionary history, suggesting their structure has some importance for the organism. They are longer in advanced organisms (higher plants and animals). Longer growth and development requires longer sequences of gene activation and down-regulation.

A government can declare such a state during a [[natural disaster]], [[civil unrest]], [[armed conflict]], medical [[pandemic]] or [[epidemic]] or other [[biosecurity]] risk. Such declarations alert citizens to change their normal behavior and orders government agencies to implement emergency plans. ''[[Justitium]]'' is its equivalent in Roman law&mdash;a concept in which the senate could put forward a final decree ([[senatus consultum ultimum]]) that was not subject to dispute.\n\nStates of emergency can also be used as a rationale or pretext for suspending rights and freedoms guaranteed under a country's [[constitution]] or [[basic law]], sometimes through [[martial law]] or revoking [[habeas corpus]]. The procedure for and legality of doing so vary by country.\n\n==Relationship with international law==\n\nUnder [[international law]], rights and freedoms may be suspended during a state of emergency; for example, a government can detain persons and hold them without trial. All rights that can be derogated from are listed in the [[ICCPR|International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights]]. Non-derogable rights cannot be suspended.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} D. Pr\u00e9mont, C. Stenersen, I. Oseredczuk, Bruylant, Brussels, ''Droits intangibles et \u00e9tats d'exception''[fr.] 1996, 644p., {{ISBN|2-8027-0766-3}}, \u00c9ditions ''Bruylant''</ref>  Non-derogable rights are listed in Article 4 of the ICCPR; they include [[right to life]], the rights to freedom from [[arbitrary detention|arbitrary deprivation of liberty]], [[slavery]], [[torture]], and [[cruel and unusual punishment|ill-treatment]].<ref>Article 4, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</ref>\n\nSome countries have made it illegal to modify emergency law or the constitution during the emergency; other countries have the freedom to change any legislation or rights based constitutional frameworks at any time that the legislative chooses to do so. Constitutions are contracts between the government and the private individuals of that country. The International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is an international law document signed and ratified by states.  Therefore, the Covenant applies to only those persons acting in an [[official capacity]], not private individuals. However, States Parties to the Covenant are expected to integrate it into national legislation. The state of emergency (within the ICCPR framework) must be publicly declared and the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]] and all other States Parties to the Covenant must be notified immediately, to declare the reason for the emergency, the date on which the emergency is to start, the derogations that may take place, with the timeframe of the emergency and the date in which the emergency is expected to finish. Although this is common protocol stipulated by the ICCPR, its monitoring Committee of experts has no sanction power and its recommendations are therefore not always strictly followed; enforcement is therefore better regulated by the American and European Conventions and Courts on human rights.<ref>{{in lang|it}} [https://www.academia.edu/12431137/stato_di_eccezione_ed_ordinamento_democratico {{lang|it|Declaratoria dello stato di emergenza e Consiglio supremo di difesa}} Nuovi studi politici, gennaio-giugno 2005, n. 1/2, p. 107].</ref>\n\n==Use and viewpoints==<!--Linked from 'Giorgio Agamben'-->\nThough fairly uncommon in democracies, [[dictatorship|dictatorial]] regimes often declare a state of emergency that is prolonged indefinitely for the life of the regime, or for extended periods of time so that derogations can be used to override human rights of their citizens usually protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political rights.<ref>See Judson, 2012, \"[http://otago.ourarchive.ac.nz/handle/10523/2279 Where is R2P grounded in international law]\".</ref> In some situations, [[martial law]] is also declared, allowing the [[military]] greater authority to act. In other situations, emergency is not declared and de facto measures taken or decree-law adopted by the government. Ms. [[Nicole Questiaux]] (France) and Mr. Leandro Despouy (Argentina), two consecutive [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs]], have recommended to the international community to adopt the following \"principles\" to be observed during a state or de facto situation of emergency : Principles of Legality, Proclamation, Notification, Time Limitation, Exceptional Threat, Proportionality, Non-Discrimination, Compatibility, Concordance and Complementarity of the Various Norms of International Law (cf. \"Question of Human Rights and State of Emergency\", E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/19, at Chapter II; see also ''[[:fr:\u00e9tat d'exception|\u00e9tat d'exception]]'').\n\nArticle 4 to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), permits states to [[Derogation|derogate]] from certain rights guaranteed by the ICCPR in \"time of public emergency\". Any measures derogating from obligations under the Covenant, however, must be to only the extent required by the exigencies of the situation, and must be announced by the State Party to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]. The [[European Convention on Human Rights]]<ref>''[[European Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 15</ref> and [[American Convention on Human Rights]]<ref>''[[American Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 27</ref> have similar derogatory provisions. No derogation is permitted to the [[ILO Conventions|International Labour Conventions]].\n\nSome [[political theory|political theorists]], such as [[Carl Schmitt]], have argued that the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] to decide the initiation of the state of emergency defines [[sovereignty]] itself. In [[State of Exception (2005)|''State of Exception'' (2005)]], [[Giorgio Agamben]] criticized this idea, arguing that the mechanism of the state of emergency deprives certain people of their [[civil and political rights]], producing his interpretation of ''[[homo sacer]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Agamben|2005}}</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\nIn many [[democracy|democratic]] states there are a selection of [[constitutional law|legal]] definitions for specific states of emergency,<ref>[http://www.astho.org/Programs/Preparedness/Public-Health-Emergency-Law/Emergency-Authority-and-Immunity-Toolkit/Emergency-Declarations-and-Authorities-Fact-Sheet/ USA ASTHO Emergency toolkit fact sheet]</ref> when the [[constitution]] of the [[State (polity)|State]] is partially in abeyance depending on the nature of the perceived threat to the [[general public]]. In order of severity these may include:\n*[[Martial law]] when civil rights are severely restricted by the imposition of [[military force]] within a [[Sovereign state]], for example during a period of extreme threat of [[invasion]] or actual [[hostilities]] by foreign forces\n* [[state of siege]] when the civil rights of specified persons or groups such as [[activist|political activists]] are likely to be curtailed, for example to prevent an [[insurrection]] or organised acts of [[treason]] by suspected [[Agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]]\n* [[emergency|civil emergency]] dealing with [[disaster area]]s and requiring the deployment of extraordinary resources to contain dangerous situations such as [[natural disaster]]s or extensive [[Malice (law)|malicious]] [[property damage]] such as may occur during [[riot]]ing or by [[arson]]. As well as regular [[emergency service]]s sometimes [[military forces]] may be assigned to deliver aid under especially [[Emergency procedure#Escalating Situations|dangerous conditions]] or to prevent [[looting]]\n\n===Abuse===\nSometimes, the state of emergency can be [[abuse]]d by being invoked. An example would be to allow a state to suppress internal opposition without having to respect human rights. An example was the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August 1991 attempted coup]] in the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) where the coup leaders invoked a state of emergency; the failure of the coup led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].\n\nDerogations by states having ratified or acceded to binding international agreements such as the ICCPR, the American and European Conventions on Human Rights and the International Labour Conventions are monitored by independent expert committees, regional Courts and other State Parties.<ref name=BBC />\n\n==Law in selected countries==\n\n===Argentina===\nThe Constitution, which has been amended several times, has always allowed for a state of emergency (literally ''estado de sitio'', \"state of siege\"), to be declared if the constitution or the authorities it creates are endangered by internal unrest or foreign attack. This provision was much abused during dictatorships, with long-lasting states of siege giving the government a free hand to suppress opposition ({{As of|2010|lc=on}} a state of emergency had been declared 52 times by democratic and dictatorial governments, starting in 1854 shortly after the constitution came into force<ref>{{cite web|url=http://derecho.laguia2000.com/derecho-politico/estado-de-sitio |title=State of emergency in Argentina and other Spanish-speaking countries (in Spanish) |publisher=Derecho.laguia2000.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref>). The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (Pacto de San Jos\u00e9 de Costa Rica), adopted in 1969 but ratified by Argentina only in 1984 immediately after the end of the [[National Reorganization Process]], restricts abuse of the state of emergency by requiring any signatory nation declaring such a state to inform the other signatories of its circumstances and duration, and what rights are affected.\n\n===Australia===\n{{also|Exceptional circumstances|Biosecurity in Australia|Biosecurity Act 2015}}\nState-of-emergency legislation differs in each state of Australia. With regard to emergency management, regions (usually on a [[local government area]] basis) that have been affected by a [[natural disaster]] are the responsibility of the state, until that state declares a State of Emergency where access to the Federal Emergency Fund becomes available to help respond to and recover from natural disasters. A State of Emergency does not apply to the whole state, but rather [[districts]] or [[shire]]s, where essential services may have been disrupted.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the [[premier of Victoria|premier]] can declare a state of emergency if there is a threat to employment, safety or public order.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/03/victoria-fires-state-of-disaster-declared-as-evacuation-ordered-and-second-man-found-dead Victorian fires: state of disaster declared as evacuation ordered and 28 people missing]</ref> The declaration expires after 30 days, and a resolution of either the upper or lower House of Parliament may revoke it earlier.

The [[High Courts of South Africa|High Courts]] have the power, subject to confirmation by the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], to determine the validity of the declaration of a state of emergency.<ref name=\"sa-bor-handbook\">{{cite book |first1=Iain |last1=Currie |first2=Johan |last2=de Waal |title=The Bill of Rights Handbook |edition=5th |year=2005 |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta & Company Ltd |isbn=9780702159237 |chapter=Chapter Thirty-three: States of Emergency |pages=798\u2013806}}</ref>\n\nDuring a state of emergency the President has the power to make emergency regulations \"necessary or expedient\" to restore peace and order and end the emergency. This power can be delegated to other authorities. Emergency measures can violate the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]], but only to a limited extent. Some rights are inviolable, including amongst others the rights to life and to human dignity; the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of race, sex or religion; the prohibition of torture or inhuman punishment; and the right of accused people to a fair trial. Any violation of a constitutional right must be strictly required by the emergency. Emergency measures may not indemnify the government or individuals for illegal actions. They may impose criminal penalties, but not exceeding three years' imprisonment. They may not require military service beyond that required by the ordinary laws governing the defence force. An emergency measure may be disapproved by the National Assembly, in which case it lapses, and no emergency measure may interfere with the elections, powers or sittings of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] or the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]]. The courts have the power to determine the validity of any emergency measure.\n\nThe constitution places strict limits on any [[detention without trial]] during a state of emergency. A friend or family member of the detainee must be informed, and the name and place of detention must be published in the ''Government Gazette''. The detainee must have access to a doctor and a legal representative. He or she must be brought before a court within at most ten days, for the court to determine whether the detention is necessary, and if not released may demand repeated review every ten days. At the court review the detainee must be allowed legal representation and must be allowed to appear in person. The provisions on detention without trial do not apply to [[prisoners of war]] in an international conflict; instead they must be treated in accordance with the [[Geneva Conventions]] and other international law.\n\n===Spain===\nIn Spain, there are three degrees of state of emergency (''estado de emergencia'' in Spanish): ''[[State of Alarm|alarma]]'' (alarm or alert), ''excepci\u00f3n'' (exception[al circumstance]) and ''sitio'' (siege). They are named by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|constitution]], which limits which rights may be suspended, but regulated by the \"[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo4-1981.html Ley Org\u00e1nica 4/1981]\" ([[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Law]]).\n\nOn 4 December 2010, the first state of alert was declared following the [[Spanish air traffic controllers strike|air traffic controllers strike]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2010/12/04/actualidad/1291454218_850215.html |title=El Gobierno declara el estado de alarma y moviliza a los controladores |first=A. |last=Mars |first2=A. |last2=Romero |first3=P. |last3=\u00c1lvarez |date=4 December 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2019 |newspaper=[[El Pa\u00eds]] |publisher=[[Prisa]] |language=es |location=Madrid}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/12/04/espana/1291425368.html |title=El Gobierno declara el estado de alarma |date=5 December 2010 |accessdate=27 October 2019 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |publisher=[[Unidad Editorial]] Internet, S.L. |language=es}}</ref> It was the first time since the [[Francoist Spain|Francisco Franco's regime]] that a state of emergency was declared.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11918008 | work=BBC | title=Striking Spain air traffic controllers return to work | date=4 December 2010}}</ref> The second state of alert was declared on 14 March 2020 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Spain|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elmundo.es/espana/2020/03/13/5e6b844e21efa0dd258b45a5.html|website=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|title=Pedro S\u00e1nchez decreta el estado de alarma en toda Espa\u00f1a para frenar la expansi\u00f3n del coronavirus|date=13 March 2020|first=Marisol|last=Hern\u00e1ndez}}</ref>\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nIn Sri Lanka, the [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] is able to proclaim emergency regulations under the ''Public Security Ordinance'' in the [[Constitution of Sri Lanka|constitution]] in order to preserve public security and public order; suppression of [[mutiny]], [[riot]] or [[civil unrest|civil commotion]]; or maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community. These regulations last for one month unless confirmed otherwise by [[Parliament of Sri Lanka|Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl-nat/a24d1cf3344e99934125673e00508142/afad7ae740f9b625c12577370039c9e1/$FILE/Public%20Security%20Ordinance.pdf|title=Constitution of Sri Lanka|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Switzerland===\nAccording to Art. 185 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] The [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] (Bundesrat) can call up in their own competence military personnel of maximum 4000 [[militia]] for three weeks to safeguard inner or outer security (called Federal Intervention or Federal Execution, respectively). A larger number of soldiers or of a longer duration is subject to [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|parliamentary]] decision. For deployments within Switzerland the principle of subsidiarity rules: as a first step, unrest has to be overcome with the aid of cantonal police units.\n\n===Syria===\nAn emergency prevailed in [[Syria]] from 1962 to 2011. Originally predicated on the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|conflict with Israel]], the emergency acted to centralize authority in the presidency and the national security apparatus while silencing public dissent. The emergency was terminated in response to protests that preceded the [[Syrian Civil War]]. Under the 2012 constitution, the president may pass an emergency decree with a 2/3 concurrence of his ministers, provided that he presents it to the legislature for constitutional review.\n\n===Trinidad and Tobago===\nA state of emergency was declared in 1970 during the [[Black Power Revolution]] by then Prime Minister [[Eric Williams]]. During the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt|attempted state coup]] by the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen]] against the NAR government of the then Prime Minister [[A. N. R.

The decision of the President, [[George Maxwell Richards]], to issue the proclamation for the state of emergency was debated in [[Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago|the country's Parliament]] as required by the Constitution on 2 September 2011 and passed by the required simple majority of the House of Representatives. On 4 September the Parliament extended the state of emergency for a further 3 months. It ended in December 2011.\n\n===Turkey===\n{{Main|Martial law and state of emergency in Turkey}}\nSince the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 the [[Turkish Armed Forces|military]] conducted three [[coup d'\u00e9tat|''coups d'\u00e9tat'']] and announced [[martial law]]. Martial law between 1978 and 1983 was replaced by a state of emergency that lasted until November 2002.\nThe latest state of emergency was declared by [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan|President Erdo\u011fan]] on 20 July 2016 following a failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016 by a faction of the country's armed forces. It was lifted in 2018.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{main|Civil Contingencies Act 2004}}\nIn the United Kingdom, only the [[British Sovereign]],<ref>The sovereign of the UK always follows the advice of the Prime Minister on any action with constitutional significance</ref> on the advice of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], or a [[Minister of the Crown]] in exceptional circumstances, has the power to introduce emergency regulations under the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]], in case of an emergency, broadly defined as war or attack by a foreign power, terrorism which poses a threat of serious damage to the security of the UK, or events which threaten serious damage to human welfare or the environment of a place in the UK. The duration of these regulations is limited to thirty days, but may be extended by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].\nA state of emergency was last invoked in 1974 by Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] in response to increasing [[industrial action]].\n\nThe act grants wide-ranging powers to central and local government in the event of an emergency. It allows the modification of [[primary legislation]] by emergency regulation, with the exception of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and Part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.\n\n===United States===\n{{Further|Senate Report 93-549|Insurrection Act|National Emergencies Act|List of national emergencies in the United States}}\nThe [[United States Constitution]] implicitly provides some emergency powers in the article about the executive power :\n* Congress may authorize the government to call forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress an insurrection or repel an invasion.\n* Congress may authorize the government to suspend consideration of writs of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]]'' \"when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\"\n* [[Felony]] charges may be brought without presentment or [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] in cases arising \"in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger.\"\n* A state government may engage in war without Congress's approval if \"actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.\"\n\nAside from these, many provisions of law exist in various jurisdictions, which take effect only upon an executive declaration of emergency; some 500 federal laws take effect upon a presidential declaration of emergency. The [[National Emergencies Act]] regulates this process at the federal level. It requires the President to specifically identify the provisions activated and to renew the declaration annually so as to prevent an arbitrarily broad or open-ended emergency.\nPresidents have occasionally taken action justified as necessary or prudent because of a state of emergency, only to have the action struck down in court as unconstitutional.<ref>''[[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'' (1953)</ref>\n\nA state [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or local [[mayor]] may declare a state of emergency within his or her [[jurisdiction]]. This is common at the state level in response to natural disasters. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] maintains a system of assets, personnel and training to respond to such incidents. For example, on 10 December 2015, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state Governor [[Jay Inslee]] declared a state of emergency due to flooding and landslides caused by heavy rains.<ref>{{cite news|title=Washington gov. declares weather emergency|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/12/10/washington-gov-declares-weather-emergency/77081310/|accessdate=10 December 2015|work=USA Today|date=10 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1977 [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] allows the government to freeze assets, limit trade and confiscate property in response to an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the United States that originates substantially outside of it. As of 2015 more than twenty emergencies under the IEEPA remain active regarding various subjects, the oldest of which was declared in 1979 with regard to the government of [[Iran]]. Another ongoing national emergency, declared after the [[September 11 attacks]], authorizes the president to retain or reactivate military personnel beyond their normal term of service.<ref>US Presidential Proclamation 7463</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n<!--\n    Natural disasters happen all the time.

A government can declare such a state during a [[natural disaster]], [[civil unrest]], [[armed conflict]], medical [[pandemic]] or [[epidemic]] or other [[biosecurity]] risk. Such declarations alert citizens to change their normal behavior and orders government agencies to implement emergency plans. ''[[Justitium]]'' is its equivalent in Roman law&mdash;a concept in which the senate could put forward a final decree ([[senatus consultum ultimum]]) that was not subject to dispute.\n\nStates of emergency can also be used as a rationale or pretext for suspending rights and freedoms guaranteed under a country's [[constitution]] or [[basic law]], sometimes through [[martial law]] or revoking [[habeas corpus]]. The procedure for and legality of doing so vary by country.\n\n==Relationship with international law==\n\nUnder [[international law]], rights and freedoms may be suspended during a state of emergency; for example, a government can detain persons and hold them without trial. All rights that can be derogated from are listed in the [[ICCPR|International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights]]. Non-derogable rights cannot be suspended.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} D.

Constitutions are contracts between the government and the private individuals of that country. The International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is an international law document signed and ratified by states.  Therefore, the Covenant applies to only those persons acting in an [[official capacity]], not private individuals. However, States Parties to the Covenant are expected to integrate it into national legislation. The state of emergency (within the ICCPR framework) must be publicly declared and the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]] and all other States Parties to the Covenant must be notified immediately, to declare the reason for the emergency, the date on which the emergency is to start, the derogations that may take place, with the timeframe of the emergency and the date in which the emergency is expected to finish. Although this is common protocol stipulated by the ICCPR, its monitoring Committee of experts has no sanction power and its recommendations are therefore not always strictly followed; enforcement is therefore better regulated by the American and European Conventions and Courts on human rights.<ref>{{in lang|it}} [https://www.academia.edu/12431137/stato_di_eccezione_ed_ordinamento_democratico {{lang|it|Declaratoria dello stato di emergenza e Consiglio supremo di difesa}} Nuovi studi politici, gennaio-giugno 2005, n. 1/2, p. 107].</ref>\n\n==Use and viewpoints==<!--Linked from 'Giorgio Agamben'-->\nThough fairly uncommon in democracies, [[dictatorship|dictatorial]] regimes often declare a state of emergency that is prolonged indefinitely for the life of the regime, or for extended periods of time so that derogations can be used to override human rights of their citizens usually protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political rights.<ref>See Judson, 2012, \"[http://otago.ourarchive.ac.nz/handle/10523/2279 Where is R2P grounded in international law]\".</ref> In some situations, [[martial law]] is also declared, allowing the [[military]] greater authority to act. In other situations, emergency is not declared and de facto measures taken or decree-law adopted by the government. Ms. [[Nicole Questiaux]] (France) and Mr. Leandro Despouy (Argentina), two consecutive [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs]], have recommended to the international community to adopt the following \"principles\" to be observed during a state or de facto situation of emergency : Principles of Legality, Proclamation, Notification, Time Limitation, Exceptional Threat, Proportionality, Non-Discrimination, Compatibility, Concordance and Complementarity of the Various Norms of International Law (cf. \"Question of Human Rights and State of Emergency\", E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/19, at Chapter II; see also ''[[:fr:\u00e9tat d'exception|\u00e9tat d'exception]]'').\n\nArticle 4 to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), permits states to [[Derogation|derogate]] from certain rights guaranteed by the ICCPR in \"time of public emergency\". Any measures derogating from obligations under the Covenant, however, must be to only the extent required by the exigencies of the situation, and must be announced by the State Party to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]. The [[European Convention on Human Rights]]<ref>''[[European Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 15</ref> and [[American Convention on Human Rights]]<ref>''[[American Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 27</ref> have similar derogatory provisions. No derogation is permitted to the [[ILO Conventions|International Labour Conventions]].\n\nSome [[political theory|political theorists]], such as [[Carl Schmitt]], have argued that the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] to decide the initiation of the state of emergency defines [[sovereignty]] itself. In [[State of Exception (2005)|''State of Exception'' (2005)]], [[Giorgio Agamben]] criticized this idea, arguing that the mechanism of the state of emergency deprives certain people of their [[civil and political rights]], producing his interpretation of ''[[homo sacer]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Agamben|2005}}</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\nIn many [[democracy|democratic]] states there are a selection of [[constitutional law|legal]] definitions for specific states of emergency,<ref>[http://www.astho.org/Programs/Preparedness/Public-Health-Emergency-Law/Emergency-Authority-and-Immunity-Toolkit/Emergency-Declarations-and-Authorities-Fact-Sheet/ USA ASTHO Emergency toolkit fact sheet]</ref> when the [[constitution]] of the [[State (polity)|State]] is partially in abeyance depending on the nature of the perceived threat to the [[general public]]. In order of severity these may include:\n*[[Martial law]] when civil rights are severely restricted by the imposition of [[military force]] within a [[Sovereign state]], for example during a period of extreme threat of [[invasion]] or actual [[hostilities]] by foreign forces\n* [[state of siege]] when the civil rights of specified persons or groups such as [[activist|political activists]] are likely to be curtailed, for example to prevent an [[insurrection]] or organised acts of [[treason]] by suspected [[Agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]]\n* [[emergency|civil emergency]] dealing with [[disaster area]]s and requiring the deployment of extraordinary resources to contain dangerous situations such as [[natural disaster]]s or extensive [[Malice (law)|malicious]] [[property damage]] such as may occur during [[riot]]ing or by [[arson]]. As well as regular [[emergency service]]s sometimes [[military forces]] may be assigned to deliver aid under especially [[Emergency procedure#Escalating Situations|dangerous conditions]] or to prevent [[looting]]\n\n===Abuse===\nSometimes, the state of emergency can be [[abuse]]d by being invoked. An example would be to allow a state to suppress internal opposition without having to respect human rights. An example was the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August 1991 attempted coup]] in the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) where the coup leaders invoked a state of emergency; the failure of the coup led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].\n\nDerogations by states having ratified or acceded to binding international agreements such as the ICCPR, the American and European Conventions on Human Rights and the International Labour Conventions are monitored by independent expert committees, regional Courts and other State Parties.<ref name=BBC />\n\n==Law in selected countries==\n\n===Argentina===\nThe Constitution, which has been amended several times, has always allowed for a state of emergency (literally ''estado de sitio'', \"state of siege\"), to be declared if the constitution or the authorities it creates are endangered by internal unrest or foreign attack. This provision was much abused during dictatorships, with long-lasting states of siege giving the government a free hand to suppress opposition ({{As of|2010|lc=on}} a state of emergency had been declared 52 times by democratic and dictatorial governments, starting in 1854 shortly after the constitution came into force<ref>{{cite web|url=http://derecho.laguia2000.com/derecho-politico/estado-de-sitio |title=State of emergency in Argentina and other Spanish-speaking countries (in Spanish) |publisher=Derecho.laguia2000.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref>). The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (Pacto de San Jos\u00e9 de Costa Rica), adopted in 1969 but ratified by Argentina only in 1984 immediately after the end of the [[National Reorganization Process]], restricts abuse of the state of emergency by requiring any signatory nation declaring such a state to inform the other signatories of its circumstances and duration, and what rights are affected.\n\n===Australia===\n{{also|Exceptional circumstances|Biosecurity in Australia|Biosecurity Act 2015}}\nState-of-emergency legislation differs in each state of Australia.

An emergency measure may be disapproved by the National Assembly, in which case it lapses, and no emergency measure may interfere with the elections, powers or sittings of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] or the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]].

A friend or family member of the detainee must be informed, and the name and place of detention must be published in the ''Government Gazette''. The detainee must have access to a doctor and a legal representative. He or she must be brought before a court within at most ten days, for the court to determine whether the detention is necessary, and if not released may demand repeated review every ten days. At the court review the detainee must be allowed legal representation and must be allowed to appear in person.

It allows the modification of [[primary legislation]] by emergency regulation, with the exception of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and Part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.\n\n===United States===\n{{Further|Senate Report 93-549|Insurrection Act|National Emergencies Act|List of national emergencies in the United States}}\nThe [[United States Constitution]] implicitly provides some emergency powers in the article about the executive power :\n* Congress may authorize the government to call forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress an insurrection or repel an invasion.\n* Congress may authorize the government to suspend consideration of writs of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]]'' \"when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\"\n* [[Felony]] charges may be brought without presentment or [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] in cases arising \"in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger.\"\n* A state government may engage in war without Congress's approval if \"actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.\"\n\nAside from these, many provisions of law exist in various jurisdictions, which take effect only upon an executive declaration of emergency; some 500 federal laws take effect upon a presidential declaration of emergency. The [[National Emergencies Act]] regulates this process at the federal level. It requires the President to specifically identify the provisions activated and to renew the declaration annually so as to prevent an arbitrarily broad or open-ended emergency.\nPresidents have occasionally taken action justified as necessary or prudent because of a state of emergency, only to have the action struck down in court as unconstitutional.<ref>''[[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'' (1953)</ref>\n\nA state [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or local [[mayor]] may declare a state of emergency within his or her [[jurisdiction]]. This is common at the state level in response to natural disasters. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] maintains a system of assets, personnel and training to respond to such incidents. For example, on 10 December 2015, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state Governor [[Jay Inslee]] declared a state of emergency due to flooding and landslides caused by heavy rains.<ref>{{cite news|title=Washington gov. declares weather emergency|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/12/10/washington-gov-declares-weather-emergency/77081310/|accessdate=10 December 2015|work=USA Today|date=10 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1977 [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] allows the government to freeze assets, limit trade and confiscate property in response to an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the United States that originates substantially outside of it. As of 2015 more than twenty emergencies under the IEEPA remain active regarding various subjects, the oldest of which was declared in 1979 with regard to the government of [[Iran]]. Another ongoing national emergency, declared after the [[September 11 attacks]], authorizes the president to retain or reactivate military personnel beyond their normal term of service.<ref>US Presidential Proclamation 7463</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n<!--\n    Natural disasters happen all the time.

The term has been more generally applied to describe what postmodernists believe to be the [[Postmodernity|historical era following modernity]] and the tendencies of this era. \n\nWhile encompassing a wide variety of approaches and disciplines, postmodernism is generally defined by an attitude of [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], [[irony]], or rejection of the [[meta-narrative|grand narratives]] and [[ideology|ideologies]] of modernism, often calling into question various assumptions of [[the Enlightenment|Enlightenment rationality]]. Consequently, common targets of postmodern critique include [[universalism|universalist]] notions of [[objective reality]], [[moral universalism|morality]], [[truth]], [[human nature]], [[reason]], [[science]], [[language]], and [[social progress]]. Postmodern thinkers frequently call attention to the [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] or [[social conditioning|socially-conditioned]] nature of [[knowledge]] claims and [[value system]]s, situating them as products of particular political, historical, or cultural [[discourse]]s and [[hierarchies]]. Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to [[self-reference|self-referentiality]], [[epistemological relativism|epistemological]] and [[moral relativism]], [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]], and irreverence.\n\nPostmodern critical approaches gained purchase in the 1980s and 1990s, and have been adopted in a variety of academic and theoretical disciplines, including [[cultural studies]], [[philosophy of science]], [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[architecture]], [[feminist theory]], and [[literary criticism]], as well as [[Postmodern art|art movements]] in fields such as [[postmodern literature|literature]], [[contemporary art]], and music. Postmodernism is often associated with schools of thought such as [[deconstruction]], [[post-structuralism]], and [[institutional critique]], as well as philosophers such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Fredric Jameson]].\n\n[[Criticism of postmodernism|Criticisms of postmodernism]] are intellectually diverse, and include assertions that postmodernism promotes [[obscurantism]], is meaningless, and that it adds nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge.\n\n== Overview ==\nPostmodernism is an intellectual stance<ref>{{cite book | last = Bauman | first = Zygmunt | title = Intimations of postmodernity | page = 26 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780415067508 }}</ref> or a mode of discourse<ref>Nuyen, A.T., 1992.

The term has been more generally applied to describe what postmodernists believe to be the [[Postmodernity|historical era following modernity]] and the tendencies of this era. \n \nWhile encompassing a wide variety of approaches and disciplines, postmodernism is generally defined by an attitude of [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], [[irony]], or rejection of the [[meta-narrative|grand narratives]] and [[ideology|ideologies]] of modernism, often calling into question various assumptions of [[the Enlightenment|Enlightenment rationality]]. Consequently, common targets of postmodern critique include [[universalism|universalist]] notions of [[objective reality]], [[moral universalism|morality]], [[truth]], [[human nature]], [[reason]], [[science]], [[language]], and [[social progress]]. Postmodern thinkers frequently call attention to the [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] or [[social conditioning|socially-conditioned]] nature of [[knowledge]] claims and [[value system]]s, situating them as products of particular political, historical, or cultural [[discourse]]s and [[hierarchies]]. Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to [[self-reference|self-referentiality]], [[epistemological relativism|epistemological]] and [[moral relativism]], [[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]], and irreverence.\n\nPostmodern critical approaches gained purchase in the 1980s and 1990s, and have been adopted in a variety of academic and theoretical disciplines, including [[cultural studies]], [[philosophy of science]], [[economics]], [[linguistics]], [[architecture]], [[feminist theory]], and [[literary criticism]], as well as [[Postmodern art|art movements]] in fields such as [[postmodern literature|literature]], [[contemporary art]], and music. Postmodernism is often associated with schools of thought such as [[deconstruction]], [[post-structuralism]], and [[institutional critique]], as well as philosophers such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Fredric Jameson]].\n\n[[Criticism of postmodernism|Criticisms of postmodernism]] are intellectually diverse, and include assertions that postmodernism promotes [[obscurantism]], is meaningless, and that it adds nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge.\n\n== Overview ==\nPostmodernism is an intellectual stance<ref>{{cite book | last = Bauman | first = Zygmunt | title = Intimations of postmodernity | page = 26 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780415067508 }}</ref> or a mode of discourse<ref>Nuyen, A.T., 1992.

The group performed until illness forced longtime lead singer Marvin Junior and bass vocalist Chuck Barksdale into retirement, ending the group's 60-year run.\n\n==History==\n===Early career===\nThe Dells grew up in [[Harvey, Illinois]] and began singing together while attending [[Thornton Township High School]]. Forming in 1952 under the name the El-Rays, the group initially consisted of Marvin Junior, Mickey McGill, Lucius McGill, Verne Allison, Chuck Barksdale, and Johnny Funches. Lucius McGill soon left the group and the remaining quintet signed with [[Checker Records]], releasing their first single, \"Darling I Know,\" which flopped.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nIn 1955, the group renamed themselves the Dells and signed with [[Vee-Jay Records]]. In 1956, they recorded their first hit, \"[[Oh, What a Night (The Dells song)|Oh, What a Night]]\" (a song co-written by Johnny Funches, who also sang lead on the recording alongside Marvin Junior<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyeurope.com/references/messages/johnny_funches.htm |title=Johnny Funches (The Dells) |website=Rockabillyeurope.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-26}}</ref>), which hit the Top 5 of the R&B singles chart.

In November 1958, the Dells suffered a car accident that left McGill in a hospital in Ohio for six months. The group temporarily disbanded and Barksdale sang as a member of [[Harvey Fuqua]]'s spinoff [[The Moonglows|Moonglows]] act, Harvey and the Moonglows, which included a young [[Marvin Gaye]]. In 1961, the Dells reunited and auditioned for [[Dinah Washington]]. After Washington agreed to hire them, Johnny Funches left the group to take care of his family. Funches was replaced by [[The Flamingos|Flamingos]] founding member [[Johnny Carter (singer)|Johnny Carter]] and sang background for Washington for two years. In 1966, they were hired to open for [[Ray Charles]], only to be fired after a performance resulted in several standing ovations.<ref name=\"more miles\">{{cite book |last=Cartwright |first1=Garth |title=More Miles Than Money: Journeys Through American Music |publisher=Profile Books |date=2009 |page=337 |isbn=978-1-84765-298-0 |quote='Then we played Carnegie Hall and got like five standing ovations.

In 1967, the Dells issued the album ''There Is'' which included their first R&B chart-topper in years with the title track, which showcased the sharp baritone of Marvin Junior and the harmonies with the four other Dells. The song was also their first top 20 pop hit.\n\nSubsequent R&B hits included \"Wear It on Our Face,\" \"Always Together\" (Top 20 Pop), \"[[I Can Sing a Rainbow]] - [[L'amour est bleu|Love is Blue]] (medley)\" ([[UK Singles Chart|UK]] No. 15),<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 150}}</ref> and their first No. 1 R&B hit and first Top Ten pop hit, 1968's \"[[Stay in My Corner]],\"<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> which reached No. 10 on the pop chart and showcased both Carter and Marvin in lead vocals. In the following year, 1969, The Dells' [[soul music|soulful]] remake of their debut hit, \"Oh What a Night\" gave the group their second chart-topping R&B single and also reached the top ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. For a second time, the song sold over a million copies.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> Subsequent hits included \"Open Up My Heart,\" \"Oh What A Day,\" and \"On the Dock of the Bay.\"<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In 1971, the Dells' \"The Love We Had Stays on My Mind\" became another Top Ten hit on the R&B chart, also reaching the pop Top 30.

The Dells were confined mostly to the oldies market afterwards until they were asked to be creative consultants to [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]]'s acclaimed 1991 film, ''[[The Five Heartbeats]]'', which was loosely based on the lives of The Dells and other groups of its era.<ref name=\"5heartbeats msn\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730100819/http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/the-five-heartbeats/|title=The Five Heartbeats : Overview|quote=Loosely based on the life and times of several R&B; artists (The Dells, The Temptations, Frankie Lymon, Sam Cooke and others) The Five Heartbeats traces the rise and fall of a popular African-American 1950s singing aggregation|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=September 3, 2019}}</ref> The group recorded a composition titled \"[[A Heart Is a House for Love]]\". The song reached number 13 on the Billboard R&B chart, making them only one of two groups to have hit singles in five decades. The following year, signing with [[Philadelphia International Records|PIR]], they released the album, ''I Salute You''. The Dells continued performing and recording sporadically in the early years of the new millennium. In 2004, the group were inducted to both the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The group performed until illness forced longtime lead singer Marvin Junior and bass vocalist Chuck Barksdale into retirement, ending the group's 60-year run.\n\n==History==\n===Early career===\nThe Dells grew up in [[Harvey, Illinois]] and began singing together while attending [[Thornton Township High School]]. Forming in 1952 under the name the El-Rays, the group initially consisted of Marvin Junior, Mickey McGill, Lucius McGill, Verne Allison, Chuck Barksdale, and Johnny Funches. McGill soon left the group and the remaining quintet signed with [[Checker Records]], releasing their first single, \"Darling I Know,\" which flopped.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nIn 1955, the group renamed themselves the Dells and signed with [[Vee-Jay Records]]. In 1956, they recorded their first hit, \"[[Oh, What a Night (The Dells song)|Oh, What a Night]]\" (a song co-written by Johnny Funches, who also sang lead on the recording alongside Marvin Junior<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyeurope.com/references/messages/johnny_funches.htm |title=Johnny Funches (The Dells) |website=Rockabillyeurope.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-26}}</ref>), which hit the Top 5 of the R&B singles chart.

In November 1958, the Dells suffered a car accident that left McGill in a hospital in Ohio for six months. The group temporarily disbanded and Barksdale sang as a member of [[Harvey Fuqua]]'s spinoff [[The Moonglows|Moonglows]] act, Harvey and the Moonglows, which included a young [[Marvin Gaye]]. In 1961, the Dells reunited and auditioned for [[Dinah Washington]]. After Washington agreed to hire them, Johnny Funches left the group to take care of his family. Funches was replaced by [[The Flamingos|Flamingos]] founding member [[Johnny Carter (singer)|Johnny Carter]] and sang background for Washington for two years. In 1966, they were hired to open for [[Ray Charles]], only to be fired after a performance resulted in several standing ovations.<ref name=\"more miles\">{{cite book |last=Cartwright |first1=Garth |title=More Miles Than Money: Journeys Through American Music |publisher=Profile Books |date=2009 |page=337 |isbn=978-1-84765-298-0 |quote='Then we played Carnegie Hall and got like five standing ovations.

In 1967, the Dells issued the album ''There Is'' which included their first R&B chart-topper in years with the title track, which showcased the sharp baritone of Marvin Junior and the harmonies with the four other Dells. The song was also their first top 20 pop hit.\n\nSubsequent R&B hits included \"Wear It on Our Face,\" \"Always Together\" (Top 20 Pop), \"[[I Can Sing a Rainbow]] - [[L'amour est bleu|Love is Blue]] (medley)\" ([[UK Singles Chart|UK]] No. 15),<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 150}}</ref> and their first No. 1 R&B hit and first Top Ten pop hit, 1968's \"[[Stay in My Corner]],\"<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> which reached No. 10 on the pop chart and showcased both Carter and Marvin in lead vocals. In the following year, 1969, The Dells' [[soul music|soulful]] remake of their debut hit, \"Oh What a Night\" gave the group their second chart-topping R&B single and also reached the top ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. For a second time, the song sold over a million copies.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> Subsequent hits included \"Open Up My Heart,\" \"Oh What A Day,\" and \"On the Dock of the Bay.\"<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In 1971, the Dells' \"The Love We Had Stays on My Mind\" became another Top Ten hit on the R&B chart, also reaching the pop Top 30. By this time Charles Stepney had taken over production duties from Bobby Miller. 1973's \"Give Your Baby a Standing Ovation\" was their third certified gold record.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> The song was [[Songwriter|written]] by [[L.V.

The Dells were confined mostly to the oldies market afterwards until they were asked to be creative consultants to [[Robert Townsend (actor)|Robert Townsend]]'s acclaimed 1991 film, ''[[The Five Heartbeats]]'', which was loosely based on the lives of The Dells and other groups of its era.<ref name=\"5heartbeats msn\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730100819/http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/the-five-heartbeats/|title=The Five Heartbeats : Overview|quote=Loosely based on the life and times of several R&B; artists (The Dells, The Temptations, Frankie Lymon, Sam Cooke and others) The Five Heartbeats traces the rise and fall of a popular African-American 1950s singing aggregation|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=September 3, 2019}}</ref> The group recorded a composition titled \"[[A Heart Is a House for Love]]\". The song reached number 13 on the Billboard R&B chart, making them only one of two groups to have hit singles in five decades. The following year, signing with [[Philadelphia International Records|PIR]], they released the album, ''I Salute You''. The Dells continued performing and recording sporadically in the early years of the new millennium. In 2004, the group were inducted to both the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].
