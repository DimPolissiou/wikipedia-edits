{"title_page": "Abortion in Italy", "text_new": "'''Abortion in Italy''' became legal in May 1978, when [[Italy|Italian]] women were allowed to terminate a [[pregnancy]] on request during the first 90 days. A proposal to repeal the law was considered in a [[1981 Italian referendums|1981 referendum]], but was rejected by nearly 68% of voters; another referendum aimed at eliminating the restrictions was rejected by 88.4%.<ref>http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/ccies/it.php#contracep</ref>\n \nItalian women are eligible to request an abortion for health, economic or social reasons, including the circumstances under which conception occurred. Abortions are performed free-of-charge in public hospitals or in private structures authorized by the regional health authorities. The law also allows termination in the second trimester of the pregnancy only when the life of the woman would be at risk if the pregnancy is carried to term or the fetus carries genetic or other serious malformations which would put the mother at risk of serious psychological or physical consequences.\n\nThe law states that, unless a state of emergency requires immediate intervention, a period of seven days, not compulsory, has to occur between the medical authorization and the effective date of the termination. Although the law only permits pregnancy termination to women at least eighteen years old, it also includes provisions for women younger than eighteen, who can request the intervention of a judge when the legal tutor refuses the intervention, or there are reasons to exclude the legal tutor from the process. The judge has to make a decision within five days of the request. Women younger than eighteen don't need parental consent in case of urgent situation or after 90 days.<ref name=ItalianLaw1978no194/>\n\n==Legal induced abortions==\n\nSince 1980, the [[Laboratory]] of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the High Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, ISS) in Rome has maintained a surveillance system for legal induced abortions. This system is based on quarterly reporting by the regional health authorities. A standardized form is compiled that contains aggregate data on major social-demographic characteristics of the woman (age, residency status, marital status, reproductive history) as well as details about the procedure (weeks of gestation, whether the procedure is elective or performed on an emergency basis, where certification was issued, type of procedure and location where it was performed, duration of stay, and immediate complications). This information is then sent to the ISS, which examines data quality and performs data analysis of trends, geographic distribution, and characteristics of women undergoing abortion. These analyses are performed annually by the ISS and the Ministry of Health (MH) and presented by the Minister of Health to the Parliament; results are also published in ISTISAN reports, an official publication of the ISS. Italy is considered to have one of the most accurate and timely abortion surveillance systems in the world.\n\n==Abortion rate==\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn 1993, the [[abortion]] ratio in Italy was 9.8 per 1,000 live births, less than 1% (Table 2).{{dubious|date=August 2019}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} Other numbers mentioned are 21% of pregnancies terminated in 1993, and 15% in 2016.<ref>Johnston's Archive, abortion statistics and other data. Historical abortion statistics, Italy [http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/ab-italy.html]</ref> However, this measure also varies regionally. The central and northern regions (in particular [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Liguria]] and [[Tuscany]]) are characterized by relatively low TFRs (one lifetime birth per woman), high abortion rates and elevated abortion ratios. While low levels of fertility can also be found in some of the northwestern regions, abortion rates are moderate in these regions (9-12 abortions per 1,000);{{dubious|date=August 2019}} therefore, abortion ratios in a few of these areas are closer to the national level.\n\nSubsequent to the legalization of abortion in Italy in 1978, abortion rates among Italian women first rose and then declined steadily, from a peak of 16.9 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age in 1983 to 9.8 per 1,000 in 1993. Abortion rates vary considerably by [[geographic]] region, with rates typically highest in the more secular regions and lowest in regions where [[traditional values]] predominate. Data from 1981 and 1991 indicate that age-specific abortion rates decreased during the 1980s for all age-groups, with the largest declines occurring in regions with the highest levels of abortion. Moreover, a shift in the age distribution of abortion rates occurred during the 1980s, with women aged 30\u201334 registering the highest abortion rate in 1991, whereas in 1981 the highest level of abortion occurred among those aged 25\u201329. The abortion rate among adolescent women was low at both times (7.6 per 1,000 in 1981 and 4.6 per 1,000 in 1991). These data are based only on reported legal abortions; the number of clandestine abortions remains unknown.\n\nA phenomenon to emerge in recent years has been an increase in the number of abortions requested by immigrant women. Among the 138,357 abortions performed in 1993, 13,826 (10%) involved foreign residents, an increase from 9,850 in 1996. This increase is most likely due to the rising number of immigrant women in Italy; the resident permits, for example, according to the data of the National Statistics Institute (ISTAT), have increased from 678,000 in 1995 to 1,100,000 in 1999. Based on estimates of the population of immigrant women 18\u201349 years of age, Istat has calculated that the AR for immigrant women was 28.7/1000 in 1998, approximately three times higher than that observed in Italian citizens. Indeed, the increase in the numbers of immigrant women may be the main cause of the leveling-off of the abortion rate in Italy. If the analysis of trends is limited to 1996\u20131998, years for which information is most complete on residency status, the number of abortions in Italian women declined from 127,700 in 1996 to 123,728 in 1998.\n\n==Abortion incidence==\nIn 1993, approximately 140,000 induced abortions were performed in Italy. In comparison, the average annual number during the period 1982-1984 was more than 230,000. Similar patterns can also be seen in abortion rates. After legalization, abortion rates rose modestly, increasing from 13.7 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344 in 1979 to a peak of 16.9 per 1,000 in 1982 and 1983. During the period 1982\u20131984, Italian abortion rates stabilized, and this period was followed by a steady decline: By 1986, the rate had dropped to 14.0 abortions per 1,000 women, and by 1990 it had reached 11.1 per 1,000; by 1993, the abortion rate had decreased to 9.8 per 1,000.<ref name=\"bettarini1996\">Salvini Bettarini, Silvana. \"Induced Abortion in Italy: levels, Trends, and Charastics.\" Guttmacher Institute . 6 Nov. 1996.

The percentage is growing in all the [[macroregion]]s except the North. As a result, voluntary abortion is performed only in 60% of the hospitals of the country. Also, non-objecting doctors suffers discrimination, and -in some provinces- needs to perform record-numbers of abortions, up to 15.8 per week in the [[province of Taranto]] ([[Apulia]]) or 12.2 in the [[province of Catania]] ([[Sicily]]).<ref name=EDJNet>{{cite news |last1=Tamma |first1=Paola |title=Even where abortion is legal, access is not granted|url=https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/News/Data-news/Even-where-abortion-is-legal-access-is-not-granted |accessdate=22 August 2018 |work=VoxEurop/EDJNet |date=24 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nA resolution by the [[Council of Europe]] has found several violations of the [[European Social Charter]] in the situation:\n* [[right to health|right to protection of health]] (art. 11) of women seeking abortion;\n* [[right to work]] (art. 1) and to [[dignity]] at work (art. 26) of non-objecting medical practitioners, because of different treatment and moral harassment.<ref>{{cite web |title=Resolution CM/ResChS(2016)3 |url=https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectId=0900001680687bdc |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=European Social Charter (Revised) |url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168007cf93 |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Catholic Church and abortion]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=ItalianLaw1978no194>Standards for social protection of motherhood and on abortion, 194 Italy (1978) <http://www.urich.edu/~jolt/vlil/burk.html{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}> (Italian language).</ref>>}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n*Spinelli, Angela, & Grandolfo, Michele.

A proposal to repeal the law was considered in a [[1981 Italian referendums|1981 referendum]], but was rejected by nearly 68% of voters; another referendum aimed at eliminating the restrictions was rejected by 88.4%.<ref>http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/ccies/it.php#contracep</ref>\n \nItalian women are eligible to request an abortion for health, economic or social reasons, including the circumstances under which conception occurred. Abortions are performed free-of-charge in public hospitals or in private structures authorized by the regional health authorities. The law also allows termination in the second trimester of the pregnancy only when the life of the woman would be at risk if the pregnancy is carried to term or the fetus carries genetic or other serious malformations which would put the mother at risk of serious psychological or physical consequences.\n\nThe law states that, unless a state of emergency requires immediate intervention, a period of seven days, not compulsory, has to occur between the medical authorization and the effective date of the termination. Although the law only permits pregnancy termination to women at least eighteen years old, it also includes provisions for women younger than eighteen, who can request the intervention of a judge when the legal tutor refuses the intervention, or there are reasons to exclude the legal tutor from the process. The judge has to make a decision within five days of the request. Women younger than eighteen don't need parental consent in case of urgent situation or after 90 days.<ref name=ItalianLaw1978no194/>\n\n==Legal induced abortions==\n\nSince 1980, the [[Laboratory]] of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the High Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, ISS) in Rome has maintained a surveillance system for legal induced abortions. This system is based on quarterly reporting by the regional health authorities. A standardized form is compiled that contains aggregate data on major social-demographic characteristics of the woman (age, residency status, marital status, reproductive history) as well as details about the procedure (weeks of gestation, whether the procedure is elective or performed on an emergency basis, where certification was issued, type of procedure and location where it was performed, duration of stay, and immediate complications). This information is then sent to the ISS, which examines data quality and performs data analysis of trends, geographic distribution, and characteristics of women undergoing abortion. These analyses are performed annually by the ISS and the Ministry of Health (MH) and presented by the Minister of Health to the Parliament; results are also published in ISTISAN reports, an official publication of the ISS. Italy is considered to have one of the most accurate and timely abortion surveillance systems in the world.\n\n==Abortion rate==\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn 1993, the [[abortion]] ratio in Italy was 9.8 per 1,000 live births, less than 1% (Table 2).{{dubious|date=August 2019}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} Other numbers mentioned are 21% of pregnancies terminated in 1993, and 15% in 2016.<ref>Johnston's Archive, abortion statistics and other data. Historical abortion statistics, Italy [http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/ab-italy.html]</ref> However, this measure also varies regionally. The central and northern regions (in particular [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Liguria]] and [[Tuscany]]) are characterized by relatively low TFRs (one lifetime birth per woman), high abortion rates and elevated abortion ratios. While low levels of fertility can also be found in some of the northwestern regions, abortion rates are moderate in these regions (9-12 abortions per 1,000);{{dubious|date=August 2019}} therefore, abortion ratios in a few of these areas are closer to the national level.\n\nSubsequent to the legalization of abortion in Italy in 1978, abortion rates among Italian women first rose and then declined steadily, from a peak of 16.9 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age in 1983 to 9.8 per 1,000 in 1993. Abortion rates vary considerably by [[geographic]] region, with rates typically highest in the more secular regions and lowest in regions where [[traditional values]] predominate. Data from 1981 and 1991 indicate that age-specific abortion rates decreased during the 1980s for all age-groups, with the largest declines occurring in regions with the highest levels of [[abortion]]. Moreover, a shift in the age distribution of abortion rates occurred during the 1980s, with women aged 30\u201334 registering the highest abortion rate in 1991, whereas in 1981 the highest level of abortion occurred among those aged 25\u201329. The abortion rate among adolescent women was low at both times (7.6 per 1,000 in 1981 and 4.6 per 1,000 in 1991). These data are based only on reported legal abortions; the number of clandestine abortions remains unknown.\n\nA phenomenon to emerge in recent years has been an increase in the number of abortions requested by immigrant women. Among the 138,357 abortions performed in 1993, 13,826 (10%) involved foreign residents, an increase from 9,850 in 1996. This increase is most likely due to the rising number of immigrant women in Italy; the resident permits, for example, according to the data of the National Statistics Institute (ISTAT), have increased from 678,000 in 1995 to 1,100,000 in 1999. Based on estimates of the population of immigrant women 18\u201349 years of age, Istat has calculated that the AR for immigrant women was 28.7/1000 in 1998, approximately three times higher than that observed in Italian citizens. Indeed, the increase in the numbers of immigrant women may be the main cause of the leveling-off of the abortion rate in Italy. If the analysis of trends is limited to 1996-1998, years for which information is most complete on residency status, the number of abortions in Italian women declined from 127,700 in 1996 to 123,728 in 1998.\n\n==Abortion incidence==\nIn 1993, approximately 140,000 induced abortions were performed in Italy. In comparison, the average annual number during the period 1982-1984 was more than 230,000. Similar patterns can also be seen in abortion rates. After legalization, abortion rates rose modestly, increasing from 13.7 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344 in 1979 to a peak of 16.9 per 1,000 in 1982 and 1983. During the period 1982-1984, Italian abortion rates stabilized, and this period was followed by a steady decline: By 1986, the rate had dropped to 14.0 abortions per 1,000 women, and by 1990 it had reached 11.1 per 1,000; by 1993, the abortion rate had decreased to 9.8 per 1,000.<ref name=\"bettarini1996\">Salvini Bettarini, Silvana. \"Induced Abortion in Italy: levels, Trends, and Charastics.\" Guttmacher Institute . 6 Nov. 1996.

He is most renowned for the design of the [[Helsinki City Theatre]] (1961\u201367).\n\n== Early life and education ==\nTimo Jussi Penttil\u00e4 was born 16 March 1931 in [[Tampere]] to Arvo Mikko Penttil\u00e4 and Ester Elviira Matinheimo. His father was agronomist and acted as a supervisor improving cattle in the country. Penttil\u00e4 graduated from Tampere secondary school in 1950 and went on to study architecture at [[Helsinki University of Technology]], graduating in 1956.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1957\u20131959 he worked for architect [[Aarne Ervi]] before founding his own office. His breakthrough work was Sampola House, the Tampere Adult Education Centre, which Penttil\u00e4 designed together with Kari Virta in 1958 and which was completed in 1960. The following year, at the age of 30, Penttil\u00e4 won the architecture competition for the design of the Helsinki City Theatre, a work which when completed in 1967 received much critical acclaim. The building is an example of Penttil\u00e4's soft, human-centric Modernism which has similarities to the mature works of Finland's most well-known architect, [[Alvar Aalto]]; indeed the building is often mistakenly assumed to be an Aalto design.\n\nThe Helsinki City Theatre has remained Penttil\u00e4's most renowned work, but among his other building designs the best known are the [[Tampere Stadium|Ratina Stadium]] in Tampere (1965) the Hanasaari B power station in Helsinki (1974), the Salmisaari power station (with Kari Lind and Heikki Saarela) in Helsinki (1985). During his career, Penttil\u00e4 was criticized within the Finnish architectural profession for following uncompromisingly the modernist desire for experimentation and for defending the autonomy of architecture.\nPenttil\u00e4 was director of the [[Museum of Finnish Architecture]] in 1976\u20131980, and was a frequent contributor to the Finnish Architecture Review (Arkkitehti) from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, writing a number of polemical articles about architecture and the profession. An exhibition of his works was held at the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in London in 1980.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Penttil\u00e4 participated in a number of architectural competitions for the design of cultural and public buildings in the Middle East, including [[Bahrain|Bahrain's]] cultural centre (1976), the [[Iran]]ian National Library in Tehran (1978), and the [[United Arab Emirates]] Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1979) - but none of which were built. In the later 1980s he courted controversy by designing a series of four 40-storey skyscrapers for the centre of his home town, Tampere. Local grass-roots opposition brought an end to the scheme which had been commissioned by the industrial company Tampella to redevelop an area where their factory then presently stood.\n\nPenttil\u00e4 was a visiting lecturer at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1968\u201369. He was professor of architecture at  the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]] from 1980 to 1996, where he succeeded [[Roland Rainer]]. After his retirement he lived in Italy and [[Lapland (Finland)]]. Following his death it emerged that he had written an extensive book on architecture theory. This was eventually published in 2013, by the Finnish publishers Gaudeamus, under the title \"Oikeat ja v\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4t arkkitehdit \u2013 2000 vuotta arkkitehtuuriteoriaa\" (Right and wrong architects \u2013 2000 years of architecture theory).
