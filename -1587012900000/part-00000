The band is known for [[musical improvisation]], extended [[Jam session#Rock|jams]], blending of [[Music genre|genres]], and a dedicated [[Fandom|fan base]]. The band consists of guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], drummer [[Jon Fishman]], and keyboardist [[Page McConnell]], all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the primary lead vocalist.\n\nThe band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist [[Jeff Holdsworth]], who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the quartet lineup has remained in place since then. Their lineup stable, Phish performed together for 15 years before beginning a two-year hiatus in October 2000. The band regrouped in late 2002, but disbanded in August 2004 after a farewell performance at their [[Phish festivals#Coventry|Coventry Festival]] in Vermont. They reunited in March 2009 for a series of three consecutive concerts at [[Hampton Coliseum]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]], and have since resumed performing regularly.\n\nPhish's music blends elements of a wide variety of genres,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phish.net/faq/whatisphish|title= What Is Phish? |accessdate=2011-02-09 |work=FAQ Files|publisher=Phish.net}}</ref> including [[funk]], [[progressive rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[country music|country]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[Pop music|pop]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/183259-phish-fuego/ | title=Phish - Fuego | magazine=[[PopMatters]] | date=July 1, 2014 | accessdate=September 3, 2015 | author=Conaton, Chris}}</ref> The band was part of a movement of improvisational rock groups, inspired by the [[Grateful Dead]] and colloquially known as \"[[jam band]]s\", which gained considerable popularity as touring concert acts in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |title=8 Bands Carrying on Jerry Garcia's Legacy |url=http://www.legacy.com/news/culture-and-trends/article/8-bands-carrying-on-jerry-garcias-legacy |website=Legacy.com |accessdate=14 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Hyden |first1=Steven |title=Is Phish a Great Band? |url=http://grantland.com/features/after-30-years-consider-phish-great-band/ |website=Grantland |accessdate=14 December 2018 |date=6 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nPhish has developed a large and dedicated following by word of mouth, the exchange of live recordings, and selling over 8 million albums and DVDs in the United States.<ref name=\"news\">{{cite web | title = News Archives | url = http://phish.com/#/news/index.php?year=2009&hash=story460 |publisher=Phish.com | accessdate = 2011-01-28}}</ref> In 1998, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described Phish as \"the most important band of the '90s.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perella |first1=Dominic |title=Anastasio puts Phish behind him with strong solo effort |url=https://azdailysun.com/anastasio-puts-phish-behind-him-with-strong-solo-effort/article_2ef6ced0-1eb1-500c-85c4-35c5433b3c6e.html |website=Arizona Daily Sun |accessdate=25 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The magazine later wrote that the band helped to \"spawn a new wave of bands oriented around group improvisation and extended instrumental [[groove (music)|groove]]s\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/phish/biography|title=Phish|accessdate=2008-05-11|work=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414030730/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/phish/biography|archive-date=2009-04-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Formation and ''The White Tape'': 1983\u20131986===\nPhish was formed at the [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) in 1983 by guitarists [[Trey Anastasio]] and [[Jeff Holdsworth]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], and drummer [[Jon Fishman]].

In so doing, the audience was helping to create an original composition. In an experiment known as \"The Rotation Jam\", each member would switch instruments with the musician on his left. On occasion, performances of \"[[You Enjoy Myself]]\" involved Gordon and Anastasio performing synchronized maneuvers and jumping on mini-[[trampoline]]s while simultaneously playing their instruments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phish.net/faq/antics| title= Phish On-stage Antics|work=FAQ Files |publisher=Phish.net| accessdate=2011-02-09}}</ref> Fishman would also regularly step out from behind his drum kit during concerts to sing cover songs, which were often punctuated by him playing an [[Electrolux]] vacuum cleaner like an instrument.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vacuum Solo History - Phish.net |url=http://phish.net/song/vacuum-solo/history |website=phish.net |accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Phish Stories: An Interview with Jon Fishman (Relix Revisited) |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/phish-stories-an-interview-with-jon-fishman-relix-revisited/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=6 October 2019 |date=24 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe band released their second album, ''[[Lawn Boy]]'', in September 1990 on Absolute A Go Go, a small independent label that had a distribution deal with the larger [[Rough Trade Records]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Puterbaugh |first1=Parke |title=Phish: The Biography |date=2009 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=9780306819476 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/phishbiography00pute/page/97 97] |url=https://archive.org/details/phishbiography00pute |url-access=registration |quote=phish junta. |language=en}}</ref> The album had been recorded the previous year, after the band had won studio time at engineer Dan Archer's Archer Studios when they came in first place at an April 1989 [[Battle of the Bands|battle of the bands]] competition in Burlington.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish 'Lawn Boy' Deluxe 2-LP Vinyl Available For Record Store Day |url=http://phish.com/news/phish-lawn-boy-deluxe-2-lp-vinyl-available-for-record-store-day/ |website=Phish |accessdate=23 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nPhish, along with [[Bob Dylan]], the [[Grateful Dead]], and [[the Beatles]], was one of the first bands to have a [[Usenet]] newsgroup, rec.music.phish, which launched in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |title=Digital Flashback: Phishing For Tapes On Web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/820343/digital-flashback-phishing-for-tapes-on-web/ |website=MTV News |accessdate=26 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Aware of the band's growing popularity, [[Elektra Records]] signed them that year after they were recommended to the record label by A&R representative Sue Drew.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sue Drew Who Brought Phish To Elektra Chats With Phishbase |url=https://www.jambase.com/article/sue-drew-brought-phish-elektra-chats-phishbase |website=JamBase |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=20 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1991, the band embarked on a 14-date tour of the eastern United States accompanied by a three-piece horn section dubbed the [[Giant Country Horns]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Giant Country Horns Talk Formation, Phish & Twiddle New Year's Eve In Albany |url=https://www.jambase.com/article/giant-country-horns-talk-formation-phish-twiddle-new-years-eve-albany |website=JamBase |accessdate=24 October 2018 |date=28 December 2017}}</ref> In August of that year, Phish played an outdoor concert at their friend Amy Skelton's horse farm in [[Auburn, Maine]] that acted as a prototype for their later all-day festival events.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Puterbaugh |first1=Parke |title=Phish: The Biography |date=2010 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=9780306819209 |pages=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXD8AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=phish&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the band released their third studio album, ''[[A Picture of Nectar]]'', their first release for the major label Elektra.

[[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[hard rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[post-punk]] and various \"acoustic\" genres, such as [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as [[a cappella]] (unaccompanied) sections of [[barbershop quartet]]-style vocal harmonies.\n\nSome of their original compositions tend towards a [[psychedelic rock]] fusion, with more progressive, jazz and [[funk]] elements than the [[Grateful Dead]] and other earlier [[jam band]]s. Their more ambitious, epic compositions (such as \"[[You Enjoy Myself]]\" and \"Guyute\") are often said to resemble classical music in a rock setting, much like the music of one of their heroes, [[Frank Zappa]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Phish were often compared to the Grateful Dead, a comparison that the band members often resisted or distanced themselves from. In November 1995, Anastasio told the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' \"When we first came into the awareness of the media, it would always be the Dead or Zappa they'd compare us to.

Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same. With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot, complete with \"Shakedown Street\": at times a garment district, art district, food court, or pharmacy.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run Like an Antelope: On the Road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 95] | url=https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 }}</ref> For many, one concert is simply a prelude to the next as the community follows the band around the country. Their image and fan devotion could be compared to that of the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\nPhish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often [[segue]] into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Ryan |title=Freshwater Phish: Introduction |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/126520/freshwater-phish-introduction/ |website=The Young Folks |accessdate=11 April 2019 |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; Those include \"Possum\", \"Mike's Song\", \"I Am Hydrogen\", \"Weekapaug Groove\", \"Harry Hood\", \"Runaway Jim\", \"Suzy Greenberg\", \"AC/DC Bag\" and \"The Lizards\", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Histories |url=http://phish.net/song |website=phish.net |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nBecause Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. Official [[soundboard recording]]s can be purchased through the Live Phish website.

Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.\n\nFans recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like [[Ticketmaster]].

The band is known for [[musical improvisation]], extended [[Jam session#Rock|jams]], blending of [[Music genre|genres]], and a dedicated [[Fandom|fan base]]. The band consists of guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], drummer [[Jon Fishman]], and keyboardist [[Page McConnell]], all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the primary lead vocalist.\n\nThe band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist [[Jeff Holdsworth]], who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the quartet lineup has remained in place since then.

[[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[hard rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[post-punk]] and various \"acoustic\" genres, such as [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as [[a cappella]] (unaccompanied) sections of [[barbershop quartet]]-style vocal harmonies.\n\nSome of their original compositions tend towards a [[psychedelic rock]] fusion, with more progressive, jazz and [[funk]] elements than the [[Grateful Dead]] and other earlier [[jam band]]s. Their more ambitious, epic compositions (such as \"[[You Enjoy Myself]]\" and \"Guyute\") are often said to resemble classical music in a rock setting, much like the music of one of their heroes, [[Frank Zappa]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Phish were often compared to the Grateful Dead, a comparison that the band members often resisted or distanced themselves from. In November 1995, Anastasio told the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' \"When we first came into the awareness of the media, it would always be the Dead or Zappa they'd compare us to.

Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same. With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot, complete with \"Shakedown Street\": at times a garment district, art district, food court, or pharmacy.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run Like an Antelope: On the Road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 95] | url=https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 }}</ref> For many, one concert is simply a prelude to the next as the community follows the band around the country. Their image and fan devotion could be compared to that of the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\nPhish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often [[segue]] into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Ryan |title=Freshwater Phish: Introduction |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/126520/freshwater-phish-introduction/ |website=The Young Folks |accessdate=11 April 2019 |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; Those include \"Possum\", \"Mike's Song\", \"I Am Hydrogen\", \"Weekapaug Groove\", \"Harry Hood\", \"Runaway Jim\", \"Suzy Greenberg\", \"AC/DC Bag\" and \"The Lizards\", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Histories |url=http://phish.net/song |website=phish.net |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nBecause Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. Official [[soundboard recording]]s can be purchased through the Live Phish website.

Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.\n\nFans recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like [[Ticketmaster]].

It spent two weeks atop the ''[[New York Times]]'' Bestseller List and reached number 3 on the ''[[USA Today]]'' bestseller list, marking the first time one of Roberts' books had become a bestseller in [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] format. A downloadable casual-play computer game based on the book was introduced by [[Oberon Media|I-Play]] in 2010.\n\nIn her thirty-year career, Roberts had published almost 200 novels. ''Vision in White'' was one of ten Roberts novels published in 2009, including five new releases and five reprints. When it was released on April 28, 2009, its cover premiered the use of a special logo to differentiate her new releases from reprints of her past works.\n\nThe novel marked Roberts' return to [[contemporary romance]]. The new series revolved around a wedding planning enterprise run by four childhood friends. This first story featured the developing relationship between wedding photographer Mackensie \"Mac\" Elliot and English professor Carter Maguire. Like several other Roberts novels, ''Vision in White'' explored how a protagonist balanced a successful career with a dysfunctional family environment. Although the hero is a fairly typical representation of the romance novel archetype of the professor, the novel is slightly unusual for a romance in that the hero must convince the heroine to take a chance on love.\n\n==Background==\n[[Nora Roberts]] is a prolific author of [[romance novel|romance]] and futuristic suspense novels.<ref name=kopun>{{citation|last=Kopun|first=Francine|title=Nora Roberts, a bestselling author rarely reviewed|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=October 19, 2009|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2009/10/19/nora_roberts_a_bestselling_author_rarely_reviewed.html|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> From 1979 through 2008, almost 200 of her novels were published.

Mac and her childhood friends Parker, Emma, and Laurel are the founders of Vows, a fictional wedding planning company in Connecticut. While accompanying his sister to a planning session at Vows, Carter renews his acquaintance with Mac, and confesses that he had been infatuated with her since high school. She is intrigued by his honesty and earnestness and decides to embark on a casual fling with him.\n\nAfter seeing her parents' numerous failed marriages, Mac does not trust the idea of commitment. Her determination to avoid emotional intimacy is reinforced as she struggles against her mother's continued tactics of [[emotional manipulation]].\n\nTheir relationship progresses slowly through the book. Each protagonist receives much advice from a large circle of friends and family. With the support of her friends and Carter, Mac develops the courage to stand up to her mother. By the end of the novel, she realizes that she does not have to relive her parents' mistakes, and chooses to embrace her love for Carter.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:NoraRoberts.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Author [[Nora Roberts]]]]\nThe four novels of the Bride Quartet share a strong emphasis on sisterhood. The heroines of the books bonded as children and have become sisters by choice. Throughout the series, they provide mutual support and acceptance of each other's quirks.

It spent two weeks atop the ''[[New York Times]]'' Bestseller List and reached number 3 on the ''[[USA Today]]'' bestseller list, marking the first time one of Roberts' books had become a bestseller in [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] format. A downloadable casual-play computer game based on the book was introduced by [[Oberon Media|I-Play]] in 2010.\n\nIn her thirty-year career, Roberts had published almost 200 novels. ''Vision in White'' was one of ten Roberts novels published in 2009, including five new releases and five reprints. When it was released on April 28, 2009, its cover premiered the use of a special logo to differentiate her new releases from reprints of her past works.\n\nThe novel marked Roberts' return to [[contemporary romance]]. The new series revolved around a wedding planning enterprise run by four childhood friends. This first story featured the developing relationship between wedding photographer Mackensie \"Mac\" Elliot and English professor Carter Maguire. Like several other Roberts novels, ''Vision in White'' explored how a protagonist balanced a successful career with a dysfunctional family environment. Although the hero is a fairly typical representation of the romance novel archetype of the professor, the novel is slightly unusual for a romance in that the hero must convince the heroine to take a chance on love.\n\n==Background==\n[[Nora Roberts]] is a prolific author of [[romance novel|romance]] and futuristic suspense novels.<ref name=kopun>{{citation|last=Kopun|first=Francine|title=Nora Roberts, a bestselling author rarely reviewed|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=October 19, 2009|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2009/10/19/nora_roberts_a_bestselling_author_rarely_reviewed.html|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> From 1979 through 2008, almost 200 of her novels were published.

The year 2000 brought additional hardship for the laboratory in the form of the [[Cerro Grande Fire]], a severe [[Wildfire|forest fire]] that destroyed several buildings (and employees' homes) and forced the laboratory to close for two weeks. In 2003, the laboratory's director ([[John C. Browne (physicist)|John Browne]]) and deputy director resigned following accusations that they had improperly dismissed two [[whistleblower]]s who had alleged widespread theft at the lab.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn July 2004, an inventory of classified weapons data revealed that four [[hard disk drive]]s were missing:  two of the drives were subsequently found to have been improperly moved to a different building, but another two remained unaccounted for.  In response, director [[Peter Nanos]] shut down large parts of the laboratory and publicly rebuked scientists working there for a lax attitude to security procedures. In the laboratory's August 2004 newsletter he wrote, \"This willful flouting of the rules must stop, and I don't care how many people I have to fire to make it stop\". Nanos is also quoted as saying, \"If I have to restart the laboratory with 10 people, I will\". However, a report released in January 2005 found that the drives were in fact an artifact of an inconsistent inventory system: the report concludes that 12 barcodes were issued to a group of disk drives that needed only 10, but the two surplus barcodes nevertheless appeared in inventory. Auditors incorrectly concluded that two disks were missing. The report states, \"The allegedly missing disks never existed and no compromise of classified material has occurred\". This incident is widely reported as contributing to continuing distrust of management at the lab.

Though the university and the laboratory had difficult relations many times since their first World War II contract, this was the first time that the university ever had to compete for management of the laboratory. The University of California decided to create a private company with the [[Bechtel]] Corporation, [[Washington Group International]], and the [[BWX Technologies]] to bid on the contract to operate the laboratory. The UC/Bechtel led corporation\u2014[[Los Alamos National Security, LLC]] (LANS)\u2014was pitted against a team formed by the [[University of Texas System]] partnered with [[Lockheed-Martin]]. In December 2005, the Department of Energy announced that LANS had won the next seven-year contract to manage and operate the laboratory.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nOn June 1, 2006, the University of California ended its sixty years of direct involvement in operating Los Alamos National Laboratory, and management control of the laboratory was taken over by [[Los Alamos National Security, LLC]] with effect October 1, 2007. Approximately 95% of the former 10,000 plus UC employees at LANL were rehired by LANS to continue working at LANL. Other than UC appointing three members to the eleven member board of directors that oversees LANS, UC now has virtually no responsibility or direct involvement in LANL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and its two national laboratories in California ([[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Lawrence Berkeley]] and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Lawrence Livermore]]) no longer apply to LANL, and the LANL director no longer reports to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President. Also, LANL employees were removed from the UC's [[403(b)]] retirement savings and defined benefits [[pension]] program and placed in a LANS run program. While the LANS retirement program provides rehired UC employees with pensions similar to those UC would have given them, LANS no longer guarantees full pensions to newly hired LANL employees. It now provides basic [[401(k)]] retirement saving options.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nOn June 8, 2018, the NNSA announced that Triad National Security, LLC, a joint venture between Batelle Memorial Institute, the University of California, and Texas A&M University, would assume operation and management of LANL beginning November 1, 2018.<ref>{{cite news |author=National Nuclear Security Administration |date=2018-06-08 |title=NNSA awards Los Alamos National Laboratory Management & Operating Contract |url=https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/articles/nnsa-awards-los-alamos-national-laboratory-management-operating-contract |location=Washington, D.C |access-date=2018-07-29 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Safety Management===\n\nIn August 2011, a near criticality incident happened with eight rods of plutonium placed close to each other to take a photo.

Los Alamos and Livermore served as the primary classified laboratories in the U.S. national laboratory system, designing all the country's nuclear arsenal. Additional work included basic scientific research, [[particle accelerator]] development, health physics, and fusion power research as part of [[Project Sherwood]]. Many nuclear tests were undertaken in the [[Marshall Islands]] and at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. During the late-1950s, a number of scientists including [[John Robert Beyster|Dr. J.

The year 2000 brought additional hardship for the laboratory in the form of the [[Cerro Grande Fire]], a severe [[Wildfire|forest fire]] that destroyed several buildings (and employees' homes) and forced the laboratory to close for two weeks. In 2003, the laboratory's director ([[John C.

In response, director [[Peter Nanos]] shut down large parts of the laboratory and publicly rebuked scientists working there for a lax attitude to security procedures. In the laboratory's August 2004 newsletter he wrote, \"This willful flouting of the rules must stop, and I don't care how many people I have to fire to make it stop\". Nanos is also quoted as saying, \"If I have to restart the laboratory with 10 people, I will\". However, a report released in January 2005 found that the drives were in fact an artifact of an inconsistent inventory system: the report concludes that 12 barcodes were issued to a group of disk drives that needed only 10, but the two surplus barcodes nevertheless appeared in inventory. Auditors incorrectly concluded that two disks were missing. The report states, \"The allegedly missing disks never existed and no compromise of classified material has occurred\".

They are used extensively in agriculture, because of their speed and light footprint.]]\n[[File:KTM Quad 990 neutral.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A KTM Quad 990 ATV]]\n\nAn '''all-terrain vehicle''' ('''ATV'''), also known as a '''quad (bike)''', '''three-wheeler''', '''four-track''',  '''four-wheeler''', or '''quadricycle''', as defined by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) is a vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars for steering control.  As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles.  Although it is a [[street-legal vehicle]] in some countries, it is not street-legal within most states, territories, and provinces of [[Australia]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]].\n\nBy the current ANSI definition, ATVs are intended for use by a single operator, although some companies have developed ATVs intended for use by the operator and one passenger. In some countries, the passenger is not required to wear a helmet.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}  These ATVs are referred to as tandem ATVs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/frnotices/fr06/066703.html|title=Standards for All Terrain Vehicles and Ban of Three-Wheeled All Terrain Vehicles; Proposed Rule|publisher=Consumer Product Safety Commission (Federal Register)|date=10 August 2006|accessdate=26 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113022054/http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/frnotices/fr06/066703.html|archivedate=13 January 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe rider sits on and operates these vehicles like a motorcycle, but the extra wheels give more stability at slower speeds. Also dirt bikes are considered to be ATVs as that they were designed for off-road use only. Although most are equipped with three or four wheels, six-wheel models exist for specialized applications. [[Engine displacement|Engine sizes]] of ATVs currently for sale in the United States, (as of 2008 products), range from {{convert|49|to|1000|cc|L CID|sigfig=2|abbr=on|lk=out}}.\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\n[[Royal Enfield]] built and sold the first powered quadracycle in 1893. It had many bicycle components, including handle bars.

With the introduction of straddle ridden ATVs, the term AATV was introduced to define the original [[amphibious ATV]] category.\n\n===ATC Development===\n\n{{Main|List of Honda three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n{{Main|List of Yamaha Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n{{Main|List of Kawasaki Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n{{Main|List of Suzuki Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n\nThe first [[three-wheeler|three-wheeled]] ATV was the [[Sperry-Rand]] Tricart.  It was designed in 1967 as a graduate project of John Plessinger at the Cranbrook Academy of Arts near Detroit.  The Tricart was straddle-ridden with a sit-in rather than sit-on style (similar to the contemporaneous [[Big Wheel (tricycle)|Big Wheel toy]]).  In 1968 Plessinger sold the Tricart patents and design rights to Sperry-Rand [[New Holland Agriculture|New Holland]] who manufactured them commercially.  Numerous small American manufacturers of 3-wheelers followed.  These small manufacturers were unable to compete when larger motorcycle companies like Honda entered the market in 1969.\n \n[[File:1984 Honda 200s.jpg|thumb|1984 Honda ATC200S, one of the many three-wheeled models made by Honda and other manufacturers]]\n\n[[Honda]] introduced their first sit-on straddle-ridden three-wheeled All Terrain Vehicle in 1969, known as a [[Honda US90|US90]], as a 1970 Model. Variations would be popularized in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] movie, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' and TV shows such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' and ''[[Hart to Hart]]''. In 1973, Honda would trademark the term \"All Terrain Cycle\" (ATC), applying the moniker to all Honda produced Three-wheeled ATV\u2019s, and creating the universal name which now  associated with all vehicles of this type. Being directly influenced by earlier 6-wheeled [[All-terrain vehicle#Six-wheeled AATVs|AATV's]] of the sixties, it utilized balloon tires for both a low environmental impact and to compensate for a lack of [[Suspension (motorcycle)|mechanical suspension]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html|title=ATC90 History|author =Chris Cooper|accessdate=2 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061216144600/http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html| archivedate= 16 December 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nHonda entered the 1980's with a virtual monopoly in the market, due to effective patents on design and engine placement. By 1980, other companies would paid patent royalties to Honda to enter the lucrative ATC field with their own machines. Yamaha introduced their first ATC, the Tri-Moto YZ125. Kawasaki followed suit the next year with the KLT200, while Suzuki produced their first effort, the ALT125, in 1982. As the popularity of ATC\u2019s increased dramatically, rapid development ensued. The ability to go anywhere on terrain that most other vehicles could not cross soon made them popular with US and Canadian hunters, and those just looking for a good trail ride. As other manufacturers were entering the market, Honda was diversifying, offering the [[ATC250R]], the first [[All-terrain vehicle#Sport competition|Sport ATC]] intended for competition, in 1981. The 1982 Honda ATC200E Big Red was a landmark model. It featured both suspension and racks, making it the first ATC designed specifically for utility, and would become the worlds best-selling ATC. Honda followed that effort in 1983 with the [[Honda Sport ATCs#Honda ATC200X|ATC200X]], an easy-to-handle {{convert|192|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[four-stroke]] Sport ATC that was ideal for new riders.\n\nNot to be outdone, Kawasaki and Yamaha responded with their own Sport ATC's. 1984 saw the release of the '''Kawasaki KXT250 Tecate''', and Yamaha followed in 1985 with the '''Tri-Z 250'''. Both were liquid Cooled 250cc two-strokes capable of giving the Honda ATC250R competition. In response to growing market, American Specialty manufacturer [[Tiger ATV LTD|Tiger]] also introduced a series of ATC's, Hand-built-to-order models that included the '''Tiger 500''', the largest displacement ATC produced commercially. While Kawasaki produced Utility ATC's, famously making the '''KLT 250 Police''' model, Yamaha focused on Sport and Recreation models, and Suzuki turned their attention to building Sport Quads.\n\nHonda continued to diversify their line-up (at peak offering 10 distinct models), offering the larger, fully suspended [[Honda ATC250es| 250cc Big Red]] Utility ATC, and introduced the [[Honda Sport ATCs#Honda ATC350X|350X]] Sport ATC, their largest displacement machine, in 1985. But the bulk of their sales would prove to be the 200cc line, offering six models and selling over 500,000 units in 3 years. Honda's response to the Tecate and Tri-Z, the liquid cooled 1985 and 1986 ATC250R, remains one of the most desirable ATC\u2019s of the era, and aftermarket support still follows the machine.\n\n===American Based Manufacturers===\n\n{{Main|Tiger ATV LTD|Polaris Scrambler 250R/es}}\n\nAmerican-based manufacturers also produced ATC\u2019s in this period, abet in small numbers. [[Polaris Inc.|Polaris]] offered the [[Polaris Scrambler 250R/es|Scrambler]] in 1985 and 1986, producing appx 1600 units. Speciality manufacturer [[Tiger ATV LTD|Tiger ATV]] also produces a range of ATC\u2019s,, but their liquidation in 1991 left no official record of how many units were produced. The collector ATV market estimates vary drastically, from 300 to as many as 1000 units total production.  Tiger ATC\u2019s were offered for three years, with models using {{convert|80| to |500|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[two-stroke]] engines provided by [[KTM]] and [[Bombardier Inc.|Rotax]].\n\nThe Tiger 500 is notable for being the fastest consumer ATC available, with tested top speeds of +80&nbsp;mph from the stock  {{convert|42|hp|kW|1}}@6500rpm engine and 5 speed gearbox. With Final drive gearing changes, the ATC could produce speeds exceeding 100mph.  However, due to the rarity of the machines, much of the public was and remains unaware of the brand, and as all Tiger Models were custom ordered and built to the buyers specifications for the purpose of factory ATV racing, Polaris is generally known as the first American \u2018Production\u2019 ATV producer. \n\n===Voluntary Cease of Production===\n\nProduction of three-wheelers was voluntarily ceased by all manufacturers by 1987, in light of safety concerns, and ahead of any legislation.<ref>{{cite journal |title=All-terrain vehicle fatalities\u2014West Virginia, 1999\u20132006 |journal= Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages=312\u20135 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18368006 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5712a2.htm |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref> Though future studies would show that three-wheelers were not considered more unstable than four-wheelers (although accidents are equally severe in both classes),<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ganos D, Crady S, Poortenga S, Hoffman G, Mann R |title=Trauma associated with three- and four-wheeled all-terrain vehicles: is the four-wheeler an unrecognized health hazard? |journal=The American Surgeon |volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=429\u201333 |date=July 1988 |pmid=3389591}}</ref> manufacturers agreed to a 10-year moratorium on production, as well as collectively financing a +$100 million ATV safety campaign. Despite the moratorium lifting, manufacturers have not returned to the ATC market, focusing instead on four wheeled ATV\u2019s. A ban on sales of new or used three-wheelers and a recall of all remaining three-wheelers has been proposed by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=All-terrain vehicle injury prevention: two-, three-, and four-wheeled unlicensed motor vehicles |journal=Pediatrics |volume=105 |issue=6 |pages=1352\u20134 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10835081 |doi=10.1542/peds.105.6.1352|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, it was determined in a CPSC study that three-wheelers are no more dangerous than other ATVs. Because of the cessation of production, it is widely assumed that the machines are unregistrable, uninsurable, and even illegal, despite a lack of any federal restrictions. All ATC\u2019s continue to be governed by the same laws as ATV\u2019s.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThese safety issues with three-wheel ATCs caused a shift in the buying public, as the sales of recently introduced four-wheel ATV models grew rapidly. While three-wheel models ended production in 1987, agreements between the major manufacturers and the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]\u2014to officially cease production and finance safety campaigns moved forward. While the lighter weight of ATC\u2019s made them popular with certain riders, manufacturers continued to focus on ATV production. \n\n===Safety Concerns of ATC\u2019s=== \n\nSafety courses and educational literature has reduced the amount and severity of accidents among ATC and ATV riders. As cornering is more challenging on an ATC than with a four-wheeled machine, properly leaning into the turn is required, to counterbalance the weight and keep the machine stable. Operators may roll over if caution isn't used at high speeds. The lighter nature and smaller footprint of ATC front end\u2019s of ATC\u2019s present both a flipping and steering hazard Under acceleration and on inclines. Rollovers may also occur when traveling steep incline. However, in most terrain with the proper riding technique and safety gear, this issues can be mitigated. ATC\u2019s require unique techniques to ride properly, and turning lean requires more exaggeration than ATV\u2019s; Throttle steering is another technique commonly used on ATC\u2019s in soft terrain and at high speeds, leaning to the inside of the turn and manipulating the throttle to break traction with the rear tires, resulting in the machines turning on axis while maintaining a forward direction.\n\n===H.R.

It sold the first model, the 1982 QuadRunner LT125, which was a recreational machine for beginners. \n\nAdventure Vehicles of Monroe, Louisiana made the first quad ATV in 1980. They called it the Avenger 400. Prior to that, Adventure Vehicles made 3 wheel ATVs and a dump body utility 3 wheeler using Kohler 8 hp engines and Comet drive systems (Comet centrifugal belt driven clutch and a Comet forward, neutral, reverse transaxle with a rigid rear axle or rear differential option.) The Avenger 400 was a rigid suspension vehicle with a fiberglass body and welded tube construction. It was a rudimentary vehicle reminiscent of the Tote Gote of the 1960s. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hc9EJcgig8 \n\nSuzuki sold the first four-wheeled mini ATV, the LT50, from 1984 to 1987. After the LT50, Suzuki sold the first ATV with a [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] transmission, the LT80, from 1987 to 2006.\n\nIn 1985 Suzuki introduced to the industry the first high-performance four-wheel ATV, the [[Suzuki LT250R]] QuadRacer. This machine was in production for the 1985\u20131992 model years.  During its production run it underwent three major engineering makeovers.  However, the core features were retained. These were: a sophisticated long-travel suspension, a liquid-cooled two-stroke motor and a fully manual five-speed transmission for 1985\u20131986 models and a six-speed transmission for the 87\u201392 models. It was a machine exclusively designed for racing by highly skilled riders.\n\nHonda responded a year later with the FourTrax TRX250R\u2014a machine that has not been replicated until recently. It currently remains a trophy winner and competitor to big-bore ATVs. [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Motorcycle & Engine|Kawasaki]] responded with its [[Kawasaki Tecate 4|Tecate-4]] 250. The TRX250R was very similar to the ATC250R it eventually replaced, and is often considered one of the greatest sport ATVs ever built.\n\nIn 1987, [[Yamaha Motor Company]] introduced a different type of high-performance machine, the [[Yamaha Banshee 350|Banshee 350]], which featured a twin-cylinder liquid-cooled two-stroke motor from the RD350LC street motorcycle. Heavier and more difficult to ride in the dirt than the 250s, the Banshee became a popular machine with sand dune riders thanks to its unique power delivery. The Banshee remains popular, but 2006 is the last year it was available in the U.S. (due to EPA emissions regulations); it remained available in Canada until 2008 and in Australia until 2012. The Warrior 350 was introduced in 1987 and went on for years as a light and fast ATV.\n\nShortly after the introduction of the Banshee in 1987, Suzuki released the LT500R QuadRacer. This unique quad was powered by a 500&nbsp;cc liquid-cooled two-stroke engine with a five-speed transmission. This ATV earned the nickname \"Quadzilla\" with its remarkable amount of speed and size. While there are claims of 100+ mph ({{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|disp=out}}) stock Quadzillas, it was officially recorded by 3&4 Wheel Action magazine as reaching a top speed of over {{convert|79|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in a high-speed shootout in its 1988 June issue, making it the fastest production four-wheeled ATV ever produced. Suzuki discontinued the production of the LT500R in 1990 after just four years.\n\nAt the same time, development of utility ATVs was rapidly escalating. The 1986 Honda FourTrax TRX350 4x4 ushered in the era of [[four-wheel drive]] ATVs. Other manufacturers quickly followed suit, and 4x4s have remained the most popular type of ATV ever since. These machines are popular with hunters, farmers, ranchers and workers at construction sites.\n\n[[File:Spreader AF.jpg|thumb|ATV with a [[tow spreader]] mounted]]\n\nModels continue, today, to be divided into the sport and utility markets. Sport models are generally small, light, [[two-wheel drive]] vehicles that accelerate quickly, have a manual transmission and run at speeds up to approximately {{convert|80|mph|abbr=on}}. Utility models are generally bigger [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles with a maximum speed of up to approximately {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}. They have the ability to haul small loads on attached racks or small dump beds. They may also tow small trailers. Due to the different weights, each has advantages on different types of terrain. A popular model is Yamaha's Raptor 700, which features a nearly 700&nbsp;cc [[four-stroke]] engine.\n\nSix-wheel models often have a small dump bed, with an extra set of wheels at the back to increase the payload capacity. They can be either four-wheel drive (back wheels driving only), or six-wheel drive.\n\nIn 2011 [[LandFighter]] was founded, \"the first Dutch/European ATV brand\". The largest part of production takes site in Taiwan, to [[European standards]]; the ATVs are finally assembled in the Netherlands.\n\n== Safety and legal regulation ==\nSafety has been a major issue with ATVs due to the high number of deaths and injuries associated with them and the negligible protection offered by the machine.\n[[File:USMC-12093.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Roll cage|Roll-over protection]] fitted 4x4 used by the US Marines Special Operations]]\nThe modern breed of ATVs was introduced in the early 1970s and almost immediately realized alarming injury rates for children and adolescents.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirkpatrick R, Puffinbarger W, Sullivan JA |title=All-terrain vehicle injuries in children |journal=Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=725\u201328 |year=2007 |pmid=17878773 |doi=10.1097/BPO.0b013e3181558856}}</ref> Based on analysis of the [[National Trauma Data Bank]], ATVs are more dangerous than [[dirt bike]]s, possibly due to crush injuries and failure to wear safety gear such as helmets.<ref>[http://www.medpagetoday.com/EmergencyMedicine/EmergencyMedicine/22593 \"ACS: Off-Road Injuries Worse With Four-Wheelers\"] article by Crystal Phend, Senior Staff Writer, ''MedPage Today'', 6 October 2010.

To be successful at fast trail riding, an ATV must have light weight, high power, good suspension and a low center of gravity. These machines can be modified for such racing disciplines as [[motocross]], woods racing (also known as cross country), [[off-road racing|desert racing]] (also known as Hare Scrambles), [[hill climbing]], [[ice racing]], speedway, Tourist Trophy (TT), [[Short track motor racing|flat track]], [[drag racing]] and others.\n\nThroughout the United States and the United Kingdom there are many quad racing clubs with [[enduro]] and quadcross sections. [[Grand National Cross Country|GNCC Racing]] began around 1980 and includes hare scramble and enduro type races. To date, events are mainly held in the eastern part of the United States. GNCC racing features many types of obstacles such as, hill climbing, creek and log crossings, dirt roads and wooded trails.\n\nATV National Motocross Championship<ref>[http://www.atvmotocross.com ATVmotorcross.com]</ref> was formed around 1985. ATVMX events are hosted at premiere motocross racetracks throughout the United States. ATVMX consists of several groups, including the Pro (AMA Pro) and Amateur (ATVA) series. Friday involves amateur practicing and racing on Saturday and Sunday. Saturday also involves racing for the Pro Am Women and Pro Am Unlimited classes. Sunday involves racing for the Pro and Pro Am production ATVs, but are scored separately. On average weekend over 500 racers will compete.\n\nThe [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] organizes the [[Quadcross of Nations]] at the end of the year. The competition involves teams of three riders representing their nations. There are three motos with two riders of each nation competing per moto. The location of the event changes from year to year.\n\nChampionship Mud Racing/CMR saw its infancy in 2006 as leaders of the ATV industry recognized a need for uniformity of classes and rules of various local mud bog events. Providing standardized rules created the need for a governing body that both racers and event promoters could turn to and CMR was born. Once unified, a true points series was established and lead to a national championship for what was once nothing more than a hobby for most. In 2007 the finalized board of directors was established and the first races were held in 2008. Currently, the CMR schedule includes eight competition dates spanning from March to November. Points are awarded throughout the season in several different competition classes of ATV and SxS Mud Racing. The 2008 year included Mud Bog and Mudda-Cross competitions, but the 2009 and future seasons will only have Mudda-Cross competitions. Classes range from 0\u2013499&nbsp;cc to a Super-Modified class which will allow any size ATV in competition. The ultimate goal of The CMR is \"to see the growth of ATV Mud Racing as a competitive sport and give competitors a pedestal upon which they can receive the recognition from national media and industry sponsors that they have long deserved.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.championship-mudracing.com/about.html |title=CMR \u2013 About \u2013 Championship Mud Racing |access-date=24 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306181505/http://www.championship-mudracing.com/about.html |archive-date=6 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the [[FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship]] started with a Quad Championship and the [[Dakar Rally]] added the Quad category in 2008. Because the [[2008 Dakar Rally]] was cancelled, the [[2009 Dakar Rally]] was the first [[Dakar Rally]] with Quads.\n\nAmateur and professional three-wheeler racing across the United States has also spiked in popularity once again, at levels not seen since the factory teams raced in the 1980s. Part of the appeal is the cheapness of parts, and how easy it is to get into. Races are held at various local and large venues, particularly in Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan and California. Payouts are sometimes awarded to winners.\n\nEach year in June, the world's biggest three-wheeler gathering is held at Haspin Acres, in [[Laurel, Indiana]], for the Trikefest event. Over the course of 3 days complete with camping, hundreds of people gather for the event which features competitive racing such as MX style racing, drag racing, mud racing, hill climbs and other events. For those who wish not to compete, there are also many trails a person can ride. as many as 100 or more three-wheelers show up each year, some built and restored to be raffled off, others brought to ride.\n\nThe fastest speed recorded on a quad cycle, or ATV given a flying start, is 315.74&nbsp;km/h (196.19&nbsp;mph), by Terry Wilmeth (USA), at the Madras, Airport in Madras, Oregon, USA, on 15 June 2008.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=The Jim Pattison Group|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/101 101]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/101}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Amphibious ATV]]\n* [[Car]]\n* [[Dune buggy]]\n* [[John Deere]]\n* [[Motorcycle]]\n* [[Motorized tricycle]]\n* [[Non-road engine]]\n* [[Off-road vehicle]]\n* [[Side-by-side (vehicle)|Side-by-side vehicle]]\n* [[Tomcar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|All-terrain vehicles}}\n<!-- ATTENTION!

As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles.  Although it is a [[street-legal vehicle]] in some countries, it is not street-legal within most states, territories, and provinces of [[Australia]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]].\n\nBy the current ANSI definition, ATVs are intended for use by a single operator, although some companies have developed ATVs intended for use by the operator and one passenger. In some countries, the passenger is not required to wear a helmet.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}  These ATVs are referred to as tandem ATVs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/frnotices/fr06/066703.html|title=Standards for All Terrain Vehicles and Ban of Three-Wheeled All Terrain Vehicles; Proposed Rule|publisher=Consumer Product Safety Commission (Federal Register)|date=10 August 2006|accessdate=26 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113022054/http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/frnotices/fr06/066703.html|archivedate=13 January 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe rider sits on and operates these vehicles like a motorcycle, but the extra wheels give more stability at slower speeds. Also dirt bikes are considered to be ATVs as that they were designed for off-road use only. Although most are equipped with three or four wheels, six-wheel models exist for specialized applications. [[Engine displacement|Engine sizes]] of ATVs currently for sale in the United States, (as of 2008 products), range from {{convert|49|to|1000|cc|L CID|sigfig=2|abbr=on|lk=out}}.\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\n[[Royal Einfield]] built and sold the first powered quadracycle in 1893.

With the introduction of straddle ridden ATVs, the term AATV was introduced to define the original [[amphibious ATV]] category.\n\n===ATC Development===\n\n{{Main|List of Honda three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n{{Main|List of Yamaha Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n{{Main|List of Kawasaki Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n{{Main|List of Suzuki Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n\nThe first [[three-wheeler|three-wheeled]] ATV was the [[Sperry-Rand]] Tricart.  It was designed in 1967 as a graduate project of John Plessinger at the Cranbrook Academy of Arts near Detroit.  The Tricart was straddle-ridden with a sit-in rather than sit-on style (similar to the contemporaneous [[Big Wheel (tricycle)|Big Wheel toy]]).  In 1968 Plessinger sold the Tricart patents and design rights to Sperry-Rand [[New Holland Agriculture|New Holland]] who manufactured them commercially.  Numerous small American manufacturers of 3-wheelers followed.  These small manufacturers were unable to compete when larger motorcycle companies like Honda entered the market in 1969.\n \n[[File:1984 Honda 200s.jpg|thumb|1984 Honda ATC200S, one of the many three-wheeled models made by Honda and other manufacturers]]\n\n[[Honda]] introduced their first sit-on straddle-ridden three-wheeled All Terrain Vehicle in 1969, known as a [[Honda US90|US90]], as a 1970 Model. Variations would be popularized in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] movie, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' and TV shows such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' and ''[[Hart to Hart]]''. In 1973, Honda would trademark the term \"All Terrain Cycle\" (ATC), applying the moniker to all Honda produced Three-wheeled ATV\u2019s, and creating the universal name which now  associated with all vehicles of this type. Being directly influenced by earlier 6-wheeled [[All-terrain vehicle#Six-wheeled AATVs|AATV's]] of the sixties, it utilized balloon tires for both a low environmental impact and to compensate for a lack of [[Suspension (motorcycle)|mechanical suspension]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html|title=ATC90 History|author =Chris Cooper|accessdate=2 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061216144600/http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html| archivedate= 16 December 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nHonda entered the 1980's with a virtual monopoly in the market, due to effective patents on design and engine placement. By 1980, other companies would paid patent royalties to Honda to enter the lucrative ATC field with their own machines. Yamaha introduced their first ATC, the Tri-Moto YZ125. Kawasaki followed suit the next year with the KLT200, while Suzuki produced their first effort, the ALT125, in 1982. As the popularity of ATC\u2019s increased dramatically, rapid development ensued. The ability to go anywhere on terrain that most other vehicles could not cross soon made them popular with US and Canadian hunters, and those just looking for a good trail ride. As other manufacturers were entering the market, Honda was diversifying, offering the [[ATC250R]], the first [[All-terrain vehicle#Sport competition|Sport ATC]] intended for competition, in 1981. The 1982 Honda ATC200E Big Red was a landmark model. It featured both suspension and racks, making it the first ATC designed specifically for utility, and would become the worlds best-selling ATC. Honda followed that effort in 1983 with the [[Honda Sport ATCs#Honda ATC200X|ATC200X]], an easy-to-handle {{convert|192|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[four-stroke]] Sport ATC that was ideal for new riders.\n\nNot to be outdone, Kawasaki and Yamaha responded with their own Sport ATC's. 1984 saw the release of the '''Kawasaki KXT250 Tecate''', and Yamaha followed in 1985 with the '''Tri-Z 250'''. Both were liquid Cooled 250cc two-strokes capable of giving the Honda ATC250R competition. In response to growing market, American Specialty manufacturer [[Tiger ATV LTD|Tiger]] also introduced a series of ATC's, Hand-built-to-order models that included the '''Tiger 500''', the largest displacement ATC produced commercially. While Kawasaki produced Utility ATC's, famously making the '''KLT 250 Police''' model, Yamaha focused on Sport and Recreation models, and Suzuki turned their attention to building Sport Quads.\n\nHonda continued to diversify their line-up (at peak offering 10 distinct models), offering the larger, fully suspended [[Honda ATC250es| 250cc Big Red]] Utility ATC, and introduced the [[Honda Sport ATCs#Honda ATC350X|350X]] Sport ATC, their largest displacement machine, in 1985. But the bulk of their sales would prove to be the 200cc line, offering six models and selling over 500,000 units in 3 years. Honda's response to the Tecate and Tri-Z, the liquid cooled 1985 and 1986 ATC250R, remains one of the most desirable ATC\u2019s of the era, and aftermarket support still follows the machine.\n\n===American Based Manufacturers===\n\n{{Main|Tiger ATV LTD|Polaris Scrambler 250R/es}}\n\nAmerican-based manufacturers also produced ATC\u2019s in this period, abet in small numbers. [[Polaris Inc.|Polaris]] offered the [[Polaris Scrambler 250R/es|Scrambler]] in 1985 and 1986, producing appx 1600 units. Speciality manufacturer [[Tiger ATV LTD|Tiger ATV]] also produces a range of ATC\u2019s,, but their liquidation in 1991 left no official record of how many units were produced. The collector ATV market estimates vary drastically, from 300 to as many as 1000 units total production.  Tiger ATC\u2019s were offered for three years, with models using {{convert|80| to |500|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[two-stroke]] engines provided by [[KTM]] and [[Bombardier Inc.|Rotax]].\n\nThe Tiger 500 is notable for being the fastest consumer ATC available, with tested top speeds of +80&nbsp;mph from the stock  {{convert|42|hp|kW|1}}@6500rpm engine and 5 speed gearbox. With Final drive gearing changes, the ATC could produce speeds exceeding 100mph.  However, due to the rarity of the machines, much of the public was and remains unaware of the brand, and as all Tiger Models were custom ordered and built to the buyers specifications for the purpose of factory ATV racing, Polaris is generally known as the first American \u2018Production\u2019 ATV producer. \n\n===Voluntary Cease of Production===\n\nProduction of three-wheelers was voluntarily ceased by all manufacturers by 1987, in light of safety concerns, and ahead of any legislation.<ref>{{cite journal |title=All-terrain vehicle fatalities\u2014West Virginia, 1999\u20132006 |journal= Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages=312\u20135 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18368006 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5712a2.htm |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref> Though future studies would show that three-wheelers were not considered more unstable than four-wheelers (although accidents are equally severe in both classes),<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ganos D, Crady S, Poortenga S, Hoffman G, Mann R |title=Trauma associated with three- and four-wheeled all-terrain vehicles: is the four-wheeler an unrecognized health hazard? |journal=The American Surgeon |volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=429\u201333 |date=July 1988 |pmid=3389591}}</ref> manufacturers agreed to a 10-year moratorium on production, as well as collectively financing a +$100 million ATV safety campaign. Despite the moratorium lifting, manufacturers have not returned to the ATC market, focusing instead on four wheeled ATV\u2019s. A ban on sales of new or used three-wheelers and a recall of all remaining three-wheelers has been proposed by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=All-terrain vehicle injury prevention: two-, three-, and four-wheeled unlicensed motor vehicles |journal=Pediatrics |volume=105 |issue=6 |pages=1352\u20134 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10835081 |doi=10.1542/peds.105.6.1352|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, it was determined in a CPSC study that three-wheelers are no more dangerous than other ATVs. Because of the cessation of production, it is widely assumed that the machines are unregistrable, uninsurable, and even illegal, despite a lack of any federal restrictions. All ATC\u2019s continue to be governed by the same laws as ATV\u2019s.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThese safety issues with three-wheel ATCs caused a shift in the buying public, as the sales of recently introduced four-wheel ATV models grew rapidly. While three-wheel models ended production in 1987, agreements between the major manufacturers and the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]\u2014to officially cease production and finance safety campaigns moved forward. While the lighter weight of ATC\u2019s made them popular with certain riders, manufacturers continued to focus on ATV production. \n\n===Safety Concerns of ATC\u2019s=== \n\nSafety courses and educational literature has reduced the amount and severity of accidents among ATC and ATV riders. As cornering is more challenging on an ATC than with a four-wheeled machine, properly leaning into the turn is required, to counterbalance the weight and keep the machine stable. Operators may roll over if caution isn't used at high speeds. The lighter nature and smaller footprint of ATC front end\u2019s of ATC\u2019s present both a flipping and steering hazard Under acceleration and on inclines. Rollovers may also occur when traveling steep incline. However, in most terrain with the proper riding technique and safety gear, this issues can be mitigated. ATC\u2019s require unique techniques to ride properly, and turning lean requires more exaggeration than ATV\u2019s; Throttle steering is another technique commonly used on ATC\u2019s in soft terrain and at high speeds, leaning to the inside of the turn and manipulating the throttle to break traction with the rear tires, resulting in the machines turning on axis while maintaining a forward direction.\n\n===H.R.

It sold the first model, the 1982 QuadRunner LT125, which was a recreational machine for beginners. \n\nAdventure Vehicles of Monroe, Louisiana made the first quad ATV in 1980. They called it the Avenger 400. Prior to that, Adventure Vehicles made 3 wheel ATVs and a dump body utility 3 wheeler using Kohler 8 hp engines and Comet drive systems (Comet centrifugal belt driven clutch and a Comet forward, neutral, reverse transaxle with a rigid rear axle or rear differential option.) The Avenger 400 was a rigid suspension vehicle with a fiberglass body and welded tube construction. It was a rudimentary vehicle reminiscent of the Tote Gote of the 1960s. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hc9EJcgig8 \n\nSuzuki sold the first four-wheeled mini ATV, the LT50, from 1984 to 1987. After the LT50, Suzuki sold the first ATV with a [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] transmission, the LT80, from 1987 to 2006.\n\nIn 1985 Suzuki introduced to the industry the first high-performance four-wheel ATV, the [[Suzuki LT250R]] QuadRacer. This machine was in production for the 1985\u20131992 model years.  During its production run it underwent three major engineering makeovers.  However, the core features were retained. These were: a sophisticated long-travel suspension, a liquid-cooled two-stroke motor and a fully manual five-speed transmission for 1985\u20131986 models and a six-speed transmission for the 87\u201392 models. It was a machine exclusively designed for racing by highly skilled riders.\n\nHonda responded a year later with the FourTrax TRX250R\u2014a machine that has not been replicated until recently. It currently remains a trophy winner and competitor to big-bore ATVs. [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Motorcycle & Engine|Kawasaki]] responded with its [[Kawasaki Tecate 4|Tecate-4]] 250. The TRX250R was very similar to the ATC250R it eventually replaced, and is often considered one of the greatest sport ATVs ever built.\n\nIn 1987, [[Yamaha Motor Company]] introduced a different type of high-performance machine, the [[Yamaha Banshee 350|Banshee 350]], which featured a twin-cylinder liquid-cooled two-stroke motor from the RD350LC street motorcycle. Heavier and more difficult to ride in the dirt than the 250s, the Banshee became a popular machine with sand dune riders thanks to its unique power delivery. The Banshee remains popular, but 2006 is the last year it was available in the U.S. (due to EPA emissions regulations); it remained available in Canada until 2008 and in Australia until 2012. The Warrior 350 was introduced in 1987 and went on for years as a light and fast ATV.\n\nShortly after the introduction of the Banshee in 1987, Suzuki released the LT500R QuadRacer. This unique quad was powered by a 500&nbsp;cc liquid-cooled two-stroke engine with a five-speed transmission. This ATV earned the nickname \"Quadzilla\" with its remarkable amount of speed and size. While there are claims of 100+ mph ({{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|disp=out}}) stock Quadzillas, it was officially recorded by 3&4 Wheel Action magazine as reaching a top speed of over {{convert|79|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in a high-speed shootout in its 1988 June issue, making it the fastest production four-wheeled ATV ever produced. Suzuki discontinued the production of the LT500R in 1990 after just four years.\n\nAt the same time, development of utility ATVs was rapidly escalating. The 1986 Honda FourTrax TRX350 4x4 ushered in the era of [[four-wheel drive]] ATVs. Other manufacturers quickly followed suit, and 4x4s have remained the most popular type of ATV ever since. These machines are popular with hunters, farmers, ranchers and workers at construction sites.\n\n[[File:Spreader AF.jpg|thumb|ATV with a [[tow spreader]] mounted]]\n\nModels continue, today, to be divided into the sport and utility markets. Sport models are generally small, light, [[two-wheel drive]] vehicles that accelerate quickly, have a manual transmission and run at speeds up to approximately {{convert|80|mph|abbr=on}}. Utility models are generally bigger [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles with a maximum speed of up to approximately {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}. They have the ability to haul small loads on attached racks or small dump beds. They may also tow small trailers. Due to the different weights, each has advantages on different types of terrain.

GNCC racing features many types of obstacles such as, hill climbing, creek and log crossings, dirt roads and wooded trails.\n\nATV National Motocross Championship<ref>[http://www.atvmotocross.com ATVmotorcross.com]</ref> was formed around 1985. ATVMX events are hosted at premiere motocross racetracks throughout the United States. ATVMX consists of several groups, including the Pro (AMA Pro) and Amateur (ATVA) series. Friday involves amateur practicing and racing on Saturday and Sunday. Saturday also involves racing for the Pro Am Women and Pro Am Unlimited classes. Sunday involves racing for the Pro and Pro Am production ATVs, but are scored separately. On average weekend over 500 racers will compete.\n\nThe [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] organizes the [[Quadcross of Nations]] at the end of the year. The competition involves teams of three riders representing their nations. There are three motos with two riders of each nation competing per moto. The location of the event changes from year to year.\n\nChampionship Mud Racing/CMR saw its infancy in 2006 as leaders of the ATV industry recognized a need for uniformity of classes and rules of various local mud bog events. Providing standardized rules created the need for a governing body that both racers and event promoters could turn to and CMR was born. Once unified, a true points series was established and lead to a national championship for what was once nothing more than a hobby for most. In 2007 the finalized board of directors was established and the first races were held in 2008. Currently, the CMR schedule includes eight competition dates spanning from March to November. Points are awarded throughout the season in several different competition classes of ATV and SxS Mud Racing. The 2008 year included Mud Bog and Mudda-Cross competitions, but the 2009 and future seasons will only have Mudda-Cross competitions. Classes range from 0\u2013499&nbsp;cc to a Super-Modified class which will allow any size ATV in competition. The ultimate goal of The CMR is \"to see the growth of ATV Mud Racing as a competitive sport and give competitors a pedestal upon which they can receive the recognition from national media and industry sponsors that they have long deserved.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.championship-mudracing.com/about.html |title=CMR \u2013 About \u2013 Championship Mud Racing |access-date=24 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306181505/http://www.championship-mudracing.com/about.html |archive-date=6 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the [[FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship]] started with a Quad Championship and the [[Dakar Rally]] added the Quad category in 2008.

Part of the appeal is the cheapness of parts, and how easy it is to get into. Races are held at various local and large venues, particularly in Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan and California. Payouts are sometimes awarded to winners.\n\nEach year in June, the world's biggest three-wheeler gathering is held at Haspin Acres, in [[Laurel, Indiana]], for the Trikefest event. Over the course of 3 days complete with camping, hundreds of people gather for the event which features competitive racing such as MX style racing, drag racing, mud racing, hill climbs and other events. For those who wish not to compete, there are also many trails a person can ride. as many as 100 or more three-wheelers show up each year, some built and restored to be raffled off, others brought to ride.\n\nThe fastest speed recorded on a quad cycle, or ATV given a flying start, is 315.74&nbsp;km/h (196.19&nbsp;mph), by Terry Wilmeth (USA), at the Madras, Airport in Madras, Oregon, USA, on 15 June 2008.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=The Jim Pattison Group|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/101 101]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/101}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Amphibious ATV]]\n* [[Car]]\n* [[Dune buggy]]\n* [[John Deere]]\n* [[Motorcycle]]\n* [[Motorized tricycle]]\n* [[Non-road engine]]\n* [[Off-road vehicle]]\n* [[Side-by-side (vehicle)|Side-by-side vehicle]]\n* [[Tomcar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|All-terrain vehicles}}\n<!-- ATTENTION!

Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the [[Knife game|Russian game]], in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself, she would pick up a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body \u2013 the pain and the sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramovi\u0107 began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. \"Once you enter into the performance state you can push your body to do things you absolutely could never normally do.\"<ref>Kaplan, 9</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 5'', 1974===\nIn this performance, Abramovi\u0107 sought to re-evoke the energy of extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire at the start of the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramovi\u0107 cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When finished with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramovi\u0107 leapt across the flames into the center of the large star. At first, due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen inside the star. However, when the flames came very near to her body and she still remained inert, a doctor and others intervened and extricated her from the star.\n\nAbramovi\u0107 later commented upon this experience: \"I was very angry because I understood there is a physical limit. When you lose consciousness you can't be present, you can't perform.\"<ref>Daneri, 29</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 2'', 1974===\nPrompted by her loss of consciousness during Rhythm 5, Abramovi\u0107 devised the two-part Rhythm 2 to incorporate a state of unconsciousness in a performance. She performed the work at the Gallery of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, in 1974. In Part I, which had a duration of 50 minutes, she ingested a medication she describes as 'given to patients who suffer from [[catatonia]], to force them to change the positions of their bodies.' The medication caused her muscles to contract violently, and she lost complete control over her body while remaining aware of what was going on. After a ten-minute break, she took a second medication 'given to schizophrenic patients with violent behavior disorders to calm them down.' The performance ended after five hours when the medication wore off.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-8747-9 |pages=132\u2013144 |last1=Dezeuze |first1=Anna |last2=Ward, Frazer |title=The \"Do-It-Yourself\" Artwork: Participation from Fluxus to New Media |chapter=Marina Abramovic: Approaching zero |location=Manchester |date=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |publisher=Charta |isbn=978-88-8158-175-7 |last1=Pejic |first1=Bojana |last2=Abramovic |first2=Marina |last3=McEvilley |first3=Thomas |last4=Stoos |first4=Toni |title=Marina Abramovic: Artist Body |location=Milano |date=July 2, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |edition=Second Printing  |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art, New York |isbn=978-0-87070-747-6 |last1=Danto |first1=Arthur |last2=Iles |first2=Chrissie |last3=Abramovic |first3=Marina |others=Klaus Biesenbach (ed.) |title=Marina Abramovic: The Artist is Present |location=New York |date=April 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 4'', 1974===\nIn this piece, Abramovi\u0107 kneeled alone and naked in a room with a high-power industrial fan.

She assigned a passive role to herself, with the public being the force which would act on her. Abramovi\u0107 placed on a table 72 objects that people were allowed to use in any way that they chose; a sign informed them that they held no responsibility for any of their actions. Some of the objects could give pleasure, while others could be wielded to inflict pain, or to harm her. Among them were a rose, a feather, honey, a whip, olive oil, scissors, a scalpel, a gun and a single bullet. For six hours the artist allowed audience members to manipulate her body and actions without consequences. This tested how vulnerable and aggressive human subjects could be when actions have no social consequences.<ref name=\"demaria\" /> At first the audience did not do much and was extremely passive. However, as the realization began to set in that there was no limit to their actions, the piece became brutal. By the end of the performance, her body was stripped, attacked, and devalued into an image that Abramovi\u0107 described as the \"Madonna, mother, and whore.\"<ref name=\"demaria\" /> Additionally, markings of aggression were written on the artist's body. There were cuts on her neck made by audience members, and her clothes were cut off her body. With an initial determination to find out how the public acts with no consequences tied to their actions, she realized by the end that the public might very well have killed her for their own personal enjoyment.\n\nIn her works, Abramovi\u0107 affirms her identity through the perspective of others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and creates a powerful message.<ref name=\"demaria\" /> Abramovi\u0107's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows spectators to do as they please with her body; the audience pushes the limits of what one would consider acceptable. By presenting her body as an object, she explores the elements of danger and physical exhaustion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Demaria|first=Cristina|date=2016-07-25|title=The Performative Body of Marina Abramovi\u0107: Rerelating (in) Time and Space|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1350506804044464|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|doi=10.1177/1350506804044464}}</ref>\n\nInitially, members of the audience reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramovi\u0107 described it later: \"What I learned was that&nbsp;... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.&nbsp;... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thetheatretimes.com/audience-to-be/|title=Audience To Be|date=2019-02-11|website=The Theatre Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\n===Works with Ulay (Uwe Laysiepen)===\n[[File:Abramovic Ulay.jpg|thumb|Marina Abramovi\u0107 and Uwe Laysiepen 1978]]\nIn 1976, after moving to Amsterdam, Abramovi\u0107 met the [[West Germany|West German]] performance artist [[Uwe Laysiepen]], who went by the single name Ulay. They began living and performing together that year. When Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay began their collaboration,<ref name=Garage/> the main concepts they explored were the ego and artistic identity. They created \"relation works\" characterized by constant movement, change, process and \"art vital\".<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art, 2nd ed.|last=Stiles|first=Kristine|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=808\u2013809}}</ref> This was the beginning of a decade of influential collaborative work. Each performer was interested in the traditions of their cultural heritage and the individual's desire for ritual. Consequently, they decided to form a collective being called \"The Other\", and spoke of themselves as parts of a \"two-headed body\".<ref>Quoted in Green, 37</ref> They dressed and behaved like twins and created a relationship of complete trust. As they defined this phantom identity, their individual identities became less accessible. In an analysis of phantom artistic identities, Charles Green has noted that this allowed a deeper understanding of the artist as performer, for it revealed a way of \"having the artistic self-made available for self-scrutiny\".<ref>Green, 41</ref>\n\nThe work of Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay tested the physical limits of the body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, [[transcendental meditation]] and [[nonverbal communication]].<ref name=\":3\" /> While some critics have explored the idea of a [[hermaphroditic]] state of being as a [[feminist]] statement, Abramovi\u0107 herself denies considering this as a conscious concept. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents' military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with [[gender]] ideologies, Abramovi\u0107/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: \"The main problem in this relationship was what to do with the two artists' egos. I had to find out how to put my ego down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that we called the death self.\"<ref>Kaplan, 14</ref>\n*In ''Relation in Space'' (1976) they ran into each other repeatedly for an hour \u2013 mixing male and female energy into the third component called \"that self\".<ref name=Garage/>\n*''Relation in Movement'' (1977) had the pair driving their car inside of a museum for 365 laps; a black liquid oozed from the car, forming a kind of sculpture, each lap representing a year. (After 365 laps the idea was that they entered the New Millennium.)\n*In ''Relation in Time'' (1977) they sat back to back, tied together by their ponytails for sixteen hours. They then allowed the public to enter the room to see if they could use the energy of the public to push their limits even further.<ref name=\"uoregon1\">{{cite web|author=|url=https://blogs.uoregon.edu/marinaabramovic/category/ulayabramovic/ |title=Ulay/Abramovi\u0107 \u2013 Marina Abramovi\u0107 |publisher=Blogs.uoregon.edu |date=February 12, 2015 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}</ref>\n*To create ''[[Breathing in/breathing out|Breathing In/Breathing Out]]'' the two artists devised a piece in which they connected their mouths and took in each other's exhaled breaths until they had used up all of the available oxygen. Seventeen minutes after the beginning of the performance they both fell to the floor unconscious, their lungs having filled with carbon dioxide. This personal piece explored the idea of an individual's ability to absorb the life of another person, exchanging and destroying it.\n*In ''Imponderabilia'' (1977, reenacted in 2010) two performers of opposite sexes, both completely nude, stand in a narrow doorway. The public must squeeze between them in order to pass, and in doing so choose which one of them to face.<ref name=Garage/>\n*In ''AAA-AAA'' (1978) the two artists stood opposite each other and made long sounds with their mouths open. They gradually moved closer and closer, until they were eventually yelling directly into each other's mouths.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/> This piece demonstrated their interest in endurance and duration.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/>\n*In 1980, they performed ''[[Rest Energy (performance piece)|Rest Energy]],'' in an art exhibition in [[Dublin]], where both balanced each other on opposite sides of a drawn bow and arrow, with the arrow pointed at Abramovi\u0107's heart. With almost no effort, Ulay could easily kill Abramovi\u0107 with one finger. This seems to symbolize the dominance of men and what kind of upperhand they have in society over women. In addition, the handle of the bow is held by Abramovi\u0107 and is pointed at herself. The handle of the bow is the most significant part of a bow. This would be a whole different piece if it were a Ulay aiming a bow at an Abramovi\u0107, but by having her hold the bow, it is almost as if the she is supporting him while taking her own life.<ref name=Garage/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/picture-galleries/2010/march/22/documenting-the-performance-art-of-marina-abramovi-in-pictures/?idx=9 |title=Documenting the performance art of Marina Abramovi\u0107 in pictures &#124; Art &#124; Agenda |publisher=Phaidon |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1981 and 1987, the pair performed ''Nightsea Crossing'' in twenty-two performances. They sat silently across from each other in chairs for seven hours a day.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/>\n\nIn 1988, after several years of tense relations, Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay decided to make a spiritual journey which would end their relationship. They each walked the Great Wall of China, in a piece called ''Lovers,'' starting from the two opposite ends and meeting in the middle. As Abramovi\u0107 described it: \"That walk became a complete personal drama. Ulay started from the [[Gobi Desert]] and I from the [[Yellow Sea]]. After each of us walked 2500&nbsp;km, we met in the middle and said good-bye.\"<ref name=\"Daneri, 35\">{{cite web|url=http://kickasstrips.com/2015/01/lovers-abramovic-ulay-walk-the-length-of-the-great-wall-of-china-from-opposite-ends-meet-in-the-middle-and-breakup/|title=Lovers Abramovi\u0107 & Ulay Walk the Length of the Great Wall of China from opposite ends, Meet in the Middle and BreakUp \u2013 Kickass Trips|date=January 14, 2015|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}</ref> She has said that she conceived this walk in a dream, and it provided what she thought was an appropriate, romantic ending to a relationship full of [[mysticism]], energy, and attraction. She later described the process: \"We needed a certain form of ending, after this huge distance walking towards each other. It is very human. It is in a way more dramatic, more like a film ending&nbsp;...

Each video is filmed with its own sound, creating an overlap. As the skeleton becomes cleaner, Abramovi\u0107 becomes covered in the grayish dirt that was once covering the skeleton. This three-hour performance is filled with metaphors of the Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality. The piece consists of a three-piece series. ''Cleaning the Mirror'' #1 was performed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], consisting of three hours. ''Cleaning the Mirror'' #2 consists of 90 minutes performed at Oxford University.

On seven consecutive nights for seven hours she recreated the works of five artists first performed in the '60s and '70s, in addition to re-performing her own ''Lips of Thomas'' and introducing a new performance on the last night. The performances were arduous, requiring both the physical and the mental concentration of the artist.  Included in Abramovi\u0107's performances were recreations of [[Gina Pane]]'s ''The Conditioning,'' which required lying on a bed frame suspended over a grid of lit candles, and of [[Vito Acconci]]'s 1972 performance in which the artist masturbated under the floorboards of a gallery as visitors walked overhead.

Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovi\u0107, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovi\u0107 wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovi\u0107 sat across from 1,545 sitters, including [[Klaus Biesenbach]], [[James Franco]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Jemima Kirke]], [[Jennifer Carpenter]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]]; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist.

The public would enter the space and be asked to take off all of their clothes and give them to Abramovi\u0107. The individuals would then wait around as she would wash, dry and iron their clothes for them, and once she was done, she would give them back their clothing, and they could get dressed and then leave.

Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the [[Knife game|Russian game]], in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself, she would pick up a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body \u2013 the pain and the sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramovi\u0107 began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. \"Once you enter into the performance state you can push your body to do things you absolutely could never normally do.\"<ref>Kaplan, 9</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 5'', 1974===\nIn this performance, Abramovi\u0107 sought to re-evoke the energy of extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire at the start of the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramovi\u0107 cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When finished with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramovi\u0107 leapt across the flames into the center of the large star. At first, due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen inside the star. However, when the flames came very near to her body and she still remained inert, a doctor and others intervened and extricated her from the star.\n\nAbramovi\u0107 later commented upon this experience: \"I was very angry because I understood there is a physical limit. When you lose consciousness you can't be present, you can't perform.\"<ref>Daneri, 29</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 2'', 1974===\nPrompted by her loss of consciousness during Rhythm 5, Abramovi\u0107 devised the two-part Rhythm 2 to incorporate a state of unconsciousness in a performance. She performed the work at the Gallery of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, in 1974. In Part I, which had a duration of 50 minutes, she ingested a medication she describes as 'given to patients who suffer from [[catatonia]], to force them to change the positions of their bodies.' The medication caused her muscles to contract violently, and she lost complete control over her body while remaining aware of what was going on. After a ten-minute break, she took a second medication 'given to schizophrenic patients with violent behavior disorders to calm them down.' The performance ended after five hours when the medication wore off.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-8747-9 |pages=132\u2013144 |last1=Dezeuze |first1=Anna |last2=Ward, Frazer |title=The \"Do-It-Yourself\" Artwork: Participation from Fluxus to New Media |chapter=Marina Abramovic: Approaching zero |location=Manchester |date=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |publisher=Charta |isbn=978-88-8158-175-7 |last1=Pejic |first1=Bojana |last2=Abramovic |first2=Marina |last3=McEvilley |first3=Thomas |last4=Stoos |first4=Toni |title=Marina Abramovic: Artist Body |location=Milano |date=July 2, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |edition=Second Printing  |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art, New York |isbn=978-0-87070-747-6 |last1=Danto |first1=Arthur |last2=Iles |first2=Chrissie |last3=Abramovic |first3=Marina |others=Klaus Biesenbach (ed.) |title=Marina Abramovic: The Artist is Present |location=New York |date=April 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 4'', 1974===\nIn this piece, Abramovi\u0107 kneeled alone and naked in a room with a high-power industrial fan.

She assigned a passive role to herself, with the public being the force which would act on her. Abramovi\u0107 placed on a table 72 objects that people were allowed to use in any way that they chose; a sign informed them that they held no responsibility for any of their actions. Some of the objects could give pleasure, while others could be wielded to inflict pain, or to harm her. Among them were a rose, a feather, honey, a whip, olive oil, scissors, a scalpel, a gun and a single bullet. For six hours the artist allowed audience members to manipulate her body and actions without consequences. This tested how vulnerable and aggressive human subjects could be when actions have no social consequences.<ref name=\"demaria\" /> At first the audience did not do much and was extremely passive. However, as the realization began to set in that there was no limit to their actions, the piece became brutal. By the end of the performance, her body was stripped, attacked, and devalued into an image that Abramovi\u0107 described as the \"Madonna, mother, and whore.\"<ref name=\"demaria\" /> Additionally, markings of aggression were written on the artist's body. There were cuts on her neck made by audience members, and her clothes were cut off her body. With an initial determination to find out how the public acts with no consequences tied to their actions, she realized by the end that the public might very well have killed her for their own personal enjoyment.\n\nIn her works, Abramovi\u0107 affirms her identity through the perspective of others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and creates a powerful message.<ref name=\"demaria\" /> Abramovi\u0107's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows spectators to do as they please with her body; the audience pushes the limits of what one would consider acceptable. By presenting her body as an object, she explores the elements of danger and physical exhaustion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Demaria|first=Cristina|date=2016-07-25|title=The Performative Body of Marina Abramovi\u0107: Rerelating (in) Time and Space|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1350506804044464|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|doi=10.1177/1350506804044464}}</ref>\n\nInitially, members of the audience reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramovi\u0107 described it later: \"What I learned was that&nbsp;... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.&nbsp;... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thetheatretimes.com/audience-to-be/|title=Audience To Be|date=2019-02-11|website=The Theatre Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\n===Works with Ulay (Uwe Laysiepen)===\n[[File:Abramovic Ulay.jpg|thumb|Marina Abramovi\u0107 and Uwe Laysiepen 1978]]\nIn 1976, after moving to Amsterdam, Abramovi\u0107 met the [[West Germany|West German]] performance artist [[Uwe Laysiepen]], who went by the single name Ulay. They began living and performing together that year. When Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay began their collaboration,<ref name=Garage/> the main concepts they explored were the ego and artistic identity. They created \"relation works\" characterized by constant movement, change, process and \"art vital\".<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art, 2nd ed.|last=Stiles|first=Kristine|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=808\u2013809}}</ref> This was the beginning of a decade of influential collaborative work. Each performer was interested in the traditions of their cultural heritage and the individual's desire for ritual. Consequently, they decided to form a collective being called \"The Other\", and spoke of themselves as parts of a \"two-headed body\".<ref>Quoted in Green, 37</ref> They dressed and behaved like twins and created a relationship of complete trust. As they defined this phantom identity, their individual identities became less accessible. In an analysis of phantom artistic identities, Charles Green has noted that this allowed a deeper understanding of the artist as performer, for it revealed a way of \"having the artistic self-made available for self-scrutiny\".<ref>Green, 41</ref>\n\nThe work of Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay tested the physical limits of the body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, [[transcendental meditation]] and [[nonverbal communication]].<ref name=\":3\" /> While some critics have explored the idea of a [[hermaphroditic]] state of being as a [[feminist]] statement, Abramovi\u0107 herself denies considering this as a conscious concept. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents' military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with [[gender]] ideologies, Abramovi\u0107/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: \"The main problem in this relationship was what to do with the two artists' egos. I had to find out how to put my ego down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that we called the death self.\"<ref>Kaplan, 14</ref>\n*In ''Relation in Space'' (1976) they ran into each other repeatedly for an hour \u2013 mixing male and female energy into the third component called \"that self\".<ref name=Garage/>\n*''Relation in Movement'' (1977) had the pair driving their car inside of a museum for 365 laps; a black liquid oozed from the car, forming a kind of sculpture, each lap representing a year. (After 365 laps the idea was that they entered the New Millennium.)\n*In ''Relation in Time'' (1977) they sat back to back, tied together by their ponytails for sixteen hours. They then allowed the public to enter the room to see if they could use the energy of the public to push their limits even further.<ref name=\"uoregon1\">{{cite web|author=|url=https://blogs.uoregon.edu/marinaabramovic/category/ulayabramovic/ |title=Ulay/Abramovi\u0107 \u2013 Marina Abramovi\u0107 |publisher=Blogs.uoregon.edu |date=February 12, 2015 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}</ref>\n*To create ''[[Breathing in/breathing out|Breathing In/Breathing Out]]'' the two artists devised a piece in which they connected their mouths and took in each other's exhaled breaths until they had used up all of the available oxygen. Seventeen minutes after the beginning of the performance they both fell to the floor unconscious, their lungs having filled with carbon dioxide. This personal piece explored the idea of an individual's ability to absorb the life of another person, exchanging and destroying it.\n*In ''Imponderabilia'' (1977, reenacted in 2010) two performers of opposite sexes, both completely nude, stand in a narrow doorway. The public must squeeze between them in order to pass, and in doing so choose which one of them to face.<ref name=Garage/>\n*In ''AAA-AAA'' (1978) the two artists stood opposite each other and made long sounds with their mouths open. They gradually moved closer and closer, until they were eventually yelling directly into each other's mouths.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/> This piece demonstrated their interest in endurance and duration.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/>\n*In 1980, they performed ''[[Rest Energy (performance piece)|Rest Energy]],'' in an art exhibition in [[Dublin]], where both balanced each other on opposite sides of a drawn bow and arrow, with the arrow pointed at Abramovi\u0107's heart. With almost no effort, Ulay could easily kill Abramovi\u0107 with one finger. This seems to symbolize the dominance of men and what kind of upperhand they have in society over women. In addition, the handle of the bow is held by Abramovi\u0107 and is pointed at herself. The handle of the bow is the most significant part of a bow. This would be a whole different piece if it were a Ulay aiming a bow at an Abramovi\u0107, but by having her hold the bow, it is almost as if the she is supporting him while taking her own life.<ref name=Garage/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/picture-galleries/2010/march/22/documenting-the-performance-art-of-marina-abramovi-in-pictures/?idx=9 |title=Documenting the performance art of Marina Abramovi\u0107 in pictures &#124; Art &#124; Agenda |publisher=Phaidon |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1981 and 1987, the pair performed ''Nightsea Crossing'' in twenty-two performances. They sat silently across from each other in chairs for seven hours a day.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/>\n\nIn 1988, after several years of tense relations, Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay decided to make a spiritual journey which would end their relationship. They each walked the Great Wall of China, in a piece called ''Lovers,'' starting from the two opposite ends and meeting in the middle. As Abramovi\u0107 described it: \"That walk became a complete personal drama. Ulay started from the [[Gobi Desert]] and I from the [[Yellow Sea]].

She later described the process: \"We needed a certain form of ending, after this huge distance walking towards each other. It is very human. It is in a way more dramatic, more like a film ending&nbsp;... Because in the end, you are really alone, whatever you do.\"<ref name=\"Daneri, 35\"/> She reported that during her walk she was reinterpreting her connection to the physical world and to nature. She felt that the metals in the ground influenced her mood and state of being; she also pondered the Chinese myths in which the Great Wall has been described as a \"dragon of energy.\" It took the couple eight years to acquire permission from the Chinese government to perform the work, by the time of which their relationship had completely dissolved.\n\nAt her 2010 MoMA retrospective, Abramovi\u0107 performed ''The Artist Is Present'', in which she shared a period of silence with each stranger who sat in front of her.

Each video is filmed with its own sound, creating an overlap. As the skeleton becomes cleaner, Abramovi\u0107 becomes covered in the grayish dirt that was once covering the skeleton. This three-hour performance is filled with metaphors of the Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality. The piece consists of a three-piece series. ''Cleaning the Mirror'' #1 was performed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], consisting of three hours. ''Cleaning the Mirror'' #2 consists of 90 minutes performed at Oxford University. ''Cleaning the Mirror'' #3 was performed at [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] for five hours.<ref>Abramovic, M., & von Drathen, D. (2002). Marina Abramovic.

On seven consecutive nights for seven hours she recreated the works of five artists first performed in the '60s and '70s, in addition to re-performing her own ''Lips of Thomas'' and introducing a new performance on the last night. The performances were arduous, requiring both the physical and the mental concentration of the artist.  Included in Abramovi\u0107's performances were recreations of [[Gina Pane]]'s ''The Conditioning,'' which required lying on a bed frame suspended over a grid of lit candles, and of [[Vito Acconci]]'s 1972 performance in which the artist masturbated under the floorboards of a gallery as visitors walked overhead. It is argued that Abramovi\u0107 re-performed these works as a series of homages to the past, though many of the performances were altered from their originals.<ref>{{citation | title= Marina Abramovi\u0107 | author= | publisher=BLOUINARTINFO  | date= November 9, 2005 | url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/artists/marina-abramovic-4098 | accessdate=April 23, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHere is a full list of the works performed:\n* [[Bruce Nauman]]'s ''[[Body Pressure]]'' (1974)\n* [[Vito Acconci]]'s ''[[Seedbed (performance piece)|Seedbed]]'' (1972)\n* [[Valie Export]]'s ''Action Pants: Genital Panic'' (1969)\n* [[Gina Pane]]'s ''The Conditioning'' (1973)\n* [[Joseph Beuys]]'s ''[[How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare]]'' (1965)\n* Abramovi\u0107's own ''Thomas Lips'' (1975)\n* Abramovi\u0107's own ''Entering the Other Side'' (2005)\n\n===''The Artist Is Present'': March\u2013May 2010{{anchor|The Artist Is Present}}===\n[[File:artistIsPresent.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Abramovi\u0107 performing ''The Artist Is Present'', [[Museum of Modern Art]], March 2010]]\n\nFrom March 14 to May 31, 2010, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] held a major retrospective and performance recreation of Abramovi\u0107's work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA's history, curated by [[Klaus Biesenbach]].<ref>Kino, Carol (March 10, 2010). \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/arts/design/14performance.html?pagewanted=all A Rebel Form Gains Favor.

Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovi\u0107, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovi\u0107 wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovi\u0107 sat across from 1,545 sitters, including [[Klaus Biesenbach]], [[James Franco]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Jemima Kirke]], [[Jennifer Carpenter]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]]; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist.

A member of this family is called a mephitid. The skunks of the family are widespread across the Americas, while the stink badgers are in the [[Greater Sunda Islands]] of southeast Asia. Species inhabit a variety of habitats, though typically grassland, forest, and shrubland. \n\nThe twelve species of Mephitidae are split into four [[genus|genera]]: the [[monotypic taxon|monotypic]] [[Conepatus]], hog-nosed skunks; [[Mephitis (genus)|Mephitis]], skunks; [[Mydaus]], stink badgers; and [[Spilogale]], spotted skunks. Mephitidae was traditionally a [[cladistics|clade]] within the [[Mustelidae]] family, with the stink badgers combined with other [[badger]]s within the ''[[Melinae]]'' genus, but more recent genetic evidence resulted in the consensus to separate Mephitidae into its own family.<ref name=\"Goswami2010\"/> Extinct species have also been placed into all of the extant genera besides ''Mydaus'', as well as 9 extinct genera; 26 extinct Mephitidae species have been found, though due to ongoing research and discoveries the exact number and categorization is not fixed.\n\n==Conventions==\n{{IUCN statuses|ex=0|ew=0|cr=0|en=0|vu=2|nt=0|lc=10|dd=0|ne=0}}\n\nConservation status codes listed follow the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]].

Mephitidae was traditionally a [[cladistics|clade]] within the [[Mustelidae]] family, with the stink badgers combined with other [[badger]]s within the ''[[Melinae]]'' genus, but more recent genetic evidence resulted in the consensus to separate Mephitidae into its own family.<ref name=\"Goswami2010\"/> Extinct species have also been placed into all of the extant genera besides ''Mydaus'', as well as 9 extinct genera; 26 extinct Mephitidae species have been found, though due to ongoing research and discoveries the exact number and categorization is not fixed.\n\n==Conventions==\n{{IUCN statuses|ex=0|ew=0|cr=0|en=0|vu=2|nt=0|lc=10|dd=0|ne=0}}\n\nConservation status codes listed follow the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]].
