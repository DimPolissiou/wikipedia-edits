{"title_page": "Electrical conductor", "text_new": "[[File:Electrical wires near Putim.jpg|thumb|right|Overhead conductors carry electric power from generating stations to customers.]] \n{{Electromagnetism|cTopic=Electrostatics}}\nIn [[physics]] and [[electrical engineering]], a '''conductor''' is an object or type of material that allows the flow of charge ([[electrical current]]) in one or more directions. Materials made of metal are common electrical conductors. Electrical current is generated by the flow of negatively charged electrons, positively charged holes, and positive or negative ions in some cases. \n\nIn order for current to flow, it is not necessary for one charged particle to travel from the machine producing the current to that consuming it. Instead, the charged particle simply needs to nudge its neighbor a finite amount who will nudge its neighbor and on and on until a particle is nudged into the consumer, thus powering the machine. Essentially what is occurring is a long chain of momentum transfer between mobile charge carriers; the [[Drude model]] of conduction describes this process more rigorously. This momentum transfer model makes metal an ideal choice for a conductor; metals, characteristically, possess a delocalized [[sea of electrons]] which gives the electrons enough mobility to collide and thus effect a momentum transfer. \n\nAs discussed above, electrons are the primary mover in metals; however, other devices such as the cationic [[electrolyte]](s) of a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]], or the mobile protons of the [[proton conductor]] of a fuel cell rely on positive charge carriers. [[Insulator (electricity)|Insulator]]s are non-conducting materials with few mobile charges that support only insignificant [[Electric current|electric currents]].\n\n==Resistance and conductance==\n[[File:Resistivity geometry.png|thumb|A piece of resistive material with electrical contacts on both ends.]]\n{{main|Electrical resistance and conductance}}\nThe [[Electrical resistance and conductance |resistance]] of a given conductor depends on the material it is made of, and on its dimensions. For a given material, the resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee281/materials/references/WireResistances.pdf|title=Wire Sizes and Resistance|access-date=2018-01-14}}</ref> For example, a thick copper wire has lower resistance than an otherwise-identical thin copper wire. Also, for a given material, the resistance is proportional to the length; for example, a long copper wire has higher resistance than an otherwise-identical short copper wire. The resistance {{math|''R''}} and conductance {{math|''G''}} of a conductor of uniform cross section, therefore, can be computed as<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nR & = \\rho \\frac \\ell A, \\\\[6pt]\nG & = \\sigma \\frac A \\ell.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\ell</math> is the length of the conductor, measured in [[metre]]s [m], ''A'' is the cross-section area of the conductor measured in [[square metre]]s [m\u00b2], \u03c3 ([[Sigma (letter)|sigma]]) is the [[electrical conductivity]] measured in [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per meter (S\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>), and \u03c1 ([[Rho (letter)|rho]]) is the [[electrical resistivity]] (also called ''specific electrical resistance'') of the material, measured in ohm-metres (\u03a9\u00b7m). The resistivity and conductivity are proportionality constants, and therefore depend only on the material the wire is made of, not the geometry of the wire. Resistivity and conductivity are [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]]: <math>\\rho=1/\\sigma</math>. Resistivity is a measure of the material's ability to oppose electric current.\n\nThis formula is not exact: It assumes the [[current density]] is totally uniform in the conductor, which is not always true in practical situation. However, this formula still provides a good approximation for long thin conductors such as wires.\n\nAnother situation this formula is not exact for is with [[alternating current]] (AC), because the [[skin effect]] inhibits current flow near the center of the conductor. Then, the ''geometrical'' cross-section is different from the ''effective'' cross-section in which current actually flows, so the resistance is higher than expected. Similarly, if two conductors are near each other carrying AC current, their resistances increase due to the [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]]. At [[utility frequency|commercial power frequency]], these  effects are significant for large conductors carrying large currents, such as [[busbar]]s in an [[electrical substation]],<ref>Fink and Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers 11th Edition'', pages 17\u201319</ref> or large power cables carrying more than a few hundred amperes.\n\nAside from the geometry of the wire, temperature also has a significant effect on the efficacy of conductors. Temperature affects conductors in two main ways, the first is that materials may expand under the application of heat. The amount that the material will expand is governed by the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] specific to the material. Such an expansion (or contraction) will change the geometry of the conductor and therefore its characteristic resistance. However, this effect is generally small, on the order of 10<sup>\u22126</sup>. An increase in temperature will also increase the number of phonons generated within the material. A [[phonon]] is essentially a lattice vibration, or rather a small, harmonic kinetic movement of the atoms of the material. Much like the shaking of a pinball machine, phonons serve to disrupt the path of electrons, causing them to scatter. This electron scattering will decrease the number of electron collisions and therefore will decrease the total amount of current transferred.\n\ntayven is the best person in the world.\n\n==Wire size==\nWires are measured by their cross sectional area. In many countries, the size is expressed in square millimetres. In North America, conductors are measured by [[American wire gauge]] for smaller ones, and [[circular mils]] for larger ones.\n\n==Conductor ampacity==\nThe [[ampacity]] of a conductor, that is, the amount of [[Electric current|current]] it can carry, is related to its electrical resistance: a lower-resistance conductor can carry a larger value of current. The resistance, in turn, is determined by the material the conductor is made from (as described above) and the conductor's size. For a given material, conductors with a larger cross-sectional area have less resistance than conductors with a smaller cross-sectional area.\n\nFor bare conductors, the ultimate limit is the point at which power lost to resistance causes the conductor to melt. Aside from [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]], most conductors in the real world are operated far below this limit, however. For example, household wiring is usually insulated with [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] insulation that is only rated to operate to about 60&nbsp;\u00b0C, therefore, the current in such wires must be limited so that it never heats the copper conductor above 60&nbsp;\u00b0C, causing a risk of [[fire]]. Other, more expensive insulation such as [[Teflon]] or [[fiberglass]] may allow operation at much higher temperatures.\n\n==Isotropy==\nIf an [[electric field]] is applied to a material, and the resulting induced [[electric current]] is in the same direction, the material is said to be an ''isotropic electrical conductor''.  If the resulting electric current is in a different direction from the applied electric field, the material is said to be an ''anisotropic electrical conductor''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Classification of materials based on permittivity}}\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[Bundle conductor]]\n*[[Charge transfer complex]]\n* [[Fourth rail]]\n* [[Overhead line]]\n*[[Resistivity]]\n* [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]], first to identify electrical conductors and insulators\n*[[Superconductivity]]\n* [[Third rail]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n===Pioneering and historical books===\n* William Henry Preece.

[[Annealing (metallurgy)|Annealed]] copper is the international standard to which all other electrical conductors are compared; the [[International Annealed Copper Standard]] conductivity is {{val|58|u=MS|up=m}}, although ultra-pure copper can slightly exceed 101% IACS.  The main grade of copper used for electrical applications, such as building wire, [[Electric motor|motor]] windings, cables and [[busbar]]s, is [[Oxygen-free copper#Specification|electrolytic-tough pitch (ETP) copper]] (CW004A or [[ASTM]] designation C100140).  If high conductivity copper must be [[welding|welded]] or [[Brazing|brazed]] or used in a reducing atmosphere, then [[Oxygen-free copper|oxygen-free high conductivity copper]] (CW008A or ASTM designation C10100) may be used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/alloys/copper/ |title=High conductivity coppers (electrical) |publisher=Copper Development Association (U.K.) |accessdate=2013-06-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720000331/http://www.copperinfo.co.uk/alloys/copper/ |archivedate=2013-07-20 }}</ref> Because of its ease of connection by [[soldering]] or clamping, copper is still the most common choice for most light-gauge wires.\n\n[[Silver]] is 6% more conductive than copper, but due to cost it is not practical in most cases. However, it is used in specialized equipment, such as [[satellite]]s, and as a thin plating to mitigate [[skin effect]] losses at high frequencies.  Famously, {{convert|14700|ST|t}} of silver on loan from the Treasury were used in the making of the [[calutron]] magnets during World War II due to wartime shortages of copper.\n\n[[Aluminum]] wire is the most common metal in [[electric power transmission]] and [[Electric power distribution|distribution]].  Although only 61% of the conductivity of copper by cross-sectional area, its lower density makes it twice as conductive by mass.  As aluminum is roughly one-third the cost of copper by weight, the economic advantages are considerable when large conductors are required.\n\nThe disadvantages of aluminum wiring lie in its mechanical and chemical properties.  It readily forms an insulating oxide, making connections heat up.  Its larger [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] than the brass materials used for connectors causes connections to loosen.  Aluminum can also \"creep\", slowly deforming under load, which also loosens connections.  These effects can be mitigated with suitably designed connectors and extra care in installation, but they have made [[aluminum building wiring]] unpopular past the [[service drop]].\n\nOrganic compounds such as octane, which has 8 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms, cannot conduct electricity. Oils are hydrocarbons, since  carbon has the property of tetracovalency and forms covalent bonds with other elements such as hydrogen, since it does not lose or gain electrons, thus does not form ions. Covalent bonds are simply the sharing of electrons. Hence, there is no separation of ions when electricity is passed through it. So the liquid (oil or any organic compound) cannot conduct electricity.\n\nWhile pure [[water]] is not an electrical conductor, even a small portion of ionic impurities, such as [[salt]], can rapidly transform it into a conductor.\n\n==Wire size==\nWires are measured by their cross sectional area. In many countries, the size is expressed in square millimetres. In North America, conductors are measured by [[American wire gauge]] for smaller ones, and [[circular mils]] for larger ones.\n\n==Conductor ampacity==\nThe [[ampacity]] of a conductor, that is, the amount of [[Electric current|current]] it can carry, is related to its electrical resistance: a lower-resistance conductor can carry a larger value of current. The resistance, in turn, is determined by the material the conductor is made from (as described above) and the conductor's size.

Almost all published research on the language has been the work of Lawrence E. Clark of the Summer Institute of Linguistics.

''\u0268'' is spelled ''\u0289''. Vowel length is indicated by an underline. Unassimilated Spanish loans are spelled as in Spanish.\n* Clark (1983) uses an orthography closer to IPA, but as in the other orthography ''\u0268'' is spelled ''\u0289'', and ''\u0294'' is spelled ''[[saltillo|\ua78c]]''.

The insertion of [[voice acting|voice actor]] performances for [[animation]], such as [[computer generated imagery]] or [[animated cartoon]]s, is often referred to as ADR although it generally does not replace existing dialogue.\n\nThe ADR process may be used to: \n\n:*remove extraneous sounds such as production equipment noise, traffic, wind, or other undesirable sounds from the environment\n:*change the original lines recorded on set to clarify context \n:*improve [[diction]] or modify an [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]\n:*improve [[comic timing|comedic timing]] or dramatic timing\n:*correct technical issues with [[synchronization|synchronisation]]\n:*use a studio-quality singing performance or provide a voice-double for actors who are poor vocalists\n:*add or remove content for legal purposes (such as removing an unauthorised trademarked name)\n:*add or remove a product placement\n:*correct a misspoken line not caught during filming.\n:*replace foul language for TV broadcasts of a movie or other program\nIn conventional film production, a [[production sound mixer]] records dialogue during filming. During post-production, a supervising [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]], or ADR supervisor, reviews all of the dialogue in the film and decides which lines must be re-recorded. ADR is recorded during an ADR session, which takes place in a specialised [[Recording studio|sound studio]]. The actor, usually the original actor from the set, views the scene with the original sound, then attempts to recreate the performance. Over the course of multiple [[take]]s, the actor performs the lines while watching the scene; the most suitable take becomes the final version.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADR |publisher=FilmSound.org |url=http://filmsound.org/terminology/adr.htm |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> The ADR process does not always take place in a post-production studio. The process may be recorded on location, with mobile equipment. ADR can also be recorded without showing the actor the image they must match, but by having them listen to the performance, since some actors{{who|date=June 2019}} believe that watching themselves act can degrade subsequent performances.\n\nSometimes, an actor other than the original actor is used during ADR. One famous example is the ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Darth Vader]], portrayed by [[David Prowse]]; in post-production, [[James Earl Jones]] dubbed the voice of Vader.<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=Film: Lucas Returns with 'The Jedi' |date=25 May 1983 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9c00e3d71e38f936a15756c0a965948260 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nOther examples include:\n*[[Jean Hagen]] provided [[Debbie Reynolds]]' voice in two scenes of ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952). Ironically, the film's story has Reynolds' character, Kathy Seldon, dubbing the voice for ''Hagen's'' character, Lina Lamont, due to Lina's grating voice and strong New York accent. Hagen used her own normal melodious voice to portray Kathy dubbing for Lina. The film, which takes place in Hollywood as talking pictures are taking over from silent films, also portrays another character, Cosmo Brown, played by [[Donald O'Connor]], as inventing the idea of using one actor to provide the voice for another.\n*[[Marni Nixon]] provided the singing voice for the character [[Eliza Doolittle]], otherwise played by [[Audrey Hepburn]], in the 1964 musical film ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''. Nixon was also the singing voices for [[Deborah Kerr]] in ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' and [[Natalie Wood]] in ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', among many others.\n*[[Ray Park]], who acted as [[Darth Maul]] from ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' had his voice dubbed over by [[Peter Serafinowicz]]\n*Frenchmen [[Philippe Noiret]] and [[Jacques Perrin]], who were dubbed into Italian for ''[[Cinema Paradiso]]''\n*Austrian bodybuilder [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], dubbed for ''[[Hercules in New York]]''\n*Argentine boxer [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]], dubbed by a professional actor for the lead in the drama ''[[La Mary]]''\n*[[Gert Fr\u00f6be]], who played [[Auric Goldfinger]] in the James Bond film [[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]], dubbed by [[Michael Collins (English actor)|Michael Collins]]\n*[[Andie MacDowell]]'s Jane, in ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'', who was dubbed by [[Glenn Close]]\n*[[Tom Hardy]], who portrayed [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', re-dubbed half of his own lines for ease of viewer comprehension\n*[[Harvey Keitel]] was dubbed by [[Roy Dotrice]] in post production for ''[[Saturn 3]]\n*[[Dave Coulier]] dubbed replacement of swear words for [[Richard Pryor]] in multiple TV versions of his movies\n\n===Process===\nThe tasks involved are performed by three different agents{{clarify|What are agents, and what are the three kinds of agents?|date=June 2019}} in the dubbing process: \n# translation \n# take segmentation \n# insertion of dubbing symbols \n# lip-sync \n# dialogue writing and the emulation of natural discourse\n\nSometimes the translator performs all five tasks. In other cases, the translator just submits a rough translation and a dialogue writer does the rest.\n\n====Dialog writing====\n\nThe dialogue writer\u2019s role is to make the translation sound natural of the target language, and to make the translation sound like a credible dialogue instead of merely a translated text.<ref>Chaume, F. (2013). Research paths in audiovisual translation: The case of dubbing. In The Routledge handbook of translation studies (pp. \n306-320). Routledge.</ref>\n\nAnother task of dialogue writers is to check whether a translation matches an on-screen character\u2019s mouth movements or not, by reading aloud simultaneously with the character. The dialogue writer often stays in the recording setting with the actors or the voice talents, to ensure that the dialogue is being spoken in the way that it was written to be, and to avoid any ambiguity in the way the dialogue is to be read (focusing on emphasis, intonation, pronunciation, articulation, pronouncing foreign words correctly, etc.). The overall goal is to make sure the script creates the illusion of authenticity of the spoken language.\n\n====Rythmo band====\nAn alternative method to dubbing, called \"rythmo band\" (or \"[[Lip sync|lip-sync]] band\"), has historically been used in [[Canada]] and [[France]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} It provides a more precise guide{{explain|how is it more precise? What's the difference?|date=June 2019}} for the actors, [[Film director|directors]], and technicians, and can be used to complement the traditional ADR method. The \"band\" is actually a clear 35&nbsp;mm [[film leader]] on which the dialogue is hand-written in [[India ink]], together with numerous additional indications for the actor\u2014including laughs, cries, length of syllables, mouth sounds, breaths, and mouth openings and closings. The rythmo band is projected in the studio and scrolls in perfect synchronisation with the picture.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nStudio time is used more efficiently, since with the aid of scrolling text, picture, and audio cues, actors can read more lines per hour than with ADR alone (only picture and audio). With ADR, actors can average 10\u201312 lines per hour, while rythmo band can facilitate the reading of 35-50 lines per hour.<ref>{{cite web |title=U of U Sound Final |url=http://quizlet.com/8640541/u-of-u-sound-final-flash-cards/ |work=Quizlet |publisher=Quizlet LLC |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Quizlet |year=2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the preparation of a rythmo band is a time-consuming process involving a series of specialists organised in a production line. This has prevented the technique from being more widely adopted, but software emulations of rythmo band technology overcome the disadvantages of the traditional rythmo band process and significantly reduce the time needed to prepare a dubbing session.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}o\n\n==<span id=\"Practice of dubbing foreign films throughout the world\"></span> Global use==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Dub localization===\nDub localization, also often simply referred to as [[Language localization|localization]], is the practice of [[voice-over translation]] that alters a [[film]] or [[television series]] from one region of the world to the local language of another.\n\nThe new voice track is usually spoken by a [[voice actor]]. In many countries, actors who regularly perform this duty remain little-known, with the exception of particular circles (such as anime [[fandom]]) or when their voices have become synonymous with roles or actors whose voices they usually dub. In the United States, many of these voice artists may employ pseudonyms or go uncredited due to [[Screen Actors Guild]] regulations or the desire to dissociate themselves from the role.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nDub localisation is a contentious issue in [[cinephilia]] amongst aficionados of foreign [[filmmaking]] and [[television program]]s, particularly [[anime]] fans. While some localisation is virtually inevitable in translation, the controversy surrounding how much localisation is \"too much\" is often discussed in such communities, especially when the final dub product is significantly different from the original. Some fans frown on any extensive localisation, while others expect it, and to varying degrees, appreciate it.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Dubbing films in Europe.png|thumb|300px|{{legend|#0000FF|Dubbing only for children: Otherwise solely subtitles.}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|General dubbing: Countries using a full-cast dubbing.}}\n{{legend|#FFFF00|Voice-over: Countries using a couple or just one voice actor, whereas the original soundtrack persists.

For movies in cinemas with clear target audiences (both below and above 10\u201311 years of age), both a dubbed and a subtitled version are usually available.\n\n=====Albania=====\nThe first movie dubbed in [[Albanian language]] was ''[[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg]]'' in 1954 and since then, there have been thousands of popular titles dubbed in Albanian by different dubbing studios. All animated movies and children's programs are dubbed into Albanian language, many live-action movies as well. TV series nevertheless are usually not dubbed, they are subtitled except for a few [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Brazil]]ian and [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap operas, like: ''[[Por ti (telenovela)|Por Ti]]'', ''[[Celebridade]]'', ''[[A Casa das Sete Mulheres]]'', ''[[Parampar\u00e7a (TV series)|Parampar\u00e7a]]'', etc. As for documentaries, Albania usually uses voice-over.\n\n=====Belgium=====\nIn the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium ([[Flanders]]), movies and TV series are shown in their original language with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], with the exception of most movies made for a young audience. In the latter case, sometimes separate versions are recorded in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Flanders]] (for instance, several [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Walt Disney films]] and [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]]). These dubbed versions only differ from each other in their use of different voice actors and different pronunciation, while the text is almost the same.\n\nIn the French-speaking part of Belgium ([[Wallonia]]), the range of French-dubbed versions is approximately as wide as the [[German language|German]] range, where nearly all movies and TV series are dubbed.\n\n=====Bosnia and Herzegovina=====\n[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] usually uses [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubs, but they have dubbed some cartoons in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] by themselves, for example ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]''. Children's programs (both animated and live-action) are airing dubbed (in Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian), while every other program is subtitled (in Bosnian).\n\n=====Croatia=====\nIn [[Croatia]], foreign films and TV series are always subtitled, while most children's programs and animated movies are dubbed into [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The practice of dubbing began in the 1980s in some animated shows and continued in 90's, 00's and forward in other shows and films, the latter ones being released in home media. Recently, more efforts have been made to introduce dubbing, but public reception has been poor in some exceptions. Regardless of language, Croatian audiences prefer subtitling to dubbing, however it is still popular in animated films. Some previously popular shows (such as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'') lost their appeal completely after the practice of dubbing began, and the dubbing was eventually removed from the programs, even though most animated shows shown on television and some on home media have been well received by people watching dubbed versions of them. This situation is similar with theater movies, with only those intended for children being dubbed (such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and ''[[Shark Tale]]''), but nowadays are shown in dubbed versions. Also, there has been an effort to impose dubbing by [[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]], with ''[[La Fea M\u00e1s Bella]]'' translated as ''Ru\u017ena ljepotica'' (literally, \"The Ugly Beauty\"), a Mexican telenovela, but it failed. Some of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubbing is also broadcast in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\n=====Estonia=====\nIn [[Estonia]] in cinemas, only children's animated films are dubbed and live-action films are shown in the original English and Russian languages with subtitles at cinemas. Subtitles are usually presented in both Estonian and [[Russian language]]s. Cartoons and animated series voiced by dubbing or [[Voice-over|voiceover]] and live-action films and television series only with Estonian subtitles also but with English and Russian Dub Languages. Animated films are commonly shown in both the originals and Russian languages and dubbed into Estonian (or Russian in many cinemas). Most Estonian-language television channels use subtitles English and Russian Audio for foreign-language films and TV channels. However, Russian language channels tend to use dubbing more often, especially for Russian channels broadcast from [[Russia]] (as opposed to Russian channels broadcast from Estonia).\n\n=====Greece=====\nIn [[Greece]], most cartoon films have dubs. Usually when a movie has a Greek dub the dub is shown in cinemas but subtitled versions are shown as well. Foreign TV shows for adults are shown in their original versions with subtitles, most cartoons, for example, ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[The Jetsons]]'' were always dubbed, while ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' are always subtitled and contain the original English dialogue, since they are mostly for adults rather than children, (even though the movie ''[[Space Jam]]'' was subtitled instead of being dubbed, since also this is suitable for children). Also some Japanese anime series are dubbed in Greek (such as Pok\u00e9mon, Pichi Pichi Pitch, Sailor Moon etc.) The only television programs dubbed in Greek includes [[Mexico|Mexican]] TV series (like ''[[Rub\u00ed (2004 telenovela)|Rub\u00ed]]'' and ''[[La usurpadora (Mexican TV series)|La usurpadora]]'') and teen series (like ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''). However, when [[Skai TV]] was re-launched in April 2006, the network opted for dubbing almost all foreign shows in Greek, unlike other Greek channels which had always broadcast most of the programs in their original language with subtitles.\n\n=====Ireland=====\nIreland usually receives the same film versions as the UK. However some films have been dubbed into [[Irish language|Irish]] by [[TG4]], including the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bY4JK5PR4MAC&lpg=PA275&ots=D6dkX7Up-y&dq=Harry%20Potter%20TG4&pg=PA275#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Writing and Translating for Children''], Elena Di Giovanni, Chiara Elefante, Roberta Pederzoli, Peter Lang, 2010, page 259</ref>\n\n=====Netherlands=====\nIn the [[Netherlands]], for the most part, Dutch versions are only made for children's and family films. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Dutch dubbing, but usually those cinemas with more screening rooms also provide the original subtitled version, such as movies like ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''.\n\n=====North Macedonia=====\n[[North Macedonia]] dubbed many cartoons in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], but they also air some [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs. Children's programs are airing dubbed (in Macedonian or Serbian), while every other program is subtitled (in Macedonian). They use [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs for [[Disney]] movies, because there are no [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] [[Disney]] dubs.\n\n=====Poland=====\n{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called \"juxtareading,\" is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference\u2014all dialogues are voiced by one off-screen reader ({{lang-pl|lektor}}), preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.\n\nIt is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}</ref>\n\nPoland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).\n\nPolish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronisation. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of that time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.\n\nThe number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.\n\nOverall, during 1948\u20131998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.\n\nIn 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2007</ref> It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.\n\nCurrently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.\n\nSince theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska \u2013 former distributor of Disney's films \u2013 decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.\n\n=====Portugal=====\nIn [[Portugal]], dubbing was banned under a 1948 law as a way of protecting the domestic film industry and reduce the access to culture as most of the population was illiterate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |title=amor de perdi\u00e7\u00e3o - especiais |date=21 January 2005 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050121055806/http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |archivedate=21 January 2005  }}</ref> Until 1994, animated movies, as well as other TV series for children shown in Portugal, have imported [[Brazilian Portuguese]] dubs due to the lack of interest from Portuguese companies in the dubbing industry. This lack of interest was justified, since there were already quality dubbed copies of shows and movies in Portuguese made by [[Brazil]]ians. ''[[The Lion King]]'' was the first feature film to be dubbed in [[European Portuguese]] rather than strictly Brazilian Portuguese. Currently, all movies for children are dubbed in European Portuguese. Subtitles are preferred in Portugal,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/polemica-dobragem-serie-einstein-gera-criticas-axn-118969|title=Pol\u00e9mica: dobragem da s\u00e9rie 'Einstein' gera cr\u00edticas ao AXN|access-date=29 March 2017|date=3 February 2017|work=O Jornal Econ\u00f3mico|quote=Ao contr\u00e1rio de alguns mercados como o espanhol e brasileiro, o p\u00fablico portugu\u00eas n\u00e3o se mostra recetivo a esta op\u00e7\u00e3o.|language=portuguese}}</ref> used in every foreign-language [[Documentary film|documentary]], TV series and film. The exception to this preference is when children are the target audience.\n\nWhile on TV, children's shows and movies are always dubbed, in cinemas, films with a clear juvenile target can be found in two versions, one dubbed (identified by the letters V.P. for ''vers\u00e3o portuguesa'' - \"Portuguese version\") and another subtitled version (V.O. for ''vers\u00e3o original'' - \"original version\"). This duality applies only to juvenile films. Others use subtitles only. While the quality of these dubs is recognised (some have already received international recognition and prizes), original versions with subtitles are usually preferred by the adults (''[[Bee Movie]]'', for example). Dubbing cartoons aimed at adults (such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' or ''[[South Park]]'') is less common. When ''The Simpsons Movie'' debuted in Portugal, most cinemas showed both versions (V.O. and V.P.), but in some small cities, cinemas decided to offer only the Portuguese version, a decision that led to public protest. Presently, [[live action]] series and movies are always shown in their original language format with Portuguese subtitles. Television programs for young children (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[Big Bad Beetleborgs]]'', etc.) are dubbed into European Portuguese. Some video games aimed at adults (such as [[God of War III]], [[Halo 3]], [[Assassin's Creed III]] and [[inFamous 2]]) are dubbed in European Portuguese, although there they provide an option to select the original language.\n\n=====Romania=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Hungarian, because graph QA11 of the Eurobarometer lists the number 62 next to RO (Romania). Hungary is HU.-->\nIn [[Romania]], virtually all programmes intended for children are dubbed in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], including cartoons, live-action movies and TV series on [[Disney Channel Romania|Disney Channel]], [[Cartoon Network (Europe)|Cartoon Network]], [[Minimax tv|Minimax]], and [[Nickelodeon]], as well as those shown on general television networks, children-focused series (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[The New Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Planet's Funniest Animals]]'') or movies screened on children's television. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Romanian dubbing. However, those cinemas with more screening rooms usually also provide the original subtitled version. Such was the case for movies like ''[[Babe (movie)|Babe]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (movie)|Cars]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''. Other foreign TV shows and movies are shown in the original language with Romanian subtitles. Subtitles are usually preferred in the Romanian market. According to \"Special Eurobarometer 243\" (graph QA11.8) of the [[European Commission]] (research carried out in November and December 2005), 62% of Romanians prefer to watch foreign films and programmes with subtitles (rather than dubbed), 22% prefer dubbing, and 16% declined to answer.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\">[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 243] of the European Commission with the title \"Europeans and their Languages\", published in February 2006 with research carried out in November and December 2005. Barely 2% of Romanians consider watching original-language versions most effective into learning a new language (Table QA7b).</ref> This is led by the assumption that watching movies in their original versions is very useful for learning foreign languages. However, according to the same Eurobarometer, virtually no Romanian found this method\u2014watching movies in their original version\u2014to be the most efficient way to learn foreign languages, compared to 53 percent who preferred language lessons at school.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn Romania, foreign language television programs and films are generally subtitled rather than dubbed.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=csMetRFKXmgC&lpg=PT61&dq=romania%20dubbing%20tv&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q=romania%20dubbing%20tv&f=true ''Dracula is Dead: How Romanians Survived Communism, Ended It, and Emerged Since 1989 as the New Italy''], Sheilah Kast, Jim Rosapepe, 2009, page 49</ref> This includes programs in non-Western languages, such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Korean language|Korean]] or [[Hindi language|Hindi]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aXutBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA91&dq=romania+subtitles+television&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiI-s2aysvOAhXrAMAKHXs4Ca4Q6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&q=romania%20subtitles%20television&f=true ''The Global Impact of South Korean Popular Culture: Hallyu Unbound''], Valentina Marinescu, Lexington Books, 2014, page 91</ref>\n\n=====Serbia=====\n[[Serbian language]] dubs are made mainly for [[Serbia]], but they broadcast in [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia & Herzegovina]], too. Children's animated and some live-action movies and TV series are dubbed into Serbian, while live-action films and TV series for adults are always airing subtitled, because in this region people prefer subtitling for live-action formats. [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap opera ''[[Lale Devri]]'' started airing dubbed in 2011, on [[RTV Pink]], but because of bad reception, dub failed and rest of TV series was aired subtitled. ''[[Married... with Children]]'' was dubbed, too.\n\nThe dubbing of cartoon series in former [[Yugoslavia]] during the 1980s had a twist of its own: famous [[Serbia]]n actors, such as [[Nikola Simi\u0107 (actor)|Nikola Simi\u0107]], [[Mi\u0107a Tati\u0107]], [[Nada Blam]] and others provided the voices for characters of [[Disney]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and other companies, frequently using region-specific phrases and sentences and, thus, adding a dose of local humor to the translation of the original lines. These phrases became immensely popular and are still being used for [[tongue-in-cheek]] comments in specific situations. These dubs are today considered cult dubs. The only dub made after 1980s and 1990s ones that's considered cult is ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' dub, made by [[B92]] in period 2002\u20132017, because of a great popularity and memorable translation with local humor phrases, such as 1980s dubs translation.\n\nSome Serbian dubs are also broadcast in [[North Macedonia]], while cult dubs made during [[Yugoslavia]] were aired all over the country (today's [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Slovenia]], [[North Macedonia]] and [[Serbia]]).\n\n=====Slovenia=====\nIn [[Slovenia]], all foreign films and television programs are subtitled with the exception of children's movies and TV shows (both animated or live-action). While dubbed versions are always shown in cinemas and later on TV channels, cinemas will sometimes play subtitled versions of children's movies as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n=====United Kingdom=====\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the vast majority of foreign language films are subtitled, although mostly animated films are dubbed in English.  These usually originate from [[North America]], as opposed to being dubbed locally. Foreign language serials shown on BBC Four are subtitled into English (although open subtitles are dropped during dialogues with English language segments already).  There have, however, been notable examples of films and TV programmes successfully dubbed in the UK, such as the Japanese ''[[Monkey (TV series)|Monkey]]'' and French ''[[The Magic Roundabout|Magic Roundabout]]'' series.  When airing films on television, channels in the UK often choose subtitling over dubbing, even if a dubbing in English exists. It is also a fairly common practice for animation aimed at [[Preschool education|preschool]] children to be re-dubbed with British voice actors replacing the original voices, such as Spin Master Entertainment's [[PAW Patrol]] series, although this is not done with shows aimed at older audiences.  The off-screen narrated portions of some programmes and reality shows that originate from North America are also redone with British English voices.  \n\nSome animated films and TV programmes are also dubbed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\n[[Hinterland (TV series)|Hinterland]] displays a not so common example of a bilingual production. Each scene is filmed twice, in the English and Welsh languages, apart from a few scenes where Welsh with subtitles is used for the English version.<ref>{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/30/hinterland-tv-noir-wales |title=Hinterland \u2013 the TV noir so good they made it twice |first=Stephen |last=Moss |date=30 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=[[London]] |access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Nordic countries=====\nIn the [[Nordic countries]], dubbing is used only in animated features (except [[adult animated]] features) and other films for younger audiences. Some cinemas in the major cities may also screen the original version, usually as the last showing of the day, or in a smaller auditorium in a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]].\n\nIn television programs with off-screen narration, both the original audio and on-screen voices are usually subtitled in their native languages.\n\nThe Nordic countries are often treated as a common market issuing [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases with original audio and user choosable subtitle options in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The covers often have text in all four languages as well, but are sometimes unique for each country. Some releases may include other European language audio and/or subtitles (i.e. German, Greek, Hungarian or Italian). Children's films typically have Nordic audio tracks in all four languages, as well as original audio in most cases.\n\nIn [[Finland]], the dubbed version from [[Sweden]] may also be available at certain cinemas for children of the 5% Swedish-speaking minority, but only in cities or towns with a significant percentage of Swedish speakers. Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually only have the original audio, except for children's films, which have both Finnish and Swedish language tracks, in addition to the original audio and subtitles in both languages.\n\nIn Finnish movie theaters, films for adult audiences have both Finnish and Swedish subtitles, the Finnish printed in basic font and the Swedish printed below the Finnish in a cursive font. In the early ages of television, foreign TV shows and movies were voiced by narrator in Finland. Later, subtitles became a practice on Finnish television. Dubbing of films other than children's films is unpopular in Finland, as in many other countries. A good example is ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''. While the original version was well-received, the Finnish-dubbed version received poor reviews, with some critics even calling it a disaster.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} On the other hand, many dubs of [[Disney]] animated features have been well-received, both critically and by the public.\n\nIn [[Iceland]], the dubbed version of film and TV is usually [[Danish language|Danish]] with some translated into [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. [[LazyTown]], an Icelandic TV show originally broadcast in English, was dubbed into Icelandic, amongst thirty-two other languages, and it remains the TV show to have been dubbed into the most languages.\n\n====General films and programming====\nIn the [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] language-speaking markets of [[Europe]], almost all foreign films and television shows are dubbed (the exception being the majority of theatrical releases of adult-audience movies in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]] and [[Turkey]] and high-profile videos in Russia). There are few opportunities to watch foreign movies in their original versions. In [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], even in the largest cities, there are few cinemas that screen original versions with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], or without any translation. However, digital [[pay-TV]] programming is often available in the original language, including the latest movies. Prior to the rise of DVDs, which in these countries are mostly issued with multi-language audio tracks, original-language films (those in languages other than the country's official language) were rare, whether in theaters, on TV, or on home video, and subtitled versions were considered a product for small [[niche market]]s such as intellectual or [[art film]]s.\n\n\n\n\n=====France=====\nIn [[France]], movies and TV series are, except purely arthouse films, usually released in the dubbed French-language version. The original-language version of the film with French subtitles is released in designated theaters which show only subtitled versions or both versions are shown at different times or split screenings between both versions. However, dubbing is the norm and subtitling is only for niche audience and movies with subtitles are usually very small arthouse films with very limited commercial prospects for pay and free TV airings and also home entertainment (VOD, DVD). Dubbing in the French Language is thus absolutely essential for any sale to be made.\n\nSince the digitalization of over-the-air television broadcasters, both versions have been offered to the customer simultaneously.  By default, foreign films and TV programmes shown on television are dubbed into French on a channel's main audio feed. However, with the advent of digital television, viewers can access the original language feed for some programmes, as well as matching subtitles.  In addition, the TV network ARTE has a French-language track on its main audio feed as well as a German-language track.  \n \nMost movies are released nationwide in dubbed version and subtitled versions where available with the exception of very limited often micro-budget arthouse productions that do stem come from the \"hollywood movie production\" machine which are exclusively arthouse films and not dubbed at the time of their theatrical release.\n\nTheaters showing these kind of movies or also showing commercial films in the original-language version with French subtitles are very rare outside of the big cities and most of them are located in [[Paris]] which has the most \"cinephile\" cinemas in France. Often these \"niche\" films are only released in [[Paris]] region.\n\nA theater showing subtitled versions of original language movies are typically well known for this and will advertise this also on the poster advising moviegoers that the film is shown in an original-language version (usually abbreviated VO [''version originale''] or VOST [''version originale sous-titr\u00e9e'']), as opposed to VF [''version fran\u00e7aise''], the latter then becoming what is known and used also in the neighboring countries like Belgium or Switzerland, as the \"FRENCH LANGUAGE VERSION\" of the film.)\n\nBecause the alterations made to the original film are so profound, making it no longer viewable or understandable for audiences that speak the language the film was originally shot in, the final dubbed version is called the \"French-language version\", as opposed to the use of subtitles which leave the film in its original state.\nThe choice to dub or not at the time of theatrical release is a decision made by the distributor releasing the film based upon their recoupment strategy for the film and their prognosis of the commercial prospects. Given the fact that a dub is needed for home entertainment and TV sales, only very small arthouse films are never dubbed.\nOnly a very small percentage (according to the official institute CNC in France only 16.4% of all ticket-sales were for movies watched in the original-language version with subtitles) and this is counting Blockbusters and others shown in their original-language version with subtitles and the small number of films that are never dubbed.\nVoice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in the European French language can be viewed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Macy]]<br />[[Joe Pantoliano]] ||\n|}\n\n=====Italy=====\nIn [[Italy]], dubbing is systematic, with a tradition going back to the 1930s in [[Rome]], [[Milan]], [[Florence]] and [[Turin]]. In [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] fascist Italy, release of movies in foreign languages was banned for political reasons. Rome is the principal base of the dubbing industry, where major productions such as movies, drama, documentaries and some cartoons are dubbed. However, dubbing in Milan is mostly of cartoons and some minor productions. Practically every foreign film (mostly American ones) of every genre, for children or adults, as well as TV shows, are dubbed into Italian. In big cities, original-version movies can also be seen in some theaters but it is not so common. Subtitles may be available on [[Late night television|late-night programs]] on mainstream TV channels, and on pay-TV all movies are available in the original language with Italian subtitles, many shows featuring their original [[soundtrack]]s.\n\nEarly in their careers, actors such as [[Alberto Sordi]] or [[Nino Manfredi]] worked extensively as dubbing actors. At one point, common practice in Italian cinema was to shoot scenes [[MOS (filmmaking)|MOS]] (motor only sync or motor only shot) and dub the dialogue in post-production. A notable example of this practice is ''[[The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly]]'', in which all actors had to dub in their own voices.\n\nVideo games are generally either dubbed into Italian (for instance [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]] saga, [[Halo (series)|Halo]] or [[Harry Potter (video games)|Harry Potter]] series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Italian language.\n\nA list of the voice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in Italian can be enlisted here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Some dubbing actors have achieved popularity for their voices, such as [[Constantino Romero]] (who dubs [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Darth Vader]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s [[The Terminator|Terminator]], among others) and [[\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz (filmmaking)|\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz]] (the official European Spanish dub-over voice artist for [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Hayden Christensen]]). Currently, with the spread of [[digital terrestrial television]], viewers can choose between the original and the dubbed soundtracks for most movies and television.\n\nIn some communities such as [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], some foreign programs are also dubbed into their own languages, different from European Spanish. Films from \nthe Spanish-speaking America shown in these communities are shown in their original language, while strong regional accents (from the Spanish-speaking America or from Spain) may be subtitled in news and documentaries.\n\n=====Germany, Austria and Switzerland=====\nThe [[German language|Germanophone]] dubbing market is the largest in Europe. Germany has the most foreign-movie-dubbing studios per capita and per given area in the world and according to the German newspaper [[Die Welt]] 52% of all voice actors currently work in the German dubbing industry. In Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], practically all films, shows, television series and foreign [[soap opera]]s are shown in dubbed versions created for the German market. However, in some of Switzerland's towns and cities (particularly along the language-borders), subtitled versions are common. Dubbing films is a traditional and common practice in German-speaking Europe, since subtitles are not accepted and used as much as in other European countries. According to a European study, Austria is the country with the highest rejection rate (more than 70 percent) of subtitles, followed by Italy, Spain and Germany.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\nIn German-speaking markets, [[PC game|computer]] and video games feature German text menus and are dubbed into the German language if speaking parts exist.\n\nIn recent years, Swiss and Austrian television stations have been showing increasing numbers of movies, series and TV-programmes in \"dual sound,\" which means the viewer can choose between the original language (e.g. English) and the language of the channel (German, French or Italian, according to the location).\n\nAlthough German-speaking [[voice actor]]s play only a secondary role, they are still notable for providing familiar voices to well-known actors. Famous foreign actors are known and recognised for their [[German language|German]] voice, and the German audience is used to them, so dubbing is also a matter of authenticity. However, in larger cities, there are theaters where movies can be seen in their original versions, as [[English language|English]] has become somewhat more popular among young educated viewers. On German [[mainstream]] television, films are never broadcast with subtitles, but pay-per-view programming is often available in the original language. Subtitled niche and [[art film]]s are sometimes aired on smaller networks.\n\nGerman-dubbed versions sometimes diverge greatly from the original, especially in adding humorous elements absent from the original. In extreme cases, such as ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', the German-dubbed version was more successful than the English original. Often, translation adds [[sexually explicit]] gags the U.S. versions might not be allowed to use. For example, in ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', the translators changed ''\"The [[Door hanger|Do Not Disturb sign]] will hang on the door tonight\"'' to ''\"The only hanging thing tonight will be the Do Not Disturb sign\"''.\n\nSome movies dubbed in Austria diverge from the German Standard version in addressing other people but only when the movies are dubbed into certain Austrian dialect versions. (Mr. and Mrs. are translated into Herr and Frau which is usually not translated in order to be in lip-sync).\nSometimes even English pronounced first names are translated and are pronounced into the correct German equivalent (English name \"Bert\" became Southern German pronounced name \"Bertl\" which is an abbreviation for any name either beginning or even ending with \"bert\", e.g. \"Berthold\" or \"Albert\".)\n\nSome movies dubbed before [[German reunification|reunification]] exist in different versions for the [[East Germany|east]] and the [[West Germany|west]]. They use different translations, and often differ in the style of dubbing.\n\nSome of the well-known German dubbing voice artists are listed below.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Czech dubbing was also extensively used in the broadcast of Slovak television channels, but since 2008 Slovak language laws require any newer shows (understood as the first television broadcast in Slovakia) to be provided with Slovak localisation (dubbing or subtitles); since then, television broadcasts of films, TV series and cartoons have been dubbed into Slovak.\n\n=====Hungary=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Romanian because the sources in this section are directly related to Hungary.-->\nIn [[Hungary]], dubbing is almost universally common. Almost every foreign movie or TV show released in Hungary is dubbed into Hungarian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://matadornetwork.com/abroad/9-culture-shocks-americans-will-hungary/ |title=9 culture shocks Americans will have in Hungary}}</ref> The history of dubbing dates back to the 1950s, when the country was still under communist rule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masterfilm.hu/services |title=Masterfilm :: Services}}</ref> One of the most iconic Hungarian dubs was of the American cartoon ''[[The Flintstones]]'', with a local translation by [[J\u00f3zsef Romh\u00e1nyi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherlockian-sherlock.com/the-dubbed-versions-of-sherlock-holmes.php |title=Dubbed versions Sherlock Holmes, dubbing, hungarian voices}}</ref> The Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis (ISzDB) is the largest Hungarian database for film dubs, with information for many live action and animated films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iszdb.hu |title=ISzDb - Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis}}</ref> On page 59 of the Eurobarometer, 84% of Hungarians said that they prefer dubbing over subtitles.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn the [[Socialism|socialist]] era, every film was dubbed with professional and mostly popular actors. Care was taken to make sure the same voice actor would lend his voice to the same original actor. In the early 1990s, as cinemas tried to keep up with showing newly released films, subtitling became dominant in the cinema. This, in turn, forced TV channels to make their own cheap versions of dubbed soundtracks for the movies they presented, resulting in a constant degrading of dubbing quality. Once this became customary, cinema distributors resumed the habit of dubbing for popular productions, presenting them in a below-average quality. However, every feature is presented with the original soundtrack in at least one cinema in large towns and cities.\n\nHowever, in Hungary, most documentary films and series (for example, those on [[Discovery Channel]], [[National Geographic Channel]]) are made with [[Voice-over|voiceovers]]. Some old movies and series, or ones that provide non-translatable jokes and conversations (for example, the ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' television series), are shown only with subtitles.\n\nThere is a more recent problem arising from dubbing included on DVD releases. Many generations have grown up with an original (and, by current technological standards, outdated) soundtrack, which is either technologically (mono or bad quality stereo sound) or legally (expired soundtrack license) unsuitable for a DVD release. Many original features are released on DVD with a new soundtrack, which in some cases proves to be extremely unpopular, thus forcing DVD producers to include the original soundtrack. In some rare cases, the Hungarian soundtrack is left out altogether. This happens notably with Warner Home Video Hungary, which ignored the existence of Hungarian soundtracks completely, as they did not want to pay the licenses for the soundtracks to be included on their new DVD releases, which appear with improved picture quality, but very poor subtitling.\n\n=====Poland=====\n{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called \"juxtareading,\" is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference\u2014all dialogues are voiced by one off-screen reader ({{lang-pl|lektor}}), preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.\n\nIt is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}</ref>\n\nPoland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).\n\nPolish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronisation. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of that time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.\n\nThe number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.\n\nOverall, during 1948\u20131998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.\n\nIn 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2007</ref> It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.\n\nCurrently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.\n\nSince theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska \u2013 former distributor of Disney's films \u2013 decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.\n\n=====Russia=====\n[[Russia]]n television is generally dubbed, but in the cases using voice-over dub technique with only a couple of voice actors, with the original speech still audible underneath. In the [[Soviet Union]], most foreign movies to be officially released were dubbed. Voice-over dub was invented in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s when with the fall of the regime, many popular foreign movies, previously forbidden, or at least questionable under communist rule, started to flood in, in the form of low-quality home-copied videos. Being unofficial releases, they were dubbed in a very primitive way. For example, the translator spoke the text directly over the audio of a video being copied, using primitive equipment.\n\nThe quality of the resulting dub was very low, the translated phrases were off-sync, interfering with the original voices, background sounds leaked into the track, translation was inaccurate and, most importantly, all dub voices were made by a single person who usually lacked the intonation of the original, making comprehension of some scenes quite difficult. This method of translation exerted a strong influence on Russian pop culture. Voices of translators became recognizable for generations.\n\nIn modern Russia, the overdubbing technique is still used in many cases, although with vastly improved quality, and now with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices. Video games are generally either dubbed into Russian (such as the ''Legend of Spyro'' trilogy, the ''Skylanders'' series, the ''Assassin's Creed'' saga, the ''Halo'' series, the ''Harry Potter'' series, etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Russian language.\n\nReleases of cinemas are almost always dubbed in the Russian language. On television series are shown as a dubbed translation and offscreen. Subtitles are not used at all.\n\n=====Ukraine=====\nIn [[Ukraine]], since 2006 cinema releases are almost always dubbed into Ukrainian with the overdubbing technique and multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices with a small percent of art-house/documentaries shown in the original language with Ukrainian subtitles. For television, TV channels usually release movies and TV-shows with a Ukrainian voiceover, although certain high-profile films and TV shows are dubbed rather than voice-overe'ed.\n\nIn the past Russian-language films, TV series, cartoons, animated series and TV programs were usually not dubbed but were shown with the original audio with Ukrainian subtitles. However, this practise has been slowly abandoned since the late 2010s: all children's films and cartoons regardless of the original language (including Russian) are always dubbed into Ukrainian; example of the first Russian cartoons dubbed into Ukrainian for the cinematic-release is [[The Snow Queen 2]] (2015), [[A Warrior's Tail]] (2015), Volki i Ovtsy: Be-e-e-zumnoe prevrashenie (2016), Ivan Tsarevich i Seryy Volk 3 (2016), Bremenskie razboyniki (2016), [[The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice|The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice (2017)]], [[Fantastic Journey to OZ]] (2017), Fixies: Top Secret (2017) etc.; the same trend is seen among Russian language feature films for adults, with the first such films dubbed into Ukrainian including [[Battle for Sevastopol|Battle for Sevastopol (2015)]], [[Hardcore Henry|Hardcore Henry (2016)]], [[The Duelist (2016 film)|The Duelist (2016)]].\n\n=====Latvia and Lithuania=====\nIn [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], only children's movies get dubbed in the cinema, while many live-action movies for an older audience use voice-over. In recent years however, many cartoons have been dubbed into Latvian and Lithuanian for TV. But some other kids shows, like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', use the voice-over.\n\n===Americas===\n====United States and English-speaking Canada====\nIn the United States and English-speaking Canada, [[live-action]] foreign films are usually shown in theaters with their original languages (with English subtitles). It is because live-action dubbed movies rarely did well in United States box office since the 1980s. The 1982 United States theatrical release of Wolfgang Peterson's ''[[Das Boot]]'' was the last major release to go out in both original and English-dubbed versions, and the film's original version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/|title=EDITORIAL: Life Isn't Beautiful Anymore, it's Dubbed|last=Indiewire|date=23 August 1999|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&gwt=pay|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805152511/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&gwt=pay|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 August 2018|title=Will Dubbing Fly in the U.S.?

The exceptions to this practice are either when an English dub has not been produced for the program (usually in the case of feature films) or when the program is being presented by a network that places importance on presenting it in its original format (as was the case when [[Turner Classic Movies]] aired several of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s works, which were presented both dubbed and subtitled). Most [[anime]] DVDs contain options for original Japanese, Japanese with subtitles, and English-dubbed, except for a handful of series that have been heavily edited or [[Americanized|Americanised]]. In addition, Disney has a policy that makes its directors undergo stages to perfect alignment of certain lip movements so the movie looks believable.\n\nIn addition, a small number of British films have been re-dubbed when released in the United States, due to the usage of dialects which Americans are not familiar with (for example, ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' and ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''). However, British children's shows (such as ''[[Bob the Builder]]'') are always re-dubbed with American voice actors in order to make the series more understandable for American children. Conversely, British programs shown in Canada are not re-dubbed.\n\nSome television shows shown in the US have Spanish dubs.  These are accessible though the SAP (secondary audio program) function of the television unit.\n\n====Spanish-speaking countries====\nFor Spanish-speaking countries, all foreign-language programs, films, cartoons and documentaries shown on free-to-air TV networks are dubbed into [[Standard Spanish]], while broadcasts on [[Cable television|cable]] and [[Satellite television|satellite]] pan-regional channels are either dubbed or subtitled. In theaters, children's movies and most blockbuster films are dubbed into Standard Spanish or [[Mexican Spanish]], and are sometimes further dubbed into regional dialects of Spanish where they are released.\n\n====Mexico====\nIn [[Mexico]], by law, films shown in theaters must be shown in their original version. Films in languages other than Spanish are usually subtitled. Only educational documentaries and movies rated for children, as well as some movies that are expected to have a wide audience (for example, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' or ''[[Marvel's The Avengers|The Avengers]]'') may be dubbed, but this is not compulsory, and some animated films are shown in theaters in both dubbed and subtitled versions (for instance, some [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] productions). Nonetheless, a recent trend in several cinemas is to offer the dubbed versions only, with a stark decrease in the showing of the original ones.\n\nDubbing must be made in Mexico by Mexican nationals or foreigners residing in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |title=Ley Federal de Cinematograf\u00eda |language=Spanish |trans-title=Federal Law of Filmmaking |publisher=C\u00e1mara de Diputados |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722125937/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011  }}</ref> Still, several programs that are shown on pay TV are dubbed in other countries like [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]] or [[Colombia]].\n\nMost movies released on DVD feature [[Standard Spanish|neutral Spanish]] as a language option, and sometimes feature a specific dub for Mexican audiences (for example, ''Rio''). Foreign programs are dubbed on [[broadcast television systems|broadcast TV]], while on [[pay TV]] most shows and movies are subtitled. In a similar way to cinemas, in the last few years many channels on pay TV have begun to broadcast programs and films only in their dubbed version.\n\nDubbing became very popular in the 1990s with the rise in popularity of anime in Mexico. Some voice actors have become celebrities and are always identified with specific characters, such as [[Mario Casta\u00f1eda]] (who became popular by dubbing [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'') or [[Humberto V\u00e9lez]] (who dubbed [[Homer Simpson]] in the first 15 seasons of ''[[The Simpsons]]'').\n\nThe popularity of pay TV has allowed people to view several series in their original language rather than dubbed. Dubbing has been criticised for the use of TV or movie stars as voice actors (such as [[Ricky Martin]] in Disney's ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', or [[Eugenio Derbez]] in DreamWorks' ''Shrek''), or for the incorrect use of local popular culture that sometimes creates unintentional jokes or breaks the feeling of the original work (such as translating [[Sheldon Cooper]]'s \"Bazinga!\" to \"\u00a1Vacil\u00f3n!\").\n\nSeveral video games have been dubbed into neutral Spanish, rather than European Spanish, in Mexico (such as the ''Gears of War'' series, ''Halo 3'', ''Infamous 2'' and others). [[Sony]] recently announced that more games (such as ''God of War: Ascension'') will be dubbed into neutral Spanish.\n\n====Peru====\nIn [[Peru]], all foreign series, movies, and animated programming are shown dubbed in Latin American Spanish, with dubs imported from Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela on terrestrial and pay-television. Most movies intended for kids are being offered as dub-only movies, while most films aimed at older audiences are being offered dubbed and subtitled in Spanish. Also, at most theaters, kids films (on rare occasions) subtitled are commonly shown at nighttime. Most subtitled Pay-TV channels show both dubbed and subtitled version of every film they broadcast, being offered with a separate subtitle track and a second audio track in English. There is an increase of people preferring subtitle films and series rather than dubbed starting the late-2000s, as Peruvians viewers tend to get used to their original version.\n\nPeru used to do not produce their own dubs since dubbing studios never existed in that country until 2016, when the company \"Big Bang Films\" started to dub movies and series, however, since 2014 a group of dubbing actors created a group called \"Torre A Doblaje\", who is a group of actors who gives dubbing and locution service.\n\n====Brazil====\nIn [[Brazil]], foreign programs are invariably dubbed into [[Brazilian Portuguese]] on [[free to air TV]], with only a few exceptions. Films shown at cinemas are generally offered with both subtitled and dubbed versions, with dubbing frequently being the only choice for children's movies. Subtitling was primarily for adult audience movies until 2012. Since then, dubbed versions also became available for all ages. As a result, in recent years, more cinemas have opened in Brazil, attracting new audiences to the cinema who prefer dubbing. According to a [[Datafolha]] survey, 56% of Brazilian movie theaters' audience prefer to watch dubbed movies.<ref>http://revistaepoca.globo.com/cultura/noticia/2012/06/dublagem-venceu-legendas.html</ref> Most of the dubbing studios in Brazil is in the cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140319091221/http://ne10.uol.com.br/canal/cultura/noticia/2012/05/27/cresce-preferencia-por-filmes-dublados-nos-cinemas-brasileiros-344927.php Cresce prefer\u00eancia por filmes dublados nos cinemas brasileiros (in Portuguese)] Ne10, 27 May 2012.

By the end of the 1950s, most of the movies, TV series and cartoons on television in Brazil were shown in its original sound and subtitles. However, in 1962, a decree of President [[J\u00e2nio Quadros]] ruled that all foreign productions on television should be dubbed. This measure boosted the growth of dubbing in Brazil, and has led to several dubbing studios since then.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/cinema-e-tv/quando-surgiu-a-dublagem-no-brasil-e-no-mundo/ | title=Quando surgiu a dublagem no Brasil e no mundo?}}</ref> The biggest dubbing studio in Brazil was [[Herbert Richers]], headquartered in [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]] and closed in 2009, At its peak in the 80s and 90s, the Herbert Richers studios dubbed about 70% of the productions shown in Brazilian cinemas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://super.abril.com.br/mundo-estranho/quem-e-herbert-richers/ |title = Quem \u00e9 Herbert Richers?}}</ref>\n\nIn the 90's, with Saint Seiya, Dragon Ball and other anime shows becoming popular in Brazilian TV's, the voice actors and the dubbing career gained a higher space in Brazilian culture. Actors like [[Hermes Baroli]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Pegasus Seiya]], in ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' and actors like [[Ashton Kutcher]]), [[Marco Ribeiro]] (Brazilian dubber of many actors like [[Tom Hanks]], [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]], and [[Yusuke Urameshi]] from the anime ''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]'') and [[Wendel Bezerra]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] in ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'') are recognised for their most notable roles.\n\nPay TV commonly offers both dubbed and subtitled movies, with statistics showing that dubbed versions are becoming predominant.<ref>[http://oglobo.globo.com/revista-da-tv/dublagem-em-canais-de-tv-paga-provoca-polemica-3262532 Dublagem em canais de TV paga provoca pol\u00eamica (in Portuguese)] O Globo, 20 November 2011.

Games such as ''[[Halo 3]]'', ''[[God of War: Ascension]]'', ''[[inFamous 2]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', ''[[Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and others are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese. This is because despite the dropping of the dubbing law in Portugal in 1994, most companies in that country use the Brazilian Portuguese because of traditional usage during the days of the dubbing rule, along with these dubbings being more marketable than European Portuguese.\n\nA list that showcases Brazilian Portuguese voice artists that dub for actors and actresses are displayed here. However, there can also be different official dub artists for certain regions within Brazil. \n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! Brazilian Portuguese dubbing artists !!

They speak with a mixed accent, they pronounce /\u025b\u0303/ with a Parisian accent, but they pronounce \"\u00e2\" and \"\u00ea\" with a Quebec accent: ''gr\u00e2ce'' [\u0261\u0281\u0251\u02d0s] and ''\u00eatre'' [\u025b\u02d0t\u0281\u0325]. Occasionally, the dubbing of a series or a movie, such as ''The Simpsons'', is made using the more widely spoken ''[[joual]]'' variety of Quebec French. Dubbing has the advantage of making children's films and TV series more comprehensible to younger audiences. However, many [[bilingual]] Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois prefer subtitling, since they would understand some or all of the original audio. In addition, all films are shown in English, as well in certain theaters (especially in major cities and English-speaking areas such as the [[West Island]]), and some theatres, such as the Scotiabank Cinema [[Montreal]], show only movies in English. Most American television series are only available in English on [[DVD]], or on English-language channels, but some of the more popular ones have French dubs shown on mainstream networks, and are released in French on DVD as well, sometimes separately from an English-only version.\n\nFormerly, all French-language dubbed films in Quebec were imported from France and some still are. Such a practice was criticised by former politician [[Mario Dumont]] after he took his children to see the [[Standard French|Parisian French]] dub of ''Shrek the Third'', which Dumont found incomprehensible.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-pressing-hollywood-to-justify-lack-of-movie-dubbing/article1352554/ Quebec pressing Hollywood to justify lack of movie dubbing], The Canadian Press, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 26 May 2008</ref> After his complaints and a proposed bill, ''[[Bee Movie]]'', the film from [[DreamWorks Animation]], was dubbed in Quebec, making it the studio's first animated film to have a Quebec French dub, as all DreamWorks Animation films had previously been dubbed in France.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr\u00f4le d'abeille (v.o.a) Bee Movie |url=http://doublage.qc.ca/showMovie.php?id=1981 |work=Doublage.qc.ca |publisher=idgrafix |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Doublage.qc.ca |language=French}}</ref> In terms of Disney, the first Disney animated film to be dubbed in Quebec was ''Oliver and Company.'' The Disney Renaissance films were also dubbed in Quebec except for ''The Rescuers Down Under'', ''Beauty and the Beast'', and ''The Lion King''.\n\nIn addition, because Canadian viewers usually find Quebec French more comprehensible than other dialects of the language, some older film series that had the French-language versions of previous installments dubbed in France have had later ones dubbed in Quebec, often creating inconsistencies within the French version of the series' canon. [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series are examples. Both series had films released in the 1970s and 1980s, with no Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French dubbed versions; instead, the Parisian French versions, with altered character and object names and terms, were distributed in the province. However, later films in both series released 1999 and later were dubbed in Quebec, using different voice actors and \"reversing\" name changes made in France's dubbings due to the change in studio.\n\n===Asia===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\n\n====China====\nChina has a long tradition of dubbing foreign films into [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], starting in the 1930s. While during the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] era Western motion pictures may have been imported and dubbed into Chinese, since 1950 [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet movies]], dubbed primarily in Shanghai, became the main import.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|1987|p=40}}</ref> Beginning in the late 1970s, in addition to films, popular TV series from the United States, Japan, Brazil, and Mexico were also dubbed. The [[Shanghai]] Film Dubbing Studio has been the most well-known studio in the film dubbing industry in China. In order to generate high-quality products, they divide each film into short segments, each one lasting only a few minutes, and then work on the segments one-by-one. In addition to the correct meaning in translation, they make tremendous effort to match the lips of the actors to the dialogue. As a result, the dubbing in these films generally is not readily detected. The cast of dubbers is acknowledged at the end of a dubbed film. Several dubbing actors and actresses of the Shanghai Film Dubbing Studio have become well-known celebrities, such as Qiu Yuefeng, Bi Ke, Li Zi, and Liu Guangning. In recent years, however, especially in the larger cities on the east and south coasts, it has become increasingly common for movie theaters to show subtitled versions with the original soundtracks intact.\n\nMotion pictures are also dubbed into the languages of some of China's [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China|autonomous regions]]. Notably, the Translation Department of the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]] Movie Company (\u897f\u85cf\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a\u7535\u5f71\u516c\u53f8\u8bd1\u5236\u79d1)<ref name=humes20131122>[http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 Confucius the Movie: China Flop Dubbed at the State\u2019s Expense for Tibetan Movie-goers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130085415/http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 |date=30 November 2013 }}, 22 November 2013</ref> has been dubbing movies into the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] since the 1960s. In the early decades, it would dub 25 to 30 movies each year, the number rising to 60-75 by the early 2010s.<ref name=humes20131122/><ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2013-02/24/content_28045511.htm China Focus: Dubbed movies spice up life for Tibetans], Xinhua News Agency, 24 February 2013.</ref>\nMotion pictures are dubbed for China's [[Mongols in China|Mongol-]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur-speaking]] markets as well.<ref>{{citation\n|first=Paul |last=Clark|publisher=CUP Archive |year=1987|isbn=0521326389\n|title=Chinese Cinema: Culture and Politics Since 1949|series=Cambridge studies in film\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jzQ9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA60|page=60}}</ref>\n\n====Taiwan====\n[[Taiwan]] dubs some foreign films and TV series in Mandarin Chinese. Until the mid-1990s, the major national [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial channels]] both dubbed and subtitled all foreign programs and films and, for some popular programs, the original voices were offered in [[second audio program]]. Gradually, however, both terrestrial and cable channels stopped dubbing for [[prime time]] U.S. shows and films, while subtitling continued.\n\nIn the 2000s, the dubbing practice has differed depending on the nature and origin of the program. Animations, children's shows and some educational programs on PTS are mostly dubbed. English live-action movies and shows are not dubbed in theaters or on television. Japanese TV dramas are no longer dubbed, while [[Korean language|Korean]] dramas, [[Hong Kong]] dramas and dramas from other Asian countries are still often dubbed. Korean variety shows are not dubbed. Japanese and Korean films on Asian movie channels are still dubbed. In theaters, most foreign films are not dubbed, while animated films and some films meant for children offer a dubbed version. Hong Kong live-action films have a long tradition of being dubbed into Mandarin, while more famous films offer a [[Cantonese]] version.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nIn [[Hong Kong]], foreign television programmes, except for English-language and Mandarin television programmes, are dubbed in Cantonese. English-language and Mandarin programmes are generally shown in their original with subtitles. Foreign films, such as most live-action and animated films (such as anime and Disney), are usually dubbed in Cantonese. However most cinemas also offer subtitled versions of English-language films.\n\nFor the most part, foreign films and TV programmes, both live-action and animated, are generally dubbed in both Mandarin and Cantonese. For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film series, Elijah Wood's character [[Frodo Baggins]] was dubbed into Mandarin by [[Jiang Guangtao]] for China and Taiwan. For the Cantonese localisation, there were actually two dubs for Hong Kong and [[Macau]]. The first Cantonese dub, he was voiced by Leung Wai Tak, with a second Cantonese dub released, he was voiced by Bosco Tang.\n\nA list for Mandarin and Cantonese voice artists that dub for actors are shown here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In programs aimed at teenagers and adults, dubbing is rarely considered for translation, not only because of its high costs, but also because the audience is mainly multi-lingual. Most viewers in Israel speak at least one European language in addition to Hebrew, and a large part of the audience also speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Therefore, most viewers prefer to hear the original soundtrack, aided by Hebrew subtitles. Another problem is that dubbing does not allow for translation into two different languages simultaneously, as is often the case of Israeli television channels that use subtitles in Hebrew and another language (like [[Russian language|Russian]]) simultaneously.\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, many television programs appear on Japanese television subtitled or dubbed if they are intended for children. When the American film ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' was released in Japan in 1931, subtitles became the mainstream method of translating TV programs and films in Japan. Later, around the 1950s, foreign television programs and films began to be shown dubbed in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] on television. The first ones to be dubbed into Japanese were [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|the 1940s Superman cartoons]] in 1955.\n\nDue to the lack of video software for domestic television, video software was imported from abroad. When the television program was shown on television, it was mostly dubbed. There was a character limit for a small TV screen at a lower resolution, and this method was not suitable for the poor elderly and illiterate eye, as was audio dubbing. Presently, TV shows and movies (both those aimed at all ages and adults-only) are shown dubbed with the original language and Japanese subtitles, while providing the original language option when the same film is released on [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]]. Laserdisc releases of Hollywood films were almost always subtitled.\n\nAdult cartoons such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' are shown dubbed in Japanese on the [[WOWOW]] TV channel. ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'' was dubbed in Japanese by different actors instead of the same Japanese dubbing-actors from the cartoon because it was handled by a different Japanese dubbing studio, and it was marketed for the [[Kansai region|Kansai]] market. In Japanese theaters, foreign-language movies, except those intended for children, are usually shown in their original version with Japanese subtitles. Foreign films usually contain multiple Japanese-dubbing versions, but with several different original Japanese-dubbing voice actors, depending upon which TV station they are aired. [[NHK]], [[Nippon TV]], [[Fuji TV]], [[TV Asahi]], and [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] usually follow this practice, as do software releases on [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]. As for recent foreign films being released, there are now some film theaters in Japan that show both dubbed and subtitled editions.\n\nOn 22 June 2009, [[20th Century Fox]]'s Japanese division has opened up a [[Blu-ray]] lineup known as \"Emperor of Dubbing\", dedicated at having multiple Japanese dubs of popular English-language films (mostly Hollywood films) as well as retaining the original scripts, releasing them altogether in special Blu-ray releases. These also feature a new dub created exclusively for that release as a director's cut, or a new dub made with a better surround sound mix to match that of the original English mix (as most older Japanese dubbings were made on mono mixes to be aired on TV). Other companies have followed practice, like Universal Pictures's Japanese division [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan]] opening up \"Reprint of Memories\", along with [[:ja:\u30ef\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc \u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c6\u30a4\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8 \u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30f3|Warner Bros Japan]] having \"Power of Dubbing\", which act in a similar way by re-packaging all the multiple Japanese dubs of popular films and putting them out as Special Blu-ray releases.\n\n\"Japanese dub-over artists\" provide the voices for certain performers, such as those listed in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

However, some anime is censored, such as Japanese letters or content being edited for a suitable Korean audience. Western cartoons are dubbed in Korean as well, such as [[Nickelodeon]] cartoons like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Danny Phantom]]''. Several English-language (mostly American) live-action films are dubbed in [[Korean language|Korean]], but they are not shown in theaters. Instead they are only broadcast on South Korean television networks ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]], [[Educational Broadcasting System|EBS]]), while DVD import releases of these films are shown with Korean subtitles, such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. This may be due to the fact that the six American [[major film studio]]s may not own any rights to the Korean dubs of their live-action films that the Korean television networks have dubbed and aired. Even if they don't own the rights, Korean or non-Korean viewers can record from Korean-dubbed live-action films from television broadcasting onto DVDs with [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]].\n\nSometimes, video games are dubbed in Korean. Examples would be the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' series, the ''[[Jak & Daxter (series)|Jak & Daxter]]'' series, and the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series. For the ''Halo'' games, Lee Jeong Gu provides his Korean voice to the main protagonist [[Characters of Halo|Master Chief]] (replacing [[Steve Downes]]'s voice), while [[Kim So Hyeong (voice actor)|Kim So Hyeong]] voices [[Characters of Halo|Chieftain Tartarus]], one of the main antagonists (replacing [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]'s voice).\n\nThe following South Korean voice-over artists are usually identified with the following actors:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Movie theaters in [[Bangkok]] and some larger cities show both the subtitled version and the dubbed version of English-language movies. In big cities like Bangkok, Thai-language movies have English subtitles. <!-- For English-language animated movies, Disney films like ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Tangled]]'' are dubbed entirely in Thai.\n\nChonnai Sukawat has provided the Thai-dubbing voice for the heroine Rapunzel in the film ''Tangled''. In the Thai version of ''Harry Potter'', [[Hermione Granger]] was dubbed by Thai singer and actress Bismillah Nana. Many English-language movies are sold on [[VCD]]s in Thailand, with the original English language and Thai subtitles, while also available with the Thai-language-dubbed version, such as ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', the ''Harry Potter'' film series, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series.

Adult films was mostly subtitled, but sometimes they can be dubbed as well and because there aren't many Indonesian voices, especially in dubbed movies, three characters can have the exact same voice.\n\nReality shows are never dubbed in Indonesian, because they are not a planned interaction like with movies and TV shows, so if they appear in TV, they will be appear with subtitles.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In general, the decision whether to dub a video production depends mainly on the target audience of the channel on which the feature will be aired, its genre, and/or outlet of transmission (e.g. TV or film, free or pay-TV).  \n\n=====Free-to-air TV=====\nThe prevalence of media needing to be dubbed has resulted in a talent pool that is very capable of syncing voice to lip, especially for shows broadcast by the country's three largest networks. It is not uncommon in the Filipino dub industry to have most of the voices in a series dubbing by only a handful of voice talents. Programmes originally in English used to usually air in their original language on free-to-air television. \n\nSince the late 1990s/early 2000s, however, more originally English-language programmes that air on major free-to-air networks (i.e. 5, ABS-CBN, GMA) have been dubbed into Filipino. Even the former Studio 23 (now S+A), once known for its airing programmes in English, had adopted Filipino-language dubbing for some of its foreign programmes. Children's programmes from cable networks [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Disney Channel]] shown on [[TV5 (Philippines)|5]], GMA, or ABS-CBN, have long been dubbed into Filipino or another Philippine regional language.  [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Animated Disney films]] are often dubbed in Filipino except for the singing scenes, which are shown in their original language (though in recent years, there has been an increase in number of Disney musicals having their songs also translated such as ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'').  [[GMA News TV]] airs some documentaries, movies, and reality series originally shown in the English language as dubbed in Filipino.  \n\nDubbing is less common in smaller free-to-air networks such as [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] and the former [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN 9]] (now CNN Philippines) whereby the original-language version of the programme is aired. Dramas from Asia (particularly Greater China and Korea) and Latin America (called ''Asianovelas'', and ''Mexicanovelas'', respectively) have always been dubbed into Filipino or another Philippine regional language, and each programme from these genres feature their unique set of Filipino-speaking voice actors.\n\n=====Pay TV=====\nThe original language-version of TV programmes is also usually available on cable/satellite channels such as [[Fox Life]], [[Fox Asia|Fox]], and AXN. However, some pay-TV channels specialise in showing foreign shows and films dubbed into Filipino. [[Cinema One]], ABS-CBN's cable movie channel, shows some films originally in non-English language dubbed into Filipino. [[Nat Geo Wild]] airs most programs dubbed into Filipino for Philippine audiences, being one of the few cable channels to do so. [[Tagalized Movie Channel|Tagalised Movie Channel]] & [[Tag (TV channel)|Tag]] airs Hollywood and Asian movies dubbed in Filipino. [[Fox Filipino]] airs some English, Latin, and Asian series dubbed in Filipino such as ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', ''[[Devious Maids]]'', ''La Teniente'', ''Kdabra'', and some selected programs from [[Channel M (Southeast Asia)|Channel M]].  The defunct channel [[Hero (TV channel)|HERO TV]], which focuses on anime and [[tokusatsu]] shows and now a web portal, dubs all its foreign programs into Filipino. This is in contrast to Animax, where their anime programs are dubbed in English.\n\n=====Cinema=====\nForeign films, especially English films shown in local cinemas, are almost always shown in their original language.  Non-English foreign films make use of English subtitles. Unlike other countries, children's films originally in English are not dubbed in cinemas.\n\nA list of voice actors with their associates that they dub into Filipino are listed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Dubbing is rarely done with the other major Indian languages, namely [[Malayalam]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]], due to lack of significant market size. Despite this, some [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]] dubs of children television programs can be seen on the [[Sun TV Network|Sun TV]] channel. The dubbed versions are released into the towns and lower tier settlements of the respective states (where English penetration is low), often with the English-language originals released in the metropolitan areas. In all other states, the English originals are released along with the dubbed versions, where often the dubbed version collections are more outstanding than the originals. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' was also done in the [[Bhojpuri language]], a language popular in [[East India|eastern India]] in addition to Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'', the most recent installment in the ''[[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]]'' franchise, was the first ever Hollywood film to receive a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi language dub]] as well. \n\nMost TV channels mention neither the Indian-language dubbing credits, nor its staff, at the end of the original ending credits, since changing the credits casting for the original actors or voice actors involves a huge budget for modifying, making it somewhat difficult to find information for the dubbed versions. The same situation is encountered for films. Sometimes foreign programs and films receive more than one dub, such as for example, [[Jumanji]], [[Dragonheart]] and [[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]] having two Hindi dubs. Information for the Hindi, Tamil and Telugu voice actors who have done the voices for specific actors and for their roles on foreign films and television programs are published in local Indian data magazines, for those that are involved in the dubbing industry in India. But on a few occasions, there are some foreign productions that do credit the dubbing cast, such as animated films like the ''[[Barbie (film series)|Barbie]]'' films, and some Disney films. [[Disney Channel]] original series released on DVD with their Hindi dubs show a list of the artists in the Hindi dub credits, after the original ending credits. Theatrical releases and VCD releases of foreign films do not credit the dubbing cast or staff. The DVD releases, however, do have credits for the dubbing staff, if they are released multilingual. As of recently, information for the dubbing staff of foreign productions have been expanding due to high demands of people wanting to know the voice actors behind characters in foreign works. Large dubbing studios in India include [[Sound & Vision India]], [[Main Frame Software Communications]], [[Visual Reality]], [[ZamZam Productions]], [[Treasure Tower International]], [[Blue Whale Entertainment]], [[Jai Hand Entertainment]], [[Sugar Mediaz]] and [[Rudra Sound Solutionz]].\n\n====Pakistan====\nIn [[Pakistan]] \"foreign films\", and cartoons are not normally dubbed locally. Instead, foreign films, anime and cartoons, such as those shown on [[Nickelodeon Pakistan]] and [[Cartoon Network Pakistan]], are dubbed in [[Hindi]] in India, as Hindi and [[Urdu]], the national language of Pakistan, are [[mutually intelligible]].\nHowever, soap operas from [[Turkey]] are now dubbed in Urdu and have gained increased popularity at the expense of Indian soap operas in Hindi.<ref>[http://www.firstpost.com/living/in-pakistan-indian-soap-operas-give-way-to-turkish-serials-1260549.html In Pakistan, Indian soap operas give way to Turkish serials], ''[[First Post (India)|First Post]]'', 1 December 2013</ref> This has led to protests from local producers that these are a threat to Pakistan's television industry, with local productions being moved out of peak viewing time or dropped altogether.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/news/772593/is-tv-drama-industry-overreacting-to-turkish-soaps-blitz Is TV drama industry overreacting to Turkish soaps blitz?], ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', 20 December 2012</ref> Similarly, politicians leaders have expressed concerns over their content, given Turkey's less conservative culture.<ref>[http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/the-geopolitics-of-soap-operas/ The Geopolitics of Soap Operas], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 January 2013</ref>\n\n====Vietnam====\nIn [[Vietnam]], foreign-language films and programs are subtitled on television in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. They were not dubbed until 1985, but are briefly translated with a speaker before commercial breaks. ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' was considered to be the very first American Hollywood film to be entirely dubbed in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Since then, children's films that came out afterwards have been released dubbed in theaters. [[HTV3]] has dubbed television programs for children, including ''[[Ben 10 (TV series)|Ben 10]]'', and ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]'', by using various voice actors to dub over the character roles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBlXxqhKwU |title=Ben 10 Vietnamese Trailer (Trailer Ben 10 - HTV3) |publisher=YouTube |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WbgyJP5-TA |title=HTV3 - C\u1ea9m Nang C\u1ee7a Ned - Trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nSooner afterwards, more programs started to get dubbed. HTV3 also offers anime dubbed into Vietnamese. [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]] got a Vietnamese dub in early 2014 on HTV3 starting with the Best Wishes series. But due to a controversy regarding Pok\u00e9mon's cries being re-dubbed despite that all characters had their Japanese names, it was switched to [[VTV2]] in September 2015 when the XY series debut. [[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]] also recently has been dubbed for HTV3 in early 2015.\n\n====Singapore====\nIn multilingual [[Singapore]], dubbing is rare for western programmes. English-language programmes on the free-to-air terrestrial channels are usually subtitled in Chinese or Malay. Chinese, Malay and Tamil programmes (except for news bulletins), usually have subtitles in English and the original language during the prime time hours. [[Dual sound]] programs, such as Korean and Japanese dramas, offer sound in the original languages with subtitles, Mandarin-dubbed and subtitled, or English-dubbed. The [[Speak Mandarin Campaign|deliberate policy to encourage Mandarin]] among citizens made it required by law for programs in other Chinese dialects ([[Min Nan|Hokkien]], Cantonese and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]) to be dubbed into Mandarin, with the exception of traditional [[opera]]s. Cantonese and Hokkien shows from Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively, are available on VCD and DVD. In a recent development, news bulletins are subtitled.\n\n====Iran====\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Iranian Dubbing artists.jpg|thumb|A group of Iranian dubbing artists]]\nIn [[Iran]], foreign films and television programs are dubbed in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Dubbing began in 1946 with the advent of movies and cinemas in the country. Since then, foreign movies have always been dubbed for the cinema and TV. Using various voice actors and adding local hints and witticisms to the original contents, dubbing played a major role in attracting people to the cinemas and developing an interest in other cultures. The dubbing art in Iran reached its apex during the 1960s and 1970s with the inflow of American, European and Hindi movies.\n\nThe most famous musicals of the time, such as ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', were translated, adjusted and performed in Persian by the voice artists. Since the 1990s, for political reasons and under pressure from the state, the dubbing industry has declined, with movies dubbed only for the state TV channels. During recent years, DVDs with Persian subtitles have found a market among viewers for the same reason, but most people still prefer the Persian-speaking dubbed versions. Recently, privately operated companies started dubbing TV series by hiring famous dubbers.\n\nA list of Persian voice actors that associate with their actor counterparts are listed here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

There are exceptions, such as some children's cartoons.\n\n====Azerbaijan====\nIn [[Azerbaijan]], dubbing is rare, as most Azerbaijani channels such as [[G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f TV|ARB G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f]] air [[voice-over]]s or Azerbaijan originals.\n\n====Western Asia====\nSee [[#North Africa, Western Asia|below]].\n\n===Africa===\n====North Africa, Western Asia====\nIn [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and Tunisia, most foreign movies (especially Hollywood productions) are shown dubbed in French. These movies are usually imported directly from French film distributors. The choice of movies dubbed into French can be explained by the widespread use of the French language. Another important factor is that local theaters and private media companies do not dub in local languages in order to avoid high costs, but also because of the lack of both expertise and demand.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, dubbed series and movies for children in [[Modern Standard Arabic]] became a popular choice among most TV channels, cinemas and VHS/DVD stores. However, dubbed films are still imported, and dubbing is performed in the [[Levant]] countries with a strong tradition of dubbing (mainly [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]]).\n\nIn the Arabic-speaking countries, some children shows (mainly cartoons) are dubbed in Arabic, otherwise Arabic subtitles are used. The only exception was [[telenovelas]] dubbed in Standard Arabic, or dialects, but also Turkish series, most notably [[G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f (TV series)|G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f]], in Syrian Arabic.\n\nAn example of Arabic voice actors that dub for certain performers is Safi Mohammed for [[Elijah Wood]].\n\nIn [[Tunisia]], the Tunisia National Television (TNT), the public broadcaster of Tunisia, is not allowed to show any content in any language other than Arabic, which forces it to broadcast only dubbed content (this restriction was recently removed for commercials). During the 1970s and 1980s, TNT (known as ERTT at the time) started dubbing famous cartoons in Tunisian and Standard Arabic. However, in the private sector, television channels are not subject to the language rule.\n\n====South Africa====\nIn [[South Africa]], many television programmes were dubbed in [[Afrikaans]], with the original soundtrack (usually in English, but sometimes [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or [[German language|German]]) \"[[simulcast]]\" in [[FM stereo#Stereo FM|FM stereo]] on [[Radio 2000]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-NRDAQAAIAAJ&dq=was+simulcast++Radio+2000+afrikaans&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Radio+2000+afrikaans ''The voice, the vision: a sixty year history of the South African Broadcasting Corporation''], Malcolm Theunissen, Victor Nikitin, Melanie Pillay, Advent Graphics, 1996, page 120</ref> These included US series such as ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''(Steve Austin: Die Man van Staal)''<ref>[http://www.tvsa.co.za/mastershowinfo.asp?mastershowid=2293 The Six Million Dollar Man], TVSA - The South African TV Authority</ref> ''[[Miami Vice]]'' ''(Misdaad in Miami)'',<ref>{{cite news |title=Shows Allow Blacks, Whites to Share Cultural Experiences : South African Viewers Get a Mixed TV Message From U.S. Programs |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-25/news/mn-7271_1_south-african |accessdate=14 August 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=25 May 1986|author=GLENN FRANKEL (from ''The Washington Post'')}}</ref> ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'',<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/1996-02-09-the-critics-thumbs-up/ The critics' thumbs-up], ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'', 9 February 1996</ref> and the German detective series ''[[Derrick (TV series)|Derrick]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7h1DAQAAIAAJ&dq=derrick+tv+series+afrikaans&q=derrick+|title=Mass Media, Towards the Millennium|isbn=9780627023248|accessdate=9 July 2015|last1=Beer|first1=Arrie De|year=1998}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[boycott]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] actors' union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], which banned the sale of most British television programmes, the [[puppet]] series ''[[The Adventures of Rupert Bear]]'' was dubbed into [[South African English]], as the original voices had been recorded by Equity voice artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |last=Bevan |first=C |year=2008 |title=Putting up screens: A history of television in South Africa, 1929-1976, MHCS dissertation, University of Pretoria, Pretoria |accessdate=1 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215155949/http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis practice has declined as a result of the reduction of airtime for the language on [[SABC]] TV, and the increase of locally produced material in Afrikaans on other channels like [[KykNet]]. Similarly, many programmes, such as ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', were dubbed into [[Zulu language|Zulu]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Lelyveld |first=Joseph |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/magazine/22SAFR.html?&pagewanted=all |title=South Africa: Dream and Reality |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=22 September 1985 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> but this has also declined as local drama production has increased. However, some animated films, such as ''[[Maya the Bee]]'', have been dubbed in both Afrikaans and Zulu by local artists.<ref>[http://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/Maya-the-Bee-flick-dubbed-into-Afrikaans-and-Zulu-for-SA-audience-20150910 Maya the Bee flick dubbed into Afrikaans and Zulu for SA audience], [[News24|Channel24]], 18 September 2015</ref>\n\n====Uganda====\nUganda's [[Cinema of Uganda|own film industry]] is fairly small, and foreign movies are commonly watched. The English sound track is often accompanied by the [[Luganda]] translation and comments, provided by an Ugandan \"video jockey\" (VJ). VJ's interpreting and narration may be available in a recorded form or live.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2012/11/cinema-uganda |title=Coming to you live\n|date=2 November 2012|journal=The Economist|first=M|last=H}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\nIn common with other English-speaking countries, there has traditionally been little dubbing in [[Australia]], with foreign language television programmes and films being shown (usually on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]) with subtitles or English dubs produced in other countries. This has also been the case in [[New Zealand]], but the [[M\u0101ori Television Service]], launched in 2004, has dubbed animated films into [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]].<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10117134 Maori TV broadens horizons], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', 26 March 2005</ref> However, some TV commercials from foreign countries are dubbed, even if the original commercial came from another English-speaking country.  Moreover, the off-screen narration portions of some non-fiction programmes originating from the UK or North America are re-dubbed by Australian voice talents to relay information in expressions that Australians can understand more easily.\n\n==Alternatives==\n===Subtitles===\n{{Main|Subtitle}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[Subtitle (captioning)|Subtitles]] can be used instead of dubbing, as different countries have different traditions regarding the choice between dubbing and subtitling. On [[DVD]]s with higher translation budgets, the option for both types will often be provided to account for individual preferences; [[Purism|purists]] often demand subtitles. For small markets (small language area or films for a select audience), subtitling is more suitable, because it is cheaper. In the case of films for small children who cannot yet read, or do not read fast enough, dubbing is necessary.\n\nIn most [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, dubbing is comparatively rare. In [[Israel]], some programmes need to be comprehensible to speakers of both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. This cannot be accomplished with dubbing, so subtitling is much more commonplace\u2014sometimes even with subtitles in multiple languages, with the soundtrack remaining in the original language, usually English. The same applies to certain television shows in [[Finland]], where [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] are both official languages.\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], [[Flanders]], [[Nordic countries]], [[Estonia]] and [[Portugal]], films and television programmes are shown in the original language (usually English) with subtitles, and only cartoons and children's movies and programs are dubbed, such as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' and others. Cinemas usually show both a dubbed version and one with subtitles for this kind of movie, with the subtitled version shown later in the evening.\n\nIn Portugal, one terrestrial channel, [[TVI (Portugal)|TVI]], dubbed U.S. series like ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name=\"DCpt\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sKswU7k_I |title=Dawson's Creek PT |last=Somnorte |date=6 December 2008 |via=YouTube}}</ref> RTP also transmitted ''[[Friends]]'' in a dubbed version, but it was poorly received and later re-aired in a subtitled version. Cartoons, on the other hand, are usually dubbed, sometimes by well-known actors, even on TV. Animated movies are usually released to the cinemas in both subtitled and dubbed versions.\n\nIn [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]], terrestrial channels air films and TV series in a dubbed version, as demanded by law. However, those same series can be seen on cable channels at more accessible time-slots in their subtitled version and usually before they are shown on open TV. In contrast, the series ''The Simpsons'' is aired in its Mexican Spanish-dubbed version both on terrestrial television and on the cable station Fox, which broadcasts the series for the area. Although the first season of the series appeared with subtitles, this was not continued for the following seasons.\n\n===Dubbing and subtitling===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIn [[Bulgaria]], television series are dubbed, but most television channels use subtitles for action and drama movies. [[AXN]] uses subtitles for its series, but as of 2008 emphasises dubbing. Only [[Diema]] channels dub all programs. Movies in theaters, with the exception of films for children, use dubbing and subtitles. Dubbing of television programs is usually done using voiceovers, but usually, voices professional actors, while trying to give each character a different voice by using appropriate intonations. Dubbing with synchronised voices is rarely used, mostly for animated films. ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' is a rare example of a feature film dubbed this way on [[BNT Channel 1]], though a subtitled version is currently shown on other channels.\n\n[[Walt Disney Television]]'s animated series (such as ''[[DuckTales]]'', ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', and ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'') were only aired with synchronised Bulgarian voices on [[BNT Channel 1]] until 2005, but then the Disney shows were canceled. When airing of Disney series resumed on [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] and [[Jetix]] in 2008, voiceovers were used, but Disney animated-movie translations still use synchronised voices. Voiceover dubbing is not used in theatrical releases. The Bulgarian film industry law requires all children's films to be dubbed, not subtitled. [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] dubbed and aired the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime with synchronised voices. Now, the show is airing on Disney Channel, also in a synchronised form.\n\n[[Netflix]] provides both subtitles and dubbed audio with its foreign language shows, including Brazil's dystopian \"[[3%]]\" and the German thriller \"[[Dark (TV series)|Dark]]\". Viewer testing indicates that its audience is more likely to finish watching a series if they select to view it with dubbed audio rather than translated subtitles. Netflix now streams its foreign language content with dubbed audio as default in an effort to increase viewer retention.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/netflix-success-secrets-1202721847/|title=Netflix's Secrets to Success: Six Cell Towers, Dubbing and More|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=8 March 2018|work=Variety|access-date=7 November 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==General use==\nDubbing is also used in applications and genres other than traditional film, including video games, television, and pornographic films.\n\n===Video games===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nMany [[video game]]s originally produced in [[North America]], [[Japan]], and [[PAL]] countries are dubbed into foreign languages for release in areas such as [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], especially for video games that place a heavy emphasis on dialogue. Because characters' mouth movements can be part of the game's code, [[lip sync]] is sometimes achieved by re-coding the mouth movements to match the dialogue in the new language. The [[Source engine]] automatically generates lip-sync data, making it easier for games to be localised.\n\nTo achieve synchronisation when animations are intended only for the source language, localised content is mostly recorded using techniques borrowed from movie dubbing (such as rythmo band) or, when images are not available, localised dubbing is done using source audios as a reference. Sound-synch is a method where localised audios are recorded matching the length and internal pauses of the source content.<!-- What does this last sentence mean? -->\n\nFor the European version of a video game, the on-screen text of the game is available in various languages and, in many cases, the dialogue is dubbed into each respective language, as well.\n\nThe North American version of any game is always available in [[English language|English]], with translated text and dubbed dialogue, if necessary, in other languages, especially if the North American version of the game contains the same data as the European version. Several Japanese games, such as those in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'', and ''[[Soul (series)|Soul]]'' series, are released with both the original Japanese audio and the English dub included.\n\n===Television===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nDubbing is occasionally used on [[network television]] broadcasts of films that contain dialogue that the network executives or [[Censorship|censors]] have decided to replace. This is usually done to remove [[profanity]]. In most cases, the original actor does not perform this duty, but an actor with a similar voice reads the changes. The results are sometimes seamless, but, in many cases, the voice of the replacement actor sounds nothing like the original performer, which becomes particularly noticeable when extensive dialogue must be replaced. Also, often easy to notice, is the sudden absence of background sounds in the movie during the dubbed dialogue. Among the films considered notorious for using substitute actors that sound very different from their theatrical counterparts are the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' and the ''[[Die Hard series|Die Hard]]'' film series, as shown on broadcasters such as [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]]. In the case of ''Smokey and the Bandit'', extensive dubbing was done for the first network airing on [[ABC Television]] in 1978, especially for [[Jackie Gleason]]'s character, [[Buford T. Justice]]. The dubbing of his phrase \"sombitch\" (son of a bitch) became \"scum bum,\" which became a catchphrase of the time.\n\nDubbing is commonly used in [[science fiction television]], as well. Sound generated by effects equipment such as [[Animatronics|animatronic]] puppets or by actors' movements on elaborate multi-level plywood sets (for example, starship bridges or other command centers) will quite often make the original character dialogue unusable. ''[[Stargate]]'' and ''[[Farscape]]'' are two prime examples where ADR is used heavily to produce usable audio.\n\nSince some anime series contain profanity, the studios recording the English dubs often re-record certain lines if a series or movie is going to be broadcast on [[Cartoon Network]], removing references to [[death]] and [[hell]] as well. Some companies will offer both an edited and an uncut version of the series on DVD, so that there is an edited script available in case the series is broadcast. Other companies also edit the full-length version of a series, meaning that even on the uncut DVD characters say things like \"Blast!\" and \"Darn!\" in place of the original dialogue's profanity. [[Bandai|Bandai Entertainment's]] English dub of ''[[G Gundam]]'' is infamous for this, among many other things, with such lines as \"Bartender, more milk\".\n\nDubbing has also been used for comedic purposes, replacing lines of dialogue to create comedies from footage that was originally another genre. Examples include the Australian shows ''[[The Late Show (1990s Australian TV series)#The Olden Days|The Olden Days]]'' and ''[[Bargearse]]'', re-dubbed from 1970s Australian drama and action series, respectively, the Irish show ''[[Soupy Norman]]'', re-dubbed from ''[[:pl:Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107|Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107]]'', a Polish soap opera, and ''[[Most Extreme Elimination Challenge]]'', a comedic dub of the Japanese show ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]''.\n\nDubbing into a foreign language does not always entail the deletion of the original language. In some countries, a performer may read the translated dialogue as a voice-over. This often occurs in [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], where \"lektories\" or \"lektors\" read the translated dialogue into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. In Poland, one announcer read all text. However, this is done almost exclusively for the television and home video markets, while theatrical releases are usually subtitled. Recently, however, the number of high-quality, fully dubbed films has increased, especially for children's movies. If a quality dubbed version exists for a film, it is shown in theaters. However, some films, such as ''[[Harry Potter]]'' or ''[[Star Wars]]'', are shown in both dubbed and subtitled versions, varying with the time of the show. Such films are also shown on TV (although some channels drop them and do standard one-narrator translation) and VHS/DVD. In other countries, like [[Vietnam]], the voice-over technique is also used for theatrical releases.<!-- This section and the next one are redundant. This material has already been covered and should be merged above. -->\n\nIn Russia, the reading of all lines by a single person is referred to as a [[Gavrilov translation]], and is generally found only in [[Copyright infringement|illegal copies]] of films and on [[cable television]]. Professional copies always include at least two actors of opposite gender translating the dialogue. Some titles in Poland have been dubbed this way, too, but this method lacks public appeal, so it is very rare now.\n\nOn special occasions, such as [[film festival]]s, live [[interpreting]] is often done by professionals.\n\n===Pornography===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nAs budgets for [[pornographic film]]s are often small, compared to films made by major studios, and there is an inherent need to film without interrupting filming, it is common for sex scenes to be over-dubbed. The audio for such over-dubbing is generally referred to as ''the Ms and Gs'', or ''the moans and groans.''\n\n==Dubbing into varieties==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\nIn the case of languages with large communities (such as [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or [[French language|French]]), a single translation may sound foreign to native speakers in a given region. Therefore, a film may be translated into a certain variety of a certain language. For example, the animated movie ''[[The Incredibles]]'' was translated to [[European Spanish]], [[Mexican Spanish]], [[Neutral Spanish]] (which is Mexican Spanish but avoids colloquialisms), and [[Rioplatense Spanish]] (although people from [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]] noticed a strong ''[[porte\u00f1o]]'' accent from most of the characters of the Rioplatense Spanish translation).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Spanish-speaking regions]], most media is dubbed twice: into European Spanish and Neutral Spanish.\n\nAnother example is the French dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which has two entirely different versions for [[Quebec]] and for [[France]]. The humor is very different for each audience (see [[Non-English versions of The Simpsons|Non-English versions of ''The Simpsons'']]). Audiences in Quebec are generally critical of France's dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which they often do not find amusing.\n\n[[Quebec French|Quebec-French]] dubbing of films is generally made in accent-free [[Standard French]], but may sound peculiar to audiences in France because of the persistence of some regionally-neutral expressions and because Quebec-French performers pronounce Anglo-Saxon names with an American accent, unlike French performers. Occasionally, budget restraints cause American [[direct-to-video]] films, such as the 1995 film ''When the Bullet Hits the Bone'', to be released in France with a Quebec-French dubbing, sometimes resulting in what some members of French audiences perceive as unintentional humor.\n\n[[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] also use different versions of dubbed films and series. Because dubbing has never been very popular in [[Portugal]], for decades, children's films were distributed using the higher-quality Brazilian dub (unlike children's TV series, which are traditionally dubbed in European Portuguese). Only in the 1990s did dubbing begin to gain popularity in Portugal. ''[[The Lion King]]'' became the first Disney feature film to be completely dubbed into [[European Portuguese]], and subsequently all major animation films gained European-Portuguese versions. In recent [[DVD]] releases, most Brazilian-Portuguese-dubbed classics were released with new European-Portuguese dubs, eliminating the predominance of Brazilian-Portuguese dubs in Portugal.\n\nSimilarly, in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking region of [[Flanders]], [[Belgium]], cartoons are often dubbed locally by [[Flemish]] artists{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} rather than using soundtracks produced in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nThe [[list of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking region]], which includes [[Germany]], [[Austria]], part of [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]], share a common German-dubbed version of films and shows. Although there are some differences in the three major German varieties, all films, shows, and series are dubbed into a single [[Standard German]] version that avoids regional variations in the German-speaking audience. Most voice actors are primarily German or Austrian. Switzerland, which has four official languages (German, French, [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Romansh language|Romansh]]), generally uses dubbed versions made in each respective country (except for Romansh). Liechtenstein uses German-dubbed versions only.\n\nSometimes, films are also dubbed into several [[German dialects]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ([[Berlinerisch]], [[Colognian language|K\u00f6lsch]], [[Saxonian]], [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Swiss German]]), especially animated films and Disney films. They are as an additional \"special feature\" to entice the audience into buying it. Popular animated films dubbed into German variety include ''[[Asterix]]'' films (in addition to its Standard German version, every film has a particular variety version), ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Shrek 2]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', (+ Austrian German){{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OBS_20090810_OBS0008 |title=\u00d6sterreich-Version von Disney/Pixars \"Oben\" mit Otto Schenk und Karlheinz B\u00f6hm - BILD |language=de |publisher=ots.at |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German).\n\nSome live-action films or TV-series have an additional German variety dubbing: ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' (German German, Austrian German, Swiss German); and ''[[Rehearsal for Murder]]'', ''[[Framed (TV series)|Framed]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776730&threaded=1&id=506508&message=6643629 |title=Allgemeines \" ORF-Synchronisationen - Wer wei\u00df was? |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German); ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[Serpico]]'', ''[[Rumpole]]'' (+ Austrian German), and ''[[The Thorn Birds]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776728&threaded=1&id=506269&message=7100872 |title=Serien \" 24 |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n(only Austrian German dubbing).\n\nBefore [[German reunification]], [[East Germany]] also made its own particular German version. For example, ''[[Olsen-banden|Olsen Gang]]'' and the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] animated series ''[[The M\u00e9zga Family]]'' were dubbed in [[West Germany]] as well as East Germany.\n\nUsually, there are two dubbings produced in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Serbian for [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]; Croatian for [[Croatia]] and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n\nWhile the voice actors involved usually bear the brunt of criticisms towards poor dubbing, other factors may include inaccurate script translation and poor [[Audio mixing (television and film)|audio mixing]]. Dialogue typically contains speech patterns and sentence structure that are natural to the original language but would appear awkward if translated literally. English dubs of Japanese animation, for example, must rewrite the dialogue so that it flows smoothly while following the natural pattern of English speech. On some occasions, voice actors record their dialogue individually instead of with the rest of the cast, and their performances can lack the dynamics gained from performing as a group.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMany [[martial arts]] movies from [[Hong Kong]] that were imported under the unofficial banner [[Kung Fu Theater]] were notorious{{according to whom|date=June 2019}} for seemingly careless dubbing that included poor lip sync and awkward dialogue. Since the results were frequently unintentionally humorous, it has become one of the hallmarks that endear these films to fans of the 1980s culture.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Dubbing (filmmaking)}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Maluf |first1=Ramez |title=Dubbing into Arabic: A Trojan Horse at the Gates? |url=http://inhouse.lau.edu.lb/bima/papers/Dubbing.pdf |accessdate=10 April 2011 |date=19 December 2003 |publisher=[[Lebanese American University]]}}\n*Di Fortunato E. e Paolinelli M.

The insertion of [[voice acting|voice actor]] performances for [[animation]], such as [[computer generated imagery]] or [[animated cartoon]]s, is often referred to as ADR although it generally does not replace existing dialogue.\n\nThe ADR process may be used to: \n\n:*remove extraneous sounds such as production equipment noise, traffic, wind, or other undesirable sounds from the environment\n:*change the original lines recorded on set to clarify context \n:*improve [[diction]] or modify an [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]\n:*improve [[comic timing|comedic timing]] or dramatic timing\n:*correct technical issues with [[synchronization|synchronisation]]\n:*use a studio-quality singing performance or provide a voice-double for actors who are poor vocalists\n:*add or remove content for legal purposes (such as removing an unauthorised trademarked name)\n:*add or remove a product placement\n:*correct a misspoken line not caught during filming.\n:*replace foul language for TV broadcasts of a movie or other program\nIn conventional film production, a [[production sound mixer]] records dialogue during filming. During post-production, a supervising [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]], or ADR supervisor, reviews all of the dialogue in the film and decides which lines must be re-recorded. ADR is recorded during an ADR session, which takes place in a specialised [[Recording studio|sound studio]]. The actor, usually the original actor from the set, views the scene with the original sound, then attempts to recreate the performance. Over the course of multiple [[take]]s, the actor performs the lines while watching the scene; the most suitable take becomes the final version.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADR |publisher=FilmSound.org |url=http://filmsound.org/terminology/adr.htm |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> The ADR process does not always take place in a post-production studio. The process may be recorded on location, with mobile equipment. ADR can also be recorded without showing the actor the image they must match, but by having them listen to the performance, since some actors{{who|date=June 2019}} believe that watching themselves act can degrade subsequent performances.\n\nSometimes, an actor other than the original actor is used during ADR. One famous example is the ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Darth Vader]], portrayed by [[David Prowse]]; in post-production, [[James Earl Jones]] dubbed the voice of Vader.<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=Film: Lucas Returns with 'The Jedi' |date=25 May 1983 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9c00e3d71e38f936a15756c0a965948260 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nOther examples include:\n*[[Jean Hagen]] provided [[Debbie Reynolds]]' voice in two scenes of ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952). Ironically, the film's story has Reynolds' character, Kathy Seldon, dubbing the voice for ''Hagen's'' character, Lina Lamont, due to Lina's grating voice and strong New York accent. Hagen used her own normal melodious voice to portray Kathy dubbing for Lina. The film, which takes place in Hollywood as talking pictures are taking over from silent films, also portrays another character, Cosmo Brown, played by [[Donald O'Connor]], as inventing the idea of using one actor to provide the voice for another.\n*[[Marni Nixon]] provided the singing voice for the character [[Eliza Doolittle]], otherwise played by [[Audrey Hepburn]], in the 1964 musical film ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''. Nixon was also the singing voices for [[Deborah Kerr]] in ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' and [[Natalie Wood]] in ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', among many others.\n*[[Ray Park]], who acted as [[Darth Maul]] from ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' had his voice dubbed over by [[Peter Serafinowicz]]\n*Frenchmen [[Philippe Noiret]] and [[Jacques Perrin]], who were dubbed into Italian for ''[[Cinema Paradiso]]''\n*Austrian bodybuilder [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], dubbed for ''[[Hercules in New York]]''\n*Argentine boxer [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]], dubbed by a professional actor for the lead in the drama ''[[La Mary]]''\n*[[Gert Frobe]], who played Auric Goldfinger in the James Bond film [[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]], dubbed by Michael Collins\n*[[Andie MacDowell]]'s Jane, in ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'', who was dubbed by [[Glenn Close]]\n*[[Tom Hardy]], who portrayed [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', re-dubbed half of his own lines for ease of viewer comprehension\n*[[Harvey Keitel]] was dubbed by [[Roy Dotrice]] in post production for ''[[Saturn 3]]\n*[[Dave Coulier]] dubbed replacement of swear words for [[Richard Pryor]] in multiple TV versions of his movies\n\n===Process===\nThe tasks involved are performed by three different agents{{clarify|What are agents, and what are the three kinds of agents?|date=June 2019}} in the dubbing process: \n# translation \n# take segmentation \n# insertion of dubbing symbols \n# lip-sync \n# dialogue writing and the emulation of natural discourse\n\nSometimes the translator performs all five tasks. In other cases, the translator just submits a rough translation and a dialogue writer does the rest.\n\n====Dialog writing====\n\nThe dialogue writer\u2019s role is to make the translation sound natural of the target language, and to make the translation sound like a credible dialogue instead of merely a translated text.<ref>Chaume, F. (2013). Research paths in audiovisual translation: The case of dubbing. In The Routledge handbook of translation studies (pp. \n306-320). Routledge.</ref>\n\nAnother task of dialogue writers is to check whether a translation matches an on-screen character\u2019s mouth movements or not, by reading aloud simultaneously with the character. The dialogue writer often stays in the recording setting with the actors or the voice talents, to ensure that the dialogue is being spoken in the way that it was written to be, and to avoid any ambiguity in the way the dialogue is to be read (focusing on emphasis, intonation, pronunciation, articulation, pronouncing foreign words correctly, etc.). The overall goal is to make sure the script creates the illusion of authenticity of the spoken language.\n\n====Rythmo band====\nAn alternative method to dubbing, called \"rythmo band\" (or \"[[Lip sync|lip-sync]] band\"), has historically been used in [[Canada]] and [[France]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} It provides a more precise guide{{explain|how is it more precise? What's the difference?|date=June 2019}} for the actors, [[Film director|directors]], and technicians, and can be used to complement the traditional ADR method. The \"band\" is actually a clear 35&nbsp;mm [[film leader]] on which the dialogue is hand-written in [[India ink]], together with numerous additional indications for the actor\u2014including laughs, cries, length of syllables, mouth sounds, breaths, and mouth openings and closings. The rythmo band is projected in the studio and scrolls in perfect synchronisation with the picture.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nStudio time is used more efficiently, since with the aid of scrolling text, picture, and audio cues, actors can read more lines per hour than with ADR alone (only picture and audio). With ADR, actors can average 10\u201312 lines per hour, while rythmo band can facilitate the reading of 35-50 lines per hour.<ref>{{cite web |title=U of U Sound Final |url=http://quizlet.com/8640541/u-of-u-sound-final-flash-cards/ |work=Quizlet |publisher=Quizlet LLC |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Quizlet |year=2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the preparation of a rythmo band is a time-consuming process involving a series of specialists organised in a production line. This has prevented the technique from being more widely adopted, but software emulations of rythmo band technology overcome the disadvantages of the traditional rythmo band process and significantly reduce the time needed to prepare a dubbing session.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}o\n\n==<span id=\"Practice of dubbing foreign films throughout the world\"></span> Global use==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Dub localization===\nDub localization, also often simply referred to as [[Language localization|localization]], is the practice of [[voice-over translation]] that alters a [[film]] or [[television series]] from one region of the world to the local language of another.\n\nThe new voice track is usually spoken by a [[voice actor]]. In many countries, actors who regularly perform this duty remain little-known, with the exception of particular circles (such as anime [[fandom]]) or when their voices have become synonymous with roles or actors whose voices they usually dub. In the United States, many of these voice artists may employ pseudonyms or go uncredited due to [[Screen Actors Guild]] regulations or the desire to dissociate themselves from the role.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nDub localisation is a contentious issue in [[cinephilia]] amongst aficionados of foreign [[filmmaking]] and [[television program]]s, particularly [[anime]] fans. While some localisation is virtually inevitable in translation, the controversy surrounding how much localisation is \"too much\" is often discussed in such communities, especially when the final dub product is significantly different from the original. Some fans frown on any extensive localisation, while others expect it, and to varying degrees, appreciate it.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Dubbing films in Europe.png|thumb|300px|{{legend|#0000FF|Dubbing only for children: Otherwise solely subtitles.}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|General dubbing: Countries using a full-cast dubbing.}}\n{{legend|#FFFF00|Voice-over: Countries using a couple or just one voice actor, whereas the original soundtrack persists.

For movies in cinemas with clear target audiences (both below and above 10\u201311 years of age), both a dubbed and a subtitled version are usually available.\n\n=====Albania=====\nThe first movie dubbed in [[Albanian language]] was ''[[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg]]'' in 1954 and since then, there have been thousands of popular titles dubbed in Albanian by different dubbing studios. All animated movies and children's programs are dubbed into Albanian language, many live-action movies as well. TV series nevertheless are usually not dubbed, they are subtitled except for a few [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Brazil]]ian and [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap operas, like: ''[[Por ti (telenovela)|Por Ti]]'', ''[[Celebridade]]'', ''[[A Casa das Sete Mulheres]]'', ''[[Parampar\u00e7a (TV series)|Parampar\u00e7a]]'', etc. As for documentaries, Albania usually uses voice-over.\n\n=====Belgium=====\nIn the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium ([[Flanders]]), movies and TV series are shown in their original language with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], with the exception of most movies made for a young audience. In the latter case, sometimes separate versions are recorded in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Flanders]] (for instance, several [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Walt Disney films]] and [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]]). These dubbed versions only differ from each other in their use of different voice actors and different pronunciation, while the text is almost the same.\n\nIn the French-speaking part of Belgium ([[Wallonia]]), the range of French-dubbed versions is approximately as wide as the [[German language|German]] range, where nearly all movies and TV series are dubbed.\n\n=====Bosnia and Herzegovina=====\n[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] usually uses [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubs, but they have dubbed some cartoons in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] by themselves, for example ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]''. Children's programs (both animated and live-action) are airing dubbed (in Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian), while every other program is subtitled (in Bosnian).\n\n=====Croatia=====\nIn [[Croatia]], foreign films and TV series are always subtitled, while most children's programs and animated movies are dubbed into [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The practice of dubbing began in the 1980s in some animated shows and continued in 90's, 00's and forward in other shows and films, the latter ones being released in home media. Recently, more efforts have been made to introduce dubbing, but public reception has been poor in some exceptions. Regardless of language, Croatian audiences prefer subtitling to dubbing, however it is still popular in animated films. Some previously popular shows (such as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'') lost their appeal completely after the practice of dubbing began, and the dubbing was eventually removed from the programs, even though most animated shows shown on television and some on home media have been well received by people watching dubbed versions of them. This situation is similar with theater movies, with only those intended for children being dubbed (such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and ''[[Shark Tale]]''), but nowadays are shown in dubbed versions. Also, there has been an effort to impose dubbing by [[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]], with ''[[La Fea M\u00e1s Bella]]'' translated as ''Ru\u017ena ljepotica'' (literally, \"The Ugly Beauty\"), a Mexican telenovela, but it failed. Some of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubbing is also broadcast in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\n=====Estonia=====\nIn [[Estonia]] in cinemas, only children's animated films are dubbed and live-action films are shown in the original English and Russian languages with subtitles at cinemas. Subtitles are usually presented in both Estonian and [[Russian language]]s. Cartoons and animated series voiced by dubbing or [[Voice-over|voiceover]] and live-action films and television series only with Estonian subtitles also but with English and Russian Dub Languages. Animated films are commonly shown in both the originals and Russian languages and dubbed into Estonian (or Russian in many cinemas). Most Estonian-language television channels use subtitles English and Russian Audio for foreign-language films and TV channels. However, Russian language channels tend to use dubbing more often, especially for Russian channels broadcast from [[Russia]] (as opposed to Russian channels broadcast from Estonia).\n\n=====Greece=====\nIn [[Greece]], most cartoon films have dubs. Usually when a movie has a Greek dub the dub is shown in cinemas but subtitled versions are shown as well. Foreign TV shows for adults are shown in their original versions with subtitles, most cartoons, for example, ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[The Jetsons]]'' were always dubbed, while ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' are always subtitled and contain the original English dialogue, since they are mostly for adults rather than children, (even though the movie ''[[Space Jam]]'' was subtitled instead of being dubbed, since also this is suitable for children). Also some Japanese anime series are dubbed in Greek (such as Pok\u00e9mon, Pichi Pichi Pitch, Sailor Moon etc.) The only television programs dubbed in Greek includes [[Mexico|Mexican]] TV series (like ''[[Rub\u00ed (2004 telenovela)|Rub\u00ed]]'' and ''[[La usurpadora (Mexican TV series)|La usurpadora]]'') and teen series (like ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''). However, when [[Skai TV]] was re-launched in April 2006, the network opted for dubbing almost all foreign shows in Greek, unlike other Greek channels which had always broadcast most of the programs in their original language with subtitles.\n\n=====Ireland=====\nIreland usually receives the same film versions as the UK. However some films have been dubbed into [[Irish language|Irish]] by [[TG4]], including the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bY4JK5PR4MAC&lpg=PA275&ots=D6dkX7Up-y&dq=Harry%20Potter%20TG4&pg=PA275#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Writing and Translating for Children''], Elena Di Giovanni, Chiara Elefante, Roberta Pederzoli, Peter Lang, 2010, page 259</ref>\n\n=====Netherlands=====\nIn the [[Netherlands]], for the most part, Dutch versions are only made for children's and family films. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Dutch dubbing, but usually those cinemas with more screening rooms also provide the original subtitled version, such as movies like ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''.\n\n=====North Macedonia=====\n[[North Macedonia]] dubbed many cartoons in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], but they also air some [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs. Children's programs are airing dubbed (in Macedonian or Serbian), while every other program is subtitled (in Macedonian). They use [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs for [[Disney]] movies, because there are no [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] [[Disney]] dubs.\n\n=====Poland=====\n{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called \"juxtareading,\" is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference\u2014all dialogues are voiced by one off-screen reader ({{lang-pl|lektor}}), preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.\n\nIt is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}</ref>\n\nPoland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).\n\nPolish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronisation. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of that time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.\n\nThe number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.\n\nOverall, during 1948\u20131998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.\n\nIn 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2007</ref> It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.\n\nCurrently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.\n\nSince theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska \u2013 former distributor of Disney's films \u2013 decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.\n\n=====Portugal=====\nIn [[Portugal]], dubbing was banned under a 1948 law as a way of protecting the domestic film industry and reduce the access to culture as most of the population was illiterate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |title=amor de perdi\u00e7\u00e3o - especiais |date=21 January 2005 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050121055806/http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |archivedate=21 January 2005  }}</ref> Until 1994, animated movies, as well as other TV series for children shown in Portugal, have imported [[Brazilian Portuguese]] dubs due to the lack of interest from Portuguese companies in the dubbing industry. This lack of interest was justified, since there were already quality dubbed copies of shows and movies in Portuguese made by [[Brazil]]ians. ''[[The Lion King]]'' was the first feature film to be dubbed in [[European Portuguese]] rather than strictly Brazilian Portuguese. Currently, all movies for children are dubbed in European Portuguese. Subtitles are preferred in Portugal,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/polemica-dobragem-serie-einstein-gera-criticas-axn-118969|title=Pol\u00e9mica: dobragem da s\u00e9rie 'Einstein' gera cr\u00edticas ao AXN|access-date=29 March 2017|date=3 February 2017|work=O Jornal Econ\u00f3mico|quote=Ao contr\u00e1rio de alguns mercados como o espanhol e brasileiro, o p\u00fablico portugu\u00eas n\u00e3o se mostra recetivo a esta op\u00e7\u00e3o.|language=portuguese}}</ref> used in every foreign-language [[Documentary film|documentary]], TV series and film. The exception to this preference is when children are the target audience.\n\nWhile on TV, children's shows and movies are always dubbed, in cinemas, films with a clear juvenile target can be found in two versions, one dubbed (identified by the letters V.P. for ''vers\u00e3o portuguesa'' - \"Portuguese version\") and another subtitled version (V.O. for ''vers\u00e3o original'' - \"original version\"). This duality applies only to juvenile films. Others use subtitles only. While the quality of these dubs is recognised (some have already received international recognition and prizes), original versions with subtitles are usually preferred by the adults (''[[Bee Movie]]'', for example). Dubbing cartoons aimed at adults (such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' or ''[[South Park]]'') is less common. When ''The Simpsons Movie'' debuted in Portugal, most cinemas showed both versions (V.O. and V.P.), but in some small cities, cinemas decided to offer only the Portuguese version, a decision that led to public protest. Presently, [[live action]] series and movies are always shown in their original language format with Portuguese subtitles. Television programs for young children (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[Big Bad Beetleborgs]]'', etc.) are dubbed into European Portuguese. Some video games aimed at adults (such as [[God of War III]], [[Halo 3]], [[Assassin's Creed III]] and [[inFamous 2]]) are dubbed in European Portuguese, although there they provide an option to select the original language.\n\n=====Romania=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Hungarian, because graph QA11 of the Eurobarometer lists the number 62 next to RO (Romania). Hungary is HU.-->\nIn [[Romania]], virtually all programmes intended for children are dubbed in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], including cartoons, live-action movies and TV series on [[Disney Channel Romania|Disney Channel]], [[Cartoon Network (Europe)|Cartoon Network]], [[Minimax tv|Minimax]], and [[Nickelodeon]], as well as those shown on general television networks, children-focused series (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[The New Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Planet's Funniest Animals]]'') or movies screened on children's television. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Romanian dubbing. However, those cinemas with more screening rooms usually also provide the original subtitled version. Such was the case for movies like ''[[Babe (movie)|Babe]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (movie)|Cars]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''. Other foreign TV shows and movies are shown in the original language with Romanian subtitles. Subtitles are usually preferred in the Romanian market. According to \"Special Eurobarometer 243\" (graph QA11.8) of the [[European Commission]] (research carried out in November and December 2005), 62% of Romanians prefer to watch foreign films and programmes with subtitles (rather than dubbed), 22% prefer dubbing, and 16% declined to answer.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\">[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 243] of the European Commission with the title \"Europeans and their Languages\", published in February 2006 with research carried out in November and December 2005. Barely 2% of Romanians consider watching original-language versions most effective into learning a new language (Table QA7b).</ref> This is led by the assumption that watching movies in their original versions is very useful for learning foreign languages. However, according to the same Eurobarometer, virtually no Romanian found this method\u2014watching movies in their original version\u2014to be the most efficient way to learn foreign languages, compared to 53 percent who preferred language lessons at school.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn Romania, foreign language television programs and films are generally subtitled rather than dubbed.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=csMetRFKXmgC&lpg=PT61&dq=romania%20dubbing%20tv&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q=romania%20dubbing%20tv&f=true ''Dracula is Dead: How Romanians Survived Communism, Ended It, and Emerged Since 1989 as the New Italy''], Sheilah Kast, Jim Rosapepe, 2009, page 49</ref> This includes programs in non-Western languages, such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Korean language|Korean]] or [[Hindi language|Hindi]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aXutBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA91&dq=romania+subtitles+television&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiI-s2aysvOAhXrAMAKHXs4Ca4Q6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&q=romania%20subtitles%20television&f=true ''The Global Impact of South Korean Popular Culture: Hallyu Unbound''], Valentina Marinescu, Lexington Books, 2014, page 91</ref>\n\n=====Serbia=====\n[[Serbian language]] dubs are made mainly for [[Serbia]], but they broadcast in [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia & Herzegovina]], too. Children's animated and some live-action movies and TV series are dubbed into Serbian, while live-action films and TV series for adults are always airing subtitled, because in this region people prefer subtitling for live-action formats. [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap opera ''[[Lale Devri]]'' started airing dubbed in 2011, on [[RTV Pink]], but because of bad reception, dub failed and rest of TV series was aired subtitled. ''[[Married... with Children]]'' was dubbed, too.\n\nThe dubbing of cartoon series in former [[Yugoslavia]] during the 1980s had a twist of its own: famous [[Serbia]]n actors, such as [[Nikola Simi\u0107 (actor)|Nikola Simi\u0107]], [[Mi\u0107a Tati\u0107]], [[Nada Blam]] and others provided the voices for characters of [[Disney]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and other companies, frequently using region-specific phrases and sentences and, thus, adding a dose of local humor to the translation of the original lines. These phrases became immensely popular and are still being used for [[tongue-in-cheek]] comments in specific situations. These dubs are today considered cult dubs. The only dub made after 1980s and 1990s ones that's considered cult is ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' dub, made by [[B92]] in period 2002\u20132017, because of a great popularity and memorable translation with local humor phrases, such as 1980s dubs translation.\n\nSome Serbian dubs are also broadcast in [[North Macedonia]], while cult dubs made during [[Yugoslavia]] were aired all over the country (today's [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Slovenia]], [[North Macedonia]] and [[Serbia]]).\n\n=====Slovenia=====\nIn [[Slovenia]], all foreign films and television programs are subtitled with the exception of children's movies and TV shows (both animated or live-action). While dubbed versions are always shown in cinemas and later on TV channels, cinemas will sometimes play subtitled versions of children's movies as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n=====United Kingdom=====\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the vast majority of foreign language films are subtitled, although mostly animated films are dubbed in English.  These usually originate from [[North America]], as opposed to being dubbed locally. Foreign language serials shown on BBC Four are subtitled into English (although open subtitles are dropped during dialogues with English language segments already).  There have, however, been notable examples of films and TV programmes successfully dubbed in the UK, such as the Japanese ''[[Monkey (TV series)|Monkey]]'' and French ''[[The Magic Roundabout|Magic Roundabout]]'' series.  When airing films on television, channels in the UK often choose subtitling over dubbing, even if a dubbing in English exists. It is also a fairly common practice for animation aimed at [[Preschool education|preschool]] children to be re-dubbed with British voice actors replacing the original voices, such as Spin Master Entertainment's [[PAW Patrol]] series, although this is not done with shows aimed at older audiences.  The off-screen narrated portions of some programmes and reality shows that originate from North America are also redone with British English voices.  \n\nSome animated films and TV programmes are also dubbed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\n[[Hinterland (TV series)|Hinterland]] displays a not so common example of a bilingual production. Each scene is filmed twice, in the English and Welsh languages, apart from a few scenes where Welsh with subtitles is used for the English version.<ref>{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/30/hinterland-tv-noir-wales |title=Hinterland \u2013 the TV noir so good they made it twice |first=Stephen |last=Moss |date=30 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=[[London]] |access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Nordic countries=====\nIn the [[Nordic countries]], dubbing is used only in animated features (except [[adult animated]] features) and other films for younger audiences. Some cinemas in the major cities may also screen the original version, usually as the last showing of the day, or in a smaller auditorium in a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]].\n\nIn television programs with off-screen narration, both the original audio and on-screen voices are usually subtitled in their native languages.\n\nThe Nordic countries are often treated as a common market issuing [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases with original audio and user choosable subtitle options in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The covers often have text in all four languages as well, but are sometimes unique for each country. Some releases may include other European language audio and/or subtitles (i.e. German, Greek, Hungarian or Italian). Children's films typically have Nordic audio tracks in all four languages, as well as original audio in most cases.\n\nIn [[Finland]], the dubbed version from [[Sweden]] may also be available at certain cinemas for children of the 5% Swedish-speaking minority, but only in cities or towns with a significant percentage of Swedish speakers. Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually only have the original audio, except for children's films, which have both Finnish and Swedish language tracks, in addition to the original audio and subtitles in both languages.\n\nIn Finnish movie theaters, films for adult audiences have both Finnish and Swedish subtitles, the Finnish printed in basic font and the Swedish printed below the Finnish in a cursive font. In the early ages of television, foreign TV shows and movies were voiced by narrator in Finland. Later, subtitles became a practice on Finnish television. Dubbing of films other than children's films is unpopular in Finland, as in many other countries. A good example is ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''. While the original version was well-received, the Finnish-dubbed version received poor reviews, with some critics even calling it a disaster.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} On the other hand, many dubs of [[Disney]] animated features have been well-received, both critically and by the public.\n\nIn [[Iceland]], the dubbed version of film and TV is usually [[Danish language|Danish]] with some translated into [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. [[LazyTown]], an Icelandic TV show originally broadcast in English, was dubbed into Icelandic, amongst thirty-two other languages, and it remains the TV show to have been dubbed into the most languages.\n\n====General films and programming====\nIn the [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] language-speaking markets of [[Europe]], almost all foreign films and television shows are dubbed (the exception being the majority of theatrical releases of adult-audience movies in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]] and [[Turkey]] and high-profile videos in Russia). There are few opportunities to watch foreign movies in their original versions. In [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], even in the largest cities, there are few cinemas that screen original versions with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], or without any translation. However, digital [[pay-TV]] programming is often available in the original language, including the latest movies. Prior to the rise of DVDs, which in these countries are mostly issued with multi-language audio tracks, original-language films (those in languages other than the country's official language) were rare, whether in theaters, on TV, or on home video, and subtitled versions were considered a product for small [[niche market]]s such as intellectual or [[art film]]s.\n\n\n\n\n=====France=====\nIn [[France]], movies and TV series are, except purely arthouse films, usually released in the dubbed French-language version. The original-language version of the film with French subtitles is released in designated theaters which show only subtitled versions or both versions are shown at different times or split screenings between both versions. However, dubbing is the norm and subtitling is only for niche audience and movies with subtitles are usually very small arthouse films with very limited commercial prospects for pay and free TV airings and also home entertainment (VOD, DVD). Dubbing in the French Language is thus absolutely essential for any sale to be made.\n\nSince the digitalization of over-the-air television broadcasters, both versions have been offered to the customer simultaneously.  By default, foreign films and TV programmes shown on television are dubbed into French on a channel's main audio feed. However, with the advent of digital television, viewers can access the original language feed for some programmes, as well as matching subtitles.  In addition, the TV network ARTE has a French-language track on its main audio feed as well as a German-language track.  \n \nMost movies are released nationwide in dubbed version and subtitled versions where available with the exception of very limited often micro-budget arthouse productions that do stem come from the \"hollywood movie production\" machine which are exclusively arthouse films and not dubbed at the time of their theatrical release.\n\nTheaters showing these kind of movies or also showing commercial films in the original-language version with French subtitles are very rare outside of the big cities and most of them are located in [[Paris]] which has the most \"cinephile\" cinemas in France. Often these \"niche\" films are only released in [[Paris]] region.\n\nA theater showing subtitled versions of original language movies are typically well known for this and will advertise this also on the poster advising moviegoers that the film is shown in an original-language version (usually abbreviated VO [''version originale''] or VOST [''version originale sous-titr\u00e9e'']), as opposed to VF [''version fran\u00e7aise''], the latter then becoming what is known and used also in the neighboring countries like Belgium or Switzerland, as the \"FRENCH LANGUAGE VERSION\" of the film.)\n\nBecause the alterations made to the original film are so profound, making it no longer viewable or understandable for audiences that speak the language the film was originally shot in, the final dubbed version is called the \"French-language version\", as opposed to the use of subtitles which leave the film in its original state.\nThe choice to dub or not at the time of theatrical release is a decision made by the distributor releasing the film based upon their recoupment strategy for the film and their prognosis of the commercial prospects. Given the fact that a dub is needed for home entertainment and TV sales, only very small arthouse films are never dubbed.\nOnly a very small percentage (according to the official institute CNC in France only 16.4% of all ticket-sales were for movies watched in the original-language version with subtitles) and this is counting Blockbusters and others shown in their original-language version with subtitles and the small number of films that are never dubbed.\nVoice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in the European French language can be viewed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] fascist Italy, release of movies in foreign languages was banned for political reasons. Rome is the principal base of the dubbing industry, where major productions such as movies, drama, documentaries and some cartoons are dubbed. However, dubbing in Milan is mostly of cartoons and some minor productions. Practically every foreign film (mostly American ones) of every genre, for children or adults, as well as TV shows, are dubbed into Italian. In big cities, original-version movies can also be seen in some theaters but it is not so common. Subtitles may be available on [[Late night television|late-night programs]] on mainstream TV channels, and on pay-TV all movies are available in the original language with Italian subtitles, many shows featuring their original [[soundtrack]]s.\n\nEarly in their careers, actors such as [[Alberto Sordi]] or [[Nino Manfredi]] worked extensively as dubbing actors. At one point, common practice in Italian cinema was to shoot scenes [[MOS (filmmaking)|MOS]] (motor only sync or motor only shot) and dub the dialogue in post-production. A notable example of this practice is ''[[The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly]]'', in which all actors had to dub in their own voices.\n\nVideo games are generally either dubbed into Italian (for instance [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]] saga, [[Halo (series)|Halo]] or [[Harry Potter (video games)|Harry Potter]] series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Italian language.\n\nA list of the voice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in Italian can be enlisted here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Some dubbing actors have achieved popularity for their voices, such as [[Constantino Romero]] (who dubs [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Darth Vader]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s [[The Terminator|Terminator]], among others) and [[\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz (filmmaking)|\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz]] (the official European Spanish dub-over voice artist for [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Hayden Christensen]]). Currently, with the spread of [[digital terrestrial television]], viewers can choose between the original and the dubbed soundtracks for most movies and television.\n\nIn some communities such as [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], some foreign programs are also dubbed into their own languages, different from European Spanish. Films from \nthe Spanish-speaking America shown in these communities are shown in their original language, while strong regional accents (from the Spanish-speaking America or from Spain) may be subtitled in news and documentaries.\n\n=====Germany, Austria and Switzerland=====\nThe [[German language|Germanophone]] dubbing market is the largest in Europe. Germany has the most foreign-movie-dubbing studios per capita and per given area in the world and according to the German newspaper [[Die Welt]] 52% of all voice actors currently work in the German dubbing industry. In Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], practically all films, shows, television series and foreign [[soap opera]]s are shown in dubbed versions created for the German market. However, in some of Switzerland's towns and cities (particularly along the language-borders), subtitled versions are common. Dubbing films is a traditional and common practice in German-speaking Europe, since subtitles are not accepted and used as much as in other European countries. According to a European study, Austria is the country with the highest rejection rate (more than 70 percent) of subtitles, followed by Italy, Spain and Germany.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\nIn German-speaking markets, [[PC game|computer]] and video games feature German text menus and are dubbed into the German language if speaking parts exist.\n\nIn recent years, Swiss and Austrian television stations have been showing increasing numbers of movies, series and TV-programmes in \"dual sound,\" which means the viewer can choose between the original language (e.g. English) and the language of the channel (German, French or Italian, according to the location).\n\nAlthough German-speaking [[voice actor]]s play only a secondary role, they are still notable for providing familiar voices to well-known actors. Famous foreign actors are known and recognised for their [[German language|German]] voice, and the German audience is used to them, so dubbing is also a matter of authenticity. However, in larger cities, there are theaters where movies can be seen in their original versions, as [[English language|English]] has become somewhat more popular among young educated viewers. On German [[mainstream]] television, films are never broadcast with subtitles, but pay-per-view programming is often available in the original language. Subtitled niche and [[art film]]s are sometimes aired on smaller networks.\n\nGerman-dubbed versions sometimes diverge greatly from the original, especially in adding humorous elements absent from the original. In extreme cases, such as ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', the German-dubbed version was more successful than the English original. Often, translation adds [[sexually explicit]] gags the U.S. versions might not be allowed to use. For example, in ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', the translators changed ''\"The [[Door hanger|Do Not Disturb sign]] will hang on the door tonight\"'' to ''\"The only hanging thing tonight will be the Do Not Disturb sign\"''.\n\nSome movies dubbed in Austria diverge from the German Standard version in addressing other people but only when the movies are dubbed into certain Austrian dialect versions. (Mr. and Mrs. are translated into Herr and Frau which is usually not translated in order to be in lip-sync).\nSometimes even English pronounced first names are translated and are pronounced into the correct German equivalent (English name \"Bert\" became Southern German pronounced name \"Bertl\" which is an abbreviation for any name either beginning or even ending with \"bert\", e.g. \"Berthold\" or \"Albert\".)\n\nSome movies dubbed before [[German reunification|reunification]] exist in different versions for the [[East Germany|east]] and the [[West Germany|west]]. They use different translations, and often differ in the style of dubbing.\n\nSome of the well-known German dubbing voice artists are listed below.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Czech dubbing was also extensively used in the broadcast of Slovak television channels, but since 2008 Slovak language laws require any newer shows (understood as the first television broadcast in Slovakia) to be provided with Slovak localisation (dubbing or subtitles); since then, television broadcasts of films, TV series and cartoons have been dubbed into Slovak.\n\n=====Hungary=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Romanian because the sources in this section are directly related to Hungary.-->\nIn [[Hungary]], dubbing is almost universally common. Almost every foreign movie or TV show released in Hungary is dubbed into Hungarian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://matadornetwork.com/abroad/9-culture-shocks-americans-will-hungary/ |title=9 culture shocks Americans will have in Hungary}}</ref> The history of dubbing dates back to the 1950s, when the country was still under communist rule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masterfilm.hu/services |title=Masterfilm :: Services}}</ref> One of the most iconic Hungarian dubs was of the American cartoon ''[[The Flintstones]]'', with a local translation by [[J\u00f3zsef Romh\u00e1nyi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherlockian-sherlock.com/the-dubbed-versions-of-sherlock-holmes.php |title=Dubbed versions Sherlock Holmes, dubbing, hungarian voices}}</ref> The Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis (ISzDB) is the largest Hungarian database for film dubs, with information for many live action and animated films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iszdb.hu |title=ISzDb - Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis}}</ref> On page 59 of the Eurobarometer, 84% of Hungarians said that they prefer dubbing over subtitles.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn the [[Socialism|socialist]] era, every film was dubbed with professional and mostly popular actors. Care was taken to make sure the same voice actor would lend his voice to the same original actor. In the early 1990s, as cinemas tried to keep up with showing newly released films, subtitling became dominant in the cinema. This, in turn, forced TV channels to make their own cheap versions of dubbed soundtracks for the movies they presented, resulting in a constant degrading of dubbing quality. Once this became customary, cinema distributors resumed the habit of dubbing for popular productions, presenting them in a below-average quality. However, every feature is presented with the original soundtrack in at least one cinema in large towns and cities.\n\nHowever, in Hungary, most documentary films and series (for example, those on [[Discovery Channel]], [[National Geographic Channel]]) are made with [[Voice-over|voiceovers]]. Some old movies and series, or ones that provide non-translatable jokes and conversations (for example, the ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' television series), are shown only with subtitles.\n\nThere is a more recent problem arising from dubbing included on DVD releases. Many generations have grown up with an original (and, by current technological standards, outdated) soundtrack, which is either technologically (mono or bad quality stereo sound) or legally (expired soundtrack license) unsuitable for a DVD release. Many original features are released on DVD with a new soundtrack, which in some cases proves to be extremely unpopular, thus forcing DVD producers to include the original soundtrack. In some rare cases, the Hungarian soundtrack is left out altogether. This happens notably with Warner Home Video Hungary, which ignored the existence of Hungarian soundtracks completely, as they did not want to pay the licenses for the soundtracks to be included on their new DVD releases, which appear with improved picture quality, but very poor subtitling.\n\n=====Poland=====\n{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called \"juxtareading,\" is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference\u2014all dialogues are voiced by one off-screen reader ({{lang-pl|lektor}}), preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.\n\nIt is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}</ref>\n\nPoland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).\n\nPolish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronisation. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of that time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.\n\nThe number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.\n\nOverall, during 1948\u20131998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.\n\nIn 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2007</ref> It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.\n\nCurrently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.\n\nSince theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska \u2013 former distributor of Disney's films \u2013 decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.\n\n=====Russia=====\n[[Russia]]n television is generally dubbed, but in the cases using voice-over dub technique with only a couple of voice actors, with the original speech still audible underneath. In the [[Soviet Union]], most foreign movies to be officially released were dubbed. Voice-over dub was invented in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s when with the fall of the regime, many popular foreign movies, previously forbidden, or at least questionable under communist rule, started to flood in, in the form of low-quality home-copied videos. Being unofficial releases, they were dubbed in a very primitive way. For example, the translator spoke the text directly over the audio of a video being copied, using primitive equipment.\n\nThe quality of the resulting dub was very low, the translated phrases were off-sync, interfering with the original voices, background sounds leaked into the track, translation was inaccurate and, most importantly, all dub voices were made by a single person who usually lacked the intonation of the original, making comprehension of some scenes quite difficult. This method of translation exerted a strong influence on Russian pop culture. Voices of translators became recognizable for generations.\n\nIn modern Russia, the overdubbing technique is still used in many cases, although with vastly improved quality, and now with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices. Video games are generally either dubbed into Russian (such as the ''Legend of Spyro'' trilogy, the ''Skylanders'' series, the ''Assassin's Creed'' saga, the ''Halo'' series, the ''Harry Potter'' series, etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Russian language.\n\nReleases of cinemas are almost always dubbed in the Russian language. On television series are shown as a dubbed translation and offscreen. Subtitles are not used at all.\n\n=====Ukraine=====\nIn [[Ukraine]], since 2006 cinema releases are almost always dubbed into Ukrainian with the overdubbing technique and multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices with a small percent of art-house/documentaries shown in the original language with Ukrainian subtitles. For television, TV channels usually release movies and TV-shows with a Ukrainian voiceover, although certain high-profile films and TV shows are dubbed rather than voice-overe'ed.\n\nIn the past Russian-language films, TV series, cartoons, animated series and TV programs were usually not dubbed but were shown with the original audio with Ukrainian subtitles. However, this practise has been slowly abandoned since the late 2010s: all children's films and cartoons regardless of the original language (including Russian) are always dubbed into Ukrainian; example of the first Russian cartoons dubbed into Ukrainian for the cinematic-release is [[The Snow Queen 2]] (2015), [[A Warrior's Tail]] (2015), Volki i Ovtsy: Be-e-e-zumnoe prevrashenie (2016), Ivan Tsarevich i Seryy Volk 3 (2016), Bremenskie razboyniki (2016), [[The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice|The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice (2017)]], [[Fantastic Journey to OZ]] (2017), Fixies: Top Secret (2017) etc.; the same trend is seen among Russian language feature films for adults, with the first such films dubbed into Ukrainian including [[Battle for Sevastopol|Battle for Sevastopol (2015)]], [[Hardcore Henry|Hardcore Henry (2016)]], [[The Duelist (2016 film)|The Duelist (2016)]].\n\n=====Latvia and Lithuania=====\nIn [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], only children's movies get dubbed in the cinema, while many live-action movies for an older audience use voice-over. In recent years however, many cartoons have been dubbed into Latvian and Lithuanian for TV. But some other kids shows, like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', use the voice-over.\n\n===Americas===\n====United States and English-speaking Canada====\nIn the United States and English-speaking Canada, [[live-action]] foreign films are usually shown in theaters with their original languages (with English subtitles). It is because live-action dubbed movies rarely did well in United States box office since the 1980s. The 1982 United States theatrical release of Wolfgang Peterson's ''[[Das Boot]]'' was the last major release to go out in both original and English-dubbed versions, and the film's original version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/|title=EDITORIAL: Life Isn't Beautiful Anymore, it's Dubbed|last=Indiewire|date=23 August 1999|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&gwt=pay|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805152511/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&gwt=pay|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 August 2018|title=Will Dubbing Fly in the U.S.?

The exceptions to this practice are either when an English dub has not been produced for the program (usually in the case of feature films) or when the program is being presented by a network that places importance on presenting it in its original format (as was the case when [[Turner Classic Movies]] aired several of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s works, which were presented both dubbed and subtitled). Most [[anime]] DVDs contain options for original Japanese, Japanese with subtitles, and English-dubbed, except for a handful of series that have been heavily edited or [[Americanized|Americanised]]. In addition, Disney has a policy that makes its directors undergo stages to perfect alignment of certain lip movements so the movie looks believable.\n\nIn addition, a small number of British films have been re-dubbed when released in the United States, due to the usage of dialects which Americans are not familiar with (for example, ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' and ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''). However, British children's shows (such as ''[[Bob the Builder]]'') are always re-dubbed with American voice actors in order to make the series more understandable for American children. Conversely, British programs shown in Canada are not re-dubbed.\n\nSome television shows shown in the US have Spanish dubs.  These are accessible though the SAP (secondary audio program) function of the television unit.\n\n====Spanish-speaking countries====\nFor Spanish-speaking countries, all foreign-language programs, films, cartoons and documentaries shown on free-to-air TV networks are dubbed into [[Standard Spanish]], while broadcasts on [[Cable television|cable]] and [[Satellite television|satellite]] pan-regional channels are either dubbed or subtitled. In theaters, children's movies and most blockbuster films are dubbed into Standard Spanish or [[Mexican Spanish]], and are sometimes further dubbed into regional dialects of Spanish where they are released.\n\n====Mexico====\nIn [[Mexico]], by law, films shown in theaters must be shown in their original version. Films in languages other than Spanish are usually subtitled. Only educational documentaries and movies rated for children, as well as some movies that are expected to have a wide audience (for example, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' or ''[[Marvel's The Avengers|The Avengers]]'') may be dubbed, but this is not compulsory, and some animated films are shown in theaters in both dubbed and subtitled versions (for instance, some [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] productions). Nonetheless, a recent trend in several cinemas is to offer the dubbed versions only, with a stark decrease in the showing of the original ones.\n\nDubbing must be made in Mexico by Mexican nationals or foreigners residing in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |title=Ley Federal de Cinematograf\u00eda |language=Spanish |trans-title=Federal Law of Filmmaking |publisher=C\u00e1mara de Diputados |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722125937/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011  }}</ref> Still, several programs that are shown on pay TV are dubbed in other countries like [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]] or [[Colombia]].\n\nMost movies released on DVD feature [[Standard Spanish|neutral Spanish]] as a language option, and sometimes feature a specific dub for Mexican audiences (for example, ''Rio''). Foreign programs are dubbed on [[broadcast television systems|broadcast TV]], while on [[pay TV]] most shows and movies are subtitled. In a similar way to cinemas, in the last few years many channels on pay TV have begun to broadcast programs and films only in their dubbed version.\n\nDubbing became very popular in the 1990s with the rise in popularity of anime in Mexico. Some voice actors have become celebrities and are always identified with specific characters, such as [[Mario Casta\u00f1eda]] (who became popular by dubbing [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'') or [[Humberto V\u00e9lez]] (who dubbed [[Homer Simpson]] in the first 15 seasons of ''[[The Simpsons]]'').\n\nThe popularity of pay TV has allowed people to view several series in their original language rather than dubbed. Dubbing has been criticised for the use of TV or movie stars as voice actors (such as [[Ricky Martin]] in Disney's ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', or [[Eugenio Derbez]] in DreamWorks' ''Shrek''), or for the incorrect use of local popular culture that sometimes creates unintentional jokes or breaks the feeling of the original work (such as translating [[Sheldon Cooper]]'s \"Bazinga!\" to \"\u00a1Vacil\u00f3n!\").\n\nSeveral video games have been dubbed into neutral Spanish, rather than European Spanish, in Mexico (such as the ''Gears of War'' series, ''Halo 3'', ''Infamous 2'' and others). [[Sony]] recently announced that more games (such as ''God of War: Ascension'') will be dubbed into neutral Spanish.\n\n====Peru====\nIn [[Peru]], all foreign series, movies, and animated programming are shown dubbed in Latin American Spanish, with dubs imported from Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela on terrestrial and pay-television. Most movies intended for kids are being offered as dub-only movies, while most films aimed at older audiences are being offered dubbed and subtitled in Spanish. Also, at most theaters, kids films (on rare occasions) subtitled are commonly shown at nighttime. Most subtitled Pay-TV channels show both dubbed and subtitled version of every film they broadcast, being offered with a separate subtitle track and a second audio track in English. There is an increase of people preferring subtitle films and series rather than dubbed starting the late-2000s, as Peruvians viewers tend to get used to their original version.\n\nPeru used to do not produce their own dubs since dubbing studios never existed in that country until 2016, when the company \"Big Bang Films\" started to dub movies and series, however, since 2014 a group of dubbing actors created a group called \"Torre A Doblaje\", who is a group of actors who gives dubbing and locution service.\n\n====Brazil====\nIn [[Brazil]], foreign programs are invariably dubbed into [[Brazilian Portuguese]] on [[free to air TV]], with only a few exceptions. Films shown at cinemas are generally offered with both subtitled and dubbed versions, with dubbing frequently being the only choice for children's movies. Subtitling was primarily for adult audience movies until 2012. Since then, dubbed versions also became available for all ages. As a result, in recent years, more cinemas have opened in Brazil, attracting new audiences to the cinema who prefer dubbing. According to a [[Datafolha]] survey, 56% of Brazilian movie theaters' audience prefer to watch dubbed movies.<ref>http://revistaepoca.globo.com/cultura/noticia/2012/06/dublagem-venceu-legendas.html</ref> Most of the dubbing studios in Brazil is in the cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140319091221/http://ne10.uol.com.br/canal/cultura/noticia/2012/05/27/cresce-preferencia-por-filmes-dublados-nos-cinemas-brasileiros-344927.php Cresce prefer\u00eancia por filmes dublados nos cinemas brasileiros (in Portuguese)] Ne10, 27 May 2012.

By the end of the 1950s, most of the movies, TV series and cartoons on television in Brazil were shown in its original sound and subtitles. However, in 1962, a decree of President [[J\u00e2nio Quadros]] ruled that all foreign productions on television should be dubbed. This measure boosted the growth of dubbing in Brazil, and has led to several dubbing studios since then.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/cinema-e-tv/quando-surgiu-a-dublagem-no-brasil-e-no-mundo/ | title=Quando surgiu a dublagem no Brasil e no mundo?}}</ref> The biggest dubbing studio in Brazil was [[Herbert Richers]], headquartered in [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]] and closed in 2009, At its peak in the 80s and 90s, the Herbert Richers studios dubbed about 70% of the productions shown in Brazilian cinemas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://super.abril.com.br/mundo-estranho/quem-e-herbert-richers/ |title = Quem \u00e9 Herbert Richers?}}</ref>\n\nIn the 90's, with Saint Seiya, Dragon Ball and other anime shows becoming popular in Brazilian TV's, the voice actors and the dubbing career gained a higher space in Brazilian culture. Actors like [[Hermes Baroli]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Pegasus Seiya]], in ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' and actors like [[Ashton Kutcher]]), [[Marco Ribeiro]] (Brazilian dubber of many actors like [[Tom Hanks]], [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]], and [[Yusuke Urameshi]] from the anime ''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]'') and [[Wendel Bezerra]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] in ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'') are recognised for their most notable roles.\n\nPay TV commonly offers both dubbed and subtitled movies, with statistics showing that dubbed versions are becoming predominant.<ref>[http://oglobo.globo.com/revista-da-tv/dublagem-em-canais-de-tv-paga-provoca-polemica-3262532 Dublagem em canais de TV paga provoca pol\u00eamica (in Portuguese)] O Globo, 20 November 2011. Retrieved 17 August 2012.</ref> Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually feature Portuguese, Spanish, and the original audio along with subtitles in native languages. Most video games are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese rather than having European Portuguese dubs alone. Games such as ''[[Halo 3]]'', ''[[God of War: Ascension]]'', ''[[inFamous 2]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', ''[[Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and others are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese. This is because despite the dropping of the dubbing law in Portugal in 1994, most companies in that country use the Brazilian Portuguese because of traditional usage during the days of the dubbing rule, along with these dubbings being more marketable than European Portuguese.\n\nA list that showcases Brazilian Portuguese voice artists that dub for actors and actresses are displayed here. However, there can also be different official dub artists for certain regions within Brazil. \n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! Brazilian Portuguese dubbing artists !!

They speak with a mixed accent, they pronounce /\u025b\u0303/ with a Parisian accent, but they pronounce \"\u00e2\" and \"\u00ea\" with a Quebec accent: ''gr\u00e2ce'' [\u0261\u0281\u0251\u02d0s] and ''\u00eatre'' [\u025b\u02d0t\u0281\u0325]. Occasionally, the dubbing of a series or a movie, such as ''The Simpsons'', is made using the more widely spoken ''[[joual]]'' variety of Quebec French. Dubbing has the advantage of making children's films and TV series more comprehensible to younger audiences. However, many [[bilingual]] Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois prefer subtitling, since they would understand some or all of the original audio. In addition, all films are shown in English, as well in certain theaters (especially in major cities and English-speaking areas such as the [[West Island]]), and some theatres, such as the Scotiabank Cinema [[Montreal]], show only movies in English. Most American television series are only available in English on [[DVD]], or on English-language channels, but some of the more popular ones have French dubs shown on mainstream networks, and are released in French on DVD as well, sometimes separately from an English-only version.\n\nFormerly, all French-language dubbed films in Quebec were imported from France and some still are. Such a practice was criticised by former politician [[Mario Dumont]] after he took his children to see the [[Standard French|Parisian French]] dub of ''Shrek the Third'', which Dumont found incomprehensible.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-pressing-hollywood-to-justify-lack-of-movie-dubbing/article1352554/ Quebec pressing Hollywood to justify lack of movie dubbing], The Canadian Press, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 26 May 2008</ref> After his complaints and a proposed bill, ''[[Bee Movie]]'', the film from [[DreamWorks Animation]], was dubbed in Quebec, making it the studio's first animated film to have a Quebec French dub, as all DreamWorks Animation films had previously been dubbed in France.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr\u00f4le d'abeille (v.o.a) Bee Movie |url=http://doublage.qc.ca/showMovie.php?id=1981 |work=Doublage.qc.ca |publisher=idgrafix |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Doublage.qc.ca |language=French}}</ref> In terms of Disney, the first Disney animated film to be dubbed in Quebec was ''Oliver and Company.'' The Disney Renaissance films were also dubbed in Quebec except for ''The Rescuers Down Under'', ''Beauty and the Beast'', and ''The Lion King''.\n\nIn addition, because Canadian viewers usually find Quebec French more comprehensible than other dialects of the language, some older film series that had the French-language versions of previous installments dubbed in France have had later ones dubbed in Quebec, often creating inconsistencies within the French version of the series' canon. [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series are examples. Both series had films released in the 1970s and 1980s, with no Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French dubbed versions; instead, the Parisian French versions, with altered character and object names and terms, were distributed in the province. However, later films in both series released 1999 and later were dubbed in Quebec, using different voice actors and \"reversing\" name changes made in France's dubbings due to the change in studio.\n\n===Asia===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\n\n====China====\nChina has a long tradition of dubbing foreign films into [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], starting in the 1930s. While during the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] era Western motion pictures may have been imported and dubbed into Chinese, since 1950 [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet movies]], dubbed primarily in Shanghai, became the main import.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|1987|p=40}}</ref> Beginning in the late 1970s, in addition to films, popular TV series from the United States, Japan, Brazil, and Mexico were also dubbed. The [[Shanghai]] Film Dubbing Studio has been the most well-known studio in the film dubbing industry in China. In order to generate high-quality products, they divide each film into short segments, each one lasting only a few minutes, and then work on the segments one-by-one. In addition to the correct meaning in translation, they make tremendous effort to match the lips of the actors to the dialogue. As a result, the dubbing in these films generally is not readily detected. The cast of dubbers is acknowledged at the end of a dubbed film. Several dubbing actors and actresses of the Shanghai Film Dubbing Studio have become well-known celebrities, such as Qiu Yuefeng, Bi Ke, Li Zi, and Liu Guangning. In recent years, however, especially in the larger cities on the east and south coasts, it has become increasingly common for movie theaters to show subtitled versions with the original soundtracks intact.\n\nMotion pictures are also dubbed into the languages of some of China's [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China|autonomous regions]]. Notably, the Translation Department of the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]] Movie Company (\u897f\u85cf\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a\u7535\u5f71\u516c\u53f8\u8bd1\u5236\u79d1)<ref name=humes20131122>[http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 Confucius the Movie: China Flop Dubbed at the State\u2019s Expense for Tibetan Movie-goers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130085415/http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 |date=30 November 2013 }}, 22 November 2013</ref> has been dubbing movies into the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] since the 1960s.

Until the mid-1990s, the major national [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial channels]] both dubbed and subtitled all foreign programs and films and, for some popular programs, the original voices were offered in [[second audio program]]. Gradually, however, both terrestrial and cable channels stopped dubbing for [[prime time]] U.S. shows and films, while subtitling continued.\n\nIn the 2000s, the dubbing practice has differed depending on the nature and origin of the program. Animations, children's shows and some educational programs on PTS are mostly dubbed. English live-action movies and shows are not dubbed in theaters or on television. Japanese TV dramas are no longer dubbed, while [[Korean language|Korean]] dramas, [[Hong Kong]] dramas and dramas from other Asian countries are still often dubbed. Korean variety shows are not dubbed. Japanese and Korean films on Asian movie channels are still dubbed. In theaters, most foreign films are not dubbed, while animated films and some films meant for children offer a dubbed version. Hong Kong live-action films have a long tradition of being dubbed into Mandarin, while more famous films offer a [[Cantonese]] version.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nIn [[Hong Kong]], foreign television programmes, except for English-language and Mandarin television programmes, are dubbed in Cantonese. English-language and Mandarin programmes are generally shown in their original with subtitles. Foreign films, such as most live-action and animated films (such as anime and Disney), are usually dubbed in Cantonese. However most cinemas also offer subtitled versions of English-language films.\n\nFor the most part, foreign films and TV programmes, both live-action and animated, are generally dubbed in both Mandarin and Cantonese. For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film series, Elijah Wood's character [[Frodo Baggins]] was dubbed into Mandarin by [[Jiang Guangtao]] for China and Taiwan. For the Cantonese localisation, there were actually two dubs for Hong Kong and [[Macau]]. The first Cantonese dub, he was voiced by Leung Wai Tak, with a second Cantonese dub released, he was voiced by Bosco Tang.\n\nA list for Mandarin and Cantonese voice artists that dub for actors are shown here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In programs aimed at teenagers and adults, dubbing is rarely considered for translation, not only because of its high costs, but also because the audience is mainly multi-lingual. Most viewers in Israel speak at least one European language in addition to Hebrew, and a large part of the audience also speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Therefore, most viewers prefer to hear the original soundtrack, aided by Hebrew subtitles. Another problem is that dubbing does not allow for translation into two different languages simultaneously, as is often the case of Israeli television channels that use subtitles in Hebrew and another language (like [[Russian language|Russian]]) simultaneously.\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, many television programs appear on Japanese television subtitled or dubbed if they are intended for children. When the American film ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' was released in Japan in 1931, subtitles became the mainstream method of translating TV programs and films in Japan. Later, around the 1950s, foreign television programs and films began to be shown dubbed in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] on television. The first ones to be dubbed into Japanese were [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|the 1940s Superman cartoons]] in 1955.\n\nDue to the lack of video software for domestic television, video software was imported from abroad. When the television program was shown on television, it was mostly dubbed. There was a character limit for a small TV screen at a lower resolution, and this method was not suitable for the poor elderly and illiterate eye, as was audio dubbing. Presently, TV shows and movies (both those aimed at all ages and adults-only) are shown dubbed with the original language and Japanese subtitles, while providing the original language option when the same film is released on [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]]. Laserdisc releases of Hollywood films were almost always subtitled.\n\nAdult cartoons such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' are shown dubbed in Japanese on the [[WOWOW]] TV channel. ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'' was dubbed in Japanese by different actors instead of the same Japanese dubbing-actors from the cartoon because it was handled by a different Japanese dubbing studio, and it was marketed for the [[Kansai region|Kansai]] market. In Japanese theaters, foreign-language movies, except those intended for children, are usually shown in their original version with Japanese subtitles. Foreign films usually contain multiple Japanese-dubbing versions, but with several different original Japanese-dubbing voice actors, depending upon which TV station they are aired. [[NHK]], [[Nippon TV]], [[Fuji TV]], [[TV Asahi]], and [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] usually follow this practice, as do software releases on [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]. As for recent foreign films being released, there are now some film theaters in Japan that show both dubbed and subtitled editions.\n\nOn 22 June 2009, [[20th Century Fox]]'s Japanese division has opened up a [[Blu-ray]] lineup known as \"Emperor of Dubbing\", dedicated at having multiple Japanese dubs of popular English-language films (mostly Hollywood films) as well as retaining the original scripts, releasing them altogether in special Blu-ray releases. These also feature a new dub created exclusively for that release as a director's cut, or a new dub made with a better surround sound mix to match that of the original English mix (as most older Japanese dubbings were made on mono mixes to be aired on TV). Other companies have followed practice, like Universal Pictures's Japanese division [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan]] opening up \"Reprint of Memories\", along with [[:ja:\u30ef\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc \u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c6\u30a4\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8 \u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30f3|Warner Bros Japan]] having \"Power of Dubbing\", which act in a similar way by re-packaging all the multiple Japanese dubs of popular films and putting them out as Special Blu-ray releases.\n\n\"Japanese dub-over artists\" provide the voices for certain performers, such as those listed in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

However, some anime is censored, such as Japanese letters or content being edited for a suitable Korean audience. Western cartoons are dubbed in Korean as well, such as [[Nickelodeon]] cartoons like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Danny Phantom]]''. Several English-language (mostly American) live-action films are dubbed in [[Korean language|Korean]], but they are not shown in theaters. Instead they are only broadcast on South Korean television networks ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]], [[Educational Broadcasting System|EBS]]), while DVD import releases of these films are shown with Korean subtitles, such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. This may be due to the fact that the six American [[major film studio]]s may not own any rights to the Korean dubs of their live-action films that the Korean television networks have dubbed and aired. Even if they don't own the rights, Korean or non-Korean viewers can record from Korean-dubbed live-action films from television broadcasting onto DVDs with [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]].\n\nSometimes, video games are dubbed in Korean. Examples would be the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' series, the ''[[Jak & Daxter (series)|Jak & Daxter]]'' series, and the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series. For the ''Halo'' games, Lee Jeong Gu provides his Korean voice to the main protagonist [[Characters of Halo|Master Chief]] (replacing [[Steve Downes]]'s voice), while [[Kim So Hyeong (voice actor)|Kim So Hyeong]] voices [[Characters of Halo|Chieftain Tartarus]], one of the main antagonists (replacing [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]'s voice).\n\nThe following South Korean voice-over artists are usually identified with the following actors:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Then a few months or years later, those movies appear on TV either dubbed in Indonesian or subtitled. Kids shows are mostly dubbed, though even in cartoon series, songs aren't dubbed, but in big movies such as Disney movies, both speaking and singing voice were cast for the new Indonesian dub even though it took maybe a few months or even years for the movie to come out. Adult films was mostly subtitled, but sometimes they can be dubbed as well and because there aren't many Indonesian voices, especially in dubbed movies, three characters can have the exact same voice.\n\nReality shows are never dubbed in Indonesian, because they are not a planned interaction like with movies and TV shows, so if they appear in TV, they will be appear with subtitles.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In general, the decision whether to dub a video production depends mainly on the target audience of the channel on which the feature will be aired, its genre, and/or outlet of transmission (e.g. TV or film, free or pay-TV).  \n\n=====Free-to-air TV=====\nThe prevalence of media needing to be dubbed has resulted in a talent pool that is very capable of syncing voice to lip, especially for shows broadcast by the country's three largest networks. It is not uncommon in the Filipino dub industry to have most of the voices in a series dubbing by only a handful of voice talents. Programmes originally in English used to usually air in their original language on free-to-air television. \n\nSince the late 1990s/early 2000s, however, more originally English-language programmes that air on major free-to-air networks (i.e. 5, ABS-CBN, GMA) have been dubbed into Filipino. Even the former Studio 23 (now S+A), once known for its airing programmes in English, had adopted Filipino-language dubbing for some of its foreign programmes. Children's programmes from cable networks [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Disney Channel]] shown on [[TV5 (Philippines)|5]], GMA, or ABS-CBN, have long been dubbed into Filipino or another Philippine regional language.  [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Animated Disney films]] are often dubbed in Filipino except for the singing scenes, which are shown in their original language (though in recent years, there has been an increase in number of Disney musicals having their songs also translated such as ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'').  [[GMA News TV]] airs some documentaries, movies, and reality series originally shown in the English language as dubbed in Filipino.  \n\nDubbing is less common in smaller free-to-air networks such as [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] and the former [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN 9]] (now CNN Philippines) whereby the original-language version of the programme is aired. Dramas from Asia (particularly Greater China and Korea) and Latin America (called ''Asianovelas'', and ''Mexicanovelas'', respectively) have always been dubbed into Filipino or another Philippine regional language, and each programme from these genres feature their unique set of Filipino-speaking voice actors.\n\n=====Pay TV=====\nThe original language-version of TV programmes is also usually available on cable/satellite channels such as [[Fox Life]], [[Fox Asia|Fox]], and AXN. However, some pay-TV channels specialise in showing foreign shows and films dubbed into Filipino. [[Cinema One]], ABS-CBN's cable movie channel, shows some films originally in non-English language dubbed into Filipino. [[Nat Geo Wild]] airs most programs dubbed into Filipino for Philippine audiences, being one of the few cable channels to do so. [[Tagalized Movie Channel|Tagalised Movie Channel]] & [[Tag (TV channel)|Tag]] airs Hollywood and Asian movies dubbed in Filipino. [[Fox Filipino]] airs some English, Latin, and Asian series dubbed in Filipino such as ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', ''[[Devious Maids]]'', ''La Teniente'', ''Kdabra'', and some selected programs from [[Channel M (Southeast Asia)|Channel M]].  The defunct channel [[Hero (TV channel)|HERO TV]], which focuses on anime and [[tokusatsu]] shows and now a web portal, dubs all its foreign programs into Filipino. This is in contrast to Animax, where their anime programs are dubbed in English.\n\n=====Cinema=====\nForeign films, especially English films shown in local cinemas, are almost always shown in their original language.  Non-English foreign films make use of English subtitles. Unlike other countries, children's films originally in English are not dubbed in cinemas.\n\nA list of voice actors with their associates that they dub into Filipino are listed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Dubbing is rarely done with the other major Indian languages, namely [[Malayalam]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]], due to lack of significant market size. Despite this, some [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]] dubs of children television programs can be seen on the [[Sun TV Network|Sun TV]] channel. The dubbed versions are released into the towns and lower tier settlements of the respective states (where English penetration is low), often with the English-language originals released in the metropolitan areas. In all other states, the English originals are released along with the dubbed versions, where often the dubbed version collections are more outstanding than the originals. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' was also done in the [[Bhojpuri language]], a language popular in [[East India|eastern India]] in addition to Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'', the most recent installment in the ''[[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]]'' franchise, was the first ever Hollywood film to receive a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi language dub]] as well. \n\nMost TV channels mention neither the Indian-language dubbing credits, nor its staff, at the end of the original ending credits, since changing the credits casting for the original actors or voice actors involves a huge budget for modifying, making it somewhat difficult to find information for the dubbed versions. The same situation is encountered for films. Sometimes foreign programs and films receive more than one dub, such as for example, [[Jumanji]], [[Dragonheart]] and [[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]] having two Hindi dubs. Information for the Hindi, Tamil and Telugu voice actors who have done the voices for specific actors and for their roles on foreign films and television programs are published in local Indian data magazines, for those that are involved in the dubbing industry in India. But on a few occasions, there are some foreign productions that do credit the dubbing cast, such as animated films like the ''[[Barbie (film series)|Barbie]]'' films, and some Disney films. [[Disney Channel]] original series released on DVD with their Hindi dubs show a list of the artists in the Hindi dub credits, after the original ending credits. Theatrical releases and VCD releases of foreign films do not credit the dubbing cast or staff. The DVD releases, however, do have credits for the dubbing staff, if they are released multilingual. As of recently, information for the dubbing staff of foreign productions have been expanding due to high demands of people wanting to know the voice actors behind characters in foreign works. Large dubbing studios in India include [[Sound & Vision India]], [[Main Frame Software Communications]], [[Visual Reality]], [[ZamZam Productions]], [[Treasure Tower International]], [[Blue Whale Entertainment]], [[Jai Hand Entertainment]], [[Sugar Mediaz]] and [[Rudra Sound Solutionz]].\n\n====Pakistan====\nIn [[Pakistan]] \"foreign films\", and cartoons are not normally dubbed locally. Instead, foreign films, anime and cartoons, such as those shown on [[Nickelodeon Pakistan]] and [[Cartoon Network Pakistan]], are dubbed in [[Hindi]] in India, as Hindi and [[Urdu]], the national language of Pakistan, are [[mutually intelligible]].\nHowever, soap operas from [[Turkey]] are now dubbed in Urdu and have gained increased popularity at the expense of Indian soap operas in Hindi.<ref>[http://www.firstpost.com/living/in-pakistan-indian-soap-operas-give-way-to-turkish-serials-1260549.html In Pakistan, Indian soap operas give way to Turkish serials], ''[[First Post (India)|First Post]]'', 1 December 2013</ref> This has led to protests from local producers that these are a threat to Pakistan's television industry, with local productions being moved out of peak viewing time or dropped altogether.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/news/772593/is-tv-drama-industry-overreacting-to-turkish-soaps-blitz Is TV drama industry overreacting to Turkish soaps blitz?], ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', 20 December 2012</ref> Similarly, politicians leaders have expressed concerns over their content, given Turkey's less conservative culture.<ref>[http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/the-geopolitics-of-soap-operas/ The Geopolitics of Soap Operas], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 January 2013</ref>\n\n====Vietnam====\nIn [[Vietnam]], foreign-language films and programs are subtitled on television in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. They were not dubbed until 1985, but are briefly translated with a speaker before commercial breaks. ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' was considered to be the very first American Hollywood film to be entirely dubbed in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Since then, children's films that came out afterwards have been released dubbed in theaters. [[HTV3]] has dubbed television programs for children, including ''[[Ben 10 (TV series)|Ben 10]]'', and ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]'', by using various voice actors to dub over the character roles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBlXxqhKwU |title=Ben 10 Vietnamese Trailer (Trailer Ben 10 - HTV3) |publisher=YouTube |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WbgyJP5-TA |title=HTV3 - C\u1ea9m Nang C\u1ee7a Ned - Trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nSooner afterwards, more programs started to get dubbed. HTV3 also offers anime dubbed into Vietnamese. [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]] got a Vietnamese dub in early 2014 on HTV3 starting with the Best Wishes series. But due to a controversy regarding Pok\u00e9mon's cries being re-dubbed despite that all characters had their Japanese names, it was switched to [[VTV2]] in September 2015 when the XY series debut. [[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]] also recently has been dubbed for HTV3 in early 2015.\n\n====Singapore====\nIn multilingual [[Singapore]], dubbing is rare for western programmes. English-language programmes on the free-to-air terrestrial channels are usually subtitled in Chinese or Malay. Chinese, Malay and Tamil programmes (except for news bulletins), usually have subtitles in English and the original language during the prime time hours. [[Dual sound]] programs, such as Korean and Japanese dramas, offer sound in the original languages with subtitles, Mandarin-dubbed and subtitled, or English-dubbed. The [[Speak Mandarin Campaign|deliberate policy to encourage Mandarin]] among citizens made it required by law for programs in other Chinese dialects ([[Min Nan|Hokkien]], Cantonese and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]) to be dubbed into Mandarin, with the exception of traditional [[opera]]s. Cantonese and Hokkien shows from Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively, are available on VCD and DVD. In a recent development, news bulletins are subtitled.\n\n====Iran====\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Iranian Dubbing artists.jpg|thumb|A group of Iranian dubbing artists]]\nIn [[Iran]], foreign films and television programs are dubbed in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Dubbing began in 1946 with the advent of movies and cinemas in the country. Since then, foreign movies have always been dubbed for the cinema and TV. Using various voice actors and adding local hints and witticisms to the original contents, dubbing played a major role in attracting people to the cinemas and developing an interest in other cultures. The dubbing art in Iran reached its apex during the 1960s and 1970s with the inflow of American, European and Hindi movies.\n\nThe most famous musicals of the time, such as ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', were translated, adjusted and performed in Persian by the voice artists. Since the 1990s, for political reasons and under pressure from the state, the dubbing industry has declined, with movies dubbed only for the state TV channels. During recent years, DVDs with Persian subtitles have found a market among viewers for the same reason, but most people still prefer the Persian-speaking dubbed versions. Recently, privately operated companies started dubbing TV series by hiring famous dubbers.\n\nA list of Persian voice actors that associate with their actor counterparts are listed here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

There are exceptions, such as some children's cartoons.\n\n====Azerbaijan====\nIn [[Azerbaijan]], dubbing is rare, as most Azerbaijani channels such as [[G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f TV|ARB G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f]] air [[voice-over]]s or Azerbaijan originals.\n\n====Western Asia====\nSee [[#North Africa, Western Asia|below]].\n\n===Africa===\n====North Africa, Western Asia====\nIn [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and Tunisia, most foreign movies (especially Hollywood productions) are shown dubbed in French. These movies are usually imported directly from French film distributors. The choice of movies dubbed into French can be explained by the widespread use of the French language. Another important factor is that local theaters and private media companies do not dub in local languages in order to avoid high costs, but also because of the lack of both expertise and demand.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, dubbed series and movies for children in [[Modern Standard Arabic]] became a popular choice among most TV channels, cinemas and VHS/DVD stores. However, dubbed films are still imported, and dubbing is performed in the [[Levant]] countries with a strong tradition of dubbing (mainly [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]]).\n\nIn the Arabic-speaking countries, some children shows (mainly cartoons) are dubbed in Arabic, otherwise Arabic subtitles are used. The only exception was [[telenovelas]] dubbed in Standard Arabic, or dialects, but also Turkish series, most notably [[G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f (TV series)|G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f]], in Syrian Arabic.\n\nAn example of Arabic voice actors that dub for certain performers is Safi Mohammed for [[Elijah Wood]].\n\nIn [[Tunisia]], the Tunisia National Television (TNT), the public broadcaster of Tunisia, is not allowed to show any content in any language other than Arabic, which forces it to broadcast only dubbed content (this restriction was recently removed for commercials). During the 1970s and 1980s, TNT (known as ERTT at the time) started dubbing famous cartoons in Tunisian and Standard Arabic. However, in the private sector, television channels are not subject to the language rule.\n\n====South Africa====\nIn [[South Africa]], many television programmes were dubbed in [[Afrikaans]], with the original soundtrack (usually in English, but sometimes [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or [[German language|German]]) \"[[simulcast]]\" in [[FM stereo#Stereo FM|FM stereo]] on [[Radio 2000]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-NRDAQAAIAAJ&dq=was+simulcast++Radio+2000+afrikaans&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Radio+2000+afrikaans ''The voice, the vision: a sixty year history of the South African Broadcasting Corporation''], Malcolm Theunissen, Victor Nikitin, Melanie Pillay, Advent Graphics, 1996, page 120</ref> These included US series such as ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''(Steve Austin: Die Man van Staal)''<ref>[http://www.tvsa.co.za/mastershowinfo.asp?mastershowid=2293 The Six Million Dollar Man], TVSA - The South African TV Authority</ref> ''[[Miami Vice]]'' ''(Misdaad in Miami)'',<ref>{{cite news |title=Shows Allow Blacks, Whites to Share Cultural Experiences : South African Viewers Get a Mixed TV Message From U.S. Programs |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-25/news/mn-7271_1_south-african |accessdate=14 August 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=25 May 1986|author=GLENN FRANKEL (from ''The Washington Post'')}}</ref> ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'',<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/1996-02-09-the-critics-thumbs-up/ The critics' thumbs-up], ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'', 9 February 1996</ref> and the German detective series ''[[Derrick (TV series)|Derrick]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7h1DAQAAIAAJ&dq=derrick+tv+series+afrikaans&q=derrick+|title=Mass Media, Towards the Millennium|isbn=9780627023248|accessdate=9 July 2015|last1=Beer|first1=Arrie De|year=1998}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[boycott]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] actors' union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], which banned the sale of most British television programmes, the [[puppet]] series ''[[The Adventures of Rupert Bear]]'' was dubbed into [[South African English]], as the original voices had been recorded by Equity voice artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |last=Bevan |first=C |year=2008 |title=Putting up screens: A history of television in South Africa, 1929-1976, MHCS dissertation, University of Pretoria, Pretoria |accessdate=1 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215155949/http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis practice has declined as a result of the reduction of airtime for the language on [[SABC]] TV, and the increase of locally produced material in Afrikaans on other channels like [[KykNet]]. Similarly, many programmes, such as ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', were dubbed into [[Zulu language|Zulu]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Lelyveld |first=Joseph |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/magazine/22SAFR.html?&pagewanted=all |title=South Africa: Dream and Reality |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=22 September 1985 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> but this has also declined as local drama production has increased. However, some animated films, such as ''[[Maya the Bee]]'', have been dubbed in both Afrikaans and Zulu by local artists.<ref>[http://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/Maya-the-Bee-flick-dubbed-into-Afrikaans-and-Zulu-for-SA-audience-20150910 Maya the Bee flick dubbed into Afrikaans and Zulu for SA audience], [[News24|Channel24]], 18 September 2015</ref>\n\n====Uganda====\nUganda's [[Cinema of Uganda|own film industry]] is fairly small, and foreign movies are commonly watched. The English sound track is often accompanied by the [[Luganda]] translation and comments, provided by an Ugandan \"video jockey\" (VJ). VJ's interpreting and narration may be available in a recorded form or live.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2012/11/cinema-uganda |title=Coming to you live\n|date=2 November 2012|journal=The Economist|first=M|last=H}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\nIn common with other English-speaking countries, there has traditionally been little dubbing in [[Australia]], with foreign language television programmes and films being shown (usually on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]) with subtitles or English dubs produced in other countries. This has also been the case in [[New Zealand]], but the [[M\u0101ori Television Service]], launched in 2004, has dubbed animated films into [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]].<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10117134 Maori TV broadens horizons], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', 26 March 2005</ref> However, some TV commercials from foreign countries are dubbed, even if the original commercial came from another English-speaking country.  Moreover, the off-screen narration portions of some non-fiction programmes originating from the UK or North America are re-dubbed by Australian voice talents to relay information in expressions that Australians can understand more easily.\n\n==Alternatives==\n===Subtitles===\n{{Main|Subtitle}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[Subtitle (captioning)|Subtitles]] can be used instead of dubbing, as different countries have different traditions regarding the choice between dubbing and subtitling. On [[DVD]]s with higher translation budgets, the option for both types will often be provided to account for individual preferences; [[Purism|purists]] often demand subtitles. For small markets (small language area or films for a select audience), subtitling is more suitable, because it is cheaper. In the case of films for small children who cannot yet read, or do not read fast enough, dubbing is necessary.\n\nIn most [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, dubbing is comparatively rare. In [[Israel]], some programmes need to be comprehensible to speakers of both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. This cannot be accomplished with dubbing, so subtitling is much more commonplace\u2014sometimes even with subtitles in multiple languages, with the soundtrack remaining in the original language, usually English. The same applies to certain television shows in [[Finland]], where [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] are both official languages.\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], [[Flanders]], [[Nordic countries]], [[Estonia]] and [[Portugal]], films and television programmes are shown in the original language (usually English) with subtitles, and only cartoons and children's movies and programs are dubbed, such as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' and others. Cinemas usually show both a dubbed version and one with subtitles for this kind of movie, with the subtitled version shown later in the evening.\n\nIn Portugal, one terrestrial channel, [[TVI (Portugal)|TVI]], dubbed U.S. series like ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name=\"DCpt\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sKswU7k_I |title=Dawson's Creek PT |last=Somnorte |date=6 December 2008 |via=YouTube}}</ref> RTP also transmitted ''[[Friends]]'' in a dubbed version, but it was poorly received and later re-aired in a subtitled version. Cartoons, on the other hand, are usually dubbed, sometimes by well-known actors, even on TV. Animated movies are usually released to the cinemas in both subtitled and dubbed versions.\n\nIn [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]], terrestrial channels air films and TV series in a dubbed version, as demanded by law. However, those same series can be seen on cable channels at more accessible time-slots in their subtitled version and usually before they are shown on open TV. In contrast, the series ''The Simpsons'' is aired in its Mexican Spanish-dubbed version both on terrestrial television and on the cable station Fox, which broadcasts the series for the area. Although the first season of the series appeared with subtitles, this was not continued for the following seasons.\n\n===Dubbing and subtitling===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIn [[Bulgaria]], television series are dubbed, but most television channels use subtitles for action and drama movies. [[AXN]] uses subtitles for its series, but as of 2008 emphasises dubbing. Only [[Diema]] channels dub all programs. Movies in theaters, with the exception of films for children, use dubbing and subtitles. Dubbing of television programs is usually done using voiceovers, but usually, voices professional actors, while trying to give each character a different voice by using appropriate intonations. Dubbing with synchronised voices is rarely used, mostly for animated films. ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' is a rare example of a feature film dubbed this way on [[BNT Channel 1]], though a subtitled version is currently shown on other channels.\n\n[[Walt Disney Television]]'s animated series (such as ''[[DuckTales]]'', ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', and ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'') were only aired with synchronised Bulgarian voices on [[BNT Channel 1]] until 2005, but then the Disney shows were canceled. When airing of Disney series resumed on [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] and [[Jetix]] in 2008, voiceovers were used, but Disney animated-movie translations still use synchronised voices. Voiceover dubbing is not used in theatrical releases. The Bulgarian film industry law requires all children's films to be dubbed, not subtitled. [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] dubbed and aired the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime with synchronised voices. Now, the show is airing on Disney Channel, also in a synchronised form.\n\n[[Netflix]] provides both subtitles and dubbed audio with its foreign language shows, including Brazil's dystopian \"[[3%]]\" and the German thriller \"[[Dark (TV series)|Dark]]\". Viewer testing indicates that its audience is more likely to finish watching a series if they select to view it with dubbed audio rather than translated subtitles. Netflix now streams its foreign language content with dubbed audio as default in an effort to increase viewer retention.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/netflix-success-secrets-1202721847/|title=Netflix's Secrets to Success: Six Cell Towers, Dubbing and More|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=8 March 2018|work=Variety|access-date=7 November 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==General use==\nDubbing is also used in applications and genres other than traditional film, including video games, television, and pornographic films.\n\n===Video games===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nMany [[video game]]s originally produced in [[North America]], [[Japan]], and [[PAL]] countries are dubbed into foreign languages for release in areas such as [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], especially for video games that place a heavy emphasis on dialogue. Because characters' mouth movements can be part of the game's code, [[lip sync]] is sometimes achieved by re-coding the mouth movements to match the dialogue in the new language. The [[Source engine]] automatically generates lip-sync data, making it easier for games to be localised.\n\nTo achieve synchronisation when animations are intended only for the source language, localised content is mostly recorded using techniques borrowed from movie dubbing (such as rythmo band) or, when images are not available, localised dubbing is done using source audios as a reference. Sound-synch is a method where localised audios are recorded matching the length and internal pauses of the source content.<!-- What does this last sentence mean? -->\n\nFor the European version of a video game, the on-screen text of the game is available in various languages and, in many cases, the dialogue is dubbed into each respective language, as well.\n\nThe North American version of any game is always available in [[English language|English]], with translated text and dubbed dialogue, if necessary, in other languages, especially if the North American version of the game contains the same data as the European version. Several Japanese games, such as those in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'', and ''[[Soul (series)|Soul]]'' series, are released with both the original Japanese audio and the English dub included.\n\n===Television===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nDubbing is occasionally used on [[network television]] broadcasts of films that contain dialogue that the network executives or [[Censorship|censors]] have decided to replace. This is usually done to remove [[profanity]]. In most cases, the original actor does not perform this duty, but an actor with a similar voice reads the changes. The results are sometimes seamless, but, in many cases, the voice of the replacement actor sounds nothing like the original performer, which becomes particularly noticeable when extensive dialogue must be replaced. Also, often easy to notice, is the sudden absence of background sounds in the movie during the dubbed dialogue. Among the films considered notorious for using substitute actors that sound very different from their theatrical counterparts are the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' and the ''[[Die Hard series|Die Hard]]'' film series, as shown on broadcasters such as [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]]. In the case of ''Smokey and the Bandit'', extensive dubbing was done for the first network airing on [[ABC Television]] in 1978, especially for [[Jackie Gleason]]'s character, [[Buford T. Justice]]. The dubbing of his phrase \"sombitch\" (son of a bitch) became \"scum bum,\" which became a catchphrase of the time.\n\nDubbing is commonly used in [[science fiction television]], as well. Sound generated by effects equipment such as [[Animatronics|animatronic]] puppets or by actors' movements on elaborate multi-level plywood sets (for example, starship bridges or other command centers) will quite often make the original character dialogue unusable. ''[[Stargate]]'' and ''[[Farscape]]'' are two prime examples where ADR is used heavily to produce usable audio.\n\nSince some anime series contain profanity, the studios recording the English dubs often re-record certain lines if a series or movie is going to be broadcast on [[Cartoon Network]], removing references to [[death]] and [[hell]] as well. Some companies will offer both an edited and an uncut version of the series on DVD, so that there is an edited script available in case the series is broadcast. Other companies also edit the full-length version of a series, meaning that even on the uncut DVD characters say things like \"Blast!\" and \"Darn!\" in place of the original dialogue's profanity. [[Bandai|Bandai Entertainment's]] English dub of ''[[G Gundam]]'' is infamous for this, among many other things, with such lines as \"Bartender, more milk\".\n\nDubbing has also been used for comedic purposes, replacing lines of dialogue to create comedies from footage that was originally another genre. Examples include the Australian shows ''[[The Late Show (1990s Australian TV series)#The Olden Days|The Olden Days]]'' and ''[[Bargearse]]'', re-dubbed from 1970s Australian drama and action series, respectively, the Irish show ''[[Soupy Norman]]'', re-dubbed from ''[[:pl:Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107|Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107]]'', a Polish soap opera, and ''[[Most Extreme Elimination Challenge]]'', a comedic dub of the Japanese show ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]''.\n\nDubbing into a foreign language does not always entail the deletion of the original language. In some countries, a performer may read the translated dialogue as a voice-over. This often occurs in [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], where \"lektories\" or \"lektors\" read the translated dialogue into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. In Poland, one announcer read all text. However, this is done almost exclusively for the television and home video markets, while theatrical releases are usually subtitled. Recently, however, the number of high-quality, fully dubbed films has increased, especially for children's movies. If a quality dubbed version exists for a film, it is shown in theaters. However, some films, such as ''[[Harry Potter]]'' or ''[[Star Wars]]'', are shown in both dubbed and subtitled versions, varying with the time of the show. Such films are also shown on TV (although some channels drop them and do standard one-narrator translation) and VHS/DVD. In other countries, like [[Vietnam]], the voice-over technique is also used for theatrical releases.<!-- This section and the next one are redundant. This material has already been covered and should be merged above. -->\n\nIn Russia, the reading of all lines by a single person is referred to as a [[Gavrilov translation]], and is generally found only in [[Copyright infringement|illegal copies]] of films and on [[cable television]]. Professional copies always include at least two actors of opposite gender translating the dialogue. Some titles in Poland have been dubbed this way, too, but this method lacks public appeal, so it is very rare now.\n\nOn special occasions, such as [[film festival]]s, live [[interpreting]] is often done by professionals.\n\n===Pornography===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nAs budgets for [[pornographic film]]s are often small, compared to films made by major studios, and there is an inherent need to film without interrupting filming, it is common for sex scenes to be over-dubbed. The audio for such over-dubbing is generally referred to as ''the Ms and Gs'', or ''the moans and groans.''\n\n==Dubbing into varieties==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\nIn the case of languages with large communities (such as [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or [[French language|French]]), a single translation may sound foreign to native speakers in a given region. Therefore, a film may be translated into a certain variety of a certain language. For example, the animated movie ''[[The Incredibles]]'' was translated to [[European Spanish]], [[Mexican Spanish]], [[Neutral Spanish]] (which is Mexican Spanish but avoids colloquialisms), and [[Rioplatense Spanish]] (although people from [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]] noticed a strong ''[[porte\u00f1o]]'' accent from most of the characters of the Rioplatense Spanish translation).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Spanish-speaking regions]], most media is dubbed twice: into European Spanish and Neutral Spanish.\n\nAnother example is the French dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which has two entirely different versions for [[Quebec]] and for [[France]]. The humor is very different for each audience (see [[Non-English versions of The Simpsons|Non-English versions of ''The Simpsons'']]). Audiences in Quebec are generally critical of France's dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which they often do not find amusing.\n\n[[Quebec French|Quebec-French]] dubbing of films is generally made in accent-free [[Standard French]], but may sound peculiar to audiences in France because of the persistence of some regionally-neutral expressions and because Quebec-French performers pronounce Anglo-Saxon names with an American accent, unlike French performers. Occasionally, budget restraints cause American [[direct-to-video]] films, such as the 1995 film ''When the Bullet Hits the Bone'', to be released in France with a Quebec-French dubbing, sometimes resulting in what some members of French audiences perceive as unintentional humor.\n\n[[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] also use different versions of dubbed films and series. Because dubbing has never been very popular in [[Portugal]], for decades, children's films were distributed using the higher-quality Brazilian dub (unlike children's TV series, which are traditionally dubbed in European Portuguese). Only in the 1990s did dubbing begin to gain popularity in Portugal. ''[[The Lion King]]'' became the first Disney feature film to be completely dubbed into [[European Portuguese]], and subsequently all major animation films gained European-Portuguese versions. In recent [[DVD]] releases, most Brazilian-Portuguese-dubbed classics were released with new European-Portuguese dubs, eliminating the predominance of Brazilian-Portuguese dubs in Portugal.\n\nSimilarly, in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking region of [[Flanders]], [[Belgium]], cartoons are often dubbed locally by [[Flemish]] artists{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} rather than using soundtracks produced in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nThe [[list of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking region]], which includes [[Germany]], [[Austria]], part of [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]], share a common German-dubbed version of films and shows. Although there are some differences in the three major German varieties, all films, shows, and series are dubbed into a single [[Standard German]] version that avoids regional variations in the German-speaking audience. Most voice actors are primarily German or Austrian. Switzerland, which has four official languages (German, French, [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Romansh language|Romansh]]), generally uses dubbed versions made in each respective country (except for Romansh). Liechtenstein uses German-dubbed versions only.\n\nSometimes, films are also dubbed into several [[German dialects]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ([[Berlinerisch]], [[Colognian language|K\u00f6lsch]], [[Saxonian]], [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Swiss German]]), especially animated films and Disney films. They are as an additional \"special feature\" to entice the audience into buying it. Popular animated films dubbed into German variety include ''[[Asterix]]'' films (in addition to its Standard German version, every film has a particular variety version), ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Shrek 2]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', (+ Austrian German){{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OBS_20090810_OBS0008 |title=\u00d6sterreich-Version von Disney/Pixars \"Oben\" mit Otto Schenk und Karlheinz B\u00f6hm - BILD |language=de |publisher=ots.at |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German).\n\nSome live-action films or TV-series have an additional German variety dubbing: ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' (German German, Austrian German, Swiss German); and ''[[Rehearsal for Murder]]'', ''[[Framed (TV series)|Framed]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776730&threaded=1&id=506508&message=6643629 |title=Allgemeines \" ORF-Synchronisationen - Wer wei\u00df was? |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German); ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[Serpico]]'', ''[[Rumpole]]'' (+ Austrian German), and ''[[The Thorn Birds]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776728&threaded=1&id=506269&message=7100872 |title=Serien \" 24 |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n(only Austrian German dubbing).\n\nBefore [[German reunification]], [[East Germany]] also made its own particular German version. For example, ''[[Olsen-banden|Olsen Gang]]'' and the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] animated series ''[[The M\u00e9zga Family]]'' were dubbed in [[West Germany]] as well as East Germany.\n\nUsually, there are two dubbings produced in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Serbian for [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]; Croatian for [[Croatia]] and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n\nWhile the voice actors involved usually bear the brunt of criticisms towards poor dubbing, other factors may include inaccurate script translation and poor [[Audio mixing (television and film)|audio mixing]]. Dialogue typically contains speech patterns and sentence structure that are natural to the original language but would appear awkward if translated literally. English dubs of Japanese animation, for example, must rewrite the dialogue so that it flows smoothly while following the natural pattern of English speech. On some occasions, voice actors record their dialogue individually instead of with the rest of the cast, and their performances can lack the dynamics gained from performing as a group.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMany [[martial arts]] movies from [[Hong Kong]] that were imported under the unofficial banner [[Kung Fu Theater]] were notorious{{according to whom|date=June 2019}} for seemingly careless dubbing that included poor lip sync and awkward dialogue. Since the results were frequently unintentionally humorous, it has become one of the hallmarks that endear these films to fans of the 1980s culture.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Dubbing (filmmaking)}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Maluf |first1=Ramez |title=Dubbing into Arabic: A Trojan Horse at the Gates? |url=http://inhouse.lau.edu.lb/bima/papers/Dubbing.pdf |accessdate=10 April 2011 |date=19 December 2003 |publisher=[[Lebanese American University]]}}\n*Di Fortunato E. e Paolinelli M.

When Chandra was asked to let his son incarnate himself on earth, he made a pact that his son will only remain on earth for 16 years, as he could not bear to be separated from him any longer than that. So, Chandra's son was born as the son of [[Arjuna]] and [[Subhadra]]. Abhimanyu was the youngest and 4th son of Arjuna. Abhimanyu was the most loved of all sons of the Pandavas, so much so that [[Draupadi]] was said to love him more than her own sons. Draupadi once said that if the Pandavas are not willing to wage war, then her sons led by Abhimanyu will attack and get justice for her. After the Virata war, King Virat offered princess [[Uttar\u0101 (Mahabharata)|Uttara]] to Arjuna in marriage. But Arjuna replied to Virat that he taught dance to Uttara, and a teacher could treat his/her student as a child, but not as a spouse.

Abhimanyu and Uttara were already in love as Abhimanyu already met Uttara while he was in search of his parents who were in exile. This was noticed by [[Draupadi]] and [[Yudhishtira]]. Convinced by them, Abhimanyu planned to leave Matsya kingdom. Because if Abhimanyu had identified his parents, their exile would have become waste and they would have supposed to go in exile for another 13 years. Just before this incident, [[Kichaka]] was killed by [[Bhima]]. Hearing about the death of Kichaka, Duryodhana surmises that the Pandavas were hiding in Matsya. A host of Kaurava warriors attacked Virata, presumably to steal their cattle, but in reality, desiring to pierce the Pandavas' veil of anonymity. Taking this as advantage, Susharma attacked Matsya kingdom. Full of bravado, Virata's son Uttar attempts to take on the army by himself while the rest of the Matsya army has been lured away to fight Susharma and the Trigartas. At the same time [[Draupadi]] was kidnapped by Kichaka's 100 brothers. [[Bhima]], [[Nakula]] & [[Sahadeva]] went in search of her. [[Yudhishtira]] suggested King Virat to stay in palace and defend the kingdom by sending soldiers of Matsya kingdom to battlefield. While Abhimanyu was leaving to [[Dv\u0101rak\u0101|Dwaraka]], Uttara asked Abhimanyu to help. Abhimanyu led the Matsya army and defeated Susharma. After defeating [[Susharma]], Abhimanyu promised Uttara that one day he would definitely visit Matsya kingdom after completion of their parents' exile. As suggested by Draupadi, Uttar takes Brihannala with him, as his charioteer. When he sees the Kaurava army, Uttar loses his nerve and attempts to flee. There, Arjuna reveals his identity and those of his brothers'. Switching places with Uttar, Arjuna takes up the Gandiva and Devadatta. Eager to defend the land that had given him refuge, Arjuna engaged the legion of Kaurava warriors. During the battle Arjuna faced great warriors like [[Karna]], [[Bhishma]] and the Kuru army, though he was not able to defeat them but he caused a certain distraction and created a opportunity for the Pandavas to flee away.\n\n==Kurukshethra war==\n[[File:Uttra Abhimanue.jpg|thumb|300px|Uttra and Abhimanyu]]\nOn the very first day, Abhimanyu faced legendary [[Bhishma]] and engaged in an archery duel with him. The battle was so intense that both of them were almost equal. Bhishma didn't want to kill his great grandson, so he didn't use celestial weapons. When Abhimanyu's arrows injured Bhishma, Bhishma asked Abhimanyu to get-out from his sight. Abhimanyu replied that he was son of [[Arjuna]] and the student of [[Krishna]]. If he would have escaped due to fear; it would become an insult to both of them. [[Bhishma]] felt proud on hearing this. Abhimanyu breaks [[Bhishma]]\u2019s bow. Then they involve in a sword duel just before the sunset. Bhishma appreciated Abhimanyu since Bhishma failed to defeat Abhimanyu. The very next day; Abhimanyu attacked [[Ashwatthama]] and drew [[Drona]]'s attention. [[Drona]] and [[Arjuna]] were involved in a fight. When Drona heard that his son was attacked by Abhimanyu, he immediately left that place and went to save his son. Drona and Abhimanyu soon engaged in an intense battle which made a clear way to [[Arjuna]] in assisting [[Bhima]] to reach [[Duryodhana]] and kill him. But their plans of killing Duryodhana and ending the war failed due to some reasons. Drona didn't wanted to hurt Abhimanyu so he held back his archery skills against him.\n\n==Thirteenth Day==\n[[File:Abhimanyu showing his talent in Battle.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Abhimanyu showing his talent in Battle]]\nThe Kaurava commander-in-chief [[Dronacharya]] planned to divert [[Arjuna]] and [[Krishna]] away to chase an army of the samsaptakhas whom Arjuna defeated that very day. The Kaurava army was grouped into the giant discus formation, which caused great loss for the Pandavas. If the formation continued till end of that day, the pandavas would have no army by sunset. The only two people on the Pandava army who completely knew about how to enter and break this formation were Arjuna and Krishna, who were away. Abhimanyu's story came to prominence when he entered the powerful [[Chakravyuha]] battle formation of the [[Kaurava]] army. Abhimanyu claimed that he could decimate the entire Kaurava army.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07034.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 7: Drona Parva: Abhimanyu-badha Parva: Section XXXIV|publisher=|access-date=16 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803194627/http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07034.htm|archive-date=3 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n \nAbhimanyu was trained in all types of warfare by Lord [[Krishna]] and [[Balrama]] themselves, and later by [[Pradyumna]] (Sri Krishna's son).

But he did not know how to destroy the formation once he was inside, as Subhadra fell asleep while listening to the story and (Abhimanyu in her womb) could learn only half of the technique. This is the reason why he was only able to enter and break but not come out of the Chakravyuha.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07031.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 7: Drona Parva: Abhimanyu-badha Parva: Section XXXI|publisher=|access-date=16 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801050231/http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07031.htm|archive-date=1 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n \nAs soon as Abhimanyu entered the formation, [[Jayadratha|Jayadrath]], the ruler of Sindh blocked the other Pandavas, so that Abhimanyu was left alone.

Inside the Chakravyuha, the trapped Abhimanyu went on a killing rampage, intending on carrying out the original strategy by himself and killing tens of thousands of [[Kaurava]] soldiers. Abhimanyu killed many prominent heroes including Duryodhana's son [[Laxman Kumara|Lakshmana]], Salya's son, younger brothers of [[Karna]] , and many advisers of [[Karna]], Rukmaratha, Kritavarma's son Matrikavata, Salya's brother, Shrutanjaya,\nAshavketu (From Magadha), Chandraketu, Mahavega, Suvarcha, Suryabhasa, Kalakeya (Shakuni's brother), Vasatiya, and rathas from the Brahma-Vasatiyas and Kekayas, King of Kosala - [[Brihadbala|King Brihadbala]], King of Amvashtas and his son. and many others.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nw7yZkx0M&t=442s</ref> Abhimanyu was defeated by Drona and Karna.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07038.htm|title=The Mahabharata, Book 7: Drona Parva: Abhimanyu-badha Parva: Section XXXIX|website=www.sacred-texts.com|access-date=2018-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411213140/http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07038.htm|archive-date=11 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> No Kaurava warrior could escape his arrows. Abhimanyu killed all the remaining foster brothers of [[Karna]] due to which [[Karna]] became angry but he held himself back because he knew that he could kill Abhimanyu easily which he didn't wanted to do, hence he only defeated him and broke his bow. Karna was rather interested in facing Arjuna and so he wasn't interested in killing Arjuna's son.[[Karna]] was against the idea of killing someone who is below his warrior standards,but Abhimanyu was a fearless warrior and he kept on challenging the opposition. Hence, a strategy was formed and a joint attack on Abhimanyu followed. On Duryodhana's advice, Karna broke Abhimanyu's bow with ease, Karna asked Duryodhana to leave Abhimanyu but Duryodhana rejected the thought and Karna was helpless because of his friendship with Duryodhana. Kripa killed his two chariot-drivers, and Kritavarma killed his horses; Abhimanyu took up a sword and a shield but these weapons were cut off by [[Drona]] and [[Ashwatthama]] (though in other versions of the story, the perpetrators change while the acts remain the same). Abhimanyu then took up a chariot-wheel and started fighting with it, but [[Kripa]] cut the wheel. In this way, many warriors attacked the sixteen year old Abhimanyu when he was unarmed. Abhimanyu's body was pierced by dozens of arrows. But Abhimanyu faced all of the Kaurava warriors and still managed to kill many enemy soldiers. At last all warriors at once stab Abhimanyu from all sides which leads to his death. In this way, Abhimanyu was killed by many warriors including [[Karna]], [[Duryodhana]], [[Vrishasena]], [[Banasena]], [[Ashwatthama]], [[Drona]], [[Shakuni]], [[Dushasana]], [[Kritavarma]], [[Shalya]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in the Mahabharata]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|tragic hero of the [[Hindu]] [[Indian epic poetry|epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]''}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=March 2020}}\n{{infobox character\n| image    = Avimanyu&#039;s farewell to Uttara.jpg\n| alt      = Abhimanyu\n| caption  = [[Uttar\u0101 (Mahabharata)|Uttara]] pleads to Abhimanyu as he leaves for the war\n| weapon             = [[Bow and arrow|Bow]] and Arrows\n| spouse   = [[Uttar\u0101 (Mahabharata)|Uttara]]\n| children = [[Parikshit]]\n| family   = [[Arjuna]] (Father)<br />[[Subhadra]] (Mother)\n}}\n\n'''Abhimanyu''' was a character of the ancient Indian epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.\n\n==Origin==\n\nAbhimanyu was the re-incarnation of son of the Moon-God ''[[Chandra]]''. When Chandra was asked to let his son incarnate himself on earth, he made a pact that his son will only remain on earth for 16 years, as he could not bear to be separated from him any longer than that. So, Chandra's son was born as the son of [[Arjuna]] and [[Subhadra]]. Abhimanyu was the youngest and 4th son of Arjuna. Abhimanyu was the most loved of all sons of the Pandavas, so much so that [[Draupadi]] was said to love him more than her own sons. Draupadi once said that if the Pandavas are not willing to wage war, then her sons led by Abhimanyu will attack and get justice for her. After the Virata war, King Virat offered princess [[Uttar\u0101 (Mahabharata)|Uttara]] to Arjuna in marriage. But Arjuna replied to Virat that he taught dance to Uttara, and a teacher could treat his/her student as a child, but not as a spouse. Arjuna accepted the offer instead by recommending to Virat that he could accept Uttara as daughter-in-law by marrying her with his son, Abhimanyu.

As of 2006 its members are located in [[London]], [[Manchester]] and Belfast.  The band's sound is characteristic of the British [[C86 (music)|C86]] movement with heavy use of jangling [[Rickenbacker]] [[12-string guitars]], airy female vocals and bright pop melodies.\n\n==Language of Flowers Mk1 (1992)==\nLanguage of Flowers Mk1 started out in 1992 when friends Colm McCrory ([[bass guitar]]) and Marc McCourt ([[guitar]]) hastily assembled a band with their friend Jeff Lynas on vocals to support the [[twee pop]] band [[Heavenly (British band)|Heavenly]] after they had booked them to play in Derry, Northern Ireland.

This is a moot where the students of the   host  institution actively participate  as  witnesses for the oral rounds.\n\n[[File:Trial Advocacy - North East Rounds - 2013.jpg|thumb|Surana & Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot Court Competition - North East India Rounds 2013 - Justice A C Upadyay, Justice Iqbal Ahmed Ansari, Justice P G Aggarwal]]\n\n{|\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Year'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Partner institutions'''\n|-\n| 2005||[[National Law Institute University|National Law Institute University, Bhopal]] (India-National round )\n|-\n| 2006 \u2013 2008 ||[[National University of Advanced Legal Studies|National University of Advanced Legal Studies, Kochi]] (India-National rounds )\n|-\n| 2009 - 2011||[[Panjab University, Chandigarh|University Institute of Legal Studies, Panjab University, Chandigarh]] (India North Rounds)\n|-\n| 2009  - continuing||[[National University of Advanced Legal Studies|National University of Advanced Legal Studies, Kochi]] (India-South rounds)\n|-\n| 2011 \u2013 2014||[[Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law|Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law, Patiala]] (India North Rounds)\n|-\n| 2012 \u2013 2014||[[National Law University and Judicial Academy, Assam|National Law University and Judicial Academy, Assam, Guwahati]] (India North East Rounds)\n|-\n| 2015 \u2013 continuing||[[National Law Institute University | National Law Institute University, Bhopal]] (India North Rounds)\n|-\n| 2014 \u2013 continuing||[[Bharti Vidyapeeth|New Law College, Bharti Vidyapeeth, Pune]] (India West Rounds)\n|}-\n{|\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''YEAR'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''NAME OF COMPETITION'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''WINNER'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''RUNNER'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''BEST INDIVIDUAL / STUDENT'''\n|-\n| 2005-2006||Surana & Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot Court Competition||NUALS, Cochin||Symbiosis Law College, Pune||Nimrat Gill, ILS Law College, Pune\n|-\n| 2006-2007||Surana & Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot Court Competition||NUALS, Kochi||NLU, Jodhpur||Mayur Khandeparkar, G L C, Mumbai\n|-\n| 2007-2008||Surana & Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot Court Competition||NLSIU, Bangalore||DES Law College, Pune||Ranbir L Chhabda, ILS Law College, Pune\n|-\n| 2008-2009||Surana & Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot Court Competition||Army Institute Of Law, Mohali||NALSAR, Hyderabad||Vaibhav Sharma, Army Institute Of Law, Mohali\n|-\n| 2009-2010||Surana & Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot Court Competition North Rounds||UILS, PURC, Ludhiana||NUALS, Kochi||Silky Avasthy, UILS, PURC, Ludhiana\n|-\n| 2009-2010||Surana & Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot Court Competition South Rounds||NALSAR, Hyderabad||UILS,Panjab University  Chandigarh||Pranshu Chaturvedi, UILS,Panjab University,  Chandigarh\n|-\n| 2010-2011||Surana & Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot Court Competition North Rounds||NLIU, Bhopal|| RGNUL-Punjab, Patiala||Deeksha Manchanda, NLIU, Bhopal\n|-\n| 2010-2011||Surana & Surana National Trial Advocacy Moot Court Competition South Rounds||ILS Law College, Pune||School Of Excellence In Law, Chennai||R.S.

However, as in all mosquito species, the [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] of the males in comparison to the females are noticeably bushier and contain auditory receptors to detect the characteristic whine of the female. The maxillary palps of the males are also longer than their proboscis, whereas the females\u2019 maxillary palps are much shorter. (This is typical for the males of the [[Culicinae]].) In addition, the tarsus of the hind legs of the males is more silvery. Tarsomere IV is roughly 75% silver in the males whereas the females\u2019 is only about 60% silver.\n\nThe other characteristics do not differentiate between sexes. A single silvery-white line of tight scales begins between the eyes and continues down the dorsal side of the thorax. This characteristic marking is the easiest and surest way to identify the Asian tiger mosquito.\n\nThe proboscis is dark colored, the upper surface of the end segment of the palps is covered in silvery scales, and the [[Labium (insect mouthpart)|labium]] does not feature a light line on its underside. The [[compound eyes]] are distinctly separated from one another. The [[scute]], the dorsal portion of an insect's thoracic segment, is black alongside the characteristic white midline. On the side of the thorax, the [[Scutellum (insect)|scutellum]], and the abdomen are numerous spots covered in white-silvery scales.\n\nSuch white-silvery scales can also be found on the tarsus, particularly on the hind legs that are commonly suspended in the air. The bases of tarsomeres I through IV have a ring of white scales, creating the appearance of white and black rings. On the fore legs and middle legs, only the first three tarsomeres have the ring of white scales, whereas tarsomere V on the hind legs is completely white. The femur of each leg is also black with white scales on the end of the \u201cknee\u201d. The femora of the middle legs do not feature a silver line on the base of the upper side, whereas, the femora on the hind legs have short white lines on base of the upper side. The [[tibia]]e are black on the base and have no white scales.\n\nThe [[terga]] on segments II through VI of the abdomen are dark and have an almost triangular silvery-white marking on the base that is not aligned with the silvery bands of scales on the ventral side of the abdomen. The triangular marking and the silvery band are only aligned on abdominal segment VII. The transparent wings have white spots on the base of the costae. With older mosquito specimens, the scales could be partially worn off, making these characteristics not stand out as much.<ref name=Huang/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe typical ''Ae. albopictus'' individual has a length around 2 to 10&nbsp;mm.<ref name=Walker>{{cite web |author =Walker, K. |title=Asian Tiger Mosquito (''Aedes albopictus'') |work=Pest and Diseases Image Library |date=22 December 2007 |url=http://www.padil.gov.au/viewPestDiagnosticImages.aspx?id=83 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321061306/http://www.padil.gov.au/viewPestDiagnosticImages.aspx?id=83 |archivedate=21 March 2009}}</ref> As with other members of the mosquito family, the female is equipped with an elongated proboscis that she uses to collect blood to feed her eggs. The Asian tiger mosquito has a rapid bite that allows it to escape most attempts by people to swat it. By contrast, the male member of the species primarily feeds on [[nectar]].\n\nThe female lays her eggs near water, not directly into it as other mosquitoes do, but typically near a [[stagnant (water)|stagnant]] pool. However, any open container containing water will suffice for larvae development, even with less than an ounce (30 ml) of water. It can also breed in running water, so stagnant pools of water are not its only breeding sites. It is more likely to lay eggs in water sources near flowers than in water sources without flowers. It has a short flight range (less than 200&nbsp;m), so breeding sites are likely to be close to where this mosquito is found.<ref>Nishida, G. M. and Tenorio, J. M. (1993) What Bit Me?

In North and South America, ''Ae. albopictus'' can be distinguished from  ''[[Aedes taeniorhynchus]]'' since only ''Ae. albopictus'' has back markings.\n\nIn Europe, the mosquito ''[[Culiseta annulata]]'', which is very common, but does not occur in high densities, can be mistaken for an Asian tiger mosquito because of its black-and-white-ringed legs. However, this species is missing the distinctive white line that runs from the middle of its head and down the thorax. It is also considerably larger than ''Ae. albopictus'', is not black and white, but rather beige and grey striped, and has wings with noticeable veins and four dark, indistinct spots. The Tree Whole mosquito or [[Aedes geniculatus]] - a native to Europe and North Africa- has also been mistaken for ''Ae. albopictus.'' This is because the Tree Whole mosquito has very white scales on a very similar body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mosquito-surveillance/distinguishing-aedes-albopictus-the-asian-tiger-mosquito-from-native-british-mosquitoes|title=Distinguishing Aedes albopictus, the Asian Tiger mosquito, from native British mosquitoes|website=GOV.UK|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref>\n\nIn the eastern Mediterranean area, ''Ae. albopictus'' species can be mistaken for ''[[Aedes cretinus]]'', which also belongs to the subgenus ''Stegomyia'' and uses similar breeding waters. ''Aedes cretinus'' also has a white stripe on the [[scute]], but it ends shortly before the abdomen, and also has two additional stripes to the left and right of the middle stripe. So far ''Aedes cretinus'' is only located in Cyprus, Greece, Macedonia, Georgia and Turkey.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lane, J. |year=1982 |title=''Aedes (Stegomyia) cretinus'' Edwards 1921 (Diptera: Culicidae) |journal=Mosquito Systematics |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=81\u201384 |url=http://www.mosquitocatalog.org/files/pdfs/MS14N02P081.PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021141816/http://www.mosquitocatalog.org/files/pdfs/MS14N02P081.PDF |archivedate=21 October 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nIn Asia, the Asian tiger mosquito can be mistaken for other members of the subgenus ''Stegomyia'', particularly the yellow fever mosquito ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' (the most prevalent species in the tropics and subtropics), because both species display a similar black and white pattern.

Apart from that, they feed on nectar and other sweet plant juices just as the males do. In regards to [[Host (biology)|host]] location, [[carbon dioxide]] and organic substances produced from the host, humidity, and optical recognition play important roles.\n\nThe search for a host takes place in two phases. First, the mosquito exhibits a nonspecific searching behavior until it perceives host stimulants, whereupon it secondly takes a targeted approach.<ref name=Estrada>Estrada-Franco, R.G. and Craig, G.B. (1995) [http://www.dpi.inpe.br/geocxnets/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:estrada-franco_and_craig_1995_paho_42_1-49.pdf Biology, disease relationship and control of Aedes albopictus].

Depending upon region and biotype, activity peaks differ, but for the most part, they rest during the morning and night hours. They search for their hosts inside and outside of human dwellings, but are particularly active outside. The size of the blood meal depends upon the size of the mosquito, but it is usually around 2 \u03bcl. Their bites are not necessarily painful, but they are more noticeable than those from other kinds of mosquitoes. Tiger mosquitoes generally tend to bite a human host more than once if they are able to.<ref name=Estrada/><ref name=Hawley>{{cite journal|author =Hawley, W.

Their blood meal is often broken off before enough blood has been ingested for the development of their eggs, so Asian tiger mosquitoes bite multiple hosts during their development cycle of the egg, making them particularly efficient at transmitting diseases. The mannerism of biting diverse host species enables the Asian tiger mosquito to be a potential bridge vector for certain [[pathogens]] that can jump species boundaries, for example the [[West Nile virus]].\n\n===Natural enemies===\nPrimarily, other mosquito larvae, [[flatworm]]s, swimming beetles, [[fungi]], [[ciliate]]s, [[paramecium|paramecia]], [[protozoan]]s which act as parasites, predatory [[copepod]]s, and spiders are natural enemies of the larval stage of Asian tiger mosquitoes.\n\n[[File:Toxorhynchites speciosus 01 L.D..jpg|thumb|''[[Toxorhynchites speciosus]]'' larvae (an adult is shown here) feed on the [[larva]]e of ''Aedes albopictus''.]]\n''[[Toxorhynchites]]'' larvae, a mosquito genus that does not suck blood, feeds upon other mosquito larvae and are often found with tiger mosquito larvae. Flatworms and small swimming beetles are considered natural predators.<ref name=Hawley/>\n\nFungi from the genus ''Coelomomyces'' (order [[Blastocladiales]]) develop inside the visceral cavity of mosquito larvae.

Infected adults are generally smaller than non-infected adults and have an insignificantly higher mortality rate; therefore, food supply and larval density apparently play a role. In competitive situations, an infection with sporozoans can also reduce the biological fitness of other uninfected mosquitoes. However, the use of the parasites as an effective biological remedy to control mosquito populations is implausible because the host must reach the adult stage for the transmission of the parasites.<ref>{{cite journal|author =Tseng, M. |year=2007|title= Ascogregarine parasites as possible biocontrol agents of mosquitoes|pmid=17853595|volume=23|issue=2 Suppl| pages=30\u20134| journal=Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association| doi=10.2987/8756-971x(2007)23[30:apapba]2.0.co;2}}</ref>\n\nThough they do not commonly occur in the natural habitats of Asian tiger mosquitoes, predatory [[copepods]] from the family Cyclopidae seem to willingly feed on them given the opportunity.<ref name=Hawley/> Relatives of different genera could therefore present a possibility in the control of tiger mosquitoes.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Marten, G.

Although little is known about why cytoplasmic incompatibility exists,  ''Wolbachia'' infection creates a fitness advantage for infected females, as they can mate with either infected or uninfected males. Despite this, infected males cannot reproduce with uninfected females. Therefore, over time, a population exposed to ''Wolbachia''  transitions from a few infected individuals to all individuals becoming infected, as the males that cannot reproduce successfully do not contribute to future generations.  This is called population replacement, where the population's overall genotype is replaced by a new genotype.

Such plans consist of different activities that include entomological surveillance, larvicide treatments in public and private areas, information campaigns, and treatments against adult mosquitoes in the zones affected by suspected cases of transmissible viroses.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Cost of Arbovirus Disease Prevention in Europe: Area-Wide Integrated Control of Tiger Mosquito, \"Aedes albopictus\", in Emilia-Romagna, Northern Italy|pmid=28425959|year=2017|last1=Canali|first1=M|last2=Rivas Morales|first2=S|last3=Beutels|first3=P|last4=Venturelli|first4=C|volume=14|issue=4|pages=444|doi=10.3390/ijerph14040444|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|pmc=5409644}}</ref>\n\nEfficient monitoring or surveillance is essential to prevent the spread and establishment of this species.

Puddles that last more than three days, sagging or plugged roof gutters, old tires holding water, litter, and any other possible containers or pools of standing water should be drained or removed. Bird baths, inlets to sewers and drainage systems holding stagnant water, flower pots, standing flower vases, knotholes, and other crevices that can collect water should be filled with sand or fine gravel to prevent mosquitoes from laying their eggs in them.\n\nAny standing water in pools, catchment basins, etc., that cannot be drained, or dumped, can be periodically treated with properly labeled insecticides or ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis]]'' (Bti), often formed into doughnut-shaped \"mosquito dunks\". Bti produces toxins which are effective in killing larvae of mosquitoes and certain other [[diptera]]ns, while having almost no effect on other organisms. Bti preparations are readily available at farm, garden, and pool suppliers.\n\nFlowing water will not be a breeding spot, and water that contains [[minnow]]s is not usually a problem, because the fish eat the mosquito larvae. [[Dragonfly|Dragonflies]] are also an excellent method of imposing control. Dragonfly larvae eat mosquito larvae in the water, and adults snatch adult mosquitoes as they fly.\n\nIn any case, an efficient surveillance is essential to monitor the presence of tiger mosquitoes and the effect of control programs. [[Ovitrap]]s are normally used for the monitoring of ''Ae. albopictus''. They are black water containers with floating Styrofoam blocks or small wooden paddles that are in contact with the surface of the water. Female tiger mosquitoes lay their eggs on these surfaces. Through the identification of these eggs or of the larvae that hatch from these eggs in the laboratory, the presence and abundance of mosquito species can be estimated. Versions of these traps with an adhesive film (sticky traps) that catch the egg-depositing mosquitoes make the analysis much easier and quicker, but are more complicated in terms of handling.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Development of a novel sticky trap for container-breeding mosquitoes and evaluation of its sampling properties to monitor urban populations of ''Aedes albopictus''|pmid=17550438|year=2007| last1=Facchinelli| first1=L|last2=Valerio|first2=L|last3=Pombi|first3=M|last4=Reiter|first4=P|last5=Costantini|first5=C|last6=Della Torre|first6=A|volume=21|issue=2|pages=183\u201395| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2915.2007.00680.x| journal=Medical and Veterinary Entomology }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of the sticky MosquiTRAP for detecting ''Aedes'' (''Stegomyia'') ''aegypti'' (L.)

Those traps that catch other species of mosquitoes do not catch tiger mosquitoes efficiently. A form of an [[ovitrap]] called a [[lethal ovitrap]] mimics the breeding site for ''Ae. albopictus'' just like the monitoring tool, but it has the added benefit of contained chemicals that are toxic to the mosquitoes when they enter, but do not harm humans.

However, as in all mosquito species, the [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] of the males in comparison to the females are noticeably bushier and contain auditory receptors to detect the characteristic whine of the female. The maxillary palps of the males are also longer than their proboscis, whereas the females\u2019 maxillary palps are much shorter. (This is typical for the males of the [[Culicinae]].) In addition, the tarsus of the hind legs of the males is more silvery. Tarsomere IV is roughly 75% silver in the males whereas the females\u2019 is only about 60% silver.\n\nThe other characteristics do not differentiate between sexes. A single silvery-white line of tight scales begins between the eyes and continues down the dorsal side of the thorax. This characteristic marking is the easiest and surest way to identify the Asian tiger mosquito.\n\nThe proboscis is dark colored, the upper surface of the end segment of the palps is covered in silvery scales, and the [[Labium (insect mouthpart)|labium]] does not feature a light line on its underside. The [[compound eyes]] are distinctly separated from one another. The [[scute]], the dorsal portion of an insect\u2019s thoracic segment, is black alongside the characteristic white midline. On the side of the thorax, the [[Scutellum (insect)|scutellum]], and the abdomen are numerous spots covered in white-silvery scales.\n\nSuch white-silvery scales can also be found on the tarsus, particularly on the hind legs that are commonly suspended in the air. The bases of tarsomeres I through IV have a ring of white scales, creating the appearance of white and black rings. On the fore legs and middle legs, only the first three tarsomeres have the ring of white scales, whereas tarsomere V on the hind legs is completely white. The femur of each leg is also black with white scales on the end of the \u201cknee\u201d. The femora of the middle legs do not feature a silver line on the base of the upper side, whereas, the femora on the hind legs have short white lines on base of the upper side.

The Asian tiger mosquito has a rapid bite that allows it to escape most attempts by people to swat it. By contrast, the male member of the species primarily feeds on [[nectar]].\n\nThe female lays her eggs near water, not directly into it as other mosquitoes do, but typically near a [[stagnant (water)|stagnant]] pool. However, any open container containing water will suffice for larvae development, even with less than an ounce (30 ml) of water. It can also breed in running water, so stagnant pools of water are not its only breeding sites. It is more likely to lay eggs in water sources near flowers than in water sources without flowers. It has a short flight range (less than 200&nbsp;m), so breeding sites are likely to be close to where this mosquito is found.<ref>Nishida, G. M. and Tenorio, J. M. (1993) What Bit Me?

In North and South America, ''Ae. albopictus'' can be distinguished from  ''[[Aedes taeniorhynchus]]'' since only ''Ae. albopictus'' has back markings.\n\nIn Europe, the mosquito ''[[Culiseta annulata]]'', which is very common, but does not occur in high densities, can be mistaken for an Asian tiger mosquito because of its black-and-white-ringed legs. However, this species is missing the distinctive white line that runs from the middle of its head and down the thorax. It is also considerably larger than ''Ae. albopictus'', is not black and white, but rather beige and grey striped, and has wings with noticeable veins and four dark, indistinct spots. The Tree Whole mosquito or [[Aedes geniculatus]] - a native to Europe and North Africa- has also been mistaken for ''Ae. albopictus.'' This is because the Tree Whole mosquito has very white scales on a very similar body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mosquito-surveillance/distinguishing-aedes-albopictus-the-asian-tiger-mosquito-from-native-british-mosquitoes|title=Distinguishing Aedes albopictus, the Asian Tiger mosquito, from native British mosquitoes|website=GOV.UK|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref>\n\nIn the eastern Mediterranean area, ''Ae. albopictus'' species can be mistaken for ''[[Aedes cretinus]]'', which also belongs to the subgenus ''Stegomyia'' and uses similar breeding waters. ''Aedes cretinus'' also has a white stripe on the [[scute]], but it ends shortly before the abdomen, and also has two additional stripes to the left and right of the middle stripe. So far ''Aedes cretinus'' is only located in Cyprus, Greece, Macedonia, Georgia and Turkey.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lane, J. |year=1982 |title=''Aedes (Stegomyia) cretinus'' Edwards 1921 (Diptera: Culicidae) |journal=Mosquito Systematics |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=81\u201384 |url=http://www.mosquitocatalog.org/files/pdfs/MS14N02P081.PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021141816/http://www.mosquitocatalog.org/files/pdfs/MS14N02P081.PDF |archivedate=21 October 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nIn Asia, the Asian tiger mosquito can be mistaken for other members of the subgenus ''Stegomyia'', particularly the yellow fever mosquito ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' (the most prevalent species in the tropics and subtropics), because both species display a similar black and white pattern.

Apart from that, they feed on nectar and other sweet plant juices just as the males do. In regards to [[Host (biology)|host]] location, [[carbon dioxide]] and organic substances produced from the host, humidity, and optical recognition play important roles.\n\nThe search for a host takes place in two phases. First, the mosquito exhibits a nonspecific searching behavior until it perceives host stimulants, whereupon it secondly takes a targeted approach.<ref name=Estrada>Estrada-Franco, R.G. and Craig, G.B. (1995) [http://www.dpi.inpe.br/geocxnets/wiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:estrada-franco_and_craig_1995_paho_42_1-49.pdf Biology, disease relationship and control of Aedes albopictus].

Depending upon region and biotype, activity peaks differ, but for the most part, they rest during the morning and night hours. They search for their hosts inside and outside of human dwellings, but are particularly active outside. The size of the blood meal depends upon the size of the mosquito, but it is usually around 2 \u03bcl. Their bites are not necessarily painful, but they are more noticeable than those from other kinds of mosquitoes. Tiger mosquitoes generally tend to bite a human host more than once if they are able to.<ref name=Estrada/><ref name=Hawley>{{cite journal|author =Hawley, W. A. |year=1988|title=The biology of ''Aedes albopictus''|journal=J Am Mosq Control Assoc |pages= 2\u201339|pmid=3068349|volume=1}}</ref>\n\n''Ae. albopictus'' also bites other [[mammals]] besides humans, as well as birds.<ref name=Estrada/><ref name=Hawley/> The females are always on the search for a host and are persistent but cautious when it comes to their blood meal and host location. Their blood meal is often broken off before enough blood has been ingested for the development of their eggs, so Asian tiger mosquitoes bite multiple hosts during their development cycle of the egg, making them particularly efficient at transmitting diseases. The mannerism of biting diverse host species enables the Asian tiger mosquito to be a potential bridge vector for certain [[pathogens]] that can jump species boundaries, for example the [[West Nile virus]].\n\n===Natural enemies===\nPrimarily, other mosquito larvae, [[flatworm]]s, swimming beetles, [[fungi]], [[ciliate]]s, [[paramecium|paramecia]], [[protozoan]]s which act as parasites, predatory [[copepod]]s, and spiders are natural enemies of the larval stage of Asian tiger mosquitoes.\n\n[[File:Toxorhynchites speciosus 01 L.D..jpg|thumb|''[[Toxorhynchites speciosus]]'' larvae (an adult is shown here) feed on the [[larva]]e of ''Aedes albopictus''.]]\n''[[Toxorhynchites]]'' larvae, a mosquito genus that does not suck blood, feeds upon other mosquito larvae and are often found with tiger mosquito larvae. Flatworms and small swimming beetles are considered natural predators.<ref name=Hawley/>\n\nFungi from the genus ''Coelomomyces'' (order [[Blastocladiales]]) develop inside the visceral cavity of mosquito larvae. The species ''[[Coelomomyces stegomyiae]]'' was first found on the Asian tiger mosquito.<ref name=Hawley/>\n\n[[Paramecium|Paramecia]], or ciliates, can also affect ''Ae. albopictus'' larvae, and the first detected species was ''[[Lambornella stegomyiae]]'' (Hymenostomatida: Tetrahymenidae).<ref name=Hawley/> The virulence, mortality rate, and subsequent possibilities of ''Lambornella'' being implemented as a biological remedy to control ''Ae. albopictus'', however, has conflicting views.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Arshad, H.

The species ''[[Ascogregarina taiwanensis]]'' was found in Asian tiger mosquitoes.<ref name=Hawley/> When the adult mosquitoes emerge from their pupal case, they leave the infectious intermediary stage of parasites in the water and close off the infection cycle. Infected adults are generally smaller than non-infected adults and have an insignificantly higher mortality rate; therefore, food supply and larval density apparently play a role. In competitive situations, an infection with sporozoans can also reduce the biological fitness of other uninfected mosquitoes. However, the use of the parasites as an effective biological remedy to control mosquito populations is implausible because the host must reach the adult stage for the transmission of the parasites.<ref>{{cite journal|author =Tseng, M. |year=2007|title= Ascogregarine parasites as possible biocontrol agents of mosquitoes|pmid=17853595|volume=23|issue=2 Suppl| pages=30\u20134| journal=Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association| doi=10.2987/8756-971x(2007)23[30:apapba]2.0.co;2}}</ref>\n\nThough they do not commonly occur in the natural habitats of Asian tiger mosquitoes, predatory [[copepods]] from the family Cyclopidae seem to willingly feed on them given the opportunity.<ref name=Hawley/> Relatives of different genera could therefore present a possibility in the control of tiger mosquitoes.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Marten, G.

Although little is known about why cytoplasmic incompatibility exists,  ''Wolbachia'' infection creates a fitness advantage for infected females, as they can mate with either infected or uninfected males. Despite this, infected males cannot reproduce with uninfected females. Therefore, over time, a population exposed to ''Wolbachia''  transitions from a few infected individuals to all individuals becoming infected, as the males that cannot reproduce successfully do not contribute to future generations.  This is called population replacement, where the population\u2019s overall genotype is replaced by a new genotype.

Such plans consist of different activities that include entomological surveillance, larvicide treatments in public and private areas, information campaigns, and treatments against adult mosquitoes in the zones affected by suspected cases of transmissible viroses.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Cost of Arbovirus Disease Prevention in Europe: Area-Wide Integrated Control of Tiger Mosquito, \"Aedes albopictus\", in Emilia-Romagna, Northern Italy|pmid=28425959|year=2017|last1=Canali|first1=M|last2=Rivas Morales|first2=S|last3=Beutels|first3=P|last4=Venturelli|first4=C|volume=14|issue=4|pages=444|doi=10.3390/ijerph14040444|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|pmc=5409644}}</ref>\n\nEfficient monitoring or surveillance is essential to prevent the spread and establishment of this species.

Puddles that last more than three days, sagging or plugged roof gutters, old tires holding water, litter, and any other possible containers or pools of standing water should be drained or removed. Bird baths, inlets to sewers and drainage systems holding stagnant water, flower pots, standing flower vases, knotholes, and other crevices that can collect water should be filled with sand or fine gravel to prevent mosquitoes from laying their eggs in them.\n\nAny standing water in pools, catchment basins, etc., that cannot be drained, or dumped, can be periodically treated with properly labeled insecticides or ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis]]'' (Bti), often formed into doughnut-shaped \"mosquito dunks\". Bti produces toxins which are effective in killing larvae of mosquitoes and certain other [[diptera]]ns, while having almost no effect on other organisms. Bti preparations are readily available at farm, garden, and pool suppliers.\n\nFlowing water will not be a breeding spot, and water that contains [[minnow]]s is not usually a problem, because the fish eat the mosquito larvae. [[Dragonfly|Dragonflies]] are also an excellent method of imposing control. Dragonfly larvae eat mosquito larvae in the water, and adults snatch adult mosquitoes as they fly.\n\nIn any case, an efficient surveillance is essential to monitor the presence of tiger mosquitoes and the effect of control programs. [[Ovitrap]]s are normally used for the monitoring of ''Ae. albopictus''. They are black water containers with floating Styrofoam blocks or small wooden paddles that are in contact with the surface of the water. Female tiger mosquitoes lay their eggs on these surfaces. Through the identification of these eggs or of the larvae that hatch from these eggs in the laboratory, the presence and abundance of mosquito species can be estimated. Versions of these traps with an adhesive film (sticky traps) that catch the egg-depositing mosquitoes make the analysis much easier and quicker, but are more complicated in terms of handling.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Development of a novel sticky trap for container-breeding mosquitoes and evaluation of its sampling properties to monitor urban populations of ''Aedes albopictus''|pmid=17550438|year=2007| last1=Facchinelli| first1=L|last2=Valerio|first2=L|last3=Pombi|first3=M|last4=Reiter|first4=P|last5=Costantini|first5=C|last6=Della Torre|first6=A|volume=21|issue=2|pages=183\u201395| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2915.2007.00680.x| journal=Medical and Veterinary Entomology }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of the sticky MosquiTRAP for detecting ''Aedes'' (''Stegomyia'') ''aegypti'' (L.)

Due to this, it is best to use them in large numbers and in conjunction with other monitoring methods.\n\nTo date, few effective traps for adult Asian tiger mosquitoes are available. Those traps that catch other species of mosquitoes do not catch tiger mosquitoes efficiently. A form of an [[ovitrap]] called a [[lethal ovitrap]] mimics the breeding site for ''Ae. albopictus'' just like the monitoring tool, but it has the added benefit of contained chemicals that are toxic to the mosquitoes when they enter, but do not harm humans. These traps have had success in some countries to control ''Aedes'' mosquito populations.<ref>Zeichner, Brian C. 2011 The lethal ovitrap: a response to the resurgence of dengue and chikungunya The Free Library (July, 1), http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The lethal ovitrap: a response to the resurgence of dengue and...-a0267030676 (accessed February 27, 2014)</ref> A new trap type has now been shown to catch significant numbers of ''Ae. albopictus''.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wilhelmine H.

With the addition of [[carbon dioxide]], the efficacy of the trap is increased. This means a suitable tool is available for trapping adult tiger mosquitoes, and for example, examining the existence of viruses in the trapped mosquitoes. Previously, the mosquitoes had to be collected from volunteers to be studied, which is ethically questionable, especially during epidemics. Recent research also indicates this trap type may also have a use as a control tool; in a study in Cesena, Italy, the number of biting tiger mosquitoes was reduced in places where traps were installed.<ref>Engelbrecht et al.

This could lead to many more discoveries in disease control for ''Ae. albopictus'' and other mosquito species.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, due to the cytoplasmic incompatibility caused by ''Wolbachia'',  the artificial infection of males can serve as a biological control as they are unable to reproduce successfully with uninfected females (unidirectional CI).<ref name=\"pnas.org\"/> When artificially infected males are unable to reproduce, the population size can be controlled, thereby reducing the transmission of the harmful disease of interest. Artificial infection of males is achieved by the removal of cytoplasm from infected oocytes, which is then transferred into embryos prior to the blastoderm stage.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Anosike | first1 = Jude C. | last2 = Nwoke | first2 = Bertram E. | last3 = Okere | first3 = Anthony N. | last4 = Oku | first4 = Ene E. | last5 = Asor | first5 = Joe E. | last6 = Emmy-Egbe | first6 = Ifeyinwa O. | last7 = Adimike | first7 = Desmond A. | year = 2007 | title = Epidemiology of tree-hole breeding mosquitoes in the tropical rainforest of Imo State, south-east Nigeria | url = http://www.aaem.pl/pdf/1431.pdf | journal = Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 31\u201338 | access-date = 5 September 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926061005/http://www.aaem.pl/pdf/1431.pdf | archive-date = 26 September 2007 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all | pmid = 17655174 }}\n* [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) (2007): [https://www.cdc.gov/Ncidod/dvbid/arbor/albopic_new.htm Information on ''Aedes albopictus''].

They named it Jones County after [[John Paul Jones]], the early American Naval hero who rose from humble Scottish origin to military success during the American Revolution.<ref>[http://www.jonescountyms.com Jones County Mississippi Official Site]</ref>\n\n[[Ellisville, Mississippi|Ellisville]], the county seat, was named for [[Powhatan Ellis]], a member of the Mississippi Legislature who claimed to be a direct descendant of [[Pocahontas]]. During the economic hard times in the 1830s and 1840s, there was an exodus of population from Southeast Mississippi, both to western Mississippi and Louisiana in regions opened to white settlement after [[Indian Removal]], and to [[Texas]]. The slogan \"GTT\" (\"Gone to Texas\") became widely used.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nJones County was in an area of mostly yeomen farmers and lumbermen, as the pine forests, swamp and soil were not easily cultivated for cotton. In 1860, the majority of white residents were not slaveholders. Slaves made up only 12% of the total population in Jones County in 1860, the smallest percentage of any county in the state.<ref name=\"mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov/articles/309/newton-knight-and-the-legend-of-the-free-state-of-jones |title=Newton Knight and the Legend of the Free State of Jones |last=Kelly |first=James R., Jr. |series=Mississippi History Now |date=April 2009 |website=mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov |publisher=[[Mississippi Historical Society]] |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223072459/http://mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov/articles/309/newton-knight-and-the-legend-of-the-free-state-of-jones |archivedate=December 23, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Civil War years===\nSoon after the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as United States president in November 1860, slave-owning planters led Mississippi to join South Carolina and secede from the Union in January 1861. These were the two states with the largest holdings of slaves. Other Southern states would follow suit.\n\nAs Mississippi debated the secession question, the inhabitants of Jones County voted overwhelmingly for the anti-secessionist John Hathorne Powell, Jr. In comparison to the pro-secessionist J.M. Bayliss, who received 24 votes, Powell received 374.<ref name=\"Leverett, Rudy H. 1984, pages 38-41\">Leverett, Rudy H., ''Legend of the Free State of Jones'', University Press of Mississippi, 1984, pp. 38-41.</ref> But, at the Secession Convention, Powell voted for secession. Legend has it that, for his vote, he was burned in effigy in Ellisville, the county seat.<ref name=\"Leverett, Rudy H. 1984, pages 38-41\"/>\n\nThe reality is more complicated. The only choices possible at the Secession Convention were voting for immediate secession on the one hand, or for a more cautious, co-operative approach to secession among several Southern states on the other. Powell almost certainly voted for the more conservative approach to secession\u2014the only position available to him that was consistent with the anti-secessionist views of his constituency.<ref name=\"Leverett, Rudy H. 1984, pages 38-41\"/>\n\n[[Mississippi's Declaration of Secession]] reflected planters' interests in its first sentence: \"Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]\u2026\" Jones County had mostly yeoman farmers and cattle herders, who were not slaveholders and had little use for a war over a \"[[States' rights|state's right]]\".\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Jones County and neighboring counties, especially [[Covington County, Mississippi|Covington County]] to its west, became a haven for Confederate deserters.<ref name=\"mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov\"/> A number of factors prompted desertions. The lack of food and supplies was demoralizing, while reports of poor conditions back home made the men fear for their families' survival. Small farms deteriorated from neglect as women and children struggled to keep them up. Their limited stores and livestock were often taken by the [[Confederate tax-in-kind]] agents, who took excessive amounts of yeoman farmers' goods. Many residents and soldiers were also outraged over the Confederate government's passing of the [[Twenty Negro Law]], allowing wealthy plantation owners to avoid military service if they owned twenty slaves or more.<ref name=\"mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov\"/> The Confederate government figured such planters were needed at home to keep the slaves in line and keep up cotton production, which still produced revenue for the government.\n\n==== Free State of Jones ====\n{{redirect|Free State of Jones|the film|Free State of Jones (film)}}\nOn October 13, 1863, a band of deserters from Jones County and adjacent counties organized to protect the area from Confederate authorities and the crippling tax collections.<ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780385525930.html \"The State of Jones,\" co-authored with Sally Jenkins, New York: Doubleday, 2009, page 378]</ref> The company, led by [[Newton Knight]], formed a separate government, with [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionist]] leanings, known as the \"Free State of Jones\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/6-unionist-strongholds-in-the-south-during-the-civil-war |title=6 Southern Unionist Strongholds During the Civil War |date=2015-01-13 |author= Evan Andrews |website=History Channel |accessdate=2017-04-05}}</ref> and fought a recorded 14 skirmishes with Confederate forces.

While there have been numerous attempts to study Knight and his followers, the lack of documentation during and after the war has made him an elusive figure. The rebellion in Jones County has been variously characterized as consisting of local skirmishes to being a full-fledged war of independence.

They named it Jones County after [[John Paul Jones]], the early American Naval hero who rose from humble Scottish origin to military success during the American Revolution.<ref>[http://www.jonescountyms.com Jones County Mississippi Official Site]</ref>\n\n[[Ellisville, Mississippi|Ellisville]], the county seat, was named for [[Powhatan Ellis]], a member of the Mississippi Legislature who claimed to be a direct descendant of [[Pocahontas]]. During the economic hard times in the 1830s and 1840s, there was an exodus of population from Southeast Mississippi, both to western Mississippi and Louisiana in regions opened to white settlement after [[Indian Removal]], and to [[Texas]]. The slogan \"GTT\" (\"Gone to Texas\") became widely used.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nJones County was in an area of mostly yeomen farmers and lumbermen, as the pine forests, swamp and soil were not easily cultivated for cotton. In 1860, the majority of white residents were not slaveholders. Slaves made up only 12% of the total population in Jones County in 1860, the smallest percentage of any county in the state.<ref name=\"mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov/articles/309/newton-knight-and-the-legend-of-the-free-state-of-jones |title=Newton Knight and the Legend of the Free State of Jones |last=Kelly |first=James R., Jr. |series=Mississippi History Now |date=April 2009 |website=mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov |publisher=[[Mississippi Historical Society]] |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223072459/http://mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov/articles/309/newton-knight-and-the-legend-of-the-free-state-of-jones |archivedate=December 23, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Civil War years===\nSoon after the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as United States president in November 1860, slave-owning planters led Mississippi to join South Carolina and secede from the Union in January 1861. These were the two states with the largest holdings of slaves. Other Southern states would follow suit.\n\nAs Mississippi debated the secession question, the inhabitants of Jones County voted overwhelmingly for the anti-secessionist John Hathorne Powell, Jr. In comparison to the pro-secessionist J.M. Bayliss, who received 24 votes, Powell received 374.<ref name=\"Leverett, Rudy H. 1984, pages 38-41\">Leverett, Rudy H., ''Legend of the Free State of Jones'', University Press of Mississippi, 1984, pp. 38-41.</ref> But, at the Secession Convention, Powell voted for secession. Legend has it that, for his vote, he was burned in effigy in Ellisville, the county seat.<ref name=\"Leverett, Rudy H. 1984, pages 38-41\"/>\n\nThe reality is more complicated. The only choices possible at the Secession Convention were voting for immediate secession on the one hand, or for a more cautious, co-operative approach to secession among several Southern states on the other. Powell almost certainly voted for the more conservative approach to secession\u2014the only position available to him that was consistent with the anti-secessionist views of his constituency.<ref name=\"Leverett, Rudy H. 1984, pages 38-41\"/>\n\n[[Mississippi's Declaration of Secession]] reflected planters' interests in its first sentence: \"Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]\u2026\" Jones County had mostly yeoman farmers and cattle herders, who were not slaveholders and had little use for a war over a \"[[States' rights|state's right]]\".\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Jones County and neighboring counties, especially [[Covington County, Mississippi|Covington County]] to its west, became a haven for Confederate deserters.<ref name=\"mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov\"/> A number of factors prompted desertions. The lack of food and supplies was demoralizing, while reports of poor conditions back home made the men fear for their families' survival. Small farms deteriorated from neglect as women and children struggled to keep them up. Their limited stores and livestock were often taken by the [[Confederate tax-in-kind]] agents, who took excessive amounts of yeoman farmers' goods. Many residents and soldiers were also outraged over the Confederate government's passing of the [[Twenty Negro Law]], allowing wealthy plantation owners to avoid military service if they owned twenty slaves or more.<ref name=\"mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov\"/> The Confederate government figured such planters were needed at home to keep the slaves in line and keep up cotton production, which still produced revenue for the government.\n\n==== Free State of Jones ====\n{{redirect|Free State of Jones|the film|Free State of Jones (film)}}\nOn October 13, 1863, a band of deserters from Jones County and adjacent counties organized to protect the area from Confederate authorities and the crippling tax collections.<ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780385525930.html \"The State of Jones,\" co-authored with Sally Jenkins, New York: Doubleday, 2009, page 378]</ref> The company, led by [[Newton Knight]], formed a separate government, with [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionist]] leanings, known as the \"Free State of Jones\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/6-unionist-strongholds-in-the-south-during-the-civil-war |title=6 Southern Unionist Strongholds During the Civil War |date=2015-01-13 |author= Evan Andrews |website=History Channel |accessdate=2017-04-05}}</ref> and fought a recorded 14 skirmishes with Confederate forces.

Deaths believed to be at their hands were reported in 1864 among numerous tax collectors, conscript officers, and other officials.<ref name=\"mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov\"/>\n\nThe governor was informed by the Jones County court clerk that deserters had made tax collections in the county impossible.<ref>Leverett (1984), ''Legend of the Free State of Jones'', p. 112</ref> By the spring of 1864, the Knight company had taken effective control from the Confederate government in the county.<ref name=\"mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov\"/> The followers of Knight raised an American flag over the courthouse in Ellisville, and sent a letter to Union General [[William T. Sherman]] declaring Jones County's independence from the Confederacy.<ref name=\"mshistorynow.mdah.ms.gov\"/> In July 1864, the ''[[Natchez Courier]]'' reported that Jones County had seceded from the Confederacy.<ref>Leverett (1984), ''Legend of the Free State of Jones'', pp. 17-29</ref>\n\nScholars have disputed whether the county truly seceded, with some concluding it did not. While there have been numerous attempts to study Knight and his followers, the lack of documentation during and after the war has made him an elusive figure. The rebellion in Jones County has been variously characterized as consisting of local skirmishes to being a full-fledged war of independence.
