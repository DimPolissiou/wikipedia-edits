The original form consisted of two pairs of [[Retroreflector|reflective]] glass spheres set into a white rubber dome, mounted in a [[cast iron]] housing. This is the kind that marks the centre of the road, with one pair of cat's eyes showing in each direction. A single-ended form has become widely used in other colours at road margins and as lane dividers. Cat's eyes are particularly valuable in fog and are largely resistant to damage from [[Snowplow|snow ploughs]].\n\nA key feature of the cat's eye is the flexible rubber dome which is occasionally deformed by the passage of traffic. A fixed rubber wiper cleans the surface of the reflectors as they sink below the surface of the road (the base tends to hold water after a shower of rain, making this process even more efficient). The rubber dome is protected from impact damage by metal 'kerbs' \u2013 which also give tactile and audible feedback for wandering drivers.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Catseye closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Double-ended cat's eye is Shaw's original design and marks road centre-line]]\nThe inventor of cat's eyes was [[Percy Shaw]] of [[Boothtown]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire]], England. When the tram-lines were removed in the nearby suburb of Ambler Thorn, he realised that he had been using the polished strips of steel to navigate at night.<ref name=\"Halifax Today\">\n{{cite news |title = The day Percy saw the light! |work = Halifax Today |url = http://www.halifaxtoday.co.uk/mk4custompages/CustomPage.aspx?PageID=39556 |accessdate = 24 April 2013 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040312081747/http://www.halifaxtoday.co.uk/mk4custompages/CustomPage.aspx?PageID=39556 |archivedate = 12 March 2004}}</ref> The name \"cat's eye\" comes from Shaw's inspiration for the device: the [[Tapetum lucidum#Eyeshine|eyeshine]] reflecting from the eyes of a cat. In 1934, he patented his invention (patents Nos. 436,290 and 457,536), and on 15 March 1935, founded [[Reflecting Roadstuds Ltd|Reflecting Roadstuds Limited]] in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] to manufacture the items.<ref>{{cite web  | url = http://www.catseyeroadstuds.com/history.html  | publisher = Reflecting Roadstuds Ltd |title = History |accessdate = 24 April 2013 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219172114/http://catseyeroadstuds.com/history.html |archivedate = 19 February 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"reyburn\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/-a060531047|title=Inventions that prove size doesn't matter; Ross Reyburn takes a look at some of the little things that have changed lives in big ways over the century.|last=Reyburn|first=Ross|date=1999-06-26|website=The Free Library|publisher=The Birmingham Post|url-status=live|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref> The name ''Catseye'' is their trademark.<ref>The History of British Roadsigns, Department for Transport, 2nd Edition, 1999</ref> The [[retroreflector|reflective]] lens had been invented six years earlier for use in advertising signs by Richard Hollins Murray, an accountant from [[Herefordshire]]<ref>British patent 289619 7 April 1927</ref><ref>[http://v3.espacenet.com/origdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=US1625905&F=0&QPN=US1625905 United States patent 1625905] 26 April 1927</ref> and, as Shaw acknowledged, they had contributed to his idea.<ref name=\"Halifax Today\"/>\n\nThe [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]]s of [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945) and the shuttered car [[headlight]]s then in use demonstrated the value of Shaw's invention<!-- how? e.g., were they visible even without head-lights? --> and helped popularise their mass use in the UK. After the war, they received firm backing from a [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] committee led by [[James Callaghan]] and [[Sir Arthur Young]]. Eventually, their use spread all over the world.\n\nIn 2006, Catseye was voted one of Britain's top 10 design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the [[BBC]] and the [[Design Museum]], a list which included [[Concorde]], [[Mini]], [[Supermarine Spitfire]], [[Red telephone box|K2 telephone box]], [[World Wide Web]] and the [[AEC Routemaster]] bus.<ref>{{cite news|title=Long list unveiled for national vote on public's favourite example of Great British Design |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/01_january/27/culture.shtml |publisher=BBC |date=18 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Concorde voted the UK's top icon |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4814088.stm |publisher=BBC |date=18 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Local practice==\n===United Kingdom and Hong Kong===\nIn the United Kingdom, different colours of cat's eyes are used to denote different situations:\n\n* White is used to indicate the centre line of a single carriageway road or the lane markings of a [[dual carriageway]].{{efn|'Dual carriageway' includes [[Controlled-access highway|motorways]]}}\n* Red and amber cat's eyes denote lines that should not be crossed.

Temporary cat's eyes with just a reflective strip are often used during motorway repair work. These are typically day glow green/yellow so they are easily visible in daylight as well as in darkness, they can then be used on their own for lane division.\n\nAlso seen during motorway repair work are plastic traffic pillars that are inserted into the socket of a retractable cat's eye rather than being free-standing. These are often used in conjunction with two rows of the temporary cat's eyes to divide traffic moving in opposite directions during motorway roadworks.\n\nSolar-powered cat's eyes known as solar road studs and showing a red or amber [[LED]] to traffic, have been introduced on roads regarded as particularly dangerous at locations throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astucia.co.uk/case-studies?pageIndex=0|title=Case studies|publisher=Astucia Traffic Safety Systems|accessdate=13 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =Cats eyes to improve safety on A65, North Yorkshire| publisher =Government News Network| date =6 November 2006| url =http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=239967&NewsAreaID=2| accessdate =15 March 2008| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165256/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=239967&NewsAreaID=2| archivedate =30 September 2007}}</ref> However, shortly after one such installation in [[Essex]] in the autumn of 2006 the [[BBC]] reported that the devices, which flash at an almost imperceptibly fast rate of 100 times a second, could possibly set off [[epileptic fit]]s and the [[Highways Agency]] had suspended the programme.<ref>{{cite news  | title = New cat's eye 'could trigger fit'  | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2 January 2007  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/essex/6226285.stm  | accessdate =15 March 2008 }}</ref> The suspension appeared to have been lifted by 2015, when LED cat's eyes began to be installed along newly re-paved sections of the A1 and A1(M) in [[County Durham]] and [[Tyne and Wear]].  \n\nFlashing blue LED cat's eyes were demonstrated on the TV show ''Accident Black Spot'', aired on [[Channel 4]] on 19 December 2000, which alert the driver to potential ice on the road when a low enough temperature, provisionally set at {{convert|3|C}}, is reached.

It is also suggested that the additional emphasis of an already brightly visible and reflective painted lane marking is simply not required for any potential road event or condition.

The original form consisted of two pairs of [[Retroreflector|reflective]] glass spheres set into a white rubber dome, mounted in a [[cast iron]] housing. This is the kind that marks the centre of the road, with one pair of cat's eyes showing in each direction. A single-ended form has become widely used in other colours at road margins and as lane dividers. Cat's eyes are particularly valuable in fog and are largely resistant to damage from [[Snowplow|snow ploughs]].\n\nA key feature of the cat's eye is the flexible rubber dome which is occasionally deformed by the passage of traffic. A fixed rubber wiper cleans the surface of the reflectors as they sink below the surface of the road (the base tends to hold water after a shower of rain, making this process even more efficient). The rubber dome is protected from impact damage by metal 'kerbs' \u2013 which also give tactile and audible feedback for wandering drivers.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Catseye closeup.jpg|thumb|right|Double-ended cat's eye is Shaw's original design and marks road centre-line]]\nThe inventor of cat's eyes was [[Percy Shaw]] of [[Boothtown]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire]], England.
