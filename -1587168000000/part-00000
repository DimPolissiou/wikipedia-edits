In 2015, the CDC also stated that an estimated 9.3 million adults, which is roughly 4% of the United States population, had suicidal thoughts in one year alone. 1.3 million adults 18 and older attempted suicide in one year, with 1.1 million making plans to commit suicide. Looking at younger teenagers, suicide is the third leading cause of death of individuals aged from 10 to 14. Males and females are known to have different suicidal tendencies. For example, males take their lives almost four times the rate females do. Males also commit approximately 77.9% of all suicides, however, the female population is more likely to have thoughts of suicide than males. Males more commonly use a firearm to commit suicide, while females commonly use a form of poison. College students aged 18\u201322 are less likely to attempt suicide than teenagers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/suicide-datasheet-a.pdf|title=Suicide Facts at a Glance 2015|last=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|date=2015|website=|access-date=November 9, 2017}}</ref> The most common the [[Suicide methods|suicide method]] among the female aged 15 to 24 is [[Asphyxia|suffocation]] according to Suicide Prevention Resource Center.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sprc.org/means-suicide|title=Means of Suicide {{!}} Suicide Prevention Resource Center|website=www.sprc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref>\n\nA recent study by the CDC with the help of [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Harvard]], and [[Boston Children's Hospital]] has revealed that suicide rates dropping in certain states has been linked to the legalization of [[same sex marriage]] in those same states. Suicide rates as a whole fell about 7% but the rates among specifically [[gay]], [[lesbian]], and [[bisexual]] teenagers fell at a rate of 14%. In 2013, an estimated 494,169 people were treated in emergency departments for self-inflicted, nonfatal injuries, which left an estimated $10.4 billion in combined medical and work loss costs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/20/drop-in-teenage-suicide-attempts-linked-to-legalisation-of-same-sex-marriage|title=Drop in teenage suicide attempts linked to legalisation of same-sex marriage|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=2017-02-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nSuicide differs through the race and ethnic backgrounds.

[[Hispanic]] students in grades 9\u201312 have the following percentages: attempting suicide (18.9%), having made a plan about how they would attempt suicide (15.7%), having attempted suicide (11.3%), and having made a suicide attempt that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that required medical attention (4.1%).

Other potentially serious threats could include a shared willingness to run away from home, as well as the damaging of property. Individuals may also give away most to all personal belongings, reference suicide or suicidal thought on social media, or various other online platforms, increase their use of drugs or alcohol, sleep too little or too much, or may display extreme mood swings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://save.org/about-suicide/warning-signs-risk-factors-protective-factors/|title=Warning Signs of Suicide {{!}} SAVE|work=SAVE|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}</ref> Parents witnessing such threats are recommended to immediately speak with their child and seek immediate mental health evaluation if further threats are made.\n\n==Population differences==\n\n===Sex ratio===\n{{Main|Gender, and suicide}}\nIn the U.S, male [[adolescents]] commit suicide at a rate five times greater than that of female adolescents, although suicide attempts by females are three times as frequent as those by males. A possible reason for this is the method of attempted suicide for males is typically that of [[firearm]] use, with a 78\u201390% chance of fatality.

In 1998, suicides among [[European American]]s accounted for 84% of all youth suicides, 61% male and 23% female. However, the suicide rate for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s was 19.3 per 100,000, much higher than the overall rate (8.5 per 100,000). The suicide rate for [[African American]]s has increased more than twofold since 1981. A national survey of high school students conducted in 1999 reported that [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] students are twice as likely to report attempted suicide than white students.<ref name=\"hobos Suicide Fact Sheet\" />\n\n===2007 study===\nOn September 6, 2007, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] reported [[suicide]] rate in [[United States|American]] [[adolescents]] (especially [[boy]]s, 10 to 24 years old) increased 8% (2003 to 2004), the largest jump in 15 years. Specifically, in 2004 there were 4,599 suicides in Americans ages 10 to 24, up from 4,232 in 2003, for a rate of 7.32 per 100,000 people that age. Before, the rate dropped to 6.78 per 100,000 in 2003 from 9.48 per 100,000 in 1990. Some [[psychiatrists]] argue that the increase is due to the decline in [[Medical prescription|prescriptions]] of [[antidepressant]] [[drugs]] like [[Prozac]] to young people since 2003, leaving more cases of serious [[Clinical depression|depression]] untreated. In a December 2006 study, [[The American Journal of Psychiatry]] said that a decrease in antidepressant prescriptions to minors of just a few percentage points coincided with a 14 percent increase in suicides in the [[United States]]; in the [[Netherlands]], the suicide rate was 50% up, upon prescription drop.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/health/07suicide.html|title=Suicide Rises in Youth; Antidepressant Debate Looms|first=Benedict|last=Carey|date=7 September 2007|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>  Despite the language of the study, however, the results appear to have been directly conflicted by the actual suicide rates in subsequent years.

Recent studies are showing that there is a link between using social media platforms and depression and anxiety.  A recent national survey of 1787 young adults looked at the use of 11 different social media platforms.  The survey showed that the teens that used between 7 and 11 platforms were three times at risk for depression or anxiety.  Depression is one of the leading causes of suicide.  Another problem with teens and social media is cyberbullying.  When teens are on social media that can say whatever they want about anybody and they do not feel there are any repercussions for their actions.  They do not have to look their victims in the eyes and see the hurt and torment they are causing.  The link between cyberbullying and teen suicide is one reason that people are trying to criminalize cyberbullying.  In 2011 the US Center for Disease Control showed that 13.7% of teens that reported being cyberbullied had attempted suicide.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1176/appi.pn.2017.1b16 |title = Using Many Social Media Platforms Linked with Depression, Anxiety Risk|journal = Psychiatric News|volume = 52|issue = 2|pages = 1|year = 2017|last1 = Zagorski|first1 = Nick}}</ref>\n\n==Suicide prevention==\n{{POV check|section|date=May 2008}}\n{{Main|Suicide prevention}}\n[[File:Lifelinelogo.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[National Suicide Prevention Lifeline]], a crisis line in the United States and Canada]]\n===Means reduction===\nJohnson and Coyne-Beasley have argued that limiting young people's access to lethal means, such as firearms, has reduced means-specific suicide rates.(However, they found that \"[m]inimum purchase-age and possession-age laws were not associated with statistically significant reductions in suicide rates among youth aged 14 through 20 years\".)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson RM, Coyne-Beasley T |title=Lethal means reduction: what have we learned? |journal=Curr.

In 2015, the CDC also stated that an estimated 9.3 million adults, which is roughly 4% of the United States population, had suicidal thoughts in one year alone. 1.3 million adults 18 and older attempted suicide in one year, with 1.1 million making plans to commit suicide. Looking at younger teenagers, suicide is the third leading cause of death of individuals aged from 10 to 14. Males and females are known to have different suicidal tendencies. For example, males take their lives almost four times the rate females do. Males also commit approximately 77.9% of all suicides, however, the female population is more likely to have thoughts of suicide than males. Males more commonly use a firearm to commit suicide, while females commonly use a form of poison.

However, the suicide rate for [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s was 19.3 per 100,000, much higher than the overall rate (8.5 per 100,000). The suicide rate for [[African American]]s has increased more than twofold since 1981.

Before, the rate dropped to 6.78 per 100,000 in 2003 from 9.48 per 100,000 in 1990. Some [[psychiatrists]] argue that the increase is due to the decline in [[Medical prescription|prescriptions]] of [[antidepressant]] [[drugs]] like [[Prozac]] to young people since 2003, leaving more cases of serious [[Clinical depression|depression]] untreated. In a December 2006 study, [[The American Journal of Psychiatry]] said that a decrease in antidepressant prescriptions to minors of just a few percentage points coincided with a 14 percent increase in suicides in the [[United States]]; in the [[Netherlands]], the suicide rate was 50% up, upon prescription drop.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/health/07suicide.html|title=Suicide Rises in Youth; Antidepressant Debate Looms|first=Benedict|last=Carey|date=7 September 2007|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>  Despite the language of the study, however, the results appear to have been directly conflicted by the actual suicide rates in subsequent years.

The intersection of elegance and effectiveness is the essential intellectual challenge.</blockquote>On the impetus that led to the invention of \u201cIPA derivatives for Inventories\u201d:<blockquote>If no one in the field [for 35 years] had been able to crack it with this approach [stochastic dynamic programming], what are the odds that one more guy is going to do it?... I thought there must be something wrong with that approach in itself... If not stochastic dynamic programming, then what?</blockquote>\n\n'''From Daniela Lamas (Oct 29, 2014). \"A Private Jet Is Waiting to Take You to Your Kidney Transplant\" in ''The Atlantic''''':<ref name=\"tayur-atlantic\" />'''\n\nOn how doing \u201csomething new\u201d is a joy in itself:<blockquote>There's a certain self-satisfaction to being clever for its own sake. It has nothing to do whether you helped somebody or made money or got a prize. All of those things matter. But there\u2019s this joy when you're sitting alone in your room and you say, \u201cAha! I thought about something in a new way.\u201d</blockquote>\n\n'''From the Harvard Business School Case ''OrganJet and GuardianWings'':<ref name=\"hbs-organjet\" />'''\n\nOn why he created \u201cOrganJet and GuardianWings\u201d:<blockquote>I like newness. It\u2019s very important to me personally to do new things. I thought maybe my next act should be social enterprise because it was new to me, but I was a little unhappy that the social enterprise idea was already 12 years old. Then I discovered that having a for-profit operation generate funding for a non-profit organization providing the same service was quite new. So, is saving lives not good enough? I'm not saying it's not good enough. It is. Is managing logistics not good enough? It is. But doing both of those and creating a new form of social enterprise all in one? That's the trifecta.</blockquote>\n\n'''Speaking with students on the occasion of receiving a Distinguished Alumnus Award from his alma mater, Indian Institute of Technology Madras:'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chennai36.iitm.ac.in/purpose-beyond-profit-dr-sridhar-tayur-daa-2018/|title=Purpose Beyond Profit- Dr. Sridhar R Tayur, DAA 2018 {{!}} Chennai36|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In line with the culture prevalent now rather than 30 years ago, I would say, \u201cDream big. Then go out and make it happen.\u201d Over these years, I have tried to upgrade my ambitions to the next level. I started out thinking to keep my head down, not doing anything way too interesting. But when I began software entrepreneurship, it was fun and pushed me into believing I could do more--be it healthcare or social entrepreneurship. I am now working on Quantum Computing with a D-Wave quantum computer from NASA. If we IITM folks are not going to swing the bat and hit the ball out of the stadium, somebody else will! We should free ourselves from the self-imprisonment of low aspirations. Do we want to be just spectators (or commentators) in the game of life, or do we want to be the star players and help create the future?</blockquote>\n\n'''Speaking about the \u201cmaximally inverse\u201d (a phrase that he coined) strategy in the context of coming up with OrganJet and Nudge video at [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]'s [[Collective intelligence|Collective Intelligence]] 2019 conference:'''<ref name=\"ci-st\" />\n\n<blockquote>One of the tricks that I like personally is what I call \u201cmaximally inverse\u201d... Ever since as a kid, what I want to achieve is to do something that is exactly opposite to 300 years of great scientific thought. So I keep looking for solutions that are actually the very opposite of what everybody wants.... My heuristic has always been whether I can use ideas from somewhere in some combination and where I can find something that I can do the opposite of what other great people are thinking. That's what I go for.</blockquote>\n\n==Publications==\nTayur has published more than 100 articles in peer-reviewed journals.

Cronin and Jeffrey Loewenstein's 2018 book ''The Craft of Creativity'':<ref name=\"CroninLoewenstein2018\" />'''\n\nOn the importance of \u201celegance in practical solutions\u201d:<blockquote>Elegance is not something that should be considered discretionary, but rather an intrinsic feature of a proposed solution. The tragedy in some academic circles is that they make elegance the \"whole thing,\" losing sight of the problem to be solved, while the pragmatic sort do not have the luxury for aesthetic considerations. The intersection of elegance and effectiveness is the essential intellectual challenge.</blockquote>On the impetus that led to the invention of \u201cIPA derivatives for Inventories\u201d:<blockquote>If no one in the field [for 35 years] had been able to crack it with this approach [stochastic dynamic programming], what are the odds that one more guy is going to do it?... I thought there must be something wrong with that approach in itself... If not stochastic dynamic programming, then what?</blockquote>\n\n'''From Daniela Lamas (Oct 29, 2014). \"A Private Jet Is Waiting to Take You to Your Kidney Transplant\" in ''The Atlantic''''':<ref name=\"tayur-atlantic\" />'''\n\nOn how doing \u201csomething new\u201d is a joy in itself:<blockquote>There's a certain self-satisfaction to being clever for its own sake. It has nothing to do whether you helped somebody or made money or got a prize. All of those things matter. But there\u2019s this joy when you're sitting alone in your room and you say, \u201cAha! I thought about something in a new way.\u201d</blockquote>\n\n'''From the Harvard Business School Case ''OrganJet and GuardianWings'':<ref name=\"hbs-organjet\" />'''\n\nOn why he created \u201cOrganJet and GuardianWings\u201d:<blockquote>I like newness. It\u2019s very important to me personally to do new things. I thought maybe my next act should be social enterprise because it was new to me, but I was a little unhappy that the social enterprise idea was already 12 years old. Then I discovered that having a for-profit operation generate funding for a non-profit organization providing the same service was quite new. So, is saving lives not good enough? I'm not saying it's not good enough. It is. Is managing logistics not good enough? It is. But doing both of those and creating a new form of social enterprise all in one? That's the trifecta.</blockquote>\n\n'''Speaking with students on the occasion of receiving a Distinguished Alumnus Award from his alma mater, Indian Institute of Technology Madras:'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chennai36.iitm.ac.in/purpose-beyond-profit-dr-sridhar-tayur-daa-2018/|title=Purpose Beyond Profit- Dr. Sridhar R Tayur, DAA 2018 {{!}} Chennai36|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In line with the culture prevalent now rather than 30 years ago, I would say, \u201cDream big. Then go out and make it happen.\u201d Over these years, I have tried to upgrade my ambitions to the next level. I started out thinking to keep my head down, not doing anything way too interesting. But when I began software entrepreneurship, it was fun and pushed me into believing I could do more--be it healthcare or social entrepreneurship. I am now working on Quantum Computing with a D-Wave quantum computer from NASA. If we IITM folks are not going to swing the bat and hit the ball out of the stadium, somebody else will! We should free ourselves from the self-imprisonment of low aspirations. Do we want to be just spectators (or commentators) in the game of life, or do we want to be the star players and help create the future?</blockquote>\n\n'''Speaking about the \u201cmaximally inverse\u201d (a phrase that he coined) strategy in the context of coming up with OrganJet and Nudge video at [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]'s [[Collective intelligence|Collective Intelligence]] 2019 conference:'''<ref name=\"ci-st\" />\n\n<blockquote>One of the tricks that I like personally is what I call \u201cmaximally inverse\u201d... Ever since as a kid, what I want to achieve is to do something that is exactly opposite to 300 years of great scientific thought. So I keep looking for solutions that are actually the very opposite of what everybody wants.... My heuristic has always been whether I can use ideas from somewhere in some combination and where I can find something that I can do the opposite of what other great people are thinking. That's what I go for.</blockquote>\n\n==Publications==\nTayur has published more than 100 articles in peer-reviewed journals.

It began on 12 November 2004 and ran for six 30 minute episodes up until 17 December 2004. This spin off from ''[[Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights]]'' follows the two [[Bolton]] doormen/bouncers Maxwell \"Max\" Bygraves (Kay) and Patrick \"Paddy\" O'Shea (McGuinness) as they wind their way around [[Great Britain|Britain]] in their [[campervan]]. The key reason why they are on the open road is never mentioned in the series: however, they took \u00a38,000 from a woman in the second series of ''[[Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights]]'' to kill her husband, but never properly went through with the job. When she discovered this, they hit the road in the van to escape the possible consequences.\n\nAlthough this series was broadcast two years after ''[[Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights]]'', the action seems to be set immediately afterwards. However, the Motor Home they purchased in Phoenix Nights is a [[Ford]], and the Motor Home they use in Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere is actually a [[Fiat]]. [[Peter Kay]] touched on this in the DVD commentary of Phoenix Nights, saying that he should have told the production company to buy a larger Motor Home than the Ford as he was going to use it in the spin off. Max is the older and more sensible of the two, roughly 40 years old, and usually pretending to have more life experience than he has actually had, including a stint in the [[army]]. Paddy is a cheeky and likely lad obsessed with [[sex]], [[pornography]], [[food]], and several strange but funny [[catchphrase]]s such as,  \"Dink dank doo.\" Max often coldly stares at Paddy or anyone who has offended his tastes and often shouts \"H-how dare you!\". He also calls people a clown or a melon if they've said something absurd. A second series of the show was initially planned for 2006, but [[Peter Kay]] instead confirmed a third series of ''Phoenix Nights'' (which as of April 2020, has not yet happened) However, on 27 November 2014 live shows were announced for [[Comic Relief]], with the full cast returning.\n\n==Theme song==\nThe theme song was written by [[Toni Baker]] and [[Peter Kay]], and borrowed heavily from the theme to the 1970s American series ''[[B. J. and the Bear]]''. The lyrics are \"Don't know where we're going, Got no way of knowing, Driving on the Road to Nowhere, Sponging for a living, Checkin' out the women, Riding on the Road to Nowhere... And we don't take shit from anyone, The only thing we wanna do is have some fun, It's Max and Paddy, Paddy and Max, And best of all we don't pay [[council tax]]\".\n\nSinger [[Tony Christie]] was to sing the show's theme, but his version was only used once, at the very end of the final episode. Kay and McGuinness themselves sang it in the opening sequences of episodes 2 to 6.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Episode 1===\nIn [[Dover]], Max and Paddy buy a [[Plasma display|plasma]] television from an Irish [[Criminal|crook]] called [[Irish Travellers|Gypsy]] Joe (played by [[Brendan O'Carroll]]). This leads to several arguments, especially when they realise the television doesn't have any speakers. The pair thus decide to go out to a [[nightclub]] to let off some steam and forget their troubles, but Max's uncoordinated [[dancing]] spoils the night and he ends up [[fighting]] with some sailors home on [[shore leave]]. Paddy teaches him a few cool moves the following day, and they return to the club dressed as sailors in order to blend in. Their new moves lure two local girls, Tracey and Louise, back to the [[campervan]], only for one of them to [[Theft|steal]] Paddy's [[wallet]]. After discovering the girls, locally known as the '[[ARA Belgrano|Belgrano]] Sisters', are infamous for this, they get revenge by forcing them to steal some speakers for their television.\n\nThis episode had 4.2m viewers.\n\n===Episode 2===\nAfter a brush with a [[porn]] film shoot (a film called [[Human penis|Willy]] [[Wanker]] and the Chocolate Factory - a gay porn parody of [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]) goes wrong for Paddy (initially believing he would naturally be working in a [[heterosexual]] porn film, he finds out otherwise), the [[campervan]] breaks down in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]]. The pair hand it over to a local garage run by Mick Bustin, played by British rocker [[Noddy Holder]]. To kill time, Max and Paddy catch the train to [[Middlewood railway station|Middlewood]], which actually turns out to be the last one that day, so the pair are forced to go for a [[walk]] in the woods, but quickly become lost. After Max shows a bemused Paddy his [[notebook]] filled with childlike drawings of a television programme he's invented called \"Magnet and Steel\", the pair reluctantly decide to sleep rough in the woods. Paddy quickly causes ill feeling by burning Max's book on their [[campfire]], but Max soon comes around and begins talking, accompanied by a [[Flashback (literary technique)|flashback]], about his one true love: a [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] called Tina, whom he met in 1994.\n\nHe goes on to say that the relationship abruptly ended after she overheard him and his friends making jokes about her height. The following morning, the two discover to their dismay that they were a short walk away from a Petrol Station and a [[Travelodge]]. Things get worse when Mick Bustin tries to charge them \u00a3500 to retrieve the [[campervan]], causing the pair to break into Bustin's workshop and, in a parody of ''[[The A-Team]]'', modify the van and 'bust' out back on to the road, only for the van to break down again miles later, Mick Bustin having never actually made any repairs.\n\nThis episode features several regulars from ''[[Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights]]'', and a homage to the movie ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''. Paddy's full name is revealed to be Patrick O'Shea. This joke is based around the rumour that [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] player [[John O'Shea]] is regularly teased by team-mates for his physical resemblance to [[Paddy McGuinness (comedian)|Patrick McGuinness]].\n\nThis episode had 3.26m viewers.\n\n===Episode 3===\nThe pair go down to London, and immediately have a run-in with the traffic police. Later, Max spots in a local newspaper a 40th birthday message for his old school friend Kevin 'The Wolfster' Wolfson, who had moved to London some years before. Max and Paddy turn up unannounced at his birthday party and surprise 'The Wolfster', as well as several other old faces from home present for the party. Things turn sad though when Tina (played by [[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]), Max's one true love mentioned in the previous episode, turns up. Max awkwardly talks to her, and things get worse when he realises that she is actually married to, and has a child with, The Wolfster.\n\nHowever, the child, a 10-year-old boy called Daniel, is actually Max's son. Tina warns Max to stay away and not blow the secret, but the following morning he ropes Paddy in and the pair steal what they think is a [[school bus]] with young Daniel aboard. They've got the wrong bus however, and are soon accosted by the police and sent directly to prison. The actor/comedian [[Reece Shearsmith]] turns up in this episode as one of Max's old friends. The 'Row Row Row Your Boat' sequence on the bus is borrowed from ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', and in the scene where The Wolfster writes his telephone number on a [[beermat]] and hands it to Max, it is clearly a [[Peter Kay]] beermat, tying in with Kay's TV adverts for [[John Smith's]] [[Bitter (beer)|bitter]].\n\nThis episode had 3.01m viewers.\n\n===Episode 4 ===\nThe pair are now in [[prison]] together after the school bus incident. Paddy is then forced to share a cell with a tennis-playing [[Cliff Richard]] impersonator who actually believes he ''is'' Cliff. After an uncomfortable first night, Paddy admits his fear of being 'bummed' in the shower room. Max convinces him the best thing to do is make the other prisoners believe they are not just two silly doormen, but genuine big-league [[gangsters]] called 'The Phoenix Twins'. After an altercation with a [[camp (style)|camp]] inmate called Pepe, Max and Paddy are soon confronted by the main man of their wing, Raymond The Bastard (played by [[Everal Walsh]]), who is also Pepe's boyfriend. Raymond is the worse of Paddy's nightmares when Paddy drops the soap, and is eagerly commented about his manhood as \"Stunning, like a young [[Burt Reynolds]]!\". Raymond has heard about the pair's alleged big-money heists and robberies, and wants a cut of their money. Max agrees just to get Raymond off their backs and receive preferential treatment, including access to luxury chocolates and [[Sky+]] .\n\nSoon, their old Phoenix Club boss Brian Potter (played by Kay) unexpectedly comes to visit, along with a cake, announcing that he's organising several events to help speed up their release. They spurn him, not wanting a high-profile campaign ruining their chances of release. Potter, as ever, fails to listen, and the whole wing later see him on the [[TV news]] talking about 'the doormen' Max and Paddy: thus showing up their tall stories as lies. A big fight is about to break out between Raymond and his henchmen against Max and Paddy. However, the fight is prevented by a prison officer telling Max and Paddy to come with him. The episode concludes with Tina, Max's ex-love, admitting to the authorities that Daniel is actually Max's son and he was acting under stress when he stole the bus. The pair are released, having their sentences reduced to community service, and get revenge on Brian Potter by informing the [[Home Office]] that there is an outbreak of anthrax at his club. We find out in this episode that Max's full name is Maxwell Bygraves, a jokey reference to the veteran British entertainer [[Max Bygraves]]. We also find out that Brian Potter's full name is 'Brian Chelsea Potter'\n\nThis episode had 3.16m viewers.\n\n===Episode 5===\nIn the countryside, Paddy is driving the van when he accidentally knocks over and kills a cow walking in the road. Tracing the cow to a nearby farm, the pair go off to find the farmer and claim expenses for the damage to the van. They come across what they assume is him: an odd, scruffy old man in a field, who instead of giving them compensation money sells them a breeder pig for \u00a3100. He claims they can sell it on at market for around \u00a3300. When Max and Paddy reach the cattle market, they discover the pig has seen better days and they've been conned. After several unsuccessful attempts to sell the pig on to butchers shops, a supermarket, and even a [[Halal]] outlet, Max and Paddy decide to kill it themselves to get rid of the burden. They have a change of heart though and head back to the farm to reclaim their \u00a3100. They soon discover that the old man who sold them the pig initially was actually the drunken father-in-law of the real farmer, and their money has probably all gone to the nearest pub. Also the farmer isn't very happy about the two killing one of his cows (even though his cow should not have been on the road in the first place). Guest starring Graham Walker of [[The Grumbleweeds]].\n\nThis episode had 3.43m viewers.\n\n===Episode 6===\nMax and Paddy finally hit [[North East England]] to visit Max's old doorman friend Billy 'The Butcher' Shannon, who had previously briefly appeared in the 1994 flashback in Episode 2. They agree to let Shannon, who is looking for his estranged son, hitch a ride around. They soon discover though that he's obsessed with Max (\"Not in a gay way\" he claims), and irrationally hates Paddy. What they fail to notice at the same time is that Shannon is carrying a [[revolver]], which he uses to force a [[Little Chef]] worker called Brenda (played by [[Alex Hall (actress)|Alex Hall]]) to open for the trio late at night. The Little Chef is Haydock, near St Helens, Merseyside. The police are quickly on to the gang, with only Shannon aware of any crime. When the [[campervan]] stops off later down the road, Max sees a newspaper headline and realises what's happening. Furthermore, Billy catches Paddy going through his stuff and prepares to shoot him.\n\nA chase eventually ensues through the services and along a motorway tunnel [[bridge]], and Shannon shoots Paddy in the [[Buttocks|bottom]]. He's on the verge of firing at Max too, but Paddy quickly recovers, and bashes Shannon around the head with a [[traffic cone]], using [[Peter Kay]]'s TV catchphrase of \"'Ave It!\" in the process. With Shannon now unconscious and arrested, Max and Paddy slip away from a police telling-off - due to the fact that earlier in the episode they cut down a [[speed camera]] - and escape into the night.\n\nThis episode had 3.26m viewers.\n\n==Future==\nOn 22 February 2010, Peter Kay stated to ''The Sun'' that he and Paddy McGuinness planned to do more specials of ''Max and Paddy's Road To Nowhere''. He wanted Phil 'The Pastie' Murphy to play the portly soldier in love with Max's mother. He had also stated in 2010, during an appearance on [[The Chris Moyles Show]], that he wanted Sir [[Terry Wogan]] to play an Irish baddie when Max and Paddy go to a funeral in Ireland but, after a stag night, only have fancy dress magician clothes. Mayhem would then ensue as they tried to act appropriately in the situation, only to keep unintentionally doing magic tricks based on what they found in their outfits.\n\n==''Max & Paddy's The Power of Two''==\nA spoof fitness DVD was released, ''Max & Paddy's The Power of Two'', including several gags and pieces of scenery from the main series. The DVD also included extra workout tips and a segment instructed by Brian Potter live from the Phoenix Club. On the DVD packaging, it is now referred to as \"The UK's fastest selling fitness DVD - Ever!\". Although the main workout is shown in full, it is more intended as a spoof product than a genuine workout.\n\n==DVD audio commentary==\nKay and McGuinness do not provide the DVD audio commentary.\n* Episode one: [[Colin Murray]] and [[Edith Bowman]]\n* Episode two: [[Bez (dancer)|Bez]] and [[Shaun Ryder]]\n* Episode three: [[Vernon Kay]] and [[Tess Daly]]\n* Episode four: [[Vernon Kay]] and [[Tess Daly]]\n* Episode five: [[Keith Harris (ventriloquist)|Keith Harris]] and [[Orville the Duck]]\n* Episode six: [[Stuart Hall (presenter)|Stuart Hall]] and [[Stuart Maconie]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Max and Paddy]]\n* ''[[Phoenix Nights]]''\n* ''[[Peter Kay's Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Channel4.com|id=maxandpaddy|title=Max and Paddy&#39;s Road to Nowhere}}\n*{{IMDb title|0421033}}\n*{{British Comedy Guide|sitcom|max_paddy}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Max And Paddy's Road To Nowhere}}\n[[Category:Channel 4 sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2000s British comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2004 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2004 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:British television spin-offs]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=February 2014}}\n{{more citations|date=September 2016}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere\n| image                    = \n| caption                  = \n| picture_format           = [[16:9]]\n| runtime                  = 30 Mins <small>(inc. adverts)</small>\n| genre                    = [[Sitcom]]\n| creator                  = Peter Kay<br/>Patrick McGuinness\n| writer                   = Peter Kay<br/>Patrick McGuinness\n| director                 = Peter Kay\n| starring                 = [[Peter Kay]]<br/>[[Paddy McGuinness|Patrick McGuinness]]<br/>[[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]<br/>[[Craig Cheetham]]\n| channel                  = [[Channel 4]]\n| first_aired              = 12 November\n| last_aired               = <br />17 December 2004\n| num_series               = 1\n| num_episodes             = 6\n| country                  = United Kingdom\n| producer                 = Lesley McNeil\n| executive_producer       = Phil McIntyre\n| cinematography           = Martin Hawkins<br/>Andy Hibbert\n| editor                   = Peter Hallworth\n| preceded_by              = ''[[Phoenix Nights]]'' <small>(2001\u201302)</small>\n| followed_by              = ''[[Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice]]'' <small>(2008)</small>\n}}\n\n'''''Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere''''' is a British [[sitcom]] on [[Channel 4]] starring and written by [[Peter Kay]] and [[Paddy McGuinness|Patrick McGuinness]].<ref name=M>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/max-paddy-coming-back-star-7634490|title=Max and Paddy are coming back as star reveals there's plenty of life left in the show|date=26 March 2016|first=Emma|last=Pryer|work=[[Daily Mirror]]}}</ref>\n\nAll the episodes were also directed by Kay. It began on 12 November 2004 and ran for six 30 minute episodes up until 17 December 2004. This spin off from ''[[Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights]]'' follows the two [[Bolton]] doormen/bouncers Maxwell \"Max\" Bygraves (Kay) and Patrick \"Paddy\" O'Shea (McGuinness) as they wind their way around [[Great Britain|Britain]] in their [[campervan]]. The key reason why they are on the open road is never mentioned in the series: however, they took \u00a38,000 from a woman in the second series of ''[[Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights]]'' to kill her husband, but never properly went through with the job. When she discovered this, they hit the road in the van to escape the possible consequences.\n\nAlthough this series was broadcast two years after ''[[Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights]]'', the action seems to be set immediately afterwards. However, the Motor Home they purchased in Phoenix Nights is a [[Ford]], and the Motor Home they use in Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere is actually a [[Fiat]]. [[Peter Kay]] touched on this in the DVD commentary of Phoenix Nights, saying that he should have told the production company to buy a larger Motor Home than the Ford as he was going to use it in the spin off. Max is the older and more sensible of the two, roughly 40 years old, and usually pretending to have more life experience than he has actually had, including a stint in the [[army]]. Paddy is a cheeky and likely lad obsessed with [[sex]], [[pornography]], [[food]], and several strange but funny [[catchphrase]]s such as,  \"Dink dank doo.\" Max often coldly stares at Paddy or anyone who has offended his tastes and often shouts \"H-how dare you!\". He also calls people a clown or a melon if they've said something absurd. A second series of the show was initially planned for 2006, but [[Peter Kay]] instead confirmed a third series of ''Phoenix Nights'' (which as of April 2020, has not yet happened) However, on 27 November 2014 live shows were announced for [[Comic Relief]], with the full cast returning.\n\n==Theme song==\nThe theme song was written by [[Toni Baker]] and [[Peter Kay]], and borrowed heavily from the theme to the 1970s American series ''[[B. J. and the Bear]]''. The lyrics are \"Don't know where we're going, Got no way of knowing, Driving on the Road to Nowhere, Sponging for a living, Checkin' out the women, Riding on the Road to Nowhere... And we don't take shit from anyone, The only thing we wanna do is have some fun, It's Max and Paddy, Paddy and Max, And best of all we don't pay [[council tax]]\".\n\nSinger [[Tony Christie]] was to sing the show's theme, but his version was only used once, at the very end of the final episode. Kay and McGuinness themselves sang it in the opening sequences of episodes 2 to 6.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Episode 1===\nIn [[Dover]], Max and Paddy buy a [[Plasma display|plasma]] television from an Irish [[Criminal|crook]] called [[Irish Travellers|Gypsy]] Joe (played by [[Brendan O'Carroll]]). This leads to several arguments, especially when they realise the television doesn't have any speakers. The pair thus decide to go out to a [[nightclub]] to let off some steam and forget their troubles, but Max's uncoordinated [[dancing]] spoils the night and he ends up [[fighting]] with some sailors home on [[shore leave]]. Paddy teaches him a few cool moves the following day, and they return to the club dressed as sailors in order to blend in. Their new moves lure two local girls, Tracey and Louise, back to the [[campervan]], only for one of them to [[Theft|steal]] Paddy's [[wallet]]. After discovering the girls, locally known as the '[[ARA Belgrano|Belgrano]] Sisters', are infamous for this, they get revenge by forcing them to steal some speakers for their television.\n\nThis episode had 4.2m viewers.\n\n===Episode 2===\nAfter a brush with a [[porn]] film shoot (a film called [[Human penis|Willy]] [[Wanker]] and the Chocolate Factory - a gay porn parody of [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]) goes wrong for Paddy (initially believing he would naturally be working in a [[heterosexual]] porn film, he finds out otherwise), the [[campervan]] breaks down in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]]. The pair hand it over to a local garage run by Mick Bustin, played by British rocker [[Noddy Holder]]. To kill time, Max and Paddy catch the train to [[Middlewood railway station|Middlewood]], which actually turns out to be the last one that day, so the pair are forced to go for a [[walk]] in the woods, but quickly become lost. After Max shows a bemused Paddy his [[notebook]] filled with childlike drawings of a television programme he's invented called \"Magnet and Steel\", the pair reluctantly decide to sleep rough in the woods. Paddy quickly causes ill feeling by burning Max's book on their [[campfire]], but Max soon comes around and begins talking, accompanied by a [[Flashback (literary technique)|flashback]], about his one true love: a [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] called Tina, whom he met in 1994.\n\nHe goes on to say that the relationship abruptly ended after she overheard him and his friends making jokes about her height. The following morning, the two discover to their dismay that they were a short walk away from a Petrol Station and a [[Travelodge]]. Things get worse when Mick Bustin tries to charge them \u00a3500 to retrieve the [[campervan]], causing the pair to break into Bustin's workshop and, in a parody of ''[[The A-Team]]'', modify the van and 'bust' out back on to the road, only for the van to break down again miles later, Mick Bustin having never actually made any repairs.\n\nThis episode features several regulars from ''[[Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights]]'', and a homage to the movie ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''. Paddy's full name is revealed to be Patrick O'Shea. This joke is based around the rumour that [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] player [[John O'Shea]] is regularly teased by team-mates for his physical resemblance to [[Paddy McGuinness (comedian)|Patrick McGuinness]].\n\nThis episode had 3.26m viewers.\n\n===Episode 3===\nThe pair go down to London, and immediately have a run-in with the traffic police. Later, Max spots in a local newspaper a 40th birthday message for his old school friend Kevin 'The Wolfster' Wolfson, who had moved to London some years before. Max and Paddy turn up unannounced at his birthday party and surprise 'The Wolfster', as well as several other old faces from home present for the party. Things turn sad though when Tina (played by [[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]), Max's one true love mentioned in the previous episode, turns up. Max awkwardly talks to her, and things get worse when he realises that she is actually married to, and has a child with, The Wolfster.\n\nHowever, the child, a 10-year-old boy called Daniel, is actually Max's son.

They've got the wrong bus however, and are soon accosted by the police and sent directly to prison. The actor/comedian [[Reece Shearsmith]] turns up in this episode as one of Max's old friends.

Two imperial families \u2013 the senior [[Northern Court]] and the junior [[Southern Court]] \u2013 had a claim to the throne. The problem was solved with the intercession of the Kamakura shogunate, who had the two lines alternate. This lasted until 1331, when [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (of the Southern Court) tried to overthrow the shogunate to stop the alternation. As a result, Daigo was exiled. Around 1334\u20131336, [[Ashikaga Takauji]] helped Daigo regain his throne.<ref name=\"sansom\">{{cite book |title=A History of Japan, 1134\u20131615 |first=George |last=Sansom |url=http://www.gotterdammerung.org/books/reviews/h/history-of-japan-1334-1615.html |year=1961 |location=United States |publisher=Stanford University Press}}</ref>\n\nThe fight against the shogunate left the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] with too many people claiming a limited supply of land. Takauji turned against the Emperor when the discontent about the distribution of land grew great enough. In 1336 Daigo was banished again, in favor of a new Emperor.<ref name=\"sansom\" />\n\nDuring the [[Kenmu Restoration]], after the fall of the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, another short-lived shogun arose. [[Prince Moriyoshi]] (Morinaga), son of Go-Daigo, was awarded the title of ''Sei-i Taish\u014dgun''. However, Prince Moriyoshi was later put under [[house arrest]] and, in 1335, killed by [[Ashikaga Tadayoshi]].\n\n===Ashikaga shogunate (1336\u20131573)===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n{{Main|Ashikaga shogunate|Muromachi period}}\n[[File:Ashikaga_Takauji.JPG|thumb|left|[[Ashikaga Takauji]] (1338\u20131358) established the [[Ashikaga shogunate]]]]\n\nIn 1338, [[Ashikaga Takauji]], like Minamoto no Yoritomo, a descendant of the [[Minamoto clan|Minamoto]] princes, was awarded the title of ''sei-i taish\u014dgun'' and established the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], which nominally lasted until 1573. The Ashikaga had their headquarters in the Muromachi district of Kyoto, and the time during which they ruled is also known as the [[Muromachi period]].\n\n===Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period (1573\u20131600)===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n{{see|Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period}}\nWhile the title of shogun went into abeyance due to technical reasons, [[Oda Nobunaga]] and his successor, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], who later obtained the position of [[Sessh\u014d and Kampaku|Imperial Regent]], gained far greater power than any of their predecessors had.

 barset:skip\n</timeline>\n\n==Shogunate==\nThe term {{Nihongo||\u5e55\u5e9c|bakufu|extra=\"tent government\"}} originally meant the dwelling and household of a shogun, but in time, became a [[metonym]] for the system of government of a feudal [[military dictatorship]], exercised in the name of the shogun or by the shogun himself. Therefore, various ''bakufu'' held absolute power over the country (territory ruled at that time) without pause from 1192 to 1867, glossing over actual power, clan and title transfers.\n\nThe shogunate system was originally established under the Kamakura shogunate by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]. Although theoretically, the state (and therefore the Emperor) held ownership of all land in Japan. The system had some [[feudal]] elements, with lesser territorial lords pledging their allegiance to greater ones. [[Samurai]] were rewarded for their loyalty with agricultural surplus, usually rice, or labor services from peasants. In contrast to European feudal knights, samurai were not landowners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bentley|first=Jerry|title=Traditions and Encounters|isbn=978-0-07-325230-8|pages=301\u2013302}}</ref> The hierarchy that held this system of government together was reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', samurai and their subordinates.\n\nEach shogunate was dynamic, not static. Power was constantly shifting and authority was often ambiguous. The study of the ebbs and flows in this complex history continues to occupy the attention of scholars. Each shogunate encountered competition. Sources of competition included the Emperor and the court aristocracy, the remnants of the imperial governmental systems, the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', the ''[[sh\u014den]]'' system, the great temples and shrines, the ''[[s\u014dhei]]'', the ''[[shugo]]'' and ''[[jit\u014d]]'', the ''[[jizamurai]]'' and early modern ''daimy\u014d''. Each shogunate reflected the necessity of new ways of balancing the changing requirements of central and regional authorities.<ref>Mass, J. et al., eds. (1985). ''The Bakufu in Japanese History'', p. 189.</ref>\n\n== Relationship with the emperor ==\n[[File:Imperial Seal of Japan.svg|thumb|left|100px|Imperial Seal of Japan]]\n{{main|Emperor of Japan}}\n\nSince [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] turned the figure of the shogun into a permanent and hereditary position and until the [[Meiji Restoration]] there were two ruling classes in Japan: 1. the emperor or {{nihongo|''[[tenn\u014d]]''|\u5929\u7687|extra=lit. \"Heavenly Sovereign\"}},<ref name=\"Mitchelhill\">Mitchelhill & Green, 2003:59.</ref> who acted as \"chief priest\" of the official religion of the country, [[Shinto]], and 2. the shogun, head of the army who also enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority.<ref name=\"Kuno245\">Kuno, 2007:245.</ref> Although in theory the shogun was an emperor's servant, it became the true power behind the throne.<ref>Davis, 2001:205.</ref>\n\nNo shogun tried to usurp the throne, even when they had at their disposal the military power of the territory. There were two reasons primarily:<ref>Roth, 2007:103.</ref>\n\n*Theoretically the shogun received the power of the emperor, so this was his symbol of authority.\n*There was a sentimentalist tradition created by priests and religious who traced the imperial line from the \"age of the gods\" into an \"eternal line unbroken by the times.\" According to Japanese mythology, the emperor was a direct descendant of [[Amaterasu]], goddess of the [[sun]].\n\nUnable to usurp the throne, the shoguns sought throughout history to keep the emperor away from the country's political activity, relegating them from the sphere of influence. One of the few powers that the imperial house could retain was that of being able to \"control time\" through the designation of the Japanese [[Neng\u014d]] or Eras and the issuance of calendars.<ref>Fi\u00e9v\u00e9 & Waley, 2003:235.</ref>\n\nThis is a highlight of two historical attempts of the emperor to recover the power they enjoyed before the establishment of the shogunate. In 1219 the [[Emperor Go-Toba]] accused the H\u014dj\u014d as outlaws. Imperial troops mobilized, leading to the [[J\u014dky\u016b War]] (1219-1221), which would culminate in the third [[Battle of Uji (1221)]]. During this, the imperial troops were defeated and the emperor Go-Toba was exiled.<ref name=\"Pag41\">Turnbull, 2006a:41.</ref> With the defeat of Go-Toba, the samurai government over the country was confirmed.<ref name=\"Pag41\" /> At the beginning of the fourteenth century the [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] decided to rebel, but the H\u014dj\u014d, who were then regents, sent an army from Kamakura. The emperor fled before the troops arrived and took the imperial insignia.<ref name=\"Pag43\">Turnbull, 2006a:43.</ref> The shogun named his own emperor, giving rise to the era {{nihongo|''[[Nanbokuch\u014d]]''|\u5357\u5317\u671d|extra=lit. \"Southern and Northern Courts\"}}.\n\nDuring the 1850s and 1860s, the shogunate was severely pressured both abroad and by foreign powers. It was then that various groups angry with the shogunate for the concessions made to the various European countries found in the figure of the emperor an ally through which they could expel the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] from power. The motto of this movement was {{nihongo|''[[Sonn\u014d j\u014di]]''|\u5c0a\u738b\u6518\u5937|extra=\"Revere the Emperor, Eject the Barbarians\"}} and they finally succeeded in 1868, when imperial power was restored after centuries of being in the shadow of the country's political life.<ref>Fi\u00e9v\u00e9 & Waley, 2003:236.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nUpon Japan's surrender after World War II, American Army General [[Douglas MacArthur]] became Japan's ''de facto'' ruler during the years of occupation.

The Taira family seized control from 1160 to 1185, but was defeated by the Minamoto in the [[Battle of Dan-no-ura]]. [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] seized power from the central government and aristocracy and established a [[feudal system]] based in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] in which the private military, the [[samurai]], gained some political powers while the Emperor and the [[aristocracy]] remained the ''[[de jure]]'' rulers. In 1192, Yoritomo was awarded the title of ''Sei-i Taish\u014dgun'' by [[Emperor Go-Toba]] and the political system he developed with a succession of shoguns as the head became known as a shogunate.

Two imperial families \u2013 the senior [[Northern Court]] and the junior [[Southern Court]] \u2013 had a claim to the throne. The problem was solved with the intercession of the Kamakura shogunate, who had the two lines alternate. This lasted until 1331, when [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (of the Southern Court) tried to overthrow the shogunate to stop the alternation. As a result, Daigo was exiled. Around 1334\u20131336, [[Ashikaga Takauji]] helped Daigo regain his throne.<ref name=\"sansom\">{{cite book |title=A History of Japan, 1134\u20131615 |first=George |last=Sansom |url=http://www.gotterdammerung.org/books/reviews/h/history-of-japan-1334-1615.html |year=1961 |location=United States |publisher=Stanford University Press}}</ref>\n\nThe fight against the shogunate left the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] with too many people claiming a limited supply of land.

 barset:skip\n</timeline>\n\n==Shogunate==\nThe term {{Nihongo||\u5e55\u5e9c|bakufu|extra=\"tent government\"}} originally meant the dwelling and household of a shogun, but in time, became a [[metonym]] for the system of government of a feudal [[military dictatorship]], exercised in the name of the shogun or by the shogun himself. Therefore, various ''bakufu'' held absolute power over the country (territory ruled at that time) without pause from 1192 to 1867, glossing over actual power, clan and title transfers.\n\nThe shogunate system was originally established under the Kamakura shogunate by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]. Although theoretically, the state (and therefore the Emperor) held ownership of all land in Japan. The system had some [[feudal]] elements, with lesser territorial lords pledging their allegiance to greater ones. [[Samurai]] were rewarded for their loyalty with agricultural surplus, usually rice, or labor services from peasants. In contrast to European feudal knights, samurai were not landowners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bentley|first=Jerry|title=Traditions and Encounters|isbn=978-0-07-325230-8|pages=301\u2013302}}</ref> The hierarchy that held this system of government together was reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', samurai and their subordinates.\n\nEach shogunate was dynamic, not static. Power was constantly shifting and authority was often ambiguous. The study of the ebbs and flows in this complex history continues to occupy the attention of scholars. Each shogunate encountered competition. Sources of competition included the Emperor and the court aristocracy, the remnants of the imperial governmental systems, the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', the ''[[sh\u014den]]'' system, the great temples and shrines, the ''[[s\u014dhei]]'', the ''[[shugo]]'' and ''[[jit\u014d]]'', the ''[[jizamurai]]'' and early modern ''daimy\u014d''. Each shogunate reflected the necessity of new ways of balancing the changing requirements of central and regional authorities.<ref>Mass, J. et al., eds. (1985). ''The Bakufu in Japanese History'', p. 189.</ref>\n\n== Relationship with the emperor ==\n[[File:Imperial Seal of Japan.svg|thumb|left|100px|Imperial Seal of Japan]]\n{{main|Emperor of Japan}}\n\nSince [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] turned the figure of the shogun into a permanent and hereditary position and until the [[Meiji Restoration]] there were two ruling classes in Japan: 1. the emperor or {{nihongo|''[[tenn\u014d]]''|\u5929\u7687|extra=lit. \"Heavenly Sovereign\"}},<ref name=\"Mitchelhill\">Mitchelhill & Green, 2003:59.</ref> who acted as \"chief priest\" of the official religion of the country, [[Shinto]], and 2. the shogun, head of the army who also enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority.<ref name=\"Kuno245\">Kuno, 2007:245.</ref> Although in theory the shogun was an emperor's servant, it became the true power behind the throne.<ref>Davis, 2001:205.</ref>\n\nNo shogun tried to usurp the throne, even when they had at their disposal the military power of the territory. There were two reasons primarily:<ref>Roth, 2007:103.</ref>\n\n*Theoretically the shogun received the power of the emperor, so this was his symbol of authority.\n*There was a sentimentalist tradition created by priests and religious who traced the imperial line from the \"age of the gods\" into an \"eternal line unbroken by the times.\" According to Japanese mythology, the emperor was a direct descendant of [[Amaterasu]], goddess of the [[sun]].\n\nUnable to usurp the throne, the shoguns sought throughout history to keep the emperor away from the country's political activity, relegating them from the sphere of influence. One of the few powers that the imperial house could retain was that of being able to \"control time\" through the designation of the Japanese [[Neng\u014d]] or Eras and the issuance of calendars.<ref>Fi\u00e9v\u00e9 & Waley, 2003:235.</ref>\n\nThis is a highlight of two historical attempts of the emperor to recover the power they enjoyed before the establishment of the shogunate. In 1219 the [[Emperor Go-Toba]] accused the H\u014dj\u014d as outlaws. Imperial troops mobilized, leading to the [[J\u014dky\u016b War]] (1219-1221), which would culminate in the third [[Battle of Uji (1221)]]. During this, the imperial troops were defeated and the emperor Go-Toba was exiled.<ref name=\"Pag41\">Turnbull, 2006a:41.</ref> With the defeat of Go-Toba, the samurai government over the country was confirmed.<ref name=\"Pag41\" /> At the beginning of the fourteenth century the [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] decided to rebel, but the H\u014dj\u014d, who were then regents, sent an army from Kamakura. The emperor fled before the troops arrived and took the imperial insignia.<ref name=\"Pag43\">Turnbull, 2006a:43.</ref> The shogun named his own emperor, giving rise to the era {{nihongo|''[[Nanbokuch\u014d]]''|\u5357\u5317\u671d|extra=lit. \"Southern and Northern Courts\"}}.\n\nDuring the 1850s and 1860s, the shogunate was severely pressured both abroad and by foreign powers. It was then that various groups angry with the shogunate for the concessions made to the various European countries found in the figure of the emperor an ally through which they could expel the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] from power. The motto of this movement was {{nihongo|''[[Sonn\u014d j\u014di]]''|\u5c0a\u738b\u6518\u5937|extra=\"Revere the Emperor, Eject the Barbarians\"}} and they finally succeeded in 1868, when imperial power was restored after centuries of being in the shadow of the country's political life.<ref>Fi\u00e9v\u00e9 & Waley, 2003:236.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nUpon Japan's surrender after World War II, American Army General [[Douglas MacArthur]] became Japan's ''de facto'' ruler during the years of occupation. So great was his influence in Japan that he has been dubbed the {{Nihongo||\u5916\u4eba\u5c06\u8ecd|Gaijin Sh\u014dgun}}.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Valley|first1=David J.|title=Gaijin Shogun : Gen.
