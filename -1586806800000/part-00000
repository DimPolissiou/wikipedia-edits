Disparate companies of [[English people|English]] [[Militia|militiamen]] from nearby settlements marched to the town's defense, two of which were drawn into Native ambushes and suffered heavy losses. The battle was the last major Native American victory in King Philip's War before their final defeat in southern [[New England]] in August 1676.   \n== Background ==\nThe winter of 1676 brought a lull in the fighting of King Philip's War in eastern [[Massachusetts]], but come spring Native American forces resumed their raids on the area's [[Puritans|Puritan]] towns. The Native coalition attacked the strategically significant fort at [[Marlborough, Massachusetts]] on both March 16 and April 7, destroying most of the settlement and forcing a partial evacuation of its residents. In response to these attacks, as well as the recent abandonment of [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]] and [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]], the colonial Council of War dispatched Captain Samuel Wadsworth and fifty men to Marlborough to reinforce the frontier. Wadsworth's company passed through Sudbury on the evening of April 20.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Schultz, Tougias|first=|title=King Philip's War: The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict|publisher=The Countryman Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=207-213}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a large group of Native warriors departed the Nipmuc stronghold of [[Mount Wachusett]] and gathered on Pompositticut Hill (also known as Summer Hill in what is now [[Maynard, Massachusetts]]).

Where guessing correctly is a form of witchcraft, counsel cannot be put on airs.''\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n''The second rule: Accept both your profits and regrets. It is best to seize what comes to hand when it comes, and not expect that your good fortune and the favorable circumstances will last.''\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n''The third rule: Profit in the share market is goblin treasure: at one moment, it is [[carbuncle (gemstone)|carbuncle]]s, the next it is coal; one moment diamonds, and the next pebbles. Sometimes, they are the tears that Aurora leaves on the sweet morning's grass, at other times, they are just tears.''\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n''The fourth rule: He who wishes to become rich from this game must have both money and patience.''\n</blockquote>\n\nConfusion de Confusiones remained little known until the German economist [[Richard Ehrenberg]] published an influential essay in the 1892 Jahrb\u00fccher f\u00fcr National\u00f6konomie und Statistik, \u201cDie Amsterdame Aktienspekulation un 17.

Whereas his self-titled debut album ''[[Bob Dylan (album)|Bob Dylan]]'' had contained only two original songs, ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' represented the beginning of Dylan's writing contemporary words to traditional melodies. Eleven of the thirteen songs on the album are Dylan's original compositions. The album opens with \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\", which became an anthem of the 1960s, and an international hit for folk trio [[Peter, Paul & Mary]] soon after the release of ''Freewheelin{{'}}''. The album featured several other songs which came to be regarded as among Dylan's best compositions and classics of the 1960s folk scene: \"[[Girl from the North Country]]\", \"[[Masters of War]]\", \"[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]\" and \"[[Don't Think Twice, It's All Right]]\".\n\nDylan's lyrics embraced news stories drawn from headlines about the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and he articulated anxieties about the fear of [[nuclear warfare]]. Balancing this political material were love songs, sometimes bitter and accusatory, and material that features [[surreal humor]]. ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' showcased Dylan's songwriting talent for the first time, propelling him to national and international fame. The success of the album and Dylan's subsequent recognition led to his being named as \"Spokesman of a Generation\", a label Dylan repudiated.\n\n''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'' reached number 22 in the US (eventually going platinum), and became a number-one album in the UK in 1964. In 2003, the album was ranked number 97 on [[Rolling Stone]] Magazine's list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]]. In 2002, ''Freewheelin''' was one of the first 50 recordings chosen by the [[Library of Congress]] to be added to the [[National Recording Registry]].\n\n==Recording sessions==\nNeither critics nor the public took much notice of Dylan's self-titled debut album, ''[[Bob Dylan (album)|Bob Dylan]]'', which sold only 5,000 copies in its first year, just enough to break even. In a pointed rebuke to [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]], who had signed Dylan to [[Columbia Records]], some within the company referred to the singer as \"Hammond's Folly\"{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 31, track 3}} and suggested dropping his contract. Hammond defended Dylan vigorously and was determined that Dylan's second album should be a success.<ref>{{harvnb|Scaduto|2001|p=110}}</ref> The recording of ''Freewheelin''' took place from April 1962 to April 1963, and the album was assembled from eight recording sessions in the Columbia Records Studio A, 799 Seventh Avenue, in New York City.<ref name=\"encyclopedia1\">{{harvnb|Gray|2006|pp=243\u2013244}}</ref>\n\n===Political and personal background===\n[[File:Joan Baez Bob Dylan.jpg|alt=|thumb|Dylan had become famous for his political songwriting\u2014he is seen here in 1963 playing at a civil rights march with [[Joan Baez]]]]\nMany critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers [[Clinton Heylin]] connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend [[Suze Rotolo]] in January 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|pp=88\u201389}}</ref> Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rotolo|2009|pp=26\u201340}}</ref> Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=90}}</ref>\n\nDylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art.<ref>{{harvnb|Rotolo|2009|pp=168\u2013169}}</ref><ref group=a>Rotolo writes that \"my mother did not approve of Bob at all. He paid her no homage and she paid him none\". Rotolo suspected that her mother presented her with the trip to Italy \"as a ''fait accompli''\" to lure her away from her relationship with Dylan. See {{harvnb|Rotolo|2009|p=169}}</ref> Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York.<ref>{{harvnb|Rotolo|2009|pp=171\u2013181}}</ref> She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on ''Freewheelin''' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|pp=99\u2013101}}</ref> In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \"chicks\", and she resented being regarded as \"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\".<ref>{{harvnb|Rotolo|2009|p=254}}</ref>\n\nThe speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on [[WBAI]] in June 1962, [[Pete Seeger]] described Dylan as \"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called [[the Bitter End]].\"<ref name = \"Heylin p.92\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=92}}</ref> Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with ''[[Sing Out!]]'' magazine, Dylan said, \"The songs are there. They exist all by themselves just waiting for someone to write them down. I just put them down on paper. If I didn't do it, somebody else would.\"<ref>''Sing Out!'', October\u2013November 1962, quoted in {{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=122}}</ref>\n\n===Recording in New York===\nDylan began work on his second album at Columbia's Studio A in New York on April 24, 1962. The album was provisionally entitled ''Bob Dylan's Blues'', and as late as July 1962, this would remain the working title.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|pp=98\u201399}}</ref> At this session, Dylan recorded four of his own compositions: \"Sally Gal\", \"[[The Death of Emmett Till]]\", \"Rambling, Gambling Willie\", and \"[[Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues]]\". He also recorded two traditional folk songs, \"Going To New Orleans\" and \"Corrina, Corrina\", and [[Hank Williams]]' \"(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle\".<ref name = \"Heylin 30\">{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=30}}</ref>\n\nReturning to Studio A the following day, Dylan recorded his new song about [[fallout shelter]]s, \"[[Let Me Die In My Footsteps]]\". Other original compositions followed: \"Rocks and Gravel\", \"Talking Hava Negiliah Blues\", \"Talking Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues\", and two more takes of \"Sally Gal\". Dylan recorded cover versions of \"Wichita\", [[Big Joe Williams]]' \"[[Baby, Please Don't Go]]\", and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"Milk Cow's Calf's Blues\".<ref name = \" Heylin 30\"/> Because Dylan's songwriting talent was developing so rapidly, nothing from the April sessions appeared on ''Freewheelin'''.<ref name=\"encyclopedia1\"/>\n\nThe recording sessions at Studio A resumed on July 9, when Dylan recorded \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\", a song that he had first performed live at [[Gerde's Folk City]] on April 16.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=29}}</ref> Dylan also recorded \"Bob Dylan's Blues\", \"Down the Highway\", and \"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\", all of which ended up on ''Freewheelin''', plus one other original composition, \"Baby, I'm in the Mood for You\", which did not.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=32}}</ref>\n\nAt this point, music manager [[Albert Grossman]] began to take an interest in Dylan's business affairs. Grossman persuaded Dylan to transfer the publishing rights of his songs from Duchess Music, whom he had signed a contract with in January 1962, to Witmark Music, a division of Warner's music publishing operation. Dylan signed a contract with Witmark on July 13, 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|pp=94\u201395}}</ref> Unknown to Dylan, Grossman had also negotiated a deal with Witmark. This gave Grossman fifty percent of Witmark's share of the publishing income generated by any songwriter Grossman had brought to the company. This \"secret deal\" resulted in a bitter legal battle between Dylan and Grossman in the 1980s.<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|pp=118\u2013119}}</ref>\n\nAlbert Grossman became Dylan's manager on August 20, 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=284}}</ref> Since Dylan was under twenty-one when he had signed his contract with CBS, Grossman argued that the contract was invalid and had to be re-negotiated. Instead, Hammond responded by inviting Dylan to his office and persuading him to sign a \"reaffirment\"\u2014agreeing to abide by the original contract. This effectively neutralized Grossman's strategy, and led to some animosity between Grossman and Hammond.<ref name=\"highway124\">{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=124}}</ref> Grossman enjoyed a reputation in the folk scene of being commercially aggressive, generating more income and defending his clients' interests more fiercely than \"the nicer, more amateurish managers in the Village\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=283}}</ref> Dylan critic Andy Gill has suggested that Grossman encouraged Dylan to become more reclusive and aloof, even paranoid.<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1999|p=20}}</ref>\n[[File:Carnegie Hall, NYC.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|While recording ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' in New York, Dylan had his first performance at [[Carnegie Hall]]]]\nOn September 22, Dylan appeared for the first time at [[Carnegie Hall]], part of an all-star hootenanny. On this occasion, he premiered his new composition \"[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]\",<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=33}}</ref> a complex and powerful song built upon the question and answer refrain pattern of the traditional British ballad \"[[Lord Randall]]\". \"Hard Rain\" would gain added resonance one month later, when [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] appeared on national television on October 22, and announced the discovery of Soviet missiles on the island of Cuba, initiating the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. In the sleeve notes on the ''Freewheelin''' album, [[Nat Hentoff]] quotes Dylan as saying that he wrote \"Hard Rain\" in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis: \"Every line in it is actually the start of a whole new song. But when I wrote it, I thought I wouldn't have enough time alive to write all those songs so I put all I could into this one\".<ref name=Hentoff>{{harvnb|Hentoff|1963}}</ref> In fact, Dylan had written the song more than a month before the crisis broke.\n\nDylan resumed work on ''Freewheelin''' at Columbia's Studio A on October 26, when a major innovation took place\u2014Dylan made his first studio recordings with a backing band. Accompanied by [[Dick Wellstood]] on piano, Howie Collins and [[Bruce Langhorne]] on guitar, [[Leonard Gaskin]] on bass, and [[Herb Lovelle]] on drums, Dylan recorded three songs. Several takes of Dylan's \"[[Mixed-Up Confusion]]\" and [[Arthur Crudup]]'s \"[[That's All Right|That's All Right Mama]]\" were deemed unusable,<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|pp=33\u201334}}</ref> but a master take of \"Corrina, Corrina\" was selected for the final album. An 'alternate take' of \"Corrina, Corrina\" from the same session would also be selected for the b-side of \"Mixed Up Confusion\", Dylan's first electric single issued later in the year. At the next recording session on November 1, the band included [[Art Davis]] on bass, while jazz guitarist [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]] replaced Howie Collins. \"Mixed-Up Confusion\" and \"That's All Right Mama\" were re-recorded, and again the results were deemed unsatisfactory. A take of the third song, \"Rocks and Gravel\", was selected for the album, but the track was subsequently dropped.<ref name=Heylin34>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=34}}</ref>\n\nOn November 14, Dylan resumed work with his backup band, this time with Gene Ramey on bass, devoting most of the session to recording \"Mixed-Up Confusion\". Although this track did not appear on ''Freewheelin''', it was released as a single on December 14, 1962, and then swiftly withdrawn.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=35}}</ref> Unlike the other material which Dylan recorded between 1961 and 1964, \"Mixed-Up Confusion\" attempted a [[rockabilly]] sound. [[Cameron Crowe]] described it as \"a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Sun Records]]\".<ref name = \"Cameron\">{{harvnb|Crowe|1985}}</ref>\n\nAlso recorded on November 14 was the new composition \"[[Don't Think Twice, It's All Right]]\" ([[Clinton Heylin]] writes that, although the sleeve notes of ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' describe this song as being accompanied by a backing band, no band is audible on the released version).<ref name=Hentoff /><ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=104}}</ref> Langhorne then accompanied Dylan on three more original compositions: \"[[Ballad of Hollis Brown]]\", \"Kingsport Town\", and \"Whatcha Gonna Do\", but these performances were not included on ''Freewheelin'''.<ref name=Heylin34/>\n\nDylan held another session at Studio A on December 6. Five songs, all original compositions, were recorded, three of which were eventually included on ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'': \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\", \"Oxford Town\", and \"I Shall Be Free\". Dylan also made another attempt at \"Whatcha Gonna Do\" and recorded a new song, \"Hero Blues\", but both songs were ultimately rejected and left unreleased.<ref name=Heylin34/>\n\n===Traveling to England===\nTwelve days later, Dylan made his first trip abroad. British TV director [[Philip Saville]] had heard Dylan perform in Greenwich Village, and invited him to take part in a [[BBC]] television drama: ''[[Madhouse on Castle Street]]''. Dylan arrived in London on December 17. In the play, Dylan performed \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and two other songs.<ref>{{harvnb|BBC TV|2007}}</ref> Dylan also immersed himself in the London folk scene, making contact with [[The Troubadour (London)|the Troubadour]] folk club organizer Anthea Joseph and folk singers [[Martin Carthy]] and [[Bob Davenport (singer)|Bob Davenport]]. \"I ran into some people in England who really knew those [traditional English] songs,\" Dylan recalled in 1984. \"Martin Carthy, another guy named [Bob] Davenport. Martin Carthy's incredible. I learned a lot of stuff from Martin.\"<ref>Loder, Kurt (1984), \"Interview with Kurt Loder, ''Rolling Stone''\", reprinted in {{harvnb|Cott|2006|pp=295\u2013296}}</ref>\n\nCarthy taught Dylan two English songs that would prove important for the ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' album. Carthy's arrangement of \"[[Scarborough Fair (ballad)|Scarborough Fair]]\" would be used by Dylan as the basis of his own composition, \"[[Girl from the North Country]]\". A 19th-century ballad commemorating the death of [[Sir John Franklin]] in 1847, \"[[Lady Franklin's Lament]]\", gave Dylan the melody for his composition \"[[Bob Dylan's Dream]]\". Both songs displayed Dylan's fast-growing ability to take traditional melodies and use them as a basis for highly personal songwriting.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref>\n\nFrom England, Dylan traveled to Italy, and joined Albert Grossman, who was touring with his client [[Odetta]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=127}}</ref> Dylan was also hoping to make contact with his girlfriend, Suze Rotolo, unaware that she had already left Italy and was on her way back to New York. Dylan worked on his new material, and when he returned to London, Martin Carthy received a surprise: \"When he came back from Italy, he'd written 'Girl From the North Country'; he came down to the Troubadour and said, 'Hey, here's \"Scarborough Fair\"' and he started playing this thing.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=110}}</ref>\n\n===Returning to New York===\nDylan flew back to New York on January 16, 1963.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=40}}</ref> In January and February, he recorded some of his new compositions in sessions for the folk magazine ''[[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]'', including a new anti-war song, \"Masters of War\", which he had composed in London.<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=142}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=117}}</ref> Dylan was happy to be reunited with Suze Rotolo, and he persuaded her to move back into the apartment they had shared on West 4th Street.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=114}}</ref>\n\nDylan's keenness to record his new material for ''Freewheelin''' paralleled a dramatic power struggle in the studio: Albert Grossman's determination to have [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] replaced as Dylan's producer at CBS. According to Dylan biographer [[Howard Sounes]], \"The two men could not have been more different. Hammond was a [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]], so relaxed during recording sessions that he sat with feet up, reading ''[[The New Yorker]]''. Grossman was a Jewish businessman with a shady past, hustling to become a millionaire.\"<ref name=\"highway124\"/>\n\nBecause of Grossman's hostility to Hammond, Columbia paired Dylan with a young, African-American jazz producer, [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]]. Wilson recalled: \"I didn't even particularly like folk music. I'd been recording [[Sun Ra]] and [[Coltrane]] ... I thought folk music was for the dumb guys. [Dylan] played like the dumb guys, but then these words came out. I was flabbergasted.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=115}}</ref> At a recording session on April 24, produced by Wilson, Dylan recorded five new compositions: \"Girl from the North Country\", \"Masters of War\", \"Talkin' World War III Blues\", \"Bob Dylan's Dream\", and \"Walls of Red Wing\". \"Walls of Red Wing\" was ultimately rejected, but the other four were included in a revised album sequence.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=43}}</ref>\n\nThe final drama of recording ''Freewheelin''' occurred when Dylan was scheduled to appear on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on May 12, 1963. Dylan had told Sullivan he would perform \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\", but the \"head of program practices\" at [[CBS Television]] informed Dylan that this song was potentially libelous to the [[John Birch Society]], and asked him to perform another number. Rather than comply with TV censorship, Dylan refused to appear on the show.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=44}}</ref> There is disagreement between Dylan's biographers about the consequences of this censorship row. [[Anthony Scaduto]] writes that after ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' debacle, CBS lawyers were alarmed to discover that the controversial song was to be included on Dylan's new album, only a few weeks from its release date. They insisted that the song be dropped, and four songs (\"John Birch\", \"Let Me Die In My Footsteps\", \"Rambling Gambling Willie\", \"Rocks and Gravel\") on the album were replaced with Dylan's newer compositions recorded in April (\"Girl from the North Country\", \"Masters of War\", \"Talkin' World War III Blues\", \"Bob Dylan's Dream\"). Scaduto writes that Dylan felt \"crushed\" by being compelled to submit to censorship, but he was in no position to argue.<ref>{{harvnb|Scaduto|2001|p=141}}</ref>\n\nAccording to biographer [[Clinton Heylin]], \"There remains a common belief that [Dylan] was forced by Columbia to pull 'Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues' from the album ''after'' he walked out on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''.\" However, the \"revised\" version of ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'' was released on May 27, 1963; this would have given Columbia Records only two weeks to recut the album, reprint the record sleeves, and press and package enough copies of the new version to fill orders. Heylin suggests that CBS had probably forced Dylan to withdraw \"John Birch\" from the album some weeks earlier and that Dylan had responded by recording his new material on April 24.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|pp=114\u2013117}}</ref> Whether the songs were substituted before or after ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', critics agree that the new material gave the album a more personal feel, distanced from the traditional folk-blues material which had dominated his first album, ''Bob Dylan''.<ref>{{harvnb|Scaduto|2001|p=142}}</ref>\n\nA few copies of the original pressing of the LP with the four deleted tracks have turned up over the years, despite Columbia's supposed destruction of all copies during the pre-release phase (all copies found were in the standard album sleeve with the revised track selection). Other permutations of the ''Freewheelin''' album include versions with a different running order of the tracks on the album, and a Canadian version of the album that listed the tracks in the wrong order.<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=244}}</ref><ref name=Thompson>{{harvnb|Thompson|2002|pp=12\u201313}}</ref> The original pressing of ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'' is considered the most valuable and rarest record in America,<ref name=Thompson/> with one copy having sold for $35,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Sharp|2007}}</ref>\n\n==Songs and themes==\n===\"Blowin' in the Wind\"===\n{{Main|Blowin' in the Wind}}\n\"Blowin' in the Wind\" is among Dylan's most celebrated compositions. In his sleeve notes for ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991]]'', John Bauldie writes that it was [[Pete Seeger]] who first identified the melody of \"Blowin' in the Wind\" as Dylan's adaptation of the old Negro spiritual \"No More Auction Block\". According to Alan Lomax's ''The Folk Songs of North America'', the song originated in Canada and was sung by former slaves who fled there after [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Britain abolished slavery in 1833]]. In 1978, Dylan acknowledged the source when he told journalist Marc Rowland: \"'Blowin' in the Wind' has always been a spiritual. I took it off a song called 'No More Auction Block'\u2014that's a spiritual and 'Blowin' in the Wind' follows the same feeling.\"<ref name=bauldie>{{harvnb|Bauldie|1991}}</ref> Dylan's performance of \"No More Auction Block\" was recorded at the Gaslight Cafe in October 1962, and appeared on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991]]''.\n\nCritic Andy Gill wrote: {{\"'}}Blowin' in the Wind' marked a huge jump in Dylan's songwriting: for the first time, Dylan discovered the effectiveness of moving from the particular to the general. Whereas 'The Ballad of Donald White' would become completely redundant as soon as the eponymous criminal was executed, a song as vague as 'Blowin' in the Wind' could be applied to just about any freedom issue. It remains the song with which Dylan's name is most inextricably linked, and safeguarded his reputation as a civil libertarian through any number of changes in style and attitude.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1999|p=23}}</ref>\n\n\"Blowin' in the Wind\" became world-famous when [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] issued the song as a single three weeks after the release of ''Freewheelin{{'}}''. They and Dylan both shared the same manager: Albert Grossman. The single sold a phenomenal three hundred thousand copies in the first week of release. On July 13, 1963, it reached number two on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart with sales exceeding one million copies.<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=135}}</ref> Dylan later recalled that he was astonished when [[Peter Yarrow]] told him he was going to make $5,000 from the publishing rights.<ref name = \"Cameron\"/>\n\n===\"Girl from the North Country\"===\n{{Main|Girl from the North Country}}\nThere has been much speculation in print about the identity of the girl in the song. Clinton Heylin states that the most frequently mooted candidates are Echo Helstrom, an early girlfriend of Dylan from his hometown of [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]], and [[Suze Rotolo]], for whom Dylan was pining as he finished the song in Italy.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|pp=120\u2013121}}</ref> Howard Sounes suggests the girl Dylan probably had in mind was Bonnie Beecher, a girlfriend of Dylan's when he was at the [[University of Minnesota]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=47}}</ref><ref group=a>An important recording of Dylan playing traditional material was taped in Beecher's apartment in December 1961. Misnamed the \"Minneapolis Hotel Tape\", the songs were released on the ''[[Great White Wonder]]'' bootleg. See {{harvnb|Gray|2006|pp=590\u2013591}}. Beecher subsequently married counter-cultural figure [[Wavy Gravy]].</ref> Musicologist Todd Harvey notes that Dylan not only took the tune of \"[[Scarborough Fair (ballad)|Scarborough Fair]]\", which he learned from Martin Carthy in London but also adapted the theme of that song. \"Scarborough Fair\" derives from \"[[The Elfin Knight]]\" ([[List of the Child Ballads|Child Ballad Number 2]]), which was first transcribed in 1670. In the song, a supernatural character poses a series of questions to an innocent, requesting her to perform impossible tasks. Harvey points out that Dylan \"retains the idea of the listener being sent upon a task, a northern place setting, and an antique lyric quality\".<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|pp=33\u201334}}</ref> Dylan returned to this song on ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969), recording it as a duet with [[Johnny Cash]], and he returned to it again in the studio with an unreleased organ and sax version in 1978.\n\n===\"Masters of War\"===\n{{Main|Masters of War}}\nA scathing song directed against the war industry, \"Masters of War\" is based on [[Jean Ritchie]]'s arrangement of \"[[Nottamun Town]]\", an English riddle song. It was written in late 1962 while Dylan was in London; eyewitnesses (including Martin Carthy and Anthea Joseph) recall Dylan performing the song in folk clubs at the time. Ritchie would later assert her claim on the song's arrangement; according to one Dylan biography, the suit was settled when Ritchie received $5,000 from Dylan's lawyers.<ref name=\"Sounes 2001 132\">{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=132}}</ref>\n\n===\"Down the Highway\"===\nDylan composed this song in the form of a [[Twelve-bar blues|12-bar blues]]. In the sleeve notes of ''Freewheelin{{'}}'', Dylan explained to [[Nat Hentoff]]: \"What made the real blues singers so great is that they were able to state all the problems they had; but at the same time, they were standing outside of them and could look at them. And in that way, they had them beat.\"<ref name=Hentoff/> Into this song, Dylan injected one explicit mention of an absence that was troubling him: the sojourn of Suze Rotolo in [[Perugia]]: \"My baby took my heart from me/ She packed it all up in a suitcase/ Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.\"\n\n===\"Bob Dylan's Blues\"===\n{{Main|Bob Dylan's Blues}}\nDylan begins this track with a spoken intro where he describes the origins of folk songs in a satirical vein: \"most of the songs that are written uptown in [[Tin Pan Alley]], that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays\".<ref name=Shelton155>{{harvnb|Shelton|2003|p=155}}</ref> What follows has been characterized as an absurd, improvised blues<ref name=Shelton155/> which Dylan, in the sleeve notes, describes as \"a really off-the-cuff-song. I start with an idea and then I feel what follows. Best way I can describe this one is that it's sort of like walking by a side street. You gaze in and walk on.\"<ref name=Hentoff/> Harvey points out that Dylan subsequently elaborated this style of self-deprecatory, [[absurdist humor]] into more complex songs, such as \"I Shall Be Free No.10\" (1964).<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=17}}</ref>\n\n===\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\"===\n{{Main|A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall}}\nDylan was only 21 years old when he wrote one of his most complex songs, \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\", often referred to as \"Hard Rain\". Dylan is said to have premiered \"Hard Rain\" at [[the Gaslight Cafe]], where Village performer Peter Blankfield recalled: \"He put out these pieces of loose-leaf paper ripped out of a spiral notebook. And he starts singing ['Hard Rain'] ... He finished singing it, and no one could say anything. The length of it, the episodic sense of it. Every line kept building and bursting\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=102}}</ref> Dylan performed \"Hard Rain\" days later at [[Carnegie Hall]] on September 22, 1962, as part of a concert organized by [[Pete Seeger]]. The song gained added resonance during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], just one month after Dylan's first performance of \"Hard Rain\", when U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] gave his warning to the Soviet Union over their deployment of [[nuclear missiles]] in Cuba. Critics have interpreted the lyric 'hard rain' as a reference to [[nuclear fallout]], but Dylan resisted the specificity of this interpretation. In a radio interview with [[Studs Terkel]] in 1963, Dylan said, <blockquote>\"No, it's not atomic rain, it's just a hard rain. It isn't the fallout rain. I mean some sort of end that's just gotta happen \u2026 In the last verse, when I say, 'the pellets of poison are flooding the waters', that means all the lies that people get told on their radios and in their newspapers.\"<ref>Terkel, Studs (1963). \"Radio Interview with Studs Terkel, WFMT (Chicago),\" reprinted in {{harvnb|Cott|2006|pp=6\u20137}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany people were astonished by the power and complexity of this work. For [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]], who had given Dylan an important boost in his 1961 review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', this song was \"a landmark in topical, folk-based songwriting. Here blooms the promised fruit of the 1950s poetry-jazz fusion of [[Allen Ginsberg|Ginsberg]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti|Ferlinghetti]], and [[Kenneth Rexroth|Rexroth]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Shelton|2003|pp=155\u2013156}}</ref> Folk singer [[Dave Van Ronk]] later commented: \"I was acutely aware that it represented the beginning of an artistic revolution.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1999|p=31}}</ref> [[Pete Seeger]] expressed the opinion that this song would last longer than any other written by Dylan.<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=122}}</ref>\n\n===\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\"===\n{{Main|Don't Think Twice, It's All Right}}\nDylan wrote this song on hearing from Suze Rotolo that she was considering staying in Italy indefinitely,<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=101}}</ref> and he used a melody he adapted from [[Paul Clayton (folksinger)|Paul Clayton]]'s song \"Who's Gonna Buy You Ribbons (When I'm Gone)\".<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=24}}</ref> In the ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' sleeve notes, Dylan comments: \"It isn't a love song. It's a statement that maybe you can say to make yourself feel better. It's as if you were talking to yourself.\"\n\nDylan's contemporaries hailed the song as a masterpiece: Bob Spitz quotes [[Paul Stookey]] saying \"I thought it was a masterful statement\", while [[Dave Van Ronk]] called it \"self-pitying but brilliant\".<ref>{{harvnb|Spitz|1989|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|pp=25\u201326}}</ref> Dylan biographer [[Howard Sounes]] commented: \"The greatness of the song was in the cleverness of the language. The phrase \"don't think twice, it's all right\" could be snarled, sung with resignation, or delivered with an ambiguous mixture of bitterness and regret. Seldom have the contradictory emotions of a thwarted lover been so well expressed, and the song transcended the autobiographical origins of Dylan's pain.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=120}}</ref>\n\n===\"Bob Dylan's Dream\"===\n{{Main|Bob Dylan's Dream}}\n\"Bob Dylan's Dream\" was based on the melody of the traditional \"[[Lady Franklin's Lament]]\", in which the title character dreams of finding her husband, Arctic explorer [[Sir John Franklin]], alive and well. (Sir John Franklin had vanished on an expedition searching for the [[North West Passage]] in 1845; a stone [[cairn]] on [[King William Island]] detailing his demise was found by a later expedition in 1859.) Todd Harvey points out that Dylan transforms the song into a personal journey, yet he retains both the theme and the mood of the original ballad. The world outside is depicted as stormy and harsh, and Dylan's most fervent wish, like Lady Franklin's, is to be reunited with departed companions and to relive the fond memories they represent.<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=19}}</ref>\n\n===\"Oxford Town\"===\n{{Main|Oxford Town}}\n\"Oxford Town\" is Dylan's sardonic account of events at the [[University of Mississippi]] in September 1962. [[U.S. Air Force]] veteran [[James Meredith]] was the first black student to enroll at the [[University of Mississippi]], located a mile from [[Oxford, Mississippi]]. When Meredith first tried to attend classes at the school, some Mississippians pledged to keep the university segregated, including the state governor [[Ross Barnett]]. Ultimately, the University of Mississippi had to be integrated with the help of U.S. federal troops. Dylan responded rapidly: his song was published in the November 1962 issue of ''[[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1999|pp=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\n===\"Talkin' World War III Blues\"===\nThe \"talkin' blues\" was a style of improvised songwriting that [[Woody Guthrie]] had developed to a high plane.

He recorded five takes of the song and the fifth was selected for the album. The format of the \"talkin' blues\" permitted Dylan to address the serious subject of nuclear annihilation with humor, and \"without resorting to his finger-pointing or apocalyptical-prophetic persona\".<ref name=\"Harvey103\"/>\n\n===\"Corrina, Corrina\"===\n{{Main|Corrine, Corrina}}\n\"Corrina, Corrina\" was recorded by [[the Mississippi Sheiks]], and by their leader [[Bo Carter]] in 1928. The song was covered by artists as diverse as [[Bob Wills]], [[Big Joe Turner]], and [[Doc Watson]]. Dylan's version borrows phrases from a few [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] songs: \"Stones In My Passway\", \"32-20 Blues\", and \"Hellhound On My Trail\".<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|pp=20\u201322}}</ref> An alternate take of the song was used as a B-side for his \"[[Mixed-Up Confusion]]\" single.<ref>{{harvnb|Shelton|2003|pp=173, 178}}</ref>\n\n===\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\"===\n{{Main|Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance}}\n\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\" is based on \"Honey, Won't You Allow Me One More Chance?\", a song dating back to the 1890s that was popularized by Henry Thomas in his 1928 recording. \"However, Thomas's original provided no more than a song title and a notion\", writes Heylin, \"which Dylan turned into a personal plea to an absent lover to allow him 'one more chance to get along with you.'

According to Todd Harvey, Dylan's version draws its melody from the Guthrie recording but omits its signature chorus (\"We'll soon be free/When the Lord will call us home\").<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=50}}</ref> Critics have been divided about the worth of this final song. Robert Shelton dismissed the song as \"a decided anticlimax. Although the album has at least a half dozen blockbusters, two of the weakest songs are tucked in at the end, like shirttails.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Shelton|2003|p=157}}</ref> Todd Harvey has argued that by placing the song at the close of the ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' LP, Dylan ends on a note of levity which is a relief after the weighty sentiments expressed in several songs on the album.<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=52}}</ref>\n\n==Outtakes==\nThe known outtakes from the ''Freewheelin''' album are as follows.

In May 1963, Dylan performed with [[Joan Baez]] at the Monterey Folk Festival, where she joined him on stage for a duet of a new Dylan song, \"[[With God on Our Side (song)|With God on Our Side]]\". Baez was at the pinnacle of her fame, having appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine the previous November. The performance not only gave Dylan and his songs a new prominence, it also marked the beginning of a romantic relationship between Baez and Dylan, the start of what Dylan biographer Sounes termed \"one of the most celebrated love affairs of the decade\".<ref name=\"Sounes 2001 132\"/>\n\n''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'' was released at the end of May. According to Scaduto, it was an immediate success, selling 10,000 copies a month and bringing Dylan an income of about $2,500 a month.<ref name=\"Scaduto144\">{{harvnb|Scaduto|2001|p=144}}</ref> An article by Nat Hentoff on folk music appeared in the June issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine and devoted considerable space to Dylan's achievements, calling him \"the most vital of the younger citybillies\".<ref name=\"Scaduto144\"/>\n\nIn July, Dylan appeared at the second [[Newport Folk Festival]]. That weekend, [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]'s rendition of \"Blowin' in the Wind\" reached number two on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s pop chart. Baez was also at Newport, appearing twice on stage with Dylan. The combination of the chart success of \"Blowin' in the Wind\", and the glamor of Baez and Dylan singing together generated excitement about Dylan and his new album. [[Tom Paxton]] recalled: \"That was a big breakout festival for Bob. The buzz kept growing exponentially and it was like a coronation of Bob and Joan. They were King and Queen of the festival\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=136}}</ref> His friend [[Bob Fass]] recalled that after Newport, Dylan told him that \"suddenly I just can't walk around without a disguise. I used to walk around and go wherever I wanted. But now it's gotten very weird.

During his dispute with Albert Grossman, Dylan stated in a deposition: \"Although I didn't know it at the time, the second album was destined to become a great success because it was to include 'Blowin' in the Wind'.\"<ref>Dylan's deposition of October 15, 1984, in the case Albert B.

[[John Lennon]] recalled: \"In Paris in 1964 was the first time I ever heard Dylan at all. [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] got the record (''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'') from a French DJ.

Before the album's release, he was one among many folk-singers. Afterwards, at the age of 22, Dylan was regarded as a major artist, perhaps even a spokesman for disaffected youth. As one critic described the transformation, \"In barely over a year, a young plagiarist had been reborn as a songwriter of substance, and his first album of fully realized original material got the 1960s off their musical starting block.\"<ref name=\"Humphries43\">{{harvnb|Humphries|1991|p=43}}</ref> Janet Maslin wrote of the album: \"These were the songs that established him as the voice of his generation\u2014someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about [[nuclear disarmament]] and the growing [[Civil Rights Movement]]: his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1981|p=220}}</ref>\n\nThis title of \"Spokesman of a Generation\" was viewed by Dylan with disgust in later years. He came to feel it was a label that the media had pinned on him, and in his autobiography, ''[[Chronicles, Volume One|Chronicles]]'', Dylan wrote: \"The press never let up. Once in a while I would have to rise up and offer myself for an interview so they wouldn't beat the door down. Later an article would hit the streets with the headline \"Spokesman Denies That He's A Spokesman\". I felt like a piece of meat that someone had thrown to the dogs.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dylan|2004|p=119}}</ref>\n\nThe album secured for Dylan an \"unstoppable cult following\" of fans who preferred the harshness of his performances to the softer cover versions released by other singers.<ref name=\"encyclopedia1\"/> [[Richard Williams (journalist)|Richard Williams]] has suggested that the richness of the imagery in ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' transformed Dylan into a key performer for a burgeoning college audience hungry for a new cultural complexity: \"For students whose exam courses included [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]] and [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]], here was something that flattered their expanding intellect while appealing to the teenage rebel in their early-sixties souls. [[James Dean]] had walked around reading [[James Joyce]]; here were both in a single package, the words and the attitude set to music.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1992|p=53}}</ref> Andy Gill adds that in the few months between the release of ''Freewheelin''' in May 1963, and Dylan's next album ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are A-Changin']]'' in January 1964, Dylan became the hottest property in American music, stretching the boundaries of what had been previously viewed as a collegiate folk music audience.<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1999|p=37}}</ref>\n\nCritical opinion about ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' has been consistently favorable in the years since its release. Dylan biographer [[Howard Sounes]] called it \"Bob Dylan's first great album\".<ref name=\"Sounes 2001 132\"/> In a survey of Dylan's work published by ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine in 2000, the ''Freewheelin\u2019'' album was described as \"easily the best of [Dylan's] acoustic albums and a quantum leap from his debut\u2014which shows the frantic pace at which Dylan's mind was moving.\" The magazine went on to comment, \"You can see why this album got The Beatles listening. The songs at its core must have sounded like communiques from another plane.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|2000|p=138}}</ref>\n\nFor Patrick Humphries, \"rarely has one album so effectively reflected the times which produced it. ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' spoke directly to the concerns of its audience. and addressed them in a mature and reflective manner: it mirrored the state of the nation.\"<ref name = \"Humphries43\"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]'s verdict on the album in the [[Allmusic]] guide was: \"It's hard to overestimate the importance of ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'', the record that firmly established Dylan as an unparalleled songwriter ... This is rich, imaginative music, capturing the sound and spirit of America as much as that of [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Hank Williams]], or [[Elvis Presley]]. Dylan, in many ways, recorded music that equaled this, but he never topped it.\"<ref name=\"erlewine\" />\n\nIn March 2000, [[Van Morrison]] told the Irish rock magazine ''[[Hot Press (magazine)|Hot Press]]'' about the impact that ''Freewheelin''' made on him: \"I think I heard it in a record shop in Smith Street. And I just thought it was incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it. That's what I thought at the time.

Whereas his self-titled debut album ''[[Bob Dylan (album)|Bob Dylan]]'' had contained only two original songs, ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' represented the beginning of Dylan's writing contemporary words to traditional melodies. Eleven of the thirteen songs on the album are Dylan's original compositions. The album opens with \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\", which became an anthem of the 1960s, and an international hit for folk trio [[Peter, Paul & Mary]] soon after the release of ''Freewheelin{{'}}''. The album featured several other songs which came to be regarded as among Dylan's best compositions and classics of the 1960s folk scene: \"[[Girl from the North Country]]\", \"[[Masters of War]]\", \"[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]\" and \"[[Don't Think Twice, It's All Right]]\".\n\nDylan's lyrics embraced news stories drawn from headlines about the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and he articulated anxieties about the fear of [[nuclear warfare]]. Balancing this political material were love songs, sometimes bitter and accusatory, and material that features [[surreal humor]]. ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' showcased Dylan's songwriting talent for the first time, propelling him to national and international fame. The success of the album and Dylan's subsequent recognition led to his being named as \"Spokesman of a Generation\", a label Dylan repudiated.\n\n''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'' reached number 22 in the US (eventually going platinum), and became a number-one album in the UK in 1964. In 2003, the album was ranked number 97 on [[Rolling Stone]] Magazine's list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]]. In 2002, ''Freewheelin''' was one of the first 50 recordings chosen by the [[Library of Congress]] to be added to the [[National Recording Registry]].\n\n==Recording sessions==\nNeither critics nor the public took much notice of Dylan's self-titled debut album, ''[[Bob Dylan (album)|Bob Dylan]]'', which sold only 5,000 copies in its first year, just enough to break even. In a pointed rebuke to [[John H.

Hammond defended Dylan vigorously and was determined that Dylan's second album should be a success.<ref>{{harvnb|Scaduto|2001|p=110}}</ref> The recording of ''Freewheelin''' took place from April 1962 to April 1963, and the album was assembled from eight recording sessions in the Columbia Records Studio A, 799 Seventh Avenue, in New York City.<ref name=\"encyclopedia1\">{{harvnb|Gray|2006|pp=243\u2013244}}</ref>\n\n===Political and personal background===\n[[File:Joan Baez Bob Dylan.jpg|alt=|thumb|Dylan had become famous for his political songwriting\u2014he is seen here in 1963 playing at a civil rights march with [[Joan Baez]]]]\nMany critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers [[Clinton Heylin]] connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend [[Suze Rotolo]] in January 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|pp=88\u201389}}</ref> Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rotolo|2009|pp=26\u201340}}</ref> Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=90}}</ref>\n\nDylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art.<ref>{{harvnb|Rotolo|2009|pp=168\u2013169}}</ref><ref group=a>Rotolo writes that \"my mother did not approve of Bob at all. He paid her no homage and she paid him none\". Rotolo suspected that her mother presented her with the trip to Italy \"as a ''fait accompli''\" to lure her away from her relationship with Dylan. See {{harvnb|Rotolo|2009|p=169}}</ref> Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York.<ref>{{harvnb|Rotolo|2009|pp=171\u2013181}}</ref> She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on ''Freewheelin''' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|pp=99\u2013101}}</ref> In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \"chicks\", and she resented being regarded as \"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\".<ref>{{harvnb|Rotolo|2009|p=254}}</ref>\n\nThe speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on [[WBAI]] in June 1962, [[Pete Seeger]] described Dylan as \"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called [[the Bitter End]].\"<ref name = \"Heylin p.92\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=92}}</ref> Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with ''[[Sing Out!]]'' magazine, Dylan said, \"The songs are there. They exist all by themselves just waiting for someone to write them down. I just put them down on paper. If I didn't do it, somebody else would.\"<ref>''Sing Out!'', October\u2013November 1962, quoted in {{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=122}}</ref>\n\n===Recording in New York===\nDylan began work on his second album at Columbia's Studio A in New York on April 24, 1962. The album was provisionally entitled ''Bob Dylan's Blues'', and as late as July 1962, this would remain the working title.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|pp=98\u201399}}</ref> At this session, Dylan recorded four of his own compositions: \"Sally Gal\", \"[[The Death of Emmett Till]]\", \"Rambling, Gambling Willie\", and \"[[Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues]]\". He also recorded two traditional folk songs, \"Going To New Orleans\" and \"Corrina, Corrina\", and [[Hank Williams]]' \"(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle\".<ref name = \"Heylin 30\">{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=30}}</ref>\n\nReturning to Studio A the following day, Dylan recorded his new song about [[fallout shelter]]s, \"[[Let Me Die In My Footsteps]]\". Other original compositions followed: \"Rocks and Gravel\", \"Talking Hava Negiliah Blues\", \"Talking Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues\", and two more takes of \"Sally Gal\". Dylan recorded cover versions of \"Wichita\", [[Big Joe Williams]]' \"[[Baby, Please Don't Go]]\", and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s \"Milk Cow's Calf's Blues\".<ref name = \" Heylin 30\"/> Because Dylan's songwriting talent was developing so rapidly, nothing from the April sessions appeared on ''Freewheelin'''.<ref name=\"encyclopedia1\"/>\n\nThe recording sessions at Studio A resumed on July 9, when Dylan recorded \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\", a song that he had first performed live at [[Gerde's Folk City]] on April 16.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=29}}</ref> Dylan also recorded \"Bob Dylan's Blues\", \"Down the Highway\", and \"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\", all of which ended up on ''Freewheelin''', plus one other original composition, \"Baby, I'm in the Mood for You\", which did not.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=32}}</ref>\n\nAt this point, music manager [[Albert Grossman]] began to take an interest in Dylan's business affairs. Grossman persuaded Dylan to transfer the publishing rights of his songs from Duchess Music, whom he had signed a contract with in January 1962, to Witmark Music, a division of Warner's music publishing operation. Dylan signed a contract with Witmark on July 13, 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|pp=94\u201395}}</ref> Unknown to Dylan, Grossman had also negotiated a deal with Witmark. This gave Grossman fifty percent of Witmark's share of the publishing income generated by any songwriter Grossman had brought to the company. This \"secret deal\" resulted in a bitter legal battle between Dylan and Grossman in the 1980s.<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|pp=118\u2013119}}</ref>\n\nAlbert Grossman became Dylan's manager on August 20, 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=284}}</ref> Since Dylan was under twenty-one when he had signed his contract with CBS, Grossman argued that the contract was invalid and had to be re-negotiated. Instead, Hammond responded by inviting Dylan to his office and persuading him to sign a \"reaffirment\"\u2014agreeing to abide by the original contract. This effectively neutralized Grossman's strategy, and led to some animosity between Grossman and Hammond.<ref name=\"highway124\">{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=124}}</ref> Grossman enjoyed a reputation in the folk scene of being commercially aggressive, generating more income and defending his clients' interests more fiercely than \"the nicer, more amateurish managers in the Village\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=283}}</ref> Dylan critic Andy Gill has suggested that Grossman encouraged Dylan to become more reclusive and aloof, even paranoid.<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1999|p=20}}</ref>\n[[File:Carnegie Hall, NYC.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright|While recording ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' in New York, Dylan had his first performance at [[Carnegie Hall]]]]\nOn September 22, Dylan appeared for the first time at [[Carnegie Hall]], part of an all-star hootenanny. On this occasion, he premiered his new composition \"[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]\",<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=33}}</ref> a complex and powerful song built upon the question and answer refrain pattern of the traditional British ballad \"[[Lord Randall]]\". \"Hard Rain\" would gain added resonance one month later, when [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] appeared on national television on October 22, and announced the discovery of Soviet missiles on the island of Cuba, initiating the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. In the sleeve notes on the ''Freewheelin''' album, [[Nat Hentoff]] quotes Dylan as saying that he wrote \"Hard Rain\" in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis: \"Every line in it is actually the start of a whole new song. But when I wrote it, I thought I wouldn't have enough time alive to write all those songs so I put all I could into this one\".<ref name=Hentoff>{{harvnb|Hentoff|1963}}</ref> In fact, Dylan had written the song more than a month before the crisis broke.\n\nDylan resumed work on ''Freewheelin''' at Columbia's Studio A on October 26, when a major innovation took place\u2014Dylan made his first studio recordings with a backing band. Accompanied by [[Dick Wellstood]] on piano, Howie Collins and [[Bruce Langhorne]] on guitar, [[Leonard Gaskin]] on bass, and [[Herb Lovelle]] on drums, Dylan recorded three songs. Several takes of Dylan's \"[[Mixed-Up Confusion]]\" and [[Arthur Crudup]]'s \"[[That's All Right|That's All Right Mama]]\" were deemed unusable,<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|pp=33\u201334}}</ref> but a master take of \"Corrina, Corrina\" was selected for the final album. An 'alternate take' of \"Corrina, Corrina\" from the same session would also be selected for the b-side of \"Mixed Up Confusion\", Dylan's first electric single issued later in the year. At the next recording session on November 1, the band included [[Art Davis]] on bass, while jazz guitarist [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]] replaced Howie Collins. \"Mixed-Up Confusion\" and \"That's All Right Mama\" were re-recorded, and again the results were deemed unsatisfactory. A take of the third song, \"Rocks and Gravel\", was selected for the album, but the track was subsequently dropped.<ref name=Heylin34>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=34}}</ref>\n\nOn November 14, Dylan resumed work with his backup band, this time with Gene Ramey on bass, devoting most of the session to recording \"Mixed-Up Confusion\". Although this track did not appear on ''Freewheelin''', it was released as a single on December 14, 1962, and then swiftly withdrawn.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=35}}</ref> Unlike the other material which Dylan recorded between 1961 and 1964, \"Mixed-Up Confusion\" attempted a [[rockabilly]] sound. [[Cameron Crowe]] described it as \"a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Sun Records]]\".<ref name = \"Cameron\">{{harvnb|Crowe|1985}}</ref>\n\nAlso recorded on November 14 was the new composition \"[[Don't Think Twice, It's All Right]]\" ([[Clinton Heylin]] writes that, although the sleeve notes of ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' describe this song as being accompanied by a backing band, no band is audible on the released version).<ref name=Hentoff /><ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=104}}</ref> Langhorne then accompanied Dylan on three more original compositions: \"[[Ballad of Hollis Brown]]\", \"Kingsport Town\", and \"Whatcha Gonna Do\", but these performances were not included on ''Freewheelin'''.<ref name=Heylin34/>\n\nDylan held another session at Studio A on December 6. Five songs, all original compositions, were recorded, three of which were eventually included on ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'': \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\", \"Oxford Town\", and \"I Shall Be Free\". Dylan also made another attempt at \"Whatcha Gonna Do\" and recorded a new song, \"Hero Blues\", but both songs were ultimately rejected and left unreleased.<ref name=Heylin34/>\n\n===Traveling to England===\nTwelve days later, Dylan made his first trip abroad. British TV director [[Philip Saville]] had heard Dylan perform in Greenwich Village, and invited him to take part in a [[BBC]] television drama: ''[[Madhouse on Castle Street]]''. Dylan arrived in London on December 17. In the play, Dylan performed \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and two other songs.<ref>{{harvnb|BBC TV|2007}}</ref> Dylan also immersed himself in the London folk scene, making contact with [[The Troubadour (London)|the Troubadour]] folk club organizer Anthea Joseph and folk singers [[Martin Carthy]] and [[Bob Davenport (singer)|Bob Davenport]]. \"I ran into some people in England who really knew those [traditional English] songs,\" Dylan recalled in 1984. \"Martin Carthy, another guy named [Bob] Davenport. Martin Carthy's incredible. I learned a lot of stuff from Martin.\"<ref>Loder, Kurt (1984), \"Interview with Kurt Loder, ''Rolling Stone''\", reprinted in {{harvnb|Cott|2006|pp=295\u2013296}}</ref>\n\nCarthy taught Dylan two English songs that would prove important for the ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' album. Carthy's arrangement of \"[[Scarborough Fair (ballad)|Scarborough Fair]]\" would be used by Dylan as the basis of his own composition, \"[[Girl from the North Country]]\". A 19th-century ballad commemorating the death of [[Sir John Franklin]] in 1847, \"[[Lady Franklin's Lament]]\", gave Dylan the melody for his composition \"[[Bob Dylan's Dream]]\". Both songs displayed Dylan's fast-growing ability to take traditional melodies and use them as a basis for highly personal songwriting.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref>\n\nFrom England, Dylan traveled to Italy, and joined Albert Grossman, who was touring with his client [[Odetta]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=127}}</ref> Dylan was also hoping to make contact with his girlfriend, Suze Rotolo, unaware that she had already left Italy and was on her way back to New York. Dylan worked on his new material, and when he returned to London, Martin Carthy received a surprise: \"When he came back from Italy, he'd written 'Girl From the North Country'; he came down to the Troubadour and said, 'Hey, here's \"Scarborough Fair\"' and he started playing this thing.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=110}}</ref>\n\n===Returning to New York===\nDylan flew back to New York on January 16, 1963.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=40}}</ref> In January and February, he recorded some of his new compositions in sessions for the folk magazine ''[[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]'', including a new anti-war song, \"Masters of War\", which he had composed in London.<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=142}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=117}}</ref> Dylan was happy to be reunited with Suze Rotolo, and he persuaded her to move back into the apartment they had shared on West 4th Street.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=114}}</ref>\n\nDylan's keenness to record his new material for ''Freewheelin''' paralleled a dramatic power struggle in the studio: Albert Grossman's determination to have [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] replaced as Dylan's producer at CBS. According to Dylan biographer [[Howard Sounes]], \"The two men could not have been more different. Hammond was a [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]], so relaxed during recording sessions that he sat with feet up, reading ''[[The New Yorker]]''. Grossman was a Jewish businessman with a shady past, hustling to become a millionaire.\"<ref name=\"highway124\"/>\n\nBecause of Grossman's hostility to Hammond, Columbia paired Dylan with a young, African-American jazz producer, [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]]. Wilson recalled: \"I didn't even particularly like folk music. I'd been recording [[Sun Ra]] and [[Coltrane]] ... I thought folk music was for the dumb guys. [Dylan] played like the dumb guys, but then these words came out. I was flabbergasted.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=115}}</ref> At a recording session on April 24, produced by Wilson, Dylan recorded five new compositions: \"Girl from the North Country\", \"Masters of War\", \"Talkin' World War III Blues\", \"Bob Dylan's Dream\", and \"Walls of Red Wing\". \"Walls of Red Wing\" was ultimately rejected, but the other four were included in a revised album sequence.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=43}}</ref>\n\nThe final drama of recording ''Freewheelin''' occurred when Dylan was scheduled to appear on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on May 12, 1963. Dylan had told Sullivan he would perform \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\", but the \"head of program practices\" at [[CBS Television]] informed Dylan that this song was potentially libelous to the [[John Birch Society]], and asked him to perform another number. Rather than comply with TV censorship, Dylan refused to appear on the show.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=44}}</ref> There is disagreement between Dylan's biographers about the consequences of this censorship row. [[Anthony Scaduto]] writes that after ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' debacle, CBS lawyers were alarmed to discover that the controversial song was to be included on Dylan's new album, only a few weeks from its release date. They insisted that the song be dropped, and four songs (\"John Birch\", \"Let Me Die In My Footsteps\", \"Rambling Gambling Willie\", \"Rocks and Gravel\") on the album were replaced with Dylan's newer compositions recorded in April (\"Girl from the North Country\", \"Masters of War\", \"Talkin' World War III Blues\", \"Bob Dylan's Dream\"). Scaduto writes that Dylan felt \"crushed\" by being compelled to submit to censorship, but he was in no position to argue.<ref>{{harvnb|Scaduto|2001|p=141}}</ref>\n\nAccording to biographer [[Clinton Heylin]], \"There remains a common belief that [Dylan] was forced by Columbia to pull 'Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues' from the album ''after'' he walked out on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''.\" However, the \"revised\" version of ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'' was released on May 27, 1963; this would have given Columbia Records only two weeks to recut the album, reprint the record sleeves, and press and package enough copies of the new version to fill orders. Heylin suggests that CBS had probably forced Dylan to withdraw \"John Birch\" from the album some weeks earlier and that Dylan had responded by recording his new material on April 24.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|pp=114\u2013117}}</ref> Whether the songs were substituted before or after ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', critics agree that the new material gave the album a more personal feel, distanced from the traditional folk-blues material which had dominated his first album, ''Bob Dylan''.<ref>{{harvnb|Scaduto|2001|p=142}}</ref>\n\nA few copies of the original pressing of the LP with the four deleted tracks have turned up over the years, despite Columbia's supposed destruction of all copies during the pre-release phase (all copies found were in the standard album sleeve with the revised track selection). Other permutations of the ''Freewheelin''' album include versions with a different running order of the tracks on the album, and a Canadian version of the album that listed the tracks in the wrong order.<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=244}}</ref><ref name=Thompson>{{harvnb|Thompson|2002|pp=12\u201313}}</ref> The original pressing of ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'' is considered the most valuable and rarest record in America,<ref name=Thompson/> with one copy having sold for $35,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Sharp|2007}}</ref>\n\n==Songs and themes==\n===\"Blowin' in the Wind\"===\n{{Main|Blowin' in the Wind}}\n\"Blowin' in the Wind\" is among Dylan's most celebrated compositions. In his sleeve notes for ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991]]'', John Bauldie writes that it was [[Pete Seeger]] who first identified the melody of \"Blowin' in the Wind\" as Dylan's adaptation of the old Negro spiritual \"No More Auction Block\". According to Alan Lomax's ''The Folk Songs of North America'', the song originated in Canada and was sung by former slaves who fled there after [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Britain abolished slavery in 1833]]. In 1978, Dylan acknowledged the source when he told journalist Marc Rowland: \"'Blowin' in the Wind' has always been a spiritual. I took it off a song called 'No More Auction Block'\u2014that's a spiritual and 'Blowin' in the Wind' follows the same feeling.\"<ref name=bauldie>{{harvnb|Bauldie|1991}}</ref> Dylan's performance of \"No More Auction Block\" was recorded at the Gaslight Cafe in October 1962, and appeared on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991]]''.\n\nCritic Andy Gill wrote: {{\"'}}Blowin' in the Wind' marked a huge jump in Dylan's songwriting: for the first time, Dylan discovered the effectiveness of moving from the particular to the general. Whereas 'The Ballad of Donald White' would become completely redundant as soon as the eponymous criminal was executed, a song as vague as 'Blowin' in the Wind' could be applied to just about any freedom issue. It remains the song with which Dylan's name is most inextricably linked, and safeguarded his reputation as a civil libertarian through any number of changes in style and attitude.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1999|p=23}}</ref>\n\n\"Blowin' in the Wind\" became world-famous when [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] issued the song as a single three weeks after the release of ''Freewheelin{{'}}''. They and Dylan both shared the same manager: Albert Grossman. The single sold a phenomenal three hundred thousand copies in the first week of release. On July 13, 1963, it reached number two on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart with sales exceeding one million copies.<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=135}}</ref> Dylan later recalled that he was astonished when [[Peter Yarrow]] told him he was going to make $5,000 from the publishing rights.<ref name = \"Cameron\"/>\n\n===\"Girl from the North Country\"===\n{{Main|Girl from the North Country}}\nThere has been much speculation in print about the identity of the girl in the song. Clinton Heylin states that the most frequently mooted candidates are Echo Helstrom, an early girlfriend of Dylan from his hometown of [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]], and [[Suze Rotolo]], for whom Dylan was pining as he finished the song in Italy.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|pp=120\u2013121}}</ref> Howard Sounes suggests the girl Dylan probably had in mind was Bonnie Beecher, a girlfriend of Dylan's when he was at the [[University of Minnesota]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=47}}</ref><ref group=a>An important recording of Dylan playing traditional material was taped in Beecher's apartment in December 1961. Misnamed the \"Minneapolis Hotel Tape\", the songs were released on the ''[[Great White Wonder]]'' bootleg. See {{harvnb|Gray|2006|pp=590\u2013591}}. Beecher subsequently married counter-cultural figure [[Wavy Gravy]].</ref> Musicologist Todd Harvey notes that Dylan not only took the tune of \"[[Scarborough Fair (ballad)|Scarborough Fair]]\", which he learned from Martin Carthy in London but also adapted the theme of that song. \"Scarborough Fair\" derives from \"[[The Elfin Knight]]\" ([[List of the Child Ballads|Child Ballad Number 2]]), which was first transcribed in 1670. In the song, a supernatural character poses a series of questions to an innocent, requesting her to perform impossible tasks. Harvey points out that Dylan \"retains the idea of the listener being sent upon a task, a northern place setting, and an antique lyric quality\".<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|pp=33\u201334}}</ref> Dylan returned to this song on ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969), recording it as a duet with [[Johnny Cash]], and he returned to it again in the studio with an unreleased organ and sax version in 1978.\n\n===\"Masters of War\"===\n{{Main|Masters of War}}\nA scathing song directed against the war industry, \"Masters of War\" is based on [[Jean Ritchie]]'s arrangement of \"[[Nottamun Town]]\", an English riddle song. It was written in late 1962 while Dylan was in London; eyewitnesses (including Martin Carthy and Anthea Joseph) recall Dylan performing the song in folk clubs at the time. Ritchie would later assert her claim on the song's arrangement; according to one Dylan biography, the suit was settled when Ritchie received $5,000 from Dylan's lawyers.<ref name=\"Sounes 2001 132\">{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=132}}</ref>\n\n===\"Down the Highway\"===\nDylan composed this song in the form of a [[Twelve-bar blues|12-bar blues]]. In the sleeve notes of ''Freewheelin{{'}}'', Dylan explained to [[Nat Hentoff]]: \"What made the real blues singers so great is that they were able to state all the problems they had; but at the same time, they were standing outside of them and could look at them. And in that way, they had them beat.\"<ref name=Hentoff/> Into this song, Dylan injected one explicit mention of an absence that was troubling him: the sojourn of Suze Rotolo in [[Perugia]]: \"My baby took my heart from me/ She packed it all up in a suitcase/ Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.\"\n\n===\"Bob Dylan's Blues\"===\n{{Main|Bob Dylan's Blues}}\nDylan begins this track with a spoken intro where he describes the origins of folk songs in a satirical vein: \"most of the songs that are written uptown in [[Tin Pan Alley]], that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays\".<ref name=Shelton155>{{harvnb|Shelton|2003|p=155}}</ref> What follows has been characterized as an absurd, improvised blues<ref name=Shelton155/> which Dylan, in the sleeve notes, describes as \"a really off-the-cuff-song. I start with an idea and then I feel what follows. Best way I can describe this one is that it's sort of like walking by a side street. You gaze in and walk on.\"<ref name=Hentoff/> Harvey points out that Dylan subsequently elaborated this style of self-deprecatory, [[absurdist humor]] into more complex songs, such as \"I Shall Be Free No.10\" (1964).<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=17}}</ref>\n\n===\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\"===\n{{Main|A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall}}\nDylan was only 21 years old when he wrote one of his most complex songs, \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\", often referred to as \"Hard Rain\". Dylan is said to have premiered \"Hard Rain\" at [[the Gaslight Cafe]], where Village performer Peter Blankfield recalled: \"He put out these pieces of loose-leaf paper ripped out of a spiral notebook. And he starts singing ['Hard Rain'] ... He finished singing it, and no one could say anything. The length of it, the episodic sense of it. Every line kept building and bursting\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=102}}</ref> Dylan performed \"Hard Rain\" days later at [[Carnegie Hall]] on September 22, 1962, as part of a concert organized by [[Pete Seeger]]. The song gained added resonance during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], just one month after Dylan's first performance of \"Hard Rain\", when U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] gave his warning to the Soviet Union over their deployment of [[nuclear missiles]] in Cuba. Critics have interpreted the lyric 'hard rain' as a reference to [[nuclear fallout]], but Dylan resisted the specificity of this interpretation. In a radio interview with [[Studs Terkel]] in 1963, Dylan said, <blockquote>\"No, it's not atomic rain, it's just a hard rain. It isn't the fallout rain. I mean some sort of end that's just gotta happen \u2026 In the last verse, when I say, 'the pellets of poison are flooding the waters', that means all the lies that people get told on their radios and in their newspapers.\"<ref>Terkel, Studs (1963). \"Radio Interview with Studs Terkel, WFMT (Chicago),\" reprinted in {{harvnb|Cott|2006|pp=6\u20137}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany people were astonished by the power and complexity of this work. For [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]], who had given Dylan an important boost in his 1961 review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', this song was \"a landmark in topical, folk-based songwriting. Here blooms the promised fruit of the 1950s poetry-jazz fusion of [[Allen Ginsberg|Ginsberg]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti|Ferlinghetti]], and [[Kenneth Rexroth|Rexroth]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Shelton|2003|pp=155\u2013156}}</ref> Folk singer [[Dave Van Ronk]] later commented: \"I was acutely aware that it represented the beginning of an artistic revolution.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1999|p=31}}</ref> [[Pete Seeger]] expressed the opinion that this song would last longer than any other written by Dylan.<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=122}}</ref>\n\n===\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\"===\n{{Main|Don't Think Twice, It's All Right}}\nDylan wrote this song on hearing from Suze Rotolo that she was considering staying in Italy indefinitely,<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2000|p=101}}</ref> and he used a melody he adapted from [[Paul Clayton (folksinger)|Paul Clayton]]'s song \"Who's Gonna Buy You Ribbons (When I'm Gone)\".<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=24}}</ref> In the ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' sleeve notes, Dylan comments: \"It isn't a love song. It's a statement that maybe you can say to make yourself feel better. It's as if you were talking to yourself.\"\n\nDylan's contemporaries hailed the song as a masterpiece: Bob Spitz quotes [[Paul Stookey]] saying \"I thought it was a masterful statement\", while [[Dave Van Ronk]] called it \"self-pitying but brilliant\".<ref>{{harvnb|Spitz|1989|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|pp=25\u201326}}</ref> Dylan biographer [[Howard Sounes]] commented: \"The greatness of the song was in the cleverness of the language. The phrase \"don't think twice, it's all right\" could be snarled, sung with resignation, or delivered with an ambiguous mixture of bitterness and regret. Seldom have the contradictory emotions of a thwarted lover been so well expressed, and the song transcended the autobiographical origins of Dylan's pain.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=120}}</ref>\n\n===\"Bob Dylan's Dream\"===\n{{Main|Bob Dylan's Dream}}\n\"Bob Dylan's Dream\" was based on the melody of the traditional \"[[Lady Franklin's Lament]]\", in which the title character dreams of finding her husband, Arctic explorer [[Sir John Franklin]], alive and well. (Sir John Franklin had vanished on an expedition searching for the [[North West Passage]] in 1845; a stone [[cairn]] on [[King William Island]] detailing his demise was found by a later expedition in 1859.) Todd Harvey points out that Dylan transforms the song into a personal journey, yet he retains both the theme and the mood of the original ballad. The world outside is depicted as stormy and harsh, and Dylan's most fervent wish, like Lady Franklin's, is to be reunited with departed companions and to relive the fond memories they represent.<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=19}}</ref>\n\n===\"Oxford Town\"===\n{{Main|Oxford Town}}\n\"Oxford Town\" is Dylan's sardonic account of events at the [[University of Mississippi]] in September 1962. [[U.S. Air Force]] veteran [[James Meredith]] was the first black student to enroll at the [[University of Mississippi]], located a mile from [[Oxford, Mississippi]]. When Meredith first tried to attend classes at the school, some Mississippians pledged to keep the university segregated, including the state governor [[Ross Barnett]]. Ultimately, the University of Mississippi had to be integrated with the help of U.S. federal troops. Dylan responded rapidly: his song was published in the November 1962 issue of ''[[Broadside (magazine)|Broadside]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1999|pp=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\n===\"Talkin' World War III Blues\"===\nThe \"talkin' blues\" was a style of improvised songwriting that [[Woody Guthrie]] had developed to a high plane.

He recorded five takes of the song and the fifth was selected for the album. The format of the \"talkin' blues\" permitted Dylan to address the serious subject of nuclear annihilation with humor, and \"without resorting to his finger-pointing or apocalyptical-prophetic persona\".<ref name=\"Harvey103\"/>\n\n===\"Corrina, Corrina\"===\n{{Main|Corrine, Corrina}}\n\"Corrina, Corrina\" was recorded by [[the Mississippi Sheiks]], and by their leader [[Bo Carter]] in 1928. The song was covered by artists as diverse as [[Bob Wills]], [[Big Joe Turner]], and [[Doc Watson]]. Dylan's version borrows phrases from a few [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] songs: \"Stones In My Passway\", \"32-20 Blues\", and \"Hellhound On My Trail\".<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|pp=20\u201322}}</ref> An alternate take of the song was used as a B-side for his \"[[Mixed-Up Confusion]]\" single.<ref>{{harvnb|Shelton|2003|pp=173, 178}}</ref>\n\n===\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\"===\n{{Main|Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance}}\n\"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance\" is based on \"Honey, Won't You Allow Me One More Chance?\", a song dating back to the 1890s that was popularized by Henry Thomas in his 1928 recording. \"However, Thomas's original provided no more than a song title and a notion\", writes Heylin, \"which Dylan turned into a personal plea to an absent lover to allow him 'one more chance to get along with you.'

According to Todd Harvey, Dylan's version draws its melody from the Guthrie recording but omits its signature chorus (\"We'll soon be free/When the Lord will call us home\").<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=50}}</ref> Critics have been divided about the worth of this final song. Robert Shelton dismissed the song as \"a decided anticlimax. Although the album has at least a half dozen blockbusters, two of the weakest songs are tucked in at the end, like shirttails.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Shelton|2003|p=157}}</ref> Todd Harvey has argued that by placing the song at the close of the ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' LP, Dylan ends on a note of levity which is a relief after the weighty sentiments expressed in several songs on the album.<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|2001|p=52}}</ref>\n\n==Outtakes==\nThe known outtakes from the ''Freewheelin''' album are as follows.

In May 1963, Dylan performed with [[Joan Baez]] at the Monterey Folk Festival, where she joined him on stage for a duet of a new Dylan song, \"[[With God on Our Side (song)|With God on Our Side]]\". Baez was at the pinnacle of her fame, having appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine the previous November. The performance not only gave Dylan and his songs a new prominence, it also marked the beginning of a romantic relationship between Baez and Dylan, the start of what Dylan biographer Sounes termed \"one of the most celebrated love affairs of the decade\".<ref name=\"Sounes 2001 132\"/>\n\n''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'' was released at the end of May. According to Scaduto, it was an immediate success, selling 10,000 copies a month and bringing Dylan an income of about $2,500 a month.<ref name=\"Scaduto144\">{{harvnb|Scaduto|2001|p=144}}</ref> An article by Nat Hentoff on folk music appeared in the June issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine and devoted considerable space to Dylan's achievements, calling him \"the most vital of the younger citybillies\".<ref name=\"Scaduto144\"/>\n\nIn July, Dylan appeared at the second [[Newport Folk Festival]]. That weekend, [[Peter, Paul and Mary]]'s rendition of \"Blowin' in the Wind\" reached number two on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s pop chart. Baez was also at Newport, appearing twice on stage with Dylan. The combination of the chart success of \"Blowin' in the Wind\", and the glamor of Baez and Dylan singing together generated excitement about Dylan and his new album. [[Tom Paxton]] recalled: \"That was a big breakout festival for Bob. The buzz kept growing exponentially and it was like a coronation of Bob and Joan. They were King and Queen of the festival\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=136}}</ref> His friend [[Bob Fass]] recalled that after Newport, Dylan told him that \"suddenly I just can't walk around without a disguise. I used to walk around and go wherever I wanted. But now it's gotten very weird.

During his dispute with Albert Grossman, Dylan stated in a deposition: \"Although I didn't know it at the time, the second album was destined to become a great success because it was to include 'Blowin' in the Wind'.\"<ref>Dylan's deposition of October 15, 1984, in the case Albert B.

[[John Lennon]] recalled: \"In Paris in 1964 was the first time I ever heard Dylan at all. [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] got the record (''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'') from a French DJ.

Before the album's release, he was one among many folk-singers. Afterwards, at the age of 22, Dylan was regarded as a major artist, perhaps even a spokesman for disaffected youth. As one critic described the transformation, \"In barely over a year, a young plagiarist had been reborn as a songwriter of substance, and his first album of fully realized original material got the 1960s off their musical starting block.\"<ref name=\"Humphries43\">{{harvnb|Humphries|1991|p=43}}</ref> Janet Maslin wrote of the album: \"These were the songs that established him as the voice of his generation\u2014someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about [[nuclear disarmament]] and the growing [[Civil Rights Movement]]: his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1981|p=220}}</ref>\n\nThis title of \"Spokesman of a Generation\" was viewed by Dylan with disgust in later years. He came to feel it was a label that the media had pinned on him, and in his autobiography, ''[[Chronicles, Volume One|Chronicles]]'', Dylan wrote: \"The press never let up. Once in a while I would have to rise up and offer myself for an interview so they wouldn't beat the door down. Later an article would hit the streets with the headline \"Spokesman Denies That He's A Spokesman\". I felt like a piece of meat that someone had thrown to the dogs.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dylan|2004|p=119}}</ref>\n\nThe album secured for Dylan an \"unstoppable cult following\" of fans who preferred the harshness of his performances to the softer cover versions released by other singers.<ref name=\"encyclopedia1\"/> [[Richard Williams (journalist)|Richard Williams]] has suggested that the richness of the imagery in ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' transformed Dylan into a key performer for a burgeoning college audience hungry for a new cultural complexity: \"For students whose exam courses included [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]] and [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]], here was something that flattered their expanding intellect while appealing to the teenage rebel in their early-sixties souls. [[James Dean]] had walked around reading [[James Joyce]]; here were both in a single package, the words and the attitude set to music.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1992|p=53}}</ref> Andy Gill adds that in the few months between the release of ''Freewheelin''' in May 1963, and Dylan's next album ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are A-Changin']]'' in January 1964, Dylan became the hottest property in American music, stretching the boundaries of what had been previously viewed as a collegiate folk music audience.<ref>{{harvnb|Gill|1999|p=37}}</ref>\n\nCritical opinion about ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' has been consistently favorable in the years since its release. Dylan biographer [[Howard Sounes]] called it \"Bob Dylan's first great album\".<ref name=\"Sounes 2001 132\"/> In a survey of Dylan's work published by ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine in 2000, the ''Freewheelin\u2019'' album was described as \"easily the best of [Dylan's] acoustic albums and a quantum leap from his debut\u2014which shows the frantic pace at which Dylan's mind was moving.\" The magazine went on to comment, \"You can see why this album got The Beatles listening. The songs at its core must have sounded like communiques from another plane.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Harris|2000|p=138}}</ref>\n\nFor Patrick Humphries, \"rarely has one album so effectively reflected the times which produced it. ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' spoke directly to the concerns of its audience. and addressed them in a mature and reflective manner: it mirrored the state of the nation.\"<ref name = \"Humphries43\"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]'s verdict on the album in the [[Allmusic]] guide was: \"It's hard to overestimate the importance of ''The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'', the record that firmly established Dylan as an unparalleled songwriter ... This is rich, imaginative music, capturing the sound and spirit of America as much as that of [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Hank Williams]], or [[Elvis Presley]]. Dylan, in many ways, recorded music that equaled this, but he never topped it.\"<ref name=\"erlewine\" />\n\nIn March 2000, [[Van Morrison]] told the Irish rock magazine ''[[Hot Press (magazine)|Hot Press]]'' about the impact that ''Freewheelin''' made on him: \"I think I heard it in a record shop in Smith Street. And I just thought it was incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it. That's what I thought at the time.

{"title_page": "2006 Faroe Islands Premier League", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=February 2018}}\n[[Faroe Islands Premier League Football]] in the 2006 season.\n\n[[EB/Streymur]] were top of the league throughout most of the season, with [[Havnar B\u00f3ltfelag|HB T\u00f3rshavn]], [[B36 T\u00f3rshavn]] and [[NS\u00cd Runav\u00edk]] staying in contention. With 4 matches left to play, EB/Streymur were 7 points ahead of second placed HB, but after 1 draw and 1 loss for EB/Streymur, HB managed to reduce that lead by 2 points by winning twice. By this time B36, K\u00cd and NS\u00cd were out of the title race. With one match left to play, HB T\u00f3rshavn's only chance of securing the title was if EB/Streymur lost to [[K\u00cd Klaksv\u00edk]]. In addition to that, HB had to win their match against [[\u00cdF]]. But as both matches were locked in stalemates and time was ebbing out, EB/Streymur were on the way to winning the title. \nBut then, 82 minutes into the match between EB/Streymur and K\u00cd, events took a dramatic twist, as Paul Clapson put K\u00cd 1-0 up against EB/Streymur with a long range effort. But EB/Streymur were still champions at this stage, because HB didn't seem to be able to capitalize on the golden opportunity given by EB/Streymur and K\u00cd. \n\n88 minutes had gone in the match between HB and \u00cdF, and still HB hadn't scored the crucial goal that would hand them the title. But in a last desperate effort, HB's central defender [[Vagnur Mohr Mortensen]] joined the attack.

{"title_page": "Laplace transform", "text_new": "{{redirect|\u2112|the Lagrangian|Lagrangian mechanics}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Laplace transform''' is an [[integral transform]] named after its inventor [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] ({{IPAc-en|l|\u0259|\u02c8|p|l|\u0251:|s}}).  It transforms a function of a real variable {{math|''t''}} (often time) to a function of a [[complex analysis|complex variable]] {{mvar|s}} ([[complex frequency]]). The transform has many applications in science and engineering.\n\nThe Laplace transform is similar to the [[Fourier transform]].  While the Fourier transform of a function is a [[complex function]] of a ''real'' variable (frequency), the Laplace transform of a function is a complex function of a ''complex'' variable. The Laplace transform is usually restricted to transformation of functions of {{math|''t''}} with {{math|''t'' \u2265 0}}.  A consequence of this restriction is that the Laplace transform of a function is a [[holomorphic function]] of the variable {{math|''s''}}.  Unlike the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] is generally a [[well-behaved]] function.  Techniques of complex variables can also be used to  directly study Laplace transforms.  As a holomorphic function, the Laplace transform has a [[power series]] representation.  This power series expresses a function as a linear superposition of [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of the function.  This perspective has applications in [[probability theory]].\n\nThe Laplace transform is invertible on a large class of functions. The inverse Laplace transform takes a function of a complex variable {{math|''s''}} (often frequency) and yields a function of a real variable {{math|''t''}} (often time).  Given a simple mathematical or functional description of an input or output to a [[system]], the Laplace transform provides an alternative functional description that often simplifies the process of analyzing the behavior of the system, or in synthesizing a new system based on a set of specifications.<ref>{{harvnb|Korn|Korn|1967|loc=\u00a78.1}}</ref>  So, for example, the Laplace transformation from the [[time domain]] to the [[frequency domain]] transforms [[Differential equation|differential equations]] into algebraic equations and [[convolution]] into multiplication.\n\nLaplace wrote extensively about the use of [[Generating function|generating functions]] in ''Essai philosophique sur les probabilit\u00e9s'' (1814) and the integral form of the Laplace transform evolved naturally as a result.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Probability theory : the logic of science|last=Jaynes, E.

He used an integral of the form\n: <math> \\int x^s \\varphi (x)\\, dx,</math>\nakin to a [[Mellin transform]], to transform the whole of a [[difference equation]], in order to look for solutions of the transformed equation. He then went on to apply the Laplace transform in the same way and started to derive some of its properties, beginning to appreciate its potential power.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|pp=261\u2013262}}</ref>\n\nLaplace also recognised that [[Joseph Fourier]]'s method of [[Fourier series]] for solving the [[diffusion equation]] could only apply to a limited region of space because those solutions were [[Periodic function|periodic]]. In 1809, Laplace applied his transform to find solutions that diffused indefinitely in space.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|pp=262&ndash;266}}</ref>\n\n== Formal definition ==\nThe Laplace transform of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''(''t'')}}, defined for all [[real number]]s {{math|''t'' \u2265 0}}, is the function {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a unilateral transform defined by\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>F(s) =\\int_0^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} \\, dt</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\nwhere ''s'' is a [[complex number]] frequency parameter\n: <math>s = \\sigma + i \\omega</math>, with real numbers {{math|''\u03c3''}} and {{math|''\u03c9''}}.\n\nAn alternate notation for the Laplace transform is <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}</math> instead of {{math|''F''}}.\n\nThe meaning of the integral depends on types of functions of interest.  A necessary condition for existence of the integral is that {{math|''f''}} must be [[locally integrable]] on {{closed-open|0, \u221e}}.  For locally integrable functions that decay at infinity or are of [[exponential type]], the integral can be understood to be a (proper) [[Lebesgue integral]]. However, for many applications it is necessary to regard it as a [[conditionally convergent]] [[improper integral]] at {{math|\u221e}}.  Still more generally, the integral can be understood in a [[distribution (mathematics)|weak sense]], and this is dealt with below.\n\nOne can define the Laplace transform of a finite [[Borel measure]] {{math|''\u03bc''}} by the Lebesgue integral<ref>{{harvnb|Feller|1971|loc=\u00a7XIII.1}}</ref>\n: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{\\mu\\}(s) = \\int_{[0,\\infty)} e^{-st}\\, d\\mu(t).</math>\n\nAn important special case is where {{math|''\u03bc''}} is a [[probability measure]], for example, the [[Dirac delta function]]. In [[operational calculus]], the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a probability density function {{math|''f''}}.  In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes\n: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_{0^-}^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} \\, dt,</math>\nwhere the lower limit of {{math|0<sup>\u2212</sup>}} is shorthand notation for\n: <math>\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0^+}\\int_{-\\varepsilon}^\\infty.</math>\n\nThis limit emphasizes that any point mass located at {{math|0}} is entirely captured by the Laplace transform. Although with the Lebesgue integral, it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the [[Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform]].\n\n=== Bilateral Laplace transform ===\n{{Main article|Two-sided Laplace transform}}\n\nWhen one says \"the Laplace transform\" without qualification, the unilateral or one-sided transform is normally intended. The Laplace transform can be alternatively defined as the ''bilateral Laplace transform'' or [[two-sided Laplace transform]] by extending the limits of integration to be the entire real axis.  If that is done the common unilateral transform simply becomes a special case of the bilateral transform where the definition of the function being transformed is multiplied by the [[Heaviside step function]].\nThe bilateral Laplace transform is defined as follows:\n{{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a bilateral transform defined by\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\, dt</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\nAn alternate notation for the bilateral Laplace transform is <math>\\mathcal{B}\\{f\\}</math> instead of <math>F</math>.\n\n=== Inverse Laplace transform ===\n{{Main article|Inverse Laplace transform}}\nTwo integrable functions have the same Laplace transform only if they differ on a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero. This means that, on the range of the transform, there is an inverse transform. In fact, besides integrable functions, the Laplace transform is a [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]] mapping from one function space into another in many other function spaces as well, although there is usually no easy characterization of the range. Typical function spaces in which this is true include the spaces of bounded continuous functions, the space [[Lp space|{{math|''L''<sup>&infin;</sup>(0, &infin;)}}]], or more generally [[Distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distributions]] on {{open-open|0, &infin;}}.  The Laplace transform is also defined and injective for suitable spaces of tempered distributions.\n\nIn these cases, the image of the Laplace transform lives in a space of [[analytic function]]s in the [[#Region of convergence|region of convergence]].  The [[inverse Laplace transform]] is given by the following complex integral, which is known by various names (the '''Bromwich integral''', the '''Fourier\u2013Mellin integral''', and '''Mellin's inverse formula'''):\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F\\}(t) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\oint_{\\gamma - i T}^{\\gamma + i T} e^{st} F(s)\\, ds</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.3}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\nwhere {{math|''\u03b3''}} is a real number so that the contour path of integration is in the region of convergence of {{math|''F''(''s'')}}. An alternative formula for the inverse Laplace transform is given by [[Post's inversion formula]]. The limit here is interpreted in the [[weak-* topology#Weak-* topology|weak-* topology]].\n\nIn practice, it is typically more convenient to decompose a Laplace transform into known transforms of functions obtained from a table, and construct the inverse by inspection.\n\n=== Probability theory ===\nIn [[probability theory|pure]] and [[applied probability]], the Laplace transform is defined as an [[expected value]]. If {{math|''X''}} is a [[random variable]] with probability density function {{math|''f''}}, then the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} is given by the expectation\n: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\operatorname{E}\\! \\left[e^{-sX} \\right]\\! .</math>\n\nBy [[abuse of notation|convention]], this is referred to as the Laplace transform of the random variable {{math|''X''}} itself. Replacing {{math|''s''}} by {{math|\u2212''t''}} gives the [[moment generating function]] of {{math|''X''}}. The Laplace transform has applications throughout probability theory, including [[first passage time]]s of [[stochastic processes]] such as [[Markov chain]]s, and [[renewal theory]].\n\nOf particular use is the ability to recover the [[cumulative distribution function]] of a continuous random variable {{math|''X''}} by means of the Laplace transform as follows<ref>The cumulative distribution function is the integral of the probability density function.</ref>\n: <math>F_X(x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\operatorname{E}\\left[e^{-sX}\\right]\\right\\}\\! (x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\right\\}\\! (x).</math>\n\n== Region of convergence ==\nIf {{math|''f''}} is a locally integrable function (or more generally a Borel measure locally of bounded variation), then the Laplace transform {{math|''F''(''s'')}} of {{math|''f''}} converges provided that the limit\n: <math>\\lim_{R\\to\\infty}\\int_0^R f(t)e^{-st}\\,dt</math>\nexists.\n\nThe Laplace transform converges absolutely if the integral\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty \\left|f(t)e^{-st}\\right|\\,dt</math>\nexists (as a proper Lebesgue integral).  The Laplace transform is usually understood as conditionally convergent, meaning that it converges in the former instead of the latter sense.\n\nThe set of values for which {{math|''F''(''s'')}} converges absolutely is either of the form {{math|Re(''s'') > ''a''}} or else {{math|Re(''s'') \u2265 ''a''}}, where {{math|''a''}} is an [[extended real number|extended real constant]], {{math|\u2212\u221e \u2264 ''a'' \u2264 \u221e}}.  (This follows from the [[dominated convergence theorem]].) The constant {{math|''a''}} is known as the abscissa of absolute convergence, and depends on the growth behavior of {{math|''f''(''t'')}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Widder|1941|loc=Chapter II, \u00a71}}</ref> Analogously, the two-sided transform converges absolutely in a strip of the form  {{math|''a'' < Re(''s'') < ''b''}}, and possibly including the lines {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''a''}} or {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''b''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Widder|1941|loc=Chapter VI, \u00a72}}</ref>  The subset of values of {{math|''s''}} for which the Laplace transform converges absolutely is called the region of absolute convergence or the domain of absolute convergence.  In the two-sided case, it is sometimes called the strip of absolute convergence. The Laplace transform is analytic in the region of absolute convergence: this is a consequence of [[Fubini's theorem]] and [[Morera's theorem]]. \n\nSimilarly, the set of values for which {{math|''F''(''s'')}} converges (conditionally or absolutely) is known as the region of conditional convergence, or simply the '''region of convergence''' (ROC).  If the Laplace transform converges (conditionally) at {{math|1=''s'' = ''s''<sub>0</sub>}}, then it automatically converges for all {{math|''s''}} with {{math|Re(''s'') > Re(''s''<sub>0</sub>)}}.  Therefore, the region of convergence is a half-plane of the form {{math|Re(''s'') > ''a''}}, possibly including some points of the boundary line {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''a''}}.\n\nIn the region of convergence {{math|Re(''s'') > Re(''s''<sub>0</sub>)}}, the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} can be expressed by [[integration by parts|integrating by parts]] as the integral\n: <math>F(s) = (s-s_0)\\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-s_0)t}\\beta(t)\\,dt,\\quad \\beta(u) = \\int_0^u e^{-s_0t}f(t)\\,dt.</math>\n\nThat is, in the region of convergence {{math|''F''(''s'')}} can effectively be expressed as the absolutely convergent Laplace transform of some other function.  In particular, it is analytic.\n\nThere are several [[Paley\u2013Wiener theorem]]s concerning the relationship between the decay properties of {{math|''f''}} and the properties of the Laplace transform within the region of convergence.\n\nIn engineering applications, a function corresponding to a [[LTI system|linear time-invariant (LTI) system]] is ''stable'' if every bounded input produces a bounded output.  This is equivalent to the absolute convergence of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function in the region {{math|Re(''s'') \u2265 0}}.  As a result, LTI systems are stable provided the poles of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function have negative real part.\n\nThis ROC is used in knowing about the causality and stability of a system.\n\n== Properties and theorems ==\nThe Laplace transform has a number of properties that make it useful for analyzing linear [[dynamical system]]s. The most significant advantage is that [[derivative|differentiation]] becomes multiplication, and [[integral|integration]] becomes division, by  {{math|''s''}} (similarly to [[logarithm]]s changing multiplication of numbers to addition of their logarithms).\n\nBecause of this property, the Laplace variable {{math|''s''}} is also known as ''operator variable'' in the {{math|''L''}} domain: either ''derivative operator'' or (for {{math|''s''<sup>\u22121</sup>)}} ''integration operator''. The transform turns [[integral equation]]s and [[differential equation]]s to [[polynomial equation]]s, which are much easier to solve.  Once solved, use of the inverse Laplace transform reverts to the original domain.\n\nGiven the functions {{math|''f''(''t'')}} and {{math|''g''(''t'')}}, and their respective Laplace transforms {{math|''F''(''s'')}} and {{math|''G''(''s'')}},\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nf(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\},\\\\\ng(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe following '''table''' is a list of properties of unilateral Laplace transform:<ref>{{harvnb|Korn|Korn|1967|pp=226&ndash;227}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" id=\"291017_tableid\"\n|+ Properties of the unilateral Laplace transform\n|-\n !\n !

Replacing summation over {{math|''n''}} with integration over  {{math|''t''}}, a continuous version of the power series becomes\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) x^t\\, dt</math>\nwhere the discrete function {{math|''a''(''n'')}} is replaced by the continuous one {{math|''f''(''t'')}}. \n\nChanging the base of the power from {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''e''}} gives\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) \\left(e^{\\ln{x}}\\right)^t\\, dt</math>\n\nFor this to converge for, say, all bounded functions {{math|''f''}}, it is necessary to require that {{math|ln ''x'' < 0}}. Making the substitution {{math|1=&minus;''s'' = ln ''x''}} gives just the Laplace transform:\n:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-st}\\, dt</math>\n\nIn other words, the Laplace transform is a continuous analog of a power series in which the discrete parameter {{math|''n''}} is replaced by the continuous parameter {{math|''t''}}, and {{math|''x''}} is replaced by {{math|''e''<sup>&minus;''s''</sup>}}.\n\n=== Relation to moments ===\n{{main article|Moment generating function}}\nThe quantities\n:<math>\\mu_n = \\int_0^\\infty t^nf(t)\\, dt</math>\n\nare the ''moments'' of the function {{math|''f''}}.

This can be derived from the basic expression for a Laplace transform as follows:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathcal{L} \\left\\{f(t)\\right\\} &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\, dt \\\\[6pt]\n                                  &= \\left[\\frac{f(t)e^{-st}}{-s} \\right]_{0^-}^\\infty -\n                                       \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-st}}{-s} f'(t) \\, dt\\quad \\text{(by parts)} \\\\[6pt]\n                                  &= \\left[-\\frac{f(0^+)}{-s}\\right] + \\frac 1 s \\mathcal{L} \\left\\{f'(t)\\right\\},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nyielding\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{L} \\{ f'(t) \\} = s\\cdot\\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\}-f(0^+), </math>\n\nand in the bilateral case,\n\n: <math> \\mathcal{L} \\{ f'(t) \\} = s \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\,dt  = s \\cdot \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\}. </math>\n\nThe general result\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{L} \\left\\{ f^{(n)}(t) \\right\\} = s^n \\cdot \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} - s^{n - 1} f(0^+) - \\cdots - f^{(n - 1)}(0^+),</math>\n\nwhere <math>f^{(n)}</math> denotes the {{math|''n''}}<sup>th</sup> derivative of {{math|''f''}}, can then be established with an inductive argument.\n\n=== Evaluating integrals over the positive real axis ===\nA useful property of the Laplace transform is the following:\n\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty f(x)g(x)\\,dx = \\int_0^\\infty(\\mathcal{L} f)(s)\\cdot(\\mathcal{L}^{-1}g)(s)\\,ds </math>\n\nunder suitable assumptions on the behaviour of <math>f,g</math> in a right neighbourhood of <math>0</math> and on the decay rate of <math>f,g</math> in a left neighbourhood of <math>\\infty</math>. The above formula is a variation of integration by parts, with the operators \n<math>\\frac{d}{dx}</math> and <math>\\int \\,dx</math> being replaced by <math>\\mathcal{L}</math> and <math>\\mathcal{L}^{-1}</math>. Let us prove the equivalent formulation:\n\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty(\\mathcal{L} f)(x)g(x)\\,dx = \\int_0^\\infty f(s)(\\mathcal{L}g)(s)\\,ds. </math>\n\nBy plugging in <math>(\\mathcal{L}f)(x)=\\int_0^\\infty f(s)e^{-sx}\\,ds</math> the left-hand side turns into:\n\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty\\int_0^\\infty f(s)g(x) e^{-sx}\\,ds\\,dx, </math>\n\nbut assuming Fubini's theorem holds, by reversing the order of integration we get the wanted right-hand side.\n\n=== Relationship to other transforms ===\n\n==== Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform ====\nThe (unilateral) Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform of a function {{math|''g'' : '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}} is defined by the [[Lebesgue\u2013Stieltjes integral]]\n\n: <math>\\{\\mathcal{L}^*g\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} \\, dg(t).</math>\n\nThe function {{math|''g''}} is assumed to be of [[bounded variation]].  If {{math|''g''}} is the [[antiderivative]] of {{math|''f''}}:\n\n: <math>g(x) = \\int_0^x f(t)\\,dt</math>\n\nthen the Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform of {{math|''g''}} and the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} coincide.  In general, the Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform is the Laplace transform of the [[Stieltjes measure]] associated to {{math|''g''}}.  So in practice, the only distinction between the two transforms is that the Laplace transform is thought of as operating on the density function of the measure, whereas the Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform is thought of as operating on its [[cumulative distribution function]].<ref>{{harvnb|Feller|1971|p=432}}</ref>\n\n==== Fourier transform ====\n{{Main|Fourier transform}}\nThe continuous Fourier transform is equivalent to evaluating the bilateral Laplace transform with imaginary argument {{math|1=''s'' = ''i\u03c9''}} or {{math|1=''s'' = 2''\u03c0fi''}}<ref>{{harvnb|Takacs|1953|p=93}}</ref> when the condition explained below is fulfilled, \n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\widehat{f}(\\omega) &= \\mathcal{F}\\{f(t)\\} \\\\[4pt]\n                  &= \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}|_{s = i\\omega}  =  F(s)|_{s = i \\omega} \\\\[4pt]\n                  &= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\omega t} f(t)\\,dt~.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis definition of the Fourier transform requires a prefactor of {{math|1/(2''\u03c0'')}} on the reverse Fourier transform. This relationship between the Laplace and Fourier transforms is often used to determine the [[frequency spectrum]] of a [[signal (information theory)|signal]] or dynamical system.\n\nThe above relation is valid as stated if and only if the region of convergence (ROC) of  {{math|''F''(''s'')}} contains the imaginary axis,  {{math|1=''\u03c3'' = 0}}.\n\nFor example, the function {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = cos(''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>''t'')}} has a Laplace transform  {{math|1=''F''(''s'') =  ''s''/(''s''<sup>2</sup> + ''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>)}} whose ROC is {{math|Re(''s'') > 0}}. As {{math|1=''s'' = ''i\u03c9''}} is a pole of  {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, substituting  {{math|1=''s'' = ''i\u03c9''}} in {{math|''F''(''s'')}} does not yield the Fourier transform of  {{math|''f''(''t'')''u''(''t'')}}, which is proportional to the [[Dirac delta-function]] {{math|''\u03b4''(''\u03c9'' \u2212 ''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>)}}.\n\nHowever, a relation of the form\n: <math>\\lim_{\\sigma\\to 0^+} F(\\sigma+i\\omega) = \\widehat{f}(\\omega)</math>\nholds under much weaker conditions.  For instance, this holds for the above example provided that the limit is understood as a [[weak limit]] of measures (see [[vague topology]]).  General conditions relating the limit of the Laplace transform of a function on the boundary to the Fourier transform take the form of [[Paley\u2013Wiener theorem]]s.\n\n==== Mellin transform ====\n{{Main|Mellin transform}}\nThe Mellin transform and its inverse are related to the two-sided Laplace transform by a simple change of variables.\n\nIf in the Mellin transform\n: <math>G(s) = \\mathcal{M}\\{g(\\theta)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty \\theta^s g(\\theta) \\, \\frac{d\\theta} \\theta </math>\nwe set {{math|1=''\u03b8'' = ''e''<sup>\u2212''t''</sup>}} we get a two-sided Laplace transform.\n\n==== Z-transform ====\n{{Main|Z-transform}}\nThe unilateral or one-sided Z-transform is simply the Laplace transform of an ideally sampled signal with the substitution of\n: <math> z \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} e^{sT} ,</math>\nwhere {{math|1=''T'' = 1/''f<sub>s</sub>''}} is the [[Sampling theorem|sampling]] period (in units of time e.g., seconds) and  {{math|''f<sub>s</sub>''}} is the [[sampling rate]] (in [[sample (signal)|samples per second]] or [[hertz]]).\n\nLet\n: <math> \\Delta_T(t) \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}  \\delta(t - n T) </math>\nbe a sampling impulse train (also called a [[Dirac comb]]) and\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  x_q(t) \\  &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  x(t) \\Delta_T(t) = x(t) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}  \\delta(t - n T) \\\\\n            &= \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x(n T) \\delta(t - n T) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x[n] \\delta(t - n T)\n\\end{align}</math>\nbe the sampled representation of the continuous-time {{math|''x''(''t'')}}\n: <math> x[n] \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{{}={}}  x(nT) ~.</math>\n\nThe Laplace transform of the sampled signal {{math|''x''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'') }} is\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  X_q(s) &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty x_q(t) e^{-s t} \\,dt \\\\\n         &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] \\delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \\, dt \\\\\n         &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \\, dt \\\\\n         &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] e^{-n s T}~.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis is the precise definition of the unilateral Z-transform of the discrete function {{math|''x''[''n'']}}\n\n: <math> X(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x[n] z^{-n} </math>\nwith the substitution of {{math|''z'' \u2192 e<sup>''sT''</sup>}}.\n\nComparing the last two equations, we find the relationship between the unilateral Z-transform and the Laplace transform of the sampled signal,\n: <math>X_q(s) =  X(z) \\Big|_{z=e^{sT}}.</math>\n\nThe similarity between the {{math|''Z''}} and Laplace transforms is expanded upon in the theory of [[time scale calculus]].\n\n==== Borel transform ====\nThe integral form of the [[Borel summation|Borel transform]]\n\n: <math>F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty f(z)e^{-sz}\\, dz</math>\n\nis a special case of the Laplace transform for {{math|''f''}} an [[entire function]] of exponential type, meaning that\n\n: <math>|f(z)|\\le Ae^{B|z|}</math>\n\nfor some constants {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}.  The generalized Borel transform allows a different weighting function to be used, rather than the exponential function, to transform functions not of exponential type. [[Nachbin's theorem]] gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the Borel transform to be well defined.\n\n==== Fundamental relationships ====\nSince an ordinary Laplace transform can be written as a special case of a two-sided transform, and since the two-sided transform can be written as the sum of two one-sided transforms, the theory of the Laplace-, Fourier-, Mellin-, and Z-transforms are at bottom the same subject. However, a different point of view and different characteristic problems are associated with each of these four major integral transforms.\n\n== Table of selected Laplace transforms ==\n{{main article|List of Laplace transforms}}\n\nThe following table provides Laplace transforms for many common functions of a single variable.<ref>{{Citation |edition=3rd |page=455 |first1=K.

Circuit elements can be transformed into [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s, very similar to [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasor]] impedances.\n\nHere is a summary of equivalents:\n\n: [[File:S-Domain circuit equivalents.svg|alt={{math|''s''}}-domain equivalent circuits|centre|frameless|400x400px|{{math|''s''}}-domain equivalent circuits]]\n\nNote that the resistor is exactly the same in the time domain and the {{math|''s''}}-domain. The sources are put in if there are initial conditions on the circuit elements. For example, if a capacitor has an initial voltage across it, or if the inductor has an initial current through it, the sources inserted in the {{math|''s''}}-domain account for that.\n\nThe equivalents for current and voltage sources are simply derived from the transformations in the table above.\n\n== Examples and applications ==\n<!--A few worked examples are provided here to enable the reader to assess comprehension of the factual presentation.  Elaboration beyond the role of supporting factual comprehension belongs at [[v:|Wikiversity]] or [[b:|Wikibooks]].-->\n\nThe Laplace transform is used frequently in [[engineering]] and [[physics]]; the output of a [[linear time-invariant]] system can be calculated by convolving its unit impulse response with the input signal. Performing this calculation in Laplace space turns the convolution into a multiplication; the latter being easier to solve because of its algebraic form. For more information, see [[control theory]].\n\nThe Laplace transform can also be used to solve differential equations and is used extensively in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].  The Laplace transform reduces a linear differential equation to an algebraic equation, which can then be solved by the formal rules of algebra.  The original differential equation can then be solved by applying the inverse Laplace transform.  The English electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside first proposed a similar scheme, although without using the Laplace transform; and the resulting operational calculus is credited as the Heaviside calculus.\n\n=== Evaluating improper integrals ===\nLet <math>\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{f(t)\\right\\} = F(s)</math>. Then (see the table above)\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L} \\left\\{\\frac{f(t)} t \\right\\} = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(t)}{t}e^{-st}\\, dt = \\int_s^\\infty F(p)\\, dp.</math>\n\nIn the limit <math>s \\rightarrow 0</math>, one gets\n\n:<math>\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(t)} t \\, dt = \\int_0^\\infty F(p)\\, dp,</math>\n\nprovided that the interchange of limits can be justified. Even when the interchange cannot be justified the calculation can be suggestive. For example, with ''a''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;''b'', proceeding formally one has\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{ \\cos(at) - \\cos(bt) }{t} \\, dt \n&= \\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0} \\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac p {p^2 + a^2} - \\frac{p}{p^2 + b^2}\\right)\\, dp \\\\[6pt]\n&= \\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0} \\Biggl[ \\frac 1 2 \\left. \\ln\\frac{p^2 + a^2}{p^2 + b^2} \\right|_{0}^\\infty \\Biggl] = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\frac{a^2}{b^2} = \\ln \\Biggl| \\frac {a}{b} \\Biggl|.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe validity of this identity can be proved by other means. It is an example of a [[Frullani integral]].\n\nAnother example is [[Dirichlet integral]].\n\n=== Complex impedance of a capacitor ===\nIn the theory of [[electrical circuit]]s, the current flow in a [[capacitor]] is proportional to the capacitance and rate of change in the electrical potential (in [[International System of Units|SI]] units). Symbolically, this is expressed by the differential equation\n\n: <math>i = C { dv \\over dt} ,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''C''}} is the capacitance (in [[farad]]s) of the capacitor, {{math|1=''i'' = ''i''(''t'')}} is the [[electric current]] (in [[ampere]]s) through the capacitor as a function of time, and {{math|1=''v'' = ''v''(''t'')}} is the [[electrostatic potential|voltage]] (in [[volt]]s) across the terminals of the capacitor, also as a function of time.\n\nTaking the Laplace transform of this equation, we obtain\n\n: <math>I(s) = C(s V(s) - V_0),</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  I(s) &= \\mathcal{L} \\{ i(t) \\},\\\\\n  V(s) &= \\mathcal{L} \\{ v(t) \\},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>V_0 = v(t)\\Big|_{t=0}. \\, </math>\n\nSolving for {{math|''V''(''s'')}} we have\n\n: <math>V(s) = { I(s) \\over sC } + { V_0 \\over s }.</math>\n\nThe definition of the complex impedance {{math|''Z''}} (in [[ohm]]s) is the ratio of the complex voltage {{math|''V''}} divided by the complex current {{math|''I''}} while holding the initial state {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} at zero:\n\n: <math>Z(s) = \\left. { V(s) \\over I(s) } \\right|_{V_0 = 0}.</math>\n\nUsing this definition and the previous equation, we find:\n\n: <math>Z(s) = \\frac{1}{sC}, </math>\n\nwhich is the correct expression for the complex impedance of a capacitor. \nIn addition, the Laplace transform has large applications in control theory.\n\n=== Partial fraction expansion ===\n<!-- [[Partial fractions in Laplace transforms]] redirect here -->\nConsider a linear time-invariant system with [[transfer function]]\n: <math>H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s + \\alpha)(s + \\beta)}.</math>\n\nThe [[impulse response]] is simply the inverse Laplace transform of this transfer function:\n: <math>h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\}.</math>\n\nTo evaluate this inverse transform, we begin by expanding {{math|''H''(''s'')}} using the method of partial fraction expansion,\n\n: <math>\\frac{1}{(s + \\alpha)(s + \\beta)} = { P \\over s + \\alpha } + { R \\over s+\\beta }.</math>\n\nThe unknown constants {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''R''}} are the [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]]s located at the corresponding poles of the transfer function. Each residue represents the relative contribution of that [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] to the transfer function's overall shape.\n\nBy the [[residue theorem]], the inverse Laplace transform depends only upon the poles and their residues. To find the residue {{math|''P''}}, we multiply both sides of the equation by {{math|''s'' + ''\u03b1''}} to get\n: <math>\\frac{1}{s + \\beta} = P  + { R (s + \\alpha) \\over s + \\beta }.</math>\n\nThen by letting {{math|1=''s'' = \u2212''\u03b1''}}, the contribution from {{math|''R''}} vanishes and all that is left is\n: <math>P = \\left.{1 \\over s+\\beta}\\right|_{s=-\\alpha} = {1 \\over \\beta - \\alpha}.</math>\n\nSimilarly, the residue {{math|''R''}} is given by\n: <math>R = \\left.{1 \\over s + \\alpha}\\right|_{s=-\\beta} = {1 \\over \\alpha - \\beta}.</math>\n\nNote that\n: <math>R = {-1 \\over \\beta - \\alpha} = - P</math>\nand so the substitution of {{math|''R''}} and {{math|''P''}} into the expanded expression for {{math|''H''(''s'')}} gives\n: <math>H(s)  = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\alpha} \\right) \\cdot \\left(  { 1 \\over s + \\alpha } - { 1  \\over s + \\beta }  \\right).</math>\n\nFinally, using the linearity property and the known transform for exponential decay (see ''Item'' #''3'' in the ''Table of Laplace Transforms'', above), we can take the inverse Laplace transform of {{math|''H''(''s'')}} to obtain\n: <math>h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\} = \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\alpha}\\left(e^{-\\alpha t} - e^{-\\beta t}\\right),</math>\nwhich is the impulse response of the system.\n\n;Convolution\nThe same result can be achieved using the [[Convolution theorem|convolution property]] as if the system is a series of filters with transfer functions of {{math|1/(''s'' + ''a'')}} and {{math|1/(''s'' + ''b'')}}. That is, the inverse of\n\n: <math>H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s + a)(s + b)} = \\frac{1}{s+a} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s + b}</math>\n\nis\n\n: <math> \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s + a} \\right\\} * \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s + b} \\right\\} = e^{-at} * e^{-bt} = \\int_0^t e^{-ax}e^{-b(t - x)}\\, dx = \\frac{e^{-a t}-e^{-b t}}{b - a}.</math>\n\n=== Phase delay ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It transforms a function of a real variable {{math|''t''}} (often time) to a function of a [[complex analysis|complex variable]] {{mvar|s}} ([[complex frequency]]). The transform has many applications in science and engineering.\n\nThe Laplace transform is similar to the [[Fourier transform]].  While the Fourier transform of a function is a [[complex function]] of a ''real'' variable (frequency), the Laplace transform of a function is a complex function of a ''complex'' variable. The Laplace transform is usually restricted to transformation of functions of {{math|''t''}} with {{math|''t'' \u2265 0}}.  A consequence of this restriction is that the Laplace transform of a function is a [[holomorphic function]] of the variable {{math|''s''}}.  Unlike the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] is generally a [[well-behaved]] function.  Techniques of complex variables can also be used to  directly study Laplace transforms.  As a holomorphic function, the Laplace transform has a [[power series]] representation.  This power series expresses a function as a linear superposition of [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of the function.  This perspective has applications in [[probability theory]].\n\nThe Laplace transform is invertible on a large class of functions. The inverse Laplace transform takes a function of a complex variable {{math|''s''}} (often frequency) and yields a function of a real variable {{math|''t''}} (often time).  Given a simple mathematical or functional description of an input or output to a [[system]], the Laplace transform provides an alternative functional description that often simplifies the process of analyzing the behavior of the system, or in synthesizing a new system based on a set of specifications.<ref>{{harvnb|Korn|Korn|1967|loc=\u00a78.1}}</ref>  So, for example, the Laplace transformation from the [[time domain]] to the [[frequency domain]] transforms [[Differential equation|differential equations]] into algebraic equations and [[convolution]] into multiplication.\n\nLaplace wrote extensively about the use of [[Generating function|generating functions]] in ''Essai philosophique sur les probabilit\u00e9s'' (1814) and the integral form of the Laplace transform evolved naturally as a result.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Probability theory : the logic of science|last=Jaynes, E.

He used an integral of the form\n: <math> \\int x^s \\varphi (x)\\, dx,</math>\nakin to a [[Mellin transform]], to transform the whole of a [[difference equation]], in order to look for solutions of the transformed equation. He then went on to apply the Laplace transform in the same way and started to derive some of its properties, beginning to appreciate its potential power.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|pp=261\u2013262}}</ref>\n\nLaplace also recognised that [[Joseph Fourier]]'s method of [[Fourier series]] for solving the [[diffusion equation]] could only apply to a limited region of space because those solutions were [[Periodic function|periodic]]. In 1809, Laplace applied his transform to find solutions that diffused indefinitely in space.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|pp=262&ndash;266}}</ref>\n\n== Formal definition ==\nThe Laplace transform of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''(''t'')}}, defined for all [[real number]]s {{math|''t'' \u2265 0}}, is the function {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a unilateral transform defined by\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>F(s) =\\int_0^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} \\, dt</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\nwhere ''s'' is a [[complex number]] frequency parameter\n: <math>s = \\sigma + i \\omega</math>, with real numbers {{math|''\u03c3''}} and {{math|''\u03c9''}}.\n\nAn alternate notation for the Laplace transform is <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}</math> instead of {{math|''F''}}.\n\nThe meaning of the integral depends on types of functions of interest.  A necessary condition for existence of the integral is that {{math|''f''}} must be [[locally integrable]] on {{closed-open|0, \u221e}}.  For locally integrable functions that decay at infinity or are of [[exponential type]], the integral can be understood to be a (proper) [[Lebesgue integral]]. However, for many applications it is necessary to regard it as a [[conditionally convergent]] [[improper integral]] at {{math|\u221e}}.  Still more generally, the integral can be understood in a [[distribution (mathematics)|weak sense]], and this is dealt with below.\n\nOne can define the Laplace transform of a finite [[Borel measure]] {{math|''\u03bc''}} by the Lebesgue integral<ref>{{harvnb|Feller|1971|loc=\u00a7XIII.1}}</ref>\n: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{\\mu\\}(s) = \\int_{[0,\\infty)} e^{-st}\\, d\\mu(t).</math>\n\nAn important special case is where {{math|''\u03bc''}} is a [[probability measure]], for example, the [[Dirac delta function]]. In [[operational calculus]], the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a probability density function {{math|''f''}}.  In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes\n: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_{0^-}^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} \\, dt,</math>\nwhere the lower limit of {{math|0<sup>\u2212</sup>}} is shorthand notation for\n: <math>\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0^+}\\int_{-\\varepsilon}^\\infty.</math>\n\nThis limit emphasizes that any point mass located at {{math|0}} is entirely captured by the Laplace transform. Although with the Lebesgue integral, it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the [[Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform]].\n\n=== Bilateral Laplace transform ===\n{{Main article|Two-sided Laplace transform}}\n\nWhen one says \"the Laplace transform\" without qualification, the unilateral or one-sided transform is normally intended. The Laplace transform can be alternatively defined as the ''bilateral Laplace transform'' or [[two-sided Laplace transform]] by extending the limits of integration to be the entire real axis.  If that is done the common unilateral transform simply becomes a special case of the bilateral transform where the definition of the function being transformed is multiplied by the [[Heaviside step function]].\nThe bilateral Laplace transform is defined as follows:\n{{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a bilateral transform defined by\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\, dt</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\nAn alternate notation for the bilateral Laplace transform is <math>\\mathcal{B}\\{f\\}</math> instead of <math>F</math>.\n\n=== Inverse Laplace transform ===\n{{Main article|Inverse Laplace transform}}\nTwo integrable functions have the same Laplace transform only if they differ on a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero. This means that, on the range of the transform, there is an inverse transform. In fact, besides integrable functions, the Laplace transform is a [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]] mapping from one function space into another in many other function spaces as well, although there is usually no easy characterization of the range. Typical function spaces in which this is true include the spaces of bounded continuous functions, the space [[Lp space|{{math|''L''<sup>&infin;</sup>(0, &infin;)}}]], or more generally [[Distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distributions]] on {{open-open|0, &infin;}}.  The Laplace transform is also defined and injective for suitable spaces of tempered distributions.\n\nIn these cases, the image of the Laplace transform lives in a space of [[analytic function]]s in the [[#Region of convergence|region of convergence]].  The [[inverse Laplace transform]] is given by the following complex integral, which is known by various names (the '''Bromwich integral''', the '''Fourier\u2013Mellin integral''', and '''Mellin's inverse formula'''):\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F\\}(t) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\oint_{\\gamma - i T}^{\\gamma + i T} e^{st} F(s)\\, ds</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.3}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\nwhere {{math|''\u03b3''}} is a real number so that the contour path of integration is in the region of convergence of {{math|''F''(''s'')}}. An alternative formula for the inverse Laplace transform is given by [[Post's inversion formula]]. The limit here is interpreted in the [[weak-* topology#Weak-* topology|weak-* topology]].\n\nIn practice, it is typically more convenient to decompose a Laplace transform into known transforms of functions obtained from a table, and construct the inverse by inspection.\n\n=== Probability theory ===\nIn [[probability theory|pure]] and [[applied probability]], the Laplace transform is defined as an [[expected value]]. If {{math|''X''}} is a [[random variable]] with probability density function {{math|''f''}}, then the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} is given by the expectation\n: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\operatorname{E}\\! \\left[e^{-sX} \\right]\\! .</math>\n\nBy [[abuse of notation|convention]], this is referred to as the Laplace transform of the random variable {{math|''X''}} itself. Replacing {{math|''s''}} by {{math|\u2212''t''}} gives the [[moment generating function]] of {{math|''X''}}. The Laplace transform has applications throughout probability theory, including [[first passage time]]s of [[stochastic processes]] such as [[Markov chain]]s, and [[renewal theory]].\n\nOf particular use is the ability to recover the [[cumulative distribution function]] of a continuous random variable {{math|''X''}} by means of the Laplace transform as follows<ref>The cumulative distribution function is the integral of the probability density function.</ref>\n: <math>F_X(x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\operatorname{E}\\left[e^{-sX}\\right]\\right\\}\\! (x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\right\\}\\! (x).</math>\n\n== Region of convergence ==\nIf {{math|''f''}} is a locally integrable function (or more generally a Borel measure locally of bounded variation), then the Laplace transform {{math|''F''(''s'')}} of {{math|''f''}} converges provided that the limit\n: <math>\\lim_{R\\to\\infty}\\int_0^R f(t)e^{-st}\\,dt</math>\nexists.\n\nThe Laplace transform converges absolutely if the integral\n: <math>\\int_0^\\infty \\left|f(t)e^{-st}\\right|\\,dt</math>\nexists (as a proper Lebesgue integral).  The Laplace transform is usually understood as conditionally convergent, meaning that it converges in the former instead of the latter sense.\n\nThe set of values for which {{math|''F''(''s'')}} converges absolutely is either of the form {{math|Re(''s'') > ''a''}} or else {{math|Re(''s'') \u2265 ''a''}}, where {{math|''a''}} is an [[extended real number|extended real constant]], {{math|\u2212\u221e \u2264 ''a'' \u2264 \u221e}}.  (This follows from the [[dominated convergence theorem]].) The constant {{math|''a''}} is known as the abscissa of absolute convergence, and depends on the growth behavior of {{math|''f''(''t'')}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Widder|1941|loc=Chapter II, \u00a71}}</ref> Analogously, the two-sided transform converges absolutely in a strip of the form  {{math|''a'' < Re(''s'') < ''b''}}, and possibly including the lines {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''a''}} or {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''b''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Widder|1941|loc=Chapter VI, \u00a72}}</ref>  The subset of values of {{math|''s''}} for which the Laplace transform converges absolutely is called the region of absolute convergence or the domain of absolute convergence.  In the two-sided case, it is sometimes called the strip of absolute convergence. The Laplace transform is analytic in the region of absolute convergence: this is a consequence of [[Fubini's theorem]] and [[Morera's theorem]]. \n\nSimilarly, the set of values for which {{math|''F''(''s'')}} converges (conditionally or absolutely) is known as the region of conditional convergence, or simply the '''region of convergence''' (ROC).  If the Laplace transform converges (conditionally) at {{math|1=''s'' = ''s''<sub>0</sub>}}, then it automatically converges for all {{math|''s''}} with {{math|Re(''s'') > Re(''s''<sub>0</sub>)}}.  Therefore, the region of convergence is a half-plane of the form {{math|Re(''s'') > ''a''}}, possibly including some points of the boundary line {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''a''}}.\n\nIn the region of convergence {{math|Re(''s'') > Re(''s''<sub>0</sub>)}}, the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} can be expressed by [[integration by parts|integrating by parts]] as the integral\n: <math>F(s) = (s-s_0)\\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-s_0)t}\\beta(t)\\,dt,\\quad \\beta(u) = \\int_0^u e^{-s_0t}f(t)\\,dt.</math>\n\nThat is, in the region of convergence {{math|''F''(''s'')}} can effectively be expressed as the absolutely convergent Laplace transform of some other function.  In particular, it is analytic.\n\nThere are several [[Paley\u2013Wiener theorem]]s concerning the relationship between the decay properties of {{math|''f''}} and the properties of the Laplace transform within the region of convergence.\n\nIn engineering applications, a function corresponding to a [[LTI system|linear time-invariant (LTI) system]] is ''stable'' if every bounded input produces a bounded output.  This is equivalent to the absolute convergence of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function in the region {{math|Re(''s'') \u2265 0}}.  As a result, LTI systems are stable provided the poles of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function have negative real part.\n\nThis ROC is used in knowing about the causality and stability of a system.\n\n== Properties and theorems ==\nThe Laplace transform has a number of properties that make it useful for analyzing linear [[dynamical system]]s. The most significant advantage is that [[derivative|differentiation]] becomes multiplication, and [[integral|integration]] becomes division, by  {{math|''s''}} (similarly to [[logarithm]]s changing multiplication of numbers to addition of their logarithms).\n\nBecause of this property, the Laplace variable {{math|''s''}} is also known as ''operator variable'' in the {{math|''L''}} domain: either ''derivative operator'' or (for {{math|''s''<sup>\u22121</sup>)}} ''integration operator''. The transform turns [[integral equation]]s and [[differential equation]]s to [[polynomial equation]]s, which are much easier to solve.  Once solved, use of the inverse Laplace transform reverts to the original domain.\n\nGiven the functions {{math|''f''(''t'')}} and {{math|''g''(''t'')}}, and their respective Laplace transforms {{math|''F''(''s'')}} and {{math|''G''(''s'')}},\n: <math>\\begin{align}\nf(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\},\\\\\ng(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe following '''table''' is a list of properties of unilateral Laplace transform:<ref>{{harvnb|Korn|Korn|1967|pp=226&ndash;227}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" id=\"291017_tableid\"\n|+ Properties of the unilateral Laplace transform\n|-\n !\n !

If {{math|''g''}} is the [[antiderivative]] of {{math|''f''}}:\n\n: <math>g(x) = \\int_0^x f(t)\\,dt</math>\n\nthen the Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform of {{math|''g''}} and the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} coincide.  In general, the Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform is the Laplace transform of the [[Stieltjes measure]] associated to {{math|''g''}}.  So in practice, the only distinction between the two transforms is that the Laplace transform is thought of as operating on the density function of the measure, whereas the Laplace\u2013Stieltjes transform is thought of as operating on its [[cumulative distribution function]].<ref>{{harvnb|Feller|1971|p=432}}</ref>\n\n==== Fourier transform ====\n{{Main|Fourier transform}}\nThe continuous Fourier transform is equivalent to evaluating the bilateral Laplace transform with imaginary argument {{math|1=''s'' = ''i\u03c9''}} or {{math|1=''s'' = 2''\u03c0fi''}}<ref>{{harvnb|Takacs|1953|p=93}}</ref> when the condition explained below is fulfilled, \n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\widehat{f}(\\omega) &= \\mathcal{F}\\{f(t)\\} \\\\[4pt]\n                  &= \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}|_{s = i\\omega}  =  F(s)|_{s = i \\omega} \\\\[4pt]\n                  &= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\omega t} f(t)\\,dt~.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis definition of the Fourier transform requires a prefactor of {{math|1/(2''\u03c0'')}} on the reverse Fourier transform. This relationship between the Laplace and Fourier transforms is often used to determine the [[frequency spectrum]] of a [[signal (information theory)|signal]] or dynamical system.\n\nThe above relation is valid as stated if and only if the region of convergence (ROC) of  {{math|''F''(''s'')}} contains the imaginary axis,  {{math|1=''\u03c3'' = 0}}.\n\nFor example, the function {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = cos(''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>''t'')}} has a Laplace transform  {{math|1=''F''(''s'') =  ''s''/(''s''<sup>2</sup> + ''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>)}} whose ROC is {{math|Re(''s'') > 0}}. As {{math|1=''s'' = ''i\u03c9''}} is a pole of  {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, substituting  {{math|1=''s'' = ''i\u03c9''}} in {{math|''F''(''s'')}} does not yield the Fourier transform of  {{math|''f''(''t'')''u''(''t'')}}, which is proportional to the [[Dirac delta-function]] {{math|''\u03b4''(''\u03c9'' \u2212 ''\u03c9''<sub>0</sub>)}}.\n\nHowever, a relation of the form\n: <math>\\lim_{\\sigma\\to 0^+} F(\\sigma+i\\omega) = \\widehat{f}(\\omega)</math>\nholds under much weaker conditions.  For instance, this holds for the above example provided that the limit is understood as a [[weak limit]] of measures (see [[vague topology]]).  General conditions relating the limit of the Laplace transform of a function on the boundary to the Fourier transform take the form of [[Paley\u2013Wiener theorem]]s.\n\n==== Mellin transform ====\n{{Main|Mellin transform}}\nThe Mellin transform and its inverse are related to the two-sided Laplace transform by a simple change of variables.\n\nIf in the Mellin transform\n: <math>G(s) = \\mathcal{M}\\{g(\\theta)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty \\theta^s g(\\theta) \\, \\frac{d\\theta} \\theta </math>\nwe set {{math|1=''\u03b8'' = ''e''<sup>\u2212''t''</sup>}} we get a two-sided Laplace transform.\n\n==== Z-transform ====\n{{Main|Z-transform}}\nThe unilateral or one-sided Z-transform is simply the Laplace transform of an ideally sampled signal with the substitution of\n: <math> z \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} e^{sT} ,</math>\nwhere {{math|1=''T'' = 1/''f<sub>s</sub>''}} is the [[Sampling theorem|sampling]] period (in units of time e.g., seconds) and  {{math|''f<sub>s</sub>''}} is the [[sampling rate]] (in [[sample (signal)|samples per second]] or [[hertz]]).\n\nLet\n: <math> \\Delta_T(t) \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}  \\delta(t - n T) </math>\nbe a sampling impulse train (also called a [[Dirac comb]]) and\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  x_q(t) \\  &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  x(t) \\Delta_T(t) = x(t) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}  \\delta(t - n T) \\\\\n            &= \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x(n T) \\delta(t - n T) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x[n] \\delta(t - n T)\n\\end{align}</math>\nbe the sampled representation of the continuous-time {{math|''x''(''t'')}}\n: <math> x[n] \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{{}={}}  x(nT) ~.</math>\n\nThe Laplace transform of the sampled signal {{math|''x''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'') }} is\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  X_q(s) &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty x_q(t) e^{-s t} \\,dt \\\\\n         &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] \\delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \\, dt \\\\\n         &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \\, dt \\\\\n         &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] e^{-n s T}~.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis is the precise definition of the unilateral Z-transform of the discrete function {{math|''x''[''n'']}}\n\n: <math> X(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x[n] z^{-n} </math>\nwith the substitution of {{math|''z'' \u2192 e<sup>''sT''</sup>}}.\n\nComparing the last two equations, we find the relationship between the unilateral Z-transform and the Laplace transform of the sampled signal,\n: <math>X_q(s) =  X(z) \\Big|_{z=e^{sT}}.</math>\n\nThe similarity between the {{math|''Z''}} and Laplace transforms is expanded upon in the theory of [[time scale calculus]].\n\n==== Borel transform ====\nThe integral form of the [[Borel summation|Borel transform]]\n\n: <math>F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty f(z)e^{-sz}\\, dz</math>\n\nis a special case of the Laplace transform for {{math|''f''}} an [[entire function]] of exponential type, meaning that\n\n: <math>|f(z)|\\le Ae^{B|z|}</math>\n\nfor some constants {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}.  The generalized Borel transform allows a different weighting function to be used, rather than the exponential function, to transform functions not of exponential type. [[Nachbin's theorem]] gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the Borel transform to be well defined.\n\n==== Fundamental relationships ====\nSince an ordinary Laplace transform can be written as a special case of a two-sided transform, and since the two-sided transform can be written as the sum of two one-sided transforms, the theory of the Laplace-, Fourier-, Mellin-, and Z-transforms are at bottom the same subject. However, a different point of view and different characteristic problems are associated with each of these four major integral transforms.\n\n== Table of selected Laplace transforms ==\n{{main article|List of Laplace transforms}}\n\nThe following table provides Laplace transforms for many common functions of a single variable.<ref>{{Citation |edition=3rd |page=455 |first1=K.

Circuit elements can be transformed into [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s, very similar to [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasor]] impedances.\n\nHere is a summary of equivalents:\n\n: [[File:S-Domain circuit equivalents.svg|alt={{math|''s''}}-domain equivalent circuits|centre|frameless|400x400px|{{math|''s''}}-domain equivalent circuits]]\n\nNote that the resistor is exactly the same in the time domain and the {{math|''s''}}-domain. The sources are put in if there are initial conditions on the circuit elements. For example, if a capacitor has an initial voltage across it, or if the inductor has an initial current through it, the sources inserted in the {{math|''s''}}-domain account for that.\n\nThe equivalents for current and voltage sources are simply derived from the transformations in the table above.\n\n== Examples and applications ==\n<!--A few worked examples are provided here to enable the reader to assess comprehension of the factual presentation.  Elaboration beyond the role of supporting factual comprehension belongs at [[v:|Wikiversity]] or [[b:|Wikibooks]].-->\n\nThe Laplace transform is used frequently in [[engineering]] and [[physics]]; the output of a [[linear time-invariant]] system can be calculated by convolving its unit impulse response with the input signal. Performing this calculation in Laplace space turns the convolution into a multiplication; the latter being easier to solve because of its algebraic form. For more information, see [[control theory]].\n\nThe Laplace transform can also be used to solve differential equations and is used extensively in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].  The Laplace transform reduces a linear differential equation to an algebraic equation, which can then be solved by the formal rules of algebra.  The original differential equation can then be solved by applying the inverse Laplace transform.  The English electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside first proposed a similar scheme, although without using the Laplace transform; and the resulting operational calculus is credited as the Heaviside calculus.\n\n=== Evaluating improper integrals ===\nLet <math>\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{f(t)\\right\\} = F(s)</math>. Then (see the table above)\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L} \\left\\{\\frac{f(t)} t \\right\\} = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(t)}{t}e^{-st}\\, dt = \\int_s^\\infty F(p)\\, dp.</math>\n\nIn the limit <math>s \\rightarrow 0</math>, one gets\n\n:<math>\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(t)} t \\, dt = \\int_0^\\infty F(p)\\, dp,</math>\n\nprovided that the interchange of limits can be justified. Even when the interchange cannot be justified the calculation can be suggestive. For example, with ''a''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;0&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;''b'', proceeding formally one has\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{ \\cos(at) - \\cos(bt) }{t} \\, dt \n&= \\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0} \\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac p {p^2 + a^2} - \\frac{p}{p^2 + b^2}\\right)\\, dp \\\\[6pt]\n&= \\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0} \\Biggl[ \\frac 1 2 \\left. \\ln\\frac{p^2 + a^2}{p^2 + b^2} \\right|_{0}^\\infty \\Biggl] = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\frac{a^2}{b^2} = \\ln \\Biggl| \\frac {a}{b} \\Biggl|.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe validity of this identity can be proved by other means. It is an example of a [[Frullani integral]].\n\nAnother example is [[Dirichlet integral]].\n\n=== Complex impedance of a capacitor ===\nIn the theory of [[electrical circuit]]s, the current flow in a [[capacitor]] is proportional to the capacitance and rate of change in the electrical potential (in [[International System of Units|SI]] units). Symbolically, this is expressed by the differential equation\n\n: <math>i = C { dv \\over dt} ,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''C''}} is the capacitance (in [[farad]]s) of the capacitor, {{math|1=''i'' = ''i''(''t'')}} is the [[electric current]] (in [[ampere]]s) through the capacitor as a function of time, and {{math|1=''v'' = ''v''(''t'')}} is the [[electrostatic potential|voltage]] (in [[volt]]s) across the terminals of the capacitor, also as a function of time.\n\nTaking the Laplace transform of this equation, we obtain\n\n: <math>I(s) = C(s V(s) - V_0),</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n  I(s) &= \\mathcal{L} \\{ i(t) \\},\\\\\n  V(s) &= \\mathcal{L} \\{ v(t) \\},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>V_0 = v(t)\\Big|_{t=0}. \\, </math>\n\nSolving for {{math|''V''(''s'')}} we have\n\n: <math>V(s) = { I(s) \\over sC } + { V_0 \\over s }.</math>\n\nThe definition of the complex impedance {{math|''Z''}} (in [[ohm]]s) is the ratio of the complex voltage {{math|''V''}} divided by the complex current {{math|''I''}} while holding the initial state {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} at zero:\n\n: <math>Z(s) = \\left. { V(s) \\over I(s) } \\right|_{V_0 = 0}.</math>\n\nUsing this definition and the previous equation, we find:\n\n: <math>Z(s) = \\frac{1}{sC}, </math>\n\nwhich is the correct expression for the complex impedance of a capacitor. \nIn addition, the Laplace transform has large applications in control theory.\n\n=== Partial fraction expansion ===\n<!-- [[Partial fractions in Laplace transforms]] redirect here -->\nConsider a linear time-invariant system with [[transfer function]]\n: <math>H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s + \\alpha)(s + \\beta)}.</math>\n\nThe [[impulse response]] is simply the inverse Laplace transform of this transfer function:\n: <math>h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\}.</math>\n\nTo evaluate this inverse transform, we begin by expanding {{math|''H''(''s'')}} using the method of partial fraction expansion,\n\n: <math>\\frac{1}{(s + \\alpha)(s + \\beta)} = { P \\over s + \\alpha } + { R \\over s+\\beta }.</math>\n\nThe unknown constants {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''R''}} are the [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]]s located at the corresponding poles of the transfer function. Each residue represents the relative contribution of that [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] to the transfer function's overall shape.\n\nBy the [[residue theorem]], the inverse Laplace transform depends only upon the poles and their residues. To find the residue {{math|''P''}}, we multiply both sides of the equation by {{math|''s'' + ''\u03b1''}} to get\n: <math>\\frac{1}{s + \\beta} = P  + { R (s + \\alpha) \\over s + \\beta }.</math>\n\nThen by letting {{math|1=''s'' = \u2212''\u03b1''}}, the contribution from {{math|''R''}} vanishes and all that is left is\n: <math>P = \\left.{1 \\over s+\\beta}\\right|_{s=-\\alpha} = {1 \\over \\beta - \\alpha}.</math>\n\nSimilarly, the residue {{math|''R''}} is given by\n: <math>R = \\left.{1 \\over s + \\alpha}\\right|_{s=-\\beta} = {1 \\over \\alpha - \\beta}.</math>\n\nNote that\n: <math>R = {-1 \\over \\beta - \\alpha} = - P</math>\nand so the substitution of {{math|''R''}} and {{math|''P''}} into the expanded expression for {{math|''H''(''s'')}} gives\n: <math>H(s)  = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\alpha} \\right) \\cdot \\left(  { 1 \\over s + \\alpha } - { 1  \\over s + \\beta }  \\right).</math>\n\nFinally, using the linearity property and the known transform for exponential decay (see ''Item'' #''3'' in the ''Table of Laplace Transforms'', above), we can take the inverse Laplace transform of {{math|''H''(''s'')}} to obtain\n: <math>h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\} = \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\alpha}\\left(e^{-\\alpha t} - e^{-\\beta t}\\right),</math>\nwhich is the impulse response of the system.\n\n;Convolution\nThe same result can be achieved using the [[Convolution theorem|convolution property]] as if the system is a series of filters with transfer functions of {{math|1/(''s'' + ''a'')}} and {{math|1/(''s'' + ''b'')}}. That is, the inverse of\n\n: <math>H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s + a)(s + b)} = \\frac{1}{s+a} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s + b}</math>\n\nis\n\n: <math> \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s + a} \\right\\} * \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s + b} \\right\\} = e^{-at} * e^{-bt} = \\int_0^t e^{-ax}e^{-b(t - x)}\\, dx = \\frac{e^{-a t}-e^{-b t}}{b - a}.</math>\n\n=== Phase delay ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
