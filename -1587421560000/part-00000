This is mainly because the nation can be said to be the highest American hip hop-consuming nation after the Americans themselves.\n\nSome American hip hop artists have included and have been influenced by Nigerian music. For example, on an episode of the radio show ''The Let Out'', there was a \"Nigerian Gangsta Remix\" of the [[Jay-Z]] song \"Roc Boyz\" which features [[Fela Kuti]], one of the most influential Nigerian musicians of all time.<ref>{{cite web | title = Audio: East Village Radio 2/29 | publisher = The Fader | date = 2008-02-29 | url = http://www.thefader.com/articles/2008/3/4/audio-east-village-radio-2-29 | accessdate = 2008-03-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080505004603/http://www.thefader.com/articles/2008/3/4/audio-east-village-radio-2-29 | archive-date = 2008-05-05 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nContributors to Nigerian hip hop include the producer [[Cobhams Asuquo]].\n\n==Rwanda==\nHip hop spread to [[Rwanda]] in the early to mid-1980s. The most prominent figure in the early Rwandan scene was DJ Berry (Nsabimana Abdul Aziz), who was a [[DJ]] for Kigali Night and Cosmos and a presenter for [[Radio Rwanda]], in addition to being an early [[rapper]] and [[breakdancing|breakdancer]]. The Rwandan government of the period did not approve of hip hop, however, and DJ Berry was forced into exile in [[Goma]], [[Zaire]], where he continued performing. He later moved on to [[Germany]] and recorded \"Hey You\", which became a hit on both Rwandan and [[Uganda]]n radio. After returning to Africa in 1990, Berry continued to promote hip hop in Rwanda until his death from [[AIDS]] in 1996. By the mid-1990s, hip hop was growing increasingly popular in Rwanda, due to the introduction of 101 FM Kigali and [[TVR]] in 1995, and American and French rappers like [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[MC Solaar]] became popular.\n\nThe first locally recorded Rwandan [[hip hop music|hip hop]] hit was \"Peaced Up\" by KP Robinson ft Mc Monday Assoumani. This was promoted by DJ Alex of Radio Rwanda from 1997. The song inspired many youths around [[Kigali]] to begin recording.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\nThe famous rapper MC Monday Assoumani, after his tune with Robisons, started his radio presenting career at local FM known as Radio10, where he promoted Rwandan local artists from 2004 to 2011. From 2012 he is no longer using the name MC Monday; he is now rebranded as SAGA Assou Gashumba. Wanting to help the Rwandan music industry, he started a record label named IYI Production, which also rebranded as C4D Production.\n\nHip hop is growing up in this country and recently SAGA Assou released a song titled \"I want you back\", a hit song which is a mixture of English and Kinyarwanda.\n\n==Senegal==\n{{Main|Senegalese hip hop}}\n\n[[File:Darra j berlin05 4.JPG|thumb|[[Daara J]] live in Berlin]]\n\n[[Senegal]] has one of the most active hip hop scenes on the continent, and has produced international stars like [[MC Solaar]]. [[United States|US]] hip hop became popular in Senegal in the early 1980s, and a few [[Rapping|MC]]s began rapping. During this period, many Senegalese rappers were copying American performers quite closely. One often-cited reason for the prominence of Senegalese hip hop is the ancient musical and oral traditions of that country, which include some practices, like [[griot]]s and tassou, which are similar to [[rapping]].\n\nIt was not until later in the decade that a more distinctive Senegalese sound began evolving, along with the use of [[Wolof language|Wolof]] lyrics. The 1990s saw a division in the Senegalese scene, with some artists remaining underground, associated with the American [[alternative hip hop]] scene, while others, like Black Mboolo (\"Alal\"), fused hip hop with Senegalese [[mbalax]] style, (this is called \"mbalax rap\" or \"rap ragga soul\"), which uses the [[sabar]] drums. The most prominent performers from the modern period include [[Positive Black Soul]], [[Daara J]], and [[Akon]]. Others include [[M.C. Solaar]], Black Face, and [[Didier Awadi]].\n\n==Sierra Leone==\nSierra Leone Rap music was originated by a Sierra Leone\u2013based rapper; YOK Seven in the late 1990s. Prior to this time pop rapper [[Jimmy B]] had already blown up in South Africa. His pop rap was a rave in Sierra Leone during the mid 1990s. By then this kind of music was not even 30% appreciated in the country until a rapper by the name of Kao Denero came and spread it nationwide. Hip hop music in Sierra Leone is now the most played music in Sierra Leone with its growth rate in the number of rappers. The hottest emcees from Sierra Leone are: Kao Denero, Boss Laj, Supa Laj, Shadow Boxxer, Jimmy B, Yokseven,Souferior and Grammy-nominated artist and author [[Freddy Will]]. Other notable Sierra Leonean hiphop rappers include The late Shine D Godson, Mr-1ne, [[Daddy Saj]], Pizzy(P.M), Menace Da General, and Star Zee, Solokai, Jooel, Speedo, Rap G Enema.\nMost recently Sierra Leone hiphop has witnessed the rise of so many new skull rappers...\n\n==Somalia==\n\nOne of the most internationally renowned Somali rappers is Canada-based [[K'naan]] (real name Kanaan Warsame). The award-winning artist is a rapper and a poet with three albums, ''The Dusty Foot Philosopher'' (on BMG Music), ''The Dusty Foot on the Road'' (on Wrasse Records) and ''Troubadour'' (on A&M/OctoScope Music)\n\n==South Africa==\nAlthough the history of South African hip hop in Cape Town can be tracked back to the early 1980s, cultural exchange between the United States, the West Indies, and South Africa was widespread since the 19th century. South African artists were influenced by [[minstrel]]sy and [[Swing music|swing]] to [[bebop]] and beyond, which was partly in response to British imperialism.<ref name=\"Ariefdien 2006\">Ariefdien, Shaheen and Nazli Abrahams. \"Cape Flats Academy: Hip-Hop Arts in South Africa.\" In Total Chaos: The Art and Aesthetics of Hip-Hop, ed.

In the late 19th century gold was discovered in Johannesburg, and people from different tribes began to migrate to the Johannesburg area. As a result of the rich diversity of various South African tribes, traditional music of South Africa mixed with European music led to the development of a different sound. <!-- THE TEXT IN THIS COMMENT SHOULD BE IN A SEPARATE KWAITO ARTICLE ::As laws were imposed to isolate each tribe, creating an apartheid, music was different in each tribe. However, one particularly interesting genre of music was mbaqanga which later developed into \"bubblegum\", which is a mix of African-American and traditional mbaqanga beat. This caused the first wave of political oppression music and [[anti-apartheid]] lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9906/09/kwaito.wb/CNN|title=Wright, Steve June 9, 1999.|website=Cnn.com}}</ref> As a result, a form of music, named [[kwaito]], developed first in 1995 which allowed artists to express themselves and talk about the many problems in everyday life.<ref>Mhlambi, Thokozani. \"'Kwaitofabulous': The study of a South African urban genre.\" Journal of the Musical Arts in Africa, vol 1 (2004): 116-27. </ref>::-->\nThe musical and [[social movement]] of hip hop in [[South Africa]] has grown exponentially in the last two decades, most notoriously in the form of home-grown [[Kwaito]], which is actually a distinct [[musical genre]] in itself.\n\nMuch of hip hop and Kwaito in South Africa is derived from western beats and tunes mixed with localized rhythms and accents.\n\nLyrically, South African hip hop is largely reliant on the political landscape from which the country has only recently emerged. If the explicit mention of [[Apartheid]] is not offered, lyrics will often revolve around the residue of the political system; such as the prevalence of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]], violence in the major cities, and what it means to be South African.\n\nOn the other hand, Kwaito has been seen as more devoted to \"positive imagery\", taking listeners away from the harsher realities of [[township (South Africa)|township]] life, where it originated. Currently, South African hip hop is beginning to diverge and acquire its own musical style, as individual provinces are developing their own styles of hip hop.\n\nAs much as hip hop has grown in South Africa it is still in its infancy in terms of recognition and artists rarely sell well. Differences in styles and approaches to the art have led to the South African market being split into sectors, for example: [[Cape Town]] has long been termed South African hip hop's birth ground with its more politically charged and socially conscious artists.\n\nTracing its origins in South Africa, the youth embraced hip hop and its culture from the United States including its break dancing and graffiti aspects.<ref name=\"allafrica.com\">{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200706270483.html|title=South Africa: Hip Hop Revolution|newspaper=Allafrica.com|accessdate=18 July 2016|date=2007-06-27|last1=Clark|first1=Msia Kibona|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807044108/http://allafrica.com/stories/200706270483.html|archive-date=7 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> These styles of expression were the predecessors to involvement in the music, due to the high cost and difficulty in finding music.

They localized the music to express culture, frustration, and hope in order to tell their own stories.<ref name=\"allafrica.com\"/> The older population used that anger and passion to pass messages against the occurring apartheid, and also to connect with the youth. The music was perfect for the time because it was able to take the language of the underprivileged, parade it, and make it attractive to the point where people took pride in their style of music.<ref name=\"Ariefdien 2006\"/>\n\nSome South African hip hop artists include [[Tuks Senganga]], [[Die Antwoord]], [[Zola (entertainer)|Zola]], [[Proverb]], [[Kwesta]], [[AKA (rapper)|AKA]], [[Cassper Nyovest]], [[L-Tido]], [[Riky Rick]], [[Nasty C]], [[Emtee]], [[Shane Eagle]], and [[Tumi Molekane]].\n\n==Tanzania==\n{{Main|Tanzanian hip hop}}\n\n==Togo==\n{{Main|Togolese hip hop}}\n\n==Uganda==\nUganda's hip hop scene began in the early to mid-1990s, especially among university students at [[Makerere University]] and elsewhere. The [[Bataka Squad]], formed in the early 1990s are the originators of the Lugaflow style, using the native Luganda language. Other formative groups on the Ugandan hip hop scene in the early 90s include Young Vibrations, MC Afrik, DJ Berry, Sylvester and Abramz and Kaddo. Club Pulsations in Kampala was a hotspot for Ugandan hip hop in the 90s. In recent years groups such as Klear Kut, Milestone, Chain Thought Reaction and many more have emerged. In 2002, Klear Kut were nominated for the [[Kora Awards|Kora All Africa Music Awards]] in the \"Most Promising African Group\" and \"Revelation of the Year\" categories.\n\nIn 2003 Geoffrey Ekongot, Saba Saba aka Krazy Native, of the Bataka Squad, Francis Agaba, the late Paul Mwandha of Musicuganda.com, and Xenson formed the Uganda Hip Hop Foundation. In 2003, the Foundation hosted the first Ugandan Hip Hop Summit and concert at Club Sabrina's in Kampala. It was so successful that they have hosted it every year for the past four years.

He is also the producer with the most singles produced and recorded. Most of Lumix's singles were either freestyles or were written 5\u201310 minutes before being recorded. Due to his catchy and crystal clear rhyme delivery techniques, Lumix Da Don earned his place as the most quoted artist in Uganda.

This is mainly because the nation can be said to be the highest American hip hop-consuming nation after the Americans themselves.\n\nSome American hip hop artists have included and have been influenced by Nigerian music. For example, on an episode of the radio show ''The Let Out'', there was a \"Nigerian Gangsta Remix\" of the [[Jay-Z]] song \"Roc Boyz\" which features [[Fela Kuti]], one of the most influential Nigerian musicians of all time.<ref>{{cite web | title = Audio: East Village Radio 2/29 | publisher = The Fader | date = 2008-02-29 | url = http://www.thefader.com/articles/2008/3/4/audio-east-village-radio-2-29 | accessdate = 2008-03-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080505004603/http://www.thefader.com/articles/2008/3/4/audio-east-village-radio-2-29 | archive-date = 2008-05-05 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nContributors to Nigerian hip hop include the producer [[Cobhams Asuquo]].\n\n==Rwanda==\nHip hop spread to [[Rwanda]] in the early to mid-1980s. The most prominent figure in the early Rwandan scene was DJ Berry (Nsabimana Abdul Aziz), who was a [[DJ]] for Kigali Night and Cosmos and a presenter for [[Radio Rwanda]], in addition to being an early [[rapper]] and [[breakdancing|breakdancer]]. The Rwandan government of the period did not approve of hip hop, however, and DJ Berry was forced into exile in [[Goma]], [[Zaire]], where he continued performing. He later moved on to [[Germany]] and recorded \"Hey You\", which became a hit on both Rwandan and [[Uganda]]n radio. After returning to Africa in 1990, Berry continued to promote hip hop in Rwanda until his death from [[AIDS]] in 1996. By the mid-1990s, hip hop was growing increasingly popular in Rwanda, due to the introduction of 101 FM Kigali and [[TVR]] in 1995, and American and French rappers like [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[MC Solaar]] became popular.\n\nThe first locally recorded Rwandan [[hip hop music|hip hop]] hit was \"Peaced Up\" by KP Robinson ft Mc Monday Assoumani. This was promoted by DJ Alex of Radio Rwanda from 1997. The song inspired many youths around [[Kigali]] to begin recording.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\nThe famous rapper MC Monday Assoumani, after his tune with Robisons, started his radio presenting career at local FM known as Radio10, where he promoted Rwandan local artists from 2004 to 2011. From 2012 he is no longer using the name MC Monday; he is now rebranded as SAGA Assou Gashumba. Wanting to help the Rwandan music industry, he started a record label named IYI Production, which also rebranded as C4D Production.\n\nHip hop is growing up in this country and recently SAGA Assou released a song titled \"I want you back\", a hit song which is a mixture of English and Kinyarwanda.\n\n==Senegal==\n{{Main|Senegalese hip hop}}\n\n[[File:Darra j berlin05 4.JPG|thumb|[[Daara J]] live in Berlin]]\n\n[[Senegal]] has one of the most active hip hop scenes on the continent, and has produced international stars like [[MC Solaar]]. [[United States|US]] hip hop became popular in Senegal in the early 1980s, and a few [[Rapping|MC]]s began rapping. During this period, many Senegalese rappers were copying American performers quite closely. One often-cited reason for the prominence of Senegalese hip hop is the ancient musical and oral traditions of that country, which include some practices, like [[griot]]s and tassou, which are similar to [[rapping]].\n\nIt was not until later in the decade that a more distinctive Senegalese sound began evolving, along with the use of [[Wolof language|Wolof]] lyrics. The 1990s saw a division in the Senegalese scene, with some artists remaining underground, associated with the American [[alternative hip hop]] scene, while others, like Black Mboolo (\"Alal\"), fused hip hop with Senegalese [[mbalax]] style, (this is called \"mbalax rap\" or \"rap ragga soul\"), which uses the [[sabar]] drums. The most prominent performers from the modern period include [[Positive Black Soul]], [[Daara J]], and [[Akon]]. Others include [[M.C. Solaar]], Black Face, and [[Didier Awadi]].\n\n==Sierra Leone==\nSierra Leone Rap music was originated by a Sierra Leone\u2013based rapper; YOK Seven in the late 1990s. Prior to this time pop rapper [[Jimmy B]] had already blown up in South Africa. His pop rap was a rave in Sierra Leone during the mid 1990s. By then this kind of music was not even 30% appreciated in the country until a rapper by the name of Kao Denero came and spread it nationwide. Hip hop music in Sierra Leone is now the most played music in Sierra Leone with its growth rate in the number of rappers. The hottest emcees from Sierra Leone are: Kao Denero, Boss Laj, Supa Laj, Shadow Boxxer, Jimmy B, Yokseven,Souferior and Grammy-nominated artist and author [[Freddy Will]]. Other notable Sierra Leonean hiphop rappers include The late Shine D Godson, Mr-1ne, [[Daddy Saj]], Pizzy(P.M), Menace Da General, and Star Zee, Solokai, Jooel, Speedo, Rap G Enema.\nMost recently Sierra Leone hiphop has witnessed the rise of so many new skull rappers...\n\n==Somalia==\n\nOne of the most internationally renowned Somali rappers is Canada-based [[K'naan]] (real name Kanaan Warsame). The award-winning artist is a rapper and a poet with three albums, ''The Dusty Foot Philosopher'' (on BMG Music), ''The Dusty Foot on the Road'' (on Wrasse Records) and ''Troubadour'' (on A&M/OctoScope Music)\n\n==South Africa==\nAlthough the history of South African hip hop in Cape Town can be tracked back to the early 1980s, cultural exchange between the United States, the West Indies, and South Africa was widespread since the 19th century. South African artists were influenced by [[minstrel]]sy and [[Swing music|swing]] to [[bebop]] and beyond, which was partly in response to British imperialism.<ref name=\"Ariefdien 2006\">Ariefdien, Shaheen and Nazli Abrahams. \"Cape Flats Academy: Hip-Hop Arts in South Africa.\" In Total Chaos: The Art and Aesthetics of Hip-Hop, ed.

In the late 19th century gold was discovered in Johannesburg, and people from different tribes began to migrate to the Johannesburg area. As a result of the rich diversity of various South African tribes, traditional music of South Africa mixed with European music led to the development of a different sound. <!-- THE TEXT IN THIS COMMENT SHOULD BE IN A SEPARATE KWAITO ARTICLE ::As laws were imposed to isolate each tribe, creating an apartheid, music was different in each tribe. However, one particularly interesting genre of music was mbaqanga which later developed into \"bubblegum\", which is a mix of African-American and traditional mbaqanga beat. This caused the first wave of political oppression music and [[anti-apartheid]] lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9906/09/kwaito.wb/CNN|title=Wright, Steve June 9, 1999.|website=Cnn.com}}</ref> As a result, a form of music, named [[kwaito]], developed first in 1995 which allowed artists to express themselves and talk about the many problems in everyday life.<ref>Mhlambi, Thokozani. \"'Kwaitofabulous': The study of a South African urban genre.\" Journal of the Musical Arts in Africa, vol 1 (2004): 116-27. </ref>::-->\nThe musical and [[social movement]] of hip hop in [[South Africa]] has grown exponentially in the last two decades, most notoriously in the form of home-grown [[Kwaito]], which is actually a distinct [[musical genre]] in itself.\n\nMuch of hip hop and Kwaito in South Africa is derived from western beats and tunes mixed with localized rhythms and accents.\n\nLyrically, South African hip hop is largely reliant on the political landscape from which the country has only recently emerged. If the explicit mention of [[Apartheid]] is not offered, lyrics will often revolve around the residue of the political system; such as the prevalence of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]], violence in the major cities, and what it means to be South African.\n\nOn the other hand, Kwaito has been seen as more devoted to \"positive imagery\", taking listeners away from the harsher realities of [[township (South Africa)|township]] life, where it originated. Currently, South African hip hop is beginning to diverge and acquire its own musical style, as individual provinces are developing their own styles of hip hop.\n\nAs much as hip hop has grown in South Africa it is still in its infancy in terms of recognition and artists rarely sell well. Differences in styles and approaches to the art have led to the South African market being split into sectors, for example: [[Cape Town]] has long been termed South African hip hop's birth ground with its more politically charged and socially conscious artists.\n\nTracing its origins in South Africa, the youth embraced hip hop and its culture from the United States including its break dancing and graffiti aspects.<ref name=\"allafrica.com\">{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200706270483.html|title=South Africa: Hip Hop Revolution|newspaper=Allafrica.com|accessdate=18 July 2016|date=2007-06-27|last1=Clark|first1=Msia Kibona|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807044108/http://allafrica.com/stories/200706270483.html|archive-date=7 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> These styles of expression were the predecessors to involvement in the music, due to the high cost and difficulty in finding music.

They localized the music to express culture, frustration, and hope in order to tell their own stories.<ref name=\"allafrica.com\"/> The older population used that anger and passion to pass messages against the occurring apartheid, and also to connect with the youth. The music was perfect for the time because it was able to take the language of the underprivileged, parade it, and make it attractive to the point where people took pride in their style of music.<ref name=\"Ariefdien 2006\"/>\n\nSome South African hip hop artists include [[Tuks Senganga]], [[Die Antwoord]], [[Zola (entertainer)|Zola]], [[Proverb]], [[Kwesta]], [[AKA (rapper)|AKA]], [[Cassper Nyovest]], [[L-Tido]], [[Riky Rick]], [[Nasty C]], [[Emtee]], [[Shane Eagle]], and [[Tumi Molekane]].\n\n==Tanzania==\n{{Main|Tanzanian hip hop}}\n\n==Togo==\n{{Main|Togolese hip hop}}\n\n==Uganda==\nUganda's hip hop scene began in the early to mid-1990s, especially among university students at [[Makerere University]] and elsewhere. The [[Bataka Squad]], formed in the early 1990s are the originators of the Lugaflow style, using the native Luganda language. Other formative groups on the Ugandan hip hop scene in the early 90s include Young Vibrations, MC Afrik, DJ Berry, Sylvester and Abramz and Kaddo. Club Pulsations in Kampala was a hotspot for Ugandan hip hop in the 90s. In recent years groups such as Klear Kut, Milestone, Chain Thought Reaction and many more have emerged. In 2002, Klear Kut were nominated for the [[Kora Awards|Kora All Africa Music Awards]] in the \"Most Promising African Group\" and \"Revelation of the Year\" categories.\n\nIn 2003 Geoffrey Ekongot, Saba Saba aka Krazy Native, of the Bataka Squad, Francis Agaba, the late Paul Mwandha of Musicuganda.com, and Xenson formed the Uganda Hip Hop Foundation. In 2003, the Foundation hosted the first Ugandan Hip Hop Summit and concert at Club Sabrina's in Kampala. It was so successful that they have hosted it every year for the past four years.

He is also the producer with the most singles produced and recorded. Most of Lumix's singles were either freestyles or were written 5\u201310 minutes before being recorded. Due to his catchy and crystal clear rhyme delivery techniques, Lumix Da Don earned his place as the most quoted artist in Uganda.

Fan filmmakers have traditionally been [[amateur]]s, but some of the more notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in quality, as well as in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to full-length motion pictures. Fan films are also examples of [[fan labor]] and the [[remix culture]]. Closely related concepts are [[Fandub]]s, [[Fansub]]s and [[Vidding]] which are reworks of fans on already released film material.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known fan film is ''Anderson 'Our Gang'',<ref name=\"Young, Clive 2008\">Young, Clive (2008) Homemade Hollywood: Fans Behind The Camera, Continuum Books, New York / London</ref> which was produced in 1926 by a pair of itinerant filmmakers. Shot in Anderson, South Carolina, the short is based on the ''[[Our Gang]]'' film series; the only known copy resides in the University of South Carolina's Newsfilm Library. Various amateur filmmakers created their own fan films throughout the ensuing decades, including a teenaged [[Hugh Hefner]],<ref name=\"Young, Clive 2008\"/> but the technology required to make fan films was a limiting factor until relatively recently. In the 1960s UCLA film student [[Donald F. Glut|Don Glut]] filmed a series of short black and white \"underground films\", based on adventure and comic book characters from 1940s and 1950s motion picture serials. Around the same time, artist [[Andy Warhol]] produced a film called ''[[Batman Dracula]]'' which could be described as a fan film. But it wasn't until the 1970s that the popularization of [[science fiction convention]]s allowed fans to show their films to the wider fan community.\n\nIn the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, there were many unofficial foreign remakes of American films that today may be considered fan films, such as ''[[S\u00fcpermenler]]'' ([[Superman]]), ''[[3 Dev Adam]]'', ([[Spider-Man]]), ''[[Mahakaal]]'' (''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''), and ''[[D\u00fcnyay\u0131 Kurtaran Adam]]'' (''[[Star Wars]]'').\n\nMost of the more prominent science fiction films and television shows are represented in fan films; these include ''[[Star Wars]]'' (see [[:Category:Fan films based on Star Wars]]), ''[[Star Trek]]'' (see [[Star Trek fan productions]]), ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (see [[Doctor Who spin-offs#Video|Doctor Who spin-offs]]), and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' (see [[Unofficial Buffy the Vampire Slayer productions]]). Because fan films generally utilize characters and storylines [[copyright]]ed and [[trademark]]ed by the original filmmakers, they are rarely distributed commercially for legal reasons. They are exhibited by various other methods, including showings at [[comic book]] and science fiction conventions, and distribution as homemade videos, ranging from [[VHS]] videocassettes to [[CD-ROM]]s and [[DVD]]s.\n\nNotable fan film is also ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation]]'', made as a [[shot-for-shot]] remake of the 1981 [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]] adventure film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''. Using the original film's screenplay and score, it principally starred and was filmed, directed, and produced over a seven-year period by three [[Mississippi]] teenagers (Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala, and Jayson Lamb). In 2015, the documentary ''[[Raiders!: The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made]]'' was released. The film follows three childhood friends, Eric Zala, Chris Strompolos, and Jayson Lamb, from 1982 to 1989 as they set out to make their fan film of ''Raiders'' fan film.\n\nFilmmaker [[Sandy Collora]] gained much notoriety in the early 2000s for a series of fan films he produced featuring [[DC Comics]] heroes Batman and Superman. ''[[Batman: Dead End]]'' premiered at the 2003 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]], while ''[[World's Finest (fan film)|World's Finest]]'' was prevented from showing in 2004 due to copyright claims from [[Warner Bros.]]<ref>{{cite web | last = Holtreman |first = Vic|title = Sandy Collora's World's Finest trailer is out | website = | publisher = Screenrant.com | date = 2004-07-23|url = http://screenrant.com/sandy-colloras-worlds-finest-trailer-is-out-vic-119/|accessdate = 2012-03-18}}</ref>\n\nSome fan film productions achieve significant quantity and or quality. For instance, the series ''[[Star Trek: Hidden Frontier]]'' produced 50 episodes over seven seasons - compared to only 34 episodes for the 1970s sci-fi series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' and ''[[Galactica 1980]]'' combined.\n\n''[[Star Trek: New Voyages]]'' started as a fan production, but has since attracted support from several crew and cast members from the different ''Star Trek'' series, as well as a wide audience.\n\nOn October 31, 2016, greek film director, film producer and writer Christos Arfanis, released ''[[Saw: Heritage]]''<ref>{{Citation|title=SAW: Heritage|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6093012/|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>.

Fan filmmakers have traditionally been [[amateur]]s, but some of the more notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in quality, as well as in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to full-length motion pictures. Fan films are also examples of [[fan labor]] and the [[remix culture]]. Closely related concepts are [[Fandub]]s, [[Fansub]]s and [[Vidding]] which are reworks of fans on already released film material.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known fan film is ''Anderson 'Our Gang'',<ref name=\"Young, Clive 2008\">Young, Clive (2008) Homemade Hollywood: Fans Behind The Camera, Continuum Books, New York / London</ref> which was produced in 1926 by a pair of itinerant filmmakers. Shot in Anderson, South Carolina, the short is based on the ''[[Our Gang]]'' film series; the only known copy resides in the University of South Carolina's Newsfilm Library. Various amateur filmmakers created their own fan films throughout the ensuing decades, including a teenaged [[Hugh Hefner]],<ref name=\"Young, Clive 2008\"/> but the technology required to make fan films was a limiting factor until relatively recently. In the 1960s UCLA film student [[Donald F. Glut|Don Glut]] filmed a series of short black and white \"underground films\", based on adventure and comic book characters from 1940s and 1950s motion picture serials. Around the same time, artist [[Andy Warhol]] produced a film called ''[[Batman Dracula]]'' which could be described as a fan film. But it wasn't until the 1970s that the popularization of [[science fiction convention]]s allowed fans to show their films to the wider fan community.\n\nIn the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, there were many unofficial foreign remakes of American films that today may be considered fan films, such as ''[[S\u00fcpermenler]]'' ([[Superman]]), ''[[3 Dev Adam]]'', ([[Spider-Man]]), ''[[Mahakaal]]'' (''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''), and ''[[D\u00fcnyay\u0131 Kurtaran Adam]]'' (''[[Star Wars]]'').\n\nMost of the more prominent science fiction films and television shows are represented in fan films; these include ''[[Star Wars]]'' (see [[:Category:Fan films based on Star Wars]]), ''[[Star Trek]]'' (see [[Star Trek fan productions]]), ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (see [[Doctor Who spin-offs#Video|Doctor Who spin-offs]]), and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' (see [[Unofficial Buffy the Vampire Slayer productions]]). Because fan films generally utilize characters and storylines [[copyright]]ed and [[trademark]]ed by the original filmmakers, they are rarely distributed commercially for legal reasons. They are exhibited by various other methods, including showings at [[comic book]] and science fiction conventions, and distribution as homemade videos, ranging from [[VHS]] videocassettes to [[CD-ROM]]s and [[DVD]]s.\n\nNotable fan film is also ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation]]'', made as a [[shot-for-shot]] remake of the 1981 [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]] adventure film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''. Using the original film's screenplay and score, it principally starred and was filmed, directed, and produced over a seven-year period by three [[Mississippi]] teenagers (Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala, and Jayson Lamb). In 2015, the documentary ''[[Raiders!: The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made]]'' was released. The film follows three childhood friends, Eric Zala, Chris Strompolos, and Jayson Lamb, from 1982 to 1989 as they set out to make their fan film of ''Raiders'' fan film.\n\nFilmmaker [[Sandy Collora]] gained much notoriety in the early 2000s for a series of fan films he produced featuring [[DC Comics]] heroes Batman and Superman. ''[[Batman: Dead End]]'' premiered at the 2003 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]], while ''[[World's Finest (fan film)|World's Finest]]'' was prevented from showing in 2004 due to copyright claims from [[Warner Bros.]]<ref>{{cite web | last = Holtreman |first = Vic|title = Sandy Collora's World's Finest trailer is out | website = | publisher = Screenrant.com | date = 2004-07-23|url = http://screenrant.com/sandy-colloras-worlds-finest-trailer-is-out-vic-119/|accessdate = 2012-03-18}}</ref>\n\nSome fan film productions achieve significant quantity and or quality. For instance, the series ''[[Star Trek: Hidden Frontier]]'' produced 50 episodes over seven seasons - compared to only 34 episodes for the 1970s sci-fi series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' and ''[[Galactica 1980]]'' combined.\n\n''[[Star Trek: New Voyages]]'' started as a fan production, but has since attracted support from several crew and cast members from the different ''Star Trek'' series, as well as a wide audience.\n\nOn October 31, 2016, greek film director, film producer and writer [[Christos Arfanis]], released ''[[Saw: Heritage]]''<ref>{{Citation|title=SAW: Heritage|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6093012/|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>.

He had his crew fashion neckrings out of thick iron and copper wire, twisted together. These were extremely popular on the coast in 1791.

The EU LCS' secondary league, the EU Challenger Series (EUCS), was consequently discontinued and replaced with an independent tournament named European Masters, which features the top teams from Europe's many regional leagues.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Split\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em; background:gold;\" | Champion\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em; background:silver;\" | Runner-up\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em; background:#c96;\" | Third\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\" |Fourth\n! colspan=\"3\" |Qualified for [[League of Legends World Championship|WC]]\n|-\n! style=\"width:9em;|Seed 1\n! style=\"width:9em;|Seed 2\n! style=\"width:9em;|Seed 3\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2013\n| scope=\"row\" | Spring\n|[[Fnatic]]\n|[[Gambit Gaming]]\n|[[Evil Geniuses]]\n|[[SK Gaming]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fnatic]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Lemondogs\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Gambit Gaming]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Summer\n|[[Fnatic]]\n|Lemondogs\n|[[Gambit Gaming]]\n|[[Evil Geniuses]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2014\n| scope=\"row\" | Spring\n|[[Fnatic]]\n|[[SK Gaming]]\n|[[Roccat]]\n|[[Alliance (esports)|Alliance]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Alliance (esports)|Alliance]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fnatic]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[SK Gaming]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Summer\n|[[Alliance (esports)|Alliance]]\n|[[Fnatic]]\n|[[SK Gaming]]\n|[[Roccat]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2015\n| scope=\"row\" | Spring\n|[[Fnatic]]\n|[[Unicorns of Love]]\n|[[H2K-Gaming|H2K]]\n|[[SK Gaming]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fnatic]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[H2K-Gaming|H2K]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Origen (esports)|Origen]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[2015 Summer European League of Legends Championship Series|Summer]]\n|[[Fnatic]]\n|[[Origen (esports)|Origen]]\n|[[H2K-Gaming|H2K]]\n|[[Unicorns of Love]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2016\n| scope=\"row\" | [[2016 Spring European League of Legends Championship Series|Spring]]\n|[[G2 Esports]]\n|[[Origen (esports)|Origen]]\n|[[Fnatic]]\n|[[H2K-Gaming|H2K]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[G2 Esports]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[H2K-Gaming|H2K]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Splyce]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[2016 Summer European League of Legends Championship Series|Summer]]\n|[[G2 Esports]]\n|[[Splyce]]\n|[[H2K-Gaming|H2K]]\n|[[Unicorns of Love]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2017\n| scope=\"row\" | [[2017 Spring European League of Legends Championship Series|Spring]]\n|[[G2 Esports]]\n|[[Unicorns of Love]]\n|[[Fnatic]]\n|[[Misfits Gaming]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[G2 Esports]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Misfits Gaming]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fnatic]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[2017 Summer European League of Legends Championship Series|Summer]]\n|[[G2 Esports]]\n|[[Misfits Gaming]]\n|[[Fnatic]]\n|[[H2K-Gaming|H2K]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2018\n| scope=\"row\" | [[2018 Spring European League of Legends Championship Series|Spring]]\n|[[Fnatic]]\n|[[G2 Esports]]\n|[[Splyce]]\n|[[Team Vitality]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fnatic]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Team Vitality]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[G2 Esports]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Summer\n|[[Fnatic]]\n|[[FC Schalke 04 (esports)|Schalke 04]]\n|[[Team Vitality]]\n|[[Misfits Gaming]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2019\n| scope=\"row\" | Spring\n|[[G2 Esports]]\n|[[Origen (esports)|Origen]]\n|[[Fnatic]]\n|[[Splyce]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[G2 Esports]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Fnatic]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Splyce]]\n|-\n|Summer\n| [[G2 Esports]]\n| [[Fnatic]]\n| [[FC Schalke 04 (esports)|Schalke 04]]\n|[[Rogue (esports)|Rogue]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |2020\n| scope=\"row\" | Spring\n|[[G2 Esports]]\n|[[Fnatic]]\n|[[MAD Lions]]\n|[[Origen (esports)|Origen]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |TBD\n| rowspan=\"2\" |TBD\n| rowspan=\"2\" |TBD\n|-\n|Summer\n| TBD\n| TBD\n| TBD\n| TBD\n|}\n\n==Broadcast Talent==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Each season is divided into two splits. The regular season of each split consists of 9 weeks of play, in which each team plays each other twice, for a total of 18 games each. At the conclusion of each split, a playoff consisting of the top 6 teams from the regular season is played to determine the final standings. \n\nThe current playoff format introduced in 2019 consists of 4 rounds. In round 1, the third seed chooses to face either the fifth or sixth seed and the fourth seed faces the remaining team. The winners of these matches then play each other in round 2, and the winner of this match advances to the round 3. In round 3, the first and second seeds play against each other in a \"juggernaut\" match. The winner of this match advances directly to the final round; the loser faces the winner of round 2 in a \"decider\" match, and the winner of this decider match advances to the final.\n\nEach split's playoffs award cash prizes and Championship Points, which are used to determine qualification into the annual ''League of Legends'' World Championship. The winner of the summer split automatically qualifies as Europe's first seed, while the next four teams ranked by Championship Point total play the Regional Qualifier Tournament to determine the two additional seeds for the World Championship.\n\n===Overview===\n\n* 10 teams participate.\n* Each team plays 18 matches:\n** Using a Double Round Robin format.\n** Each match is a best of one.\n* The top 6 teams qualifies to the playoffs.\n* [https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.eu.lolesports.com/LEC+Rulebook+'19+(Updated_+18.01.2019).pdf Official 2019 Season LEC Rulebook]\n\n===Teams===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Teams\n!rowspan=\"2\"|First appearance in LCS\n!colspan=\"5\"|Starting Rosters\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Coach\n|-\n!Top\n!Jungle\n!Mid\n!Bot\n!Support\n|-\n|'''[[Fnatic]]'''\n|Spring 2013\n|{{flagicon|BEL}} Bwipo\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Selfmade<br/> {{flagicon|UK}} Dan\n|{{flagicon|SVN}} Nemesis\n|{{flagicon|SWE}} [[Rekkles]]\n|{{flagicon|BUL}} Hylissang\n|{{flagicon|ESP}} [[Mithy]]\n|-\n|-\n|'''[[SK Gaming]]'''\n|Spring 2013\n|{{flagicon|CRO}} Sacre\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} [[Trick (League of Legends player)|Trick]]\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Jenax\n|{{flagicon|SVN}} Crownshot\n|{{flagicon|CRO}} LIMIT\n|{{flagicon|BUL}} Unlimited\n|-\n|'''[[Origen (esports)|Origen]]'''\n|Summer 2015\n|{{flagicon|UK}} Alphari\n|{{flagicon|ROM}} Xerxe\n|{{flagicon|NOR}} Nukeduck\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Upset\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} Destiny\n|{{flagicon|POR}} Guilhoto\n|-\n|'''[[G2 Esports]]'''\n|Spring 2016\n|{{flagicon|DEN}} [[Wunder (video game player)|Wunder]]\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Jankos\n|{{flagicon|CRO}} [[PerkZ|Perkz]]\n|{{flagicon|DEN}} [[Caps (video game player)|Caps]]\n|{{flagicon|SVN}} Mikyx\n|{{flagicon|GER}} GrabbZ\n|-\n|'''[[Team Vitality]]'''\n|Spring 2016\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Cabochard]]\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} Skeanz\n|{{flagicon|SER}} Milica\n|{{flagicon|GRE}} Comp\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Jactroll\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} Duke\n|-\n|'''[[FC Schalke 04 (esports)|Schalke 04]]'''\n|Summer 2016\n|{{flagicon|ROM}} Odoamne\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Gilius\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Abbedagge\n|{{Flagicon|Greece}} [[FORG1VEN]]<br/>{{flagicon|BUL}} Innaxe\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} Dreams\n|{{flagicon|CAN}} Dylan Falco\n|-\n|'''[[Misfits Gaming]]'''\n|Spring 2017\n|{{flagicon|NLD}} Dan Dan\n|{{flagicon|ESP}} Razork\n|{{flagicon|NLD}} [[Febiven]]\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} Bvoy\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} denyk \n|{{flagicon|ESP}} Jandro\n|-\n|'''[[Excel Esports]]'''\n|Spring 2019\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} [[Expect (League of Legends player)|Expect]]\n|{{flagicon|UK}} Caedrel\n|{{flagicon|South Korea}} Mickey\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} Patrik\n|{{flagicon|NOR}} Tore<br/>{{flagicon|UK}} [[KaSing]]\n|{{flagicon|NED}} YoungBuck\n|-\n|'''[[Rogue (esports)|Rogue]]'''\n|Spring 2019\n|{{flagicon|SWE}} Finn\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Inspired\n|{{flagicon|SWE}} Larssen\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} Hans Sama<br />{{flagicon|POL}} Woolite\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Vander\n|{{flagicon|UK}} fredy122\n\n|-\n|'''[[Splyce|MAD Lions]]'''\n|Spring 2020\n|{{flagicon|ROM}} Orome \n|{{flagicon|ITA}} Shad0w\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} Humanoid\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} Carzzy\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Gistick\n|{{flagicon|UK}} Mac\n|}\n\n<!-- ===Current Player of the Game standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Each annual season of play is divided into two splits, spring and summer, both consisting of nine weeks of [[round-robin tournament]] play, which then conclude with play-off tournaments between the top six teams. At the end of the season, the winner of the summer split, the team with the most championship points, and the winner of the gauntlet tournament qualify for the annual [[League of Legends World Championship|''League of Legends'' World Championship]].

Each LCS season is divided into two splits for spring and summer; the first games of the first spring split took place on 7 February 2013 in North America and on 9 February 2013 in Europe.\n\nSeason 3 of the LCS finished with the top three finishers [[Fnatic]], Lemondogs, and [[Gambit Gaming]]. The top three teams advanced to the [[Season 3 World Championships]].\n\nRiot Games changed naming conventions in 2014, calling the season the \"2014 Season\" instead of \"Season 4\".

Each season is divided into two splits. The regular season of each split consists of 9 weeks of play, in which each team plays each other twice, for a total of 18 games each. At the conclusion of each split, a playoff consisting of the top 6 teams from the regular season is played to determine the final standings. \n\nThe current playoff format introduced in 2019 consists of 4 rounds. In round 1, the third seed chooses to face either the fifth or sixth seed and the fourth seed faces the remaining team. The winners of these matches then play each other in round 2, and the winner of this match advances to the round 3. In round 3, the first and second seeds play against each other in a \"juggernaut\" match. The winner of this match advances directly to the final round; the loser faces the winner of round 2 in a \"decider\" match, and the winner of this decider match advances to the final.\n\nEach split's playoffs award cash prizes and Championship Points, which are used to determine qualification into the annual ''League of Legends'' World Championship. The winner of the summer split automatically qualifies as Europe's first seed, while the next four teams ranked by Championship Point total play the Regional Qualifier Tournament to determine the two additional seeds for the World Championship.\n\n===Overview===\n\n* 10 teams participate.\n* Each team plays 18 matches:\n** Using a Double Round Robin format.\n** Each match is a best of one.\n* The top 6 teams qualifies to the playoffs.\n* [https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cdn.eu.lolesports.com/LEC+Rulebook+'19+(Updated_+18.01.2019).pdf Official 2019 Season LEC Rulebook]\n\n===Teams===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Teams\n!rowspan=\"2\"|First appearance in LCS\n!colspan=\"5\"|Starting Rosters\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Coach\n|-\n!Top\n!Jungle\n!Mid\n!Bot\n!Support\n|-\n|'''[[Fnatic]]'''\n|Spring 2013\n|{{flagicon|BEL}} Bwipo\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Selfmade<br/> {{flagicon|UK}} Dan\n|{{flagicon|SVN}} Nemesis\n|{{flagicon|SWE}} [[Rekkles]]\n|{{flagicon|BUL}} Hylissang\n|{{flagicon|ESP}} [[Mithy]]\n|-\n|-\n|'''[[SK Gaming]]'''\n|Spring 2013\n|{{flagicon|CRO}} Sacre\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} [[Trick (League of Legends player)|Trick]]\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Jenax\n|{{flagicon|SVN}} Crownshot\n|{{flagicon|CRO}} LIMIT\n|{{flagicon|BUL}} Unlimited\n|-\n|'''[[Origen (esports)|Origen]]'''\n|Summer 2015\n|{{flagicon|UK}} Alphari\n|{{flagicon|ROM}} Xerxe\n|{{flagicon|NOR}} Nukeduck\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Upset\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} Destiny\n|{{flagicon|POR}} Guilhoto\n|-\n|'''[[G2 Esports]]'''\n|Spring 2016\n|{{flagicon|DEN}} [[Wunder (video game player)|Wunder]]\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Jankos\n|{{flagicon|CRO}} [[PerkZ|Perkz]]\n|{{flagicon|DEN}} [[Caps (video game player)|Caps]]\n|{{flagicon|SVN}} Mikyx\n|{{flagicon|GER}} GrabbZ\n|-\n|'''[[Team Vitality]]'''\n|Spring 2016\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Cabochard]]\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} Skeanz\n|{{flagicon|SER}} Milica\n|{{flagicon|GRE}} Comp\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Jactroll\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} Duke\n|-\n|'''[[FC Schalke 04 (esports)|Schalke 04]]'''\n|Summer 2016\n|{{flagicon|ROM}} Odoamne\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Gilius\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Abbedagge\n|{{Flagicon|Greece}} [[FORG1VEN]]<br/>{{flagicon|BUL}} Innaxe\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} Dreams\n|{{flagicon|CAN}} Dylan Falco\n|-\n|'''[[Misfits Gaming]]'''\n|Spring 2017\n|{{flagicon|NLD}} Dan Dan\n|{{flagicon|ESP}} Razork\n|{{flagicon|NLD}} [[Febiven]]\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} Bvoy\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} denyk \n|{{flagicon|ESP}} Jandro\n|-\n|'''[[Excel Esports]]'''\n|Spring 2019\n|{{flagicon|KOR}} [[Expect (League of Legends player)|Expect]]\n|{{flagicon|UK}} Caedrel\n|{{flagicon|South Korea}} Mickey\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} Patrik\n|{{flagicon|NOR}} Tore<br/>{{flagicon|UK}} [[KaSing]]\n|{{flagicon|NED}} YoungBuck\n|-\n|'''[[Rogue (esports)|Rogue]]'''\n|Spring 2019\n|{{flagicon|SWE}} Finn\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Inspired\n|{{flagicon|SWE}} Larssen\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} Hans Sama<br />{{flagicon|POL}} Woolite\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Vander\n|{{flagicon|UK}} fredy122\n\n|-\n|'''[[Splyce|MAD Lions]]'''\n|Spring 2020\n|{{flagicon|ROM}} Orome \n|{{flagicon|ITA}} Shad0w\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} Humanoid\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} Carzzy\n|{{flagicon|GER}} Gistick\n|{{flagicon|UK}} Mac\n|}\n\n<!-- ===Current Player of the Game standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
