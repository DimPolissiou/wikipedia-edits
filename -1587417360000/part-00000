The antiwar activists, anticipating a reaction from the military, proceeded to form the Fort Hood Three Defense Committee and mobilized legal help for the Three. The June 30 press conference where the Three presented their initial statement was attended by [[Stokely Carmichael]], chairman of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] and Lincoln Lynch the public relations director of [[Congress of Racial Equality]]. Within weeks the antiwar movement, nationally and internationally, had taken up their cause.<ref name=\"EVW\"/>\n\nPete Seeger, the folk singer and [[social activist]], even wrote a song for them called the ''Ballad Of The Fort Hood Three'', which included: \n\n{{Poemquote\n|text=<!-- or: 1= -->Come all you brave Americans and listen unto me,\nIf you can spare five minutes in this 20th century,\nI'll sing to you a story true as you will plainly see\nIt's about three U.S. soldiers they call the \"Fort Hood Three.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve been told in training that in Vietnam we must fight;\nAnd we may have to kill women and children, and that is quite all right;\nWe say this war\u2019s illegal, immoral, and unjust;\nWe\u2019re taking legal action, just the three of us.\n\nWe\u2019ll report for duty but we won\u2019t go overseas.\nWe\u2019re prepared to face court martial, but we won\u2019t fight for [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3|Ky]].\nWe three have talked it over, our decision now is clear,\nWe will not go to Vietnam, we\u2019ll fight for freedom here.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.antiwarsongs.org/canzone.php?id=3358&lang=en|title=Ballad Of The Fort Hood Three|publisher=Antiwar Songs}}</ref>}}\n\n==Legal Cases==\n\nThe court cases of the Fort Hood Three were among several early legal trials during the Vietnam War involving U.S. military personal refusing orders and going to jail. The Three underwent two separate legal proceedings with numerous stages as they both sued the government in [[United States district court|Federal Court]] while being court-martialed by the military. They argued in their suit and court-martials that they were \"refusing to commit war crimes\", while the military charged them with refusing direct orders to board a plane bound for Vietnam.<ref>{{cite book |last=Woodward  |first=Beverly |editor-last=Falk |editor-first=Richard A. |title=The Vietnam War and International Law, Volume 3 |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2015 |pages=477-486 |chapter=Nuremberg Law and U.S. Courts |isbn=9781400868247}}</ref> The Federal suit was filed on the same day as their initial public announcement on June 30, 1966 in [[Washington, D.C.]] The suit, an application for a permanent injunction to bar the military from shipping them to Southeast Asia, was filed by their attorney, Stanley Faulkner.<ref name=\"DefenseCommittee\"/> However, because the Three were ordered to board the plane before their suit could be heard, they were court-martialed before their hearing in Federal Court. \n\nTheir court-martial took place in September 1966. During separate trials, they each argued the war was illegal. Samas cited [[Nuremberg Code]] as precedent and said, \u201cThe way I was brought up was to judge things with my conscience, and that is what I did.\u201d The men were defended as \"counterpoints to [[Adolf Eichmann]]\", the infamous Nazi who defended his war crimes by saying he was just following orders. The military court ruled against them, charged them with insubordination and dishonorably discharged them from the Army. Mora was sentenced to three years in jail, Samas and Johnson to five.<ref name=\"Timeline\"/>\n\nThe three eventually brought the case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] as ''[[Mora v. McNamara]]'' ({{Ussc|389|934}}), claiming that the Vietnam War was illegal, among other things.

The antiwar activists, anticipating a reaction from the military, proceeded to form the Fort Hood Three Defense Committee and mobilized legal help for the Three. The June 30 press conference where the Three presented their initial statement was attended by [[Stokely Carmichael]], chairman of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] and Lincoln Lynch the public relations director of [[Congress of Racial Equality]]. Within weeks the antiwar movement, nationally and internationally, had taken up their cause.<ref name=\"EVW\"/>\n\nPete Seeger, the folk singer and [[social activist]], even wrote a song for them called the ''Ballad Of The Fort Hood Three'', which included: \n\n{{Poemquote\n|text=<!-- or: 1= -->Come all you brave Americans and listen unto me,\nIf you can spare five minutes in this 20th century,\nI'll sing to you a story true as you will plainly see\nIt's about three U.S. soldiers they call the \"Fort Hood Three.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve been told in training that in Vietnam we must fight;\nAnd we may have to kill women and children, and that is quite all right;\nWe say this war\u2019s illegal, immoral, and unjust;\nWe\u2019re taking legal action, just the three of us.\n\nWe\u2019ll report for duty but we won\u2019t go overseas.\nWe\u2019re prepared to face court martial, but we won\u2019t fight for [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3|Ky]].\nWe three have talked it over, our decision now is clear,\nWe will not go to Vietnam, we\u2019ll fight for freedom here.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.antiwarsongs.org/canzone.php?id=3358&lang=en|title=Ballad Of The Fort Hood Three|publisher=Antiwar Songs}}</ref>}}\n\n==Legal Cases==\n\nThe court cases of the Fort Hood Three were among several early legal trials during the Vietnam War involving U.S. military personal refusing orders and going to jail. The Three underwent two separate legal proceedings with numerous stages as they both sued the government in [[United States district court|Federal Court]] while being court-martialed by the military. They argued in their suit and court-martials that they were \"refusing to commit war crimes\", while the military charged them with refusing direct orders to board a plane bound for Vietnam.<ref>{{cite book |last=Woodward  |first=Beverly |editor-last=Falk |editor-first=Richard A. |title=The Vietnam War and International Law, Volume 3 |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2015 |pages=477-486 |chapter=Nuremberg Law and U.S. Courts |isbn=9781400868247}}</ref> The Federal suit was filed on the same day as their initial public announcement on June 30, 1966 in [[Washington, D.C.]] The suit, an application for a permanent injunction to bar the military from shipping them to Southeast Asia, was filed by their attorney, Stanley Faulkner.<ref name=\"DefenseCommittee\"/> However, because the Three were ordered to board the plane before their suit could be heard, they were court-martialed before their hearing in Federal Court. \n\nTheir court-martial took place in September 1966. During separate trials, they each argued the war was illegal. Samas cited [[Nuremberg Code]] as precedent and said, \u201cThe way I was brought up was to judge things with my conscience, and that is what I did.\u201d The men were defended as \"counterpoints to [[Adolf Eichmann]]\", the infamous Nazi who defended his war crimes by saying he was just following orders. The military court ruled against them, charged them with insubordination and dishonorably discharged them from the Army. Mora was sentenced to three years in jail, Samas and Johnson to five.<ref name=\"Timeline\"/>\n\nThe three eventually brought the case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] as ''[[Mora v.

Shifting or turning within a stance is done on the heels, balls, or middle (K1 or Kidney 1 point) of the foot, depending on lineage. Some Wing Chun styles discourage the use of high kicks because this risks counter-attacks to the groin.

It also teaches methods of recovering position and centerline when in a compromised position where Siu Nim Tau structure has been lost. For some branches, bodyweight in striking is a central theme, either from pivoting (rotational) or stepping (translational). Likewise for some branches, this form provides the engine to the car.

Still other branches view this form as imparting deadly \"killing\" and maiming techniques that should never be used without good reason. A common Wing Chun saying is \"Biu Ji doesn't go out the door\".

[N/A 1] Muk Yan Jong is demonstrated by using a wooden Wing Chun dummy as an opponent. There are many versions of this form which come from a variety of Wing Chun Kung Fu lineages.\n|}\n\n=== Other Forms ===\n==== Empty Hand ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nBoth the Wai Yan (Weng Chun) and Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ebf-C\u00f4ng branches use different curricula of empty hand forms. The Tam Yeung and Fung Sang lineages both trace their origins to Leung Jan's retirement to his native village of Gu Lao, where he taught a curriculum of San Sik.\n\nThe Siu Lim Tau of Wing Chun is one long form that includes movements that are comparative to a combination of Siu Lim Tau, Chum Kiu, and Biu Ji of other families. The other major forms of the style are: Jeui Da ({{zh|c=\u8ffd\u6253||l=Chase Strike}}), Fa Kyun ({{zh|c=\u82b1\u62f3||l=Variegated Fist}}), Jin Jeung ({{zh|c=\u7bad\u638c||l=Arrow Palm}}), Jin Kyun ({{zh|c=\u7bad\u62f3||l=Arrow Fist}}), Jeui Kyun ({{zh|c=\u9189\u62f3||l=Drunken Fist}}), Sap Saam Sau ({{zh|c=\u5341\u4e09\u624b||l=Thirteen Hands}}), and Chi Sau Lung ({{zh|t=\u9ed0\u624b\u650f|s=\u9ed0\u624b\u62e2||l=Sticking Hands Set}}).\n\nAlso, a few family styles of Wing-Chun (especially those coming from the Hung Syun Hei Baan ({{zh|c=\u7d05\u8239\u6232\u73ed|s=\u7ea2\u8239\u620f\u73ed||l=Red Boat Theatrical Troupe}}) have an advanced combination form called Saam Baai Fat ({{zh|c=\u4e09\u62dc\u4f5b||l=Three Bows to Buddha}}) which includes many flow/leak techniques from all of the first 'standard' 7 forms. Old phonetics in Cantonese; ''Hung Sun Hay Ban Tong'' Red Boat Opera Organization/Troop has a branch in Girard, Ohio ran by Si-Fu Mark Lee Pringle. They are one of the few schools that teach the full 8-form curriculum including Yoo-Choy( old phonetics ) family-style of 'Saam Baai Fut' 3 Bows to Buddha.\n\n==== Wooden Dummy ====\nThe Star Dummy consists of three poles that are embedded into the ground in a triangle with each pole an arms span apart.  The associated form consists of kicking the poles using the various kicks found in Wing Chun: front kick, front kick with foot pointed out using broad area of foot and knee rotation to outside, and side kick.\n\n==== Weapons ====\nThe [[Yuen Kay Shan]] / [[:es:Sum Nung|Sum Nung]] branch also historically trained throwing darts (Biu).\n\n=== San Sik ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\nSan Sik (Chinese: \u6563\u5f0f; Cantonese Yale: S\u00e1an S\u012bk; pinyin: S\u01cen Sh\u00ec; literally: 'Casual Style') are compact in structure. They can be loosely grouped into three broad categories:\n\n1. Focus on building body structure through basic punching, standing, turning, and stepping drills.\n2. Fundamental arm cycles and changes, firmly ingraining the cardinal tools for interception and adaptation.\n3. Sensitivity training and combination techniques.\n\n== Sensitivity Training {{anchor|Sensitivity Training}} ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\nWing Chun includes several sensitivity drills designed to train and obtain specific responses.  Although they can be practiced or expressed in a combat form, they should not be confused with actual sparring or fighting.\n\n=== Chi Sau {{anchor|Chi Sao}} ===\nChi Sau ({{zh|t=\u9ed0\u624b|cy=Ch\u012b S\u00e1u|p=Ch\u012b Sh\u01d2u|first=j|l=sticking hands}}) is a term for the principle and drills used for the development of automatic reflexes upon contact and the idea of \"sticking\" to the opponent (also known as \"sensitivity training\"). In reality, the intention is not to \"stick\" to your opponent at all costs, but rather to protect your centerline while simultaneously attacking your opponent's centerline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wingchunlife.com/chi-sau.html |title=Chi Sau: What's Behind Sticky Hand Training |publisher=Wingchunlife.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref> In Wing Chun, this is practiced by two practitioners maintaining contact with each other's forearms while executing techniques, thereby training each other to sense changes in body mechanics, pressure, momentum and \"feel\". The increased sensitivity gained from this drill helps a practitioner attack and counter an opponent's movements precisely, quickly, and with appropriate techniques.\n\nChi Sau additionally refers to methods of rolling hands drills ({{zh|c=\u788c\u624b|cy=L\u016bk S\u00e1u|first=j|l=rolling hands}}). Luk Sau participants push and \"roll\" their forearms against each other in a single circle while trying to remain in relaxed form. The aim is to feel force, test resistance, and find defensive gaps.

Shifting or turning within a stance is done on the heels, balls, or middle (K1 or Kidney 1 point) of the foot, depending on lineage. Some Wing Chun styles discourage the use of high kicks because this risks counter-attacks to the groin.

The other major forms of the style are: Jeui Da ({{zh|c=\u8ffd\u6253||l=Chase Strike}}), Fa Kyun ({{zh|c=\u82b1\u62f3||l=Variegated Fist}}), Jin Jeung ({{zh|c=\u7bad\u638c||l=Arrow Palm}}), Jin Kyun ({{zh|c=\u7bad\u62f3||l=Arrow Fist}}), Jeui Kyun ({{zh|c=\u9189\u62f3||l=Drunken Fist}}), Sap Saam Sau ({{zh|c=\u5341\u4e09\u624b||l=Thirteen Hands}}), and Chi Sau Lung ({{zh|t=\u9ed0\u624b\u650f|s=\u9ed0\u624b\u62e2||l=Sticking Hands Set}}).\n\nAlso, a few family styles of Wing-Chun (especially those coming from the Hung Syun Hei Baan ({{zh|c=\u7d05\u8239\u6232\u73ed|s=\u7ea2\u8239\u620f\u73ed||l=Red Boat Theatrical Troupe}}) have an advanced combination form called Saam Baai Fat ({{zh|c=\u4e09\u62dc\u4f5b||l=Three Bows to Buddha}}) which includes many flow/leak techniques from all of the first 'standard' 7 forms. Old phonetics in Cantonese; ''Hung Sun Hay Ban Tong'' Red Boat Opera Organization/Troop has a branch in Girard, Ohio ran by Si-Fu Mark Lee Pringle. They are one of the few schools that teach the full 8-form curriculum including Yoo-Choy( old phonetics ) family-style of 'Saam Baai Fut' 3 Bows to Buddha.\n\n==== Wooden Dummy ====\nThe Star Dummy consists of three poles that are embedded into the ground in a triangle with each pole an arms span apart.  The associated form consists of kicking the poles using the various kicks found in Wing Chun: front kick, front kick with foot pointed out using broad area of foot and knee rotation to outside, and side kick.\n\n==== Weapons ====\nThe [[Yuen Kay Shan]] / [[:es:Sum Nung|Sum Nung]] branch also historically trained throwing darts (Biu).\n\n=== San Sik ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\nSan Sik (Chinese: \u6563\u5f0f; Cantonese Yale: S\u00e1an S\u012bk; pinyin: S\u01cen Sh\u00ec; literally: 'Casual Style') are compact in structure. They can be loosely grouped into three broad categories:\n\n1. Focus on building body structure through basic punching, standing, turning, and stepping drills.\n2. Fundamental arm cycles and changes, firmly ingraining the cardinal tools for interception and adaptation.\n3. Sensitivity training and combination techniques.\n\n== Sensitivity Training {{anchor|Sensitivity Training}} ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}\nWing Chun includes several sensitivity drills designed to train and obtain specific responses.  Although they can be practiced or expressed in a combat form, they should not be confused with actual sparring or fighting.\n\n=== Chi Sau {{anchor|Chi Sao}} ===\nChi Sau ({{zh|t=\u9ed0\u624b|cy=Ch\u012b S\u00e1u|p=Ch\u012b Sh\u01d2u|first=j|l=sticking hands}}) is a term for the principle and drills used for the development of automatic reflexes upon contact and the idea of \"sticking\" to the opponent (also known as \"sensitivity training\"). In reality, the intention is not to \"stick\" to your opponent at all costs, but rather to protect your centerline while simultaneously attacking your opponent's centerline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wingchunlife.com/chi-sau.html |title=Chi Sau: What's Behind Sticky Hand Training |publisher=Wingchunlife.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref> In Wing Chun, this is practiced by two practitioners maintaining contact with each other's forearms while executing techniques, thereby training each other to sense changes in body mechanics, pressure, momentum and \"feel\". The increased sensitivity gained from this drill helps a practitioner attack and counter an opponent's movements precisely, quickly, and with appropriate techniques.\n\nChi Sau additionally refers to methods of rolling hands drills ({{zh|c=\u788c\u624b|cy=L\u016bk S\u00e1u|first=j|l=rolling hands}}). Luk Sau participants push and \"roll\" their forearms against each other in a single circle while trying to remain in relaxed form. The aim is to feel force, test resistance, and find defensive gaps. Other branches have a version of this practice where each arm rolls in small, separate circles. Luk Sau is most notably taught within the Pan Nam branch of Wing Chun where both the larger rolling drills as well as the smaller, separate-hand circle drills are taught.\n\nSome lineages, such as [[Ip Man]] and Jiu Wan, begin Chi Sau drills with one-armed sets called Daan Chi Sau ({{zh|s=\u5355\u9ed0\u624b|cy=D\u0101an Ch\u012b S\u00e1u|first=j|l=Single Sticking Hand}}) which help the novice student to get the feel of the exercise.  In Daan Chi Sau each practitioner uses one hand from the same side as they face each other.\n\n=== Chi Geuk ===\nChi Geuk ({{zh|t=\u9ed0\u8173|s=\u9ed0\u811a|cy=Ch\u012b Geuk|p=Ch\u012b Ji\u01ceo|first=j|l=sticking legs}}) is the lower-body equivalent of the upper body's Chi Sau training, aimed on developing awareness in the lower body and obtaining relaxation of the legs.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[Donnie Yen]] played the role of Wing Chun Grandmaster Ip Man in the 2008 movie ''[[Ip Man (film)|Ip Man]]'', which was a box office success, and in its sequels ''[[Ip Man 2]]'',  ''[[Ip Man 3]],'' and ''[[Ip Man 4]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/china/?yr=2008&wk=50&p=.htm |title=2008 Chinese Box Office records |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/03/18/ip-man-4-trailer-teaser/|title=IP Man 4 Teaser Trailer Pits Donnie Yen Against Scott Adkins|website=Movies|language=en|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref> Max Zhang ([[Zhang Jin (actor)|Zhang Jin]]) who played the role of Cheung Tin Chi in ''Ip Man 3'' starred in a spin-off and direct sequel movie called ''[[Master Z: The Ip Man Legacy]]'', which follows the events after the end of ''Ip Man 3''.<ref>{{Citation|last=Shaw Theatres|title=Master Z: The Ip Man Legacy Official Trailer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzVQDAiZ7ME&app=desktop|website=YouTube|date=December 3, 2018|access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen Amell]] on the CW show ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' has incorporated Wing Chun into his fighting style; his character practices on a [[Muk Yan Jong]] (wooden dummy).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsc3IROJt50|title=Arrow's stunt coordinator teaches us how to fight like Oliver Queen|last=|first=|date=December 19, 2014|website=Youtube|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhen creating characters to represent real-world martial arts, the [[Bandai-Namco|developers]] of the [[fighting game]] ''[[Tekken 7]]'' wanted to introduce a new fighter utilizing Wing Chun.

He was one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s closest and most devoted associates, and was known for his skills in [[public speaking]] and his deeply virulent [[antisemitism]], which was evident in his publicly voiced views. He advocated progressively harsher discrimination, including the extermination of the Jews in [[the Holocaust]].\n\nGoebbels, who aspired to be an author, obtained a Doctor of [[Philology]] degree from the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1921. He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1924, and worked with [[Gregor Strasser]] in their northern branch. He was appointed ''[[Gauleiter]]'' (district leader) for Berlin in 1926, where he began to take an interest in the use of propaganda to promote the party and its programme. After the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Nazis' seizure of power]] in 1933, Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry quickly gained and exerted control over the news media, arts, and information in Germany. He was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes. Topics for party propaganda included antisemitism, attacks on the Christian churches, and (after the start of the [[Second World War]]) attempting to shape morale.\n\nIn 1943, Goebbels began to pressure Hitler to introduce measures that would produce ''[[total war]]'', including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the [[Wehrmacht]]. Hitler finally appointed him as [[Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War]] on 23 July 1944, whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures to increase the number of people available for armaments manufacture and the Wehrmacht.\n\nAs the war drew to a close and Nazi Germany faced defeat, [[Magda Goebbels]] and the [[Goebbels children]] joined him in Berlin. They moved into the underground ''[[Vorbunker]]'', part of Hitler's underground bunker complex, on 22 April 1945. [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler committed suicide]] on 30 April. In accordance with [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's will]], Goebbels succeeded him as [[Chancellor of Germany]]; he served one day in this post. The following day, Goebbels and his wife committed suicide, after poisoning their six children with cyanide.\n\n==Early life==\nPaul Joseph Goebbels was born on 29 October 1897 in [[Rheydt]], an industrial town south of [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]] near [[D\u00fcsseldorf]].{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} Both of his parents were [[Roman Catholics]] with modest family backgrounds.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} His father Fritz was a German factory clerk; his mother Katharina (''n\u00e9e'' Odenhausen) was born to [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and German parents in the [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=2, 299}} Goebbels had five siblings: Konrad (1893\u20131947), Hans (1895\u20131949), Maria (1896\u20131896), Elisabeth (1901\u20131915), and Maria (1910\u20131949),{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} who married the German filmmaker [[Max W. Kimmich]] in 1938.{{sfn|Hull|1969|p=149}} In 1932, Goebbels published a pamphlet of his family tree to refute the rumours that his grandmother was of Jewish ancestry.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=299}}\n\nDuring childhood, Goebbels suffered from ill health, which included a long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a [[clubfoot|deformed right foot]] that turned inwards, due to a [[Congenital disorder|congenital deformity]]. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=6}} Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in [[World War I]] because of this deformity.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=14}}\n\n[[File:Goebbels 1916.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goebbels in 1916]]\nGoebbels was educated at a ''[[gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'', where he completed his ''[[Abitur]]'' (university entrance examination) in 1917.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=7}} He was the top student of his class and was given the traditional honour to speak at the awards ceremony.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=10}} His parents initially hoped that he would become a Catholic priest, and Goebbels seriously considered it.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=6}} He studied literature and history at the universities of [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]], [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]],{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=10\u201311, 14}} aided by a scholarship from the [[Albertus Magnus]] Society.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=6\u20137}} By this time Goebbels had begun to distance himself from the church.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=14}}\n\nHistorians, including [[Richard J. Evans]] and [[Roger Manvell]], speculate that Goebbels' lifelong pursuit of women may have been in compensation for his physical disability.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=204}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=164}} At Freiburg, he met and fell in love with Anka Stalherm, who was three years his senior.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=12, 13}} She went on to W\u00fcrzburg to continue school, as did Goebbels.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=14}} In 1921 he wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, ''[[Michael (novel)|Michael]]'', a three-part work of which only Parts I and III have survived.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=16}} Goebbels felt he was writing his \"own story\".{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=16}} Antisemitic content and material about a charismatic leader may have been added by Goebbels shortly before the book was published in 1929 by [[Eher-Verlag]], the publishing house of the [[Nazi Party]] (National Socialist German Workers' Party; NSDAP).{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=19, 26}} By 1920, the relationship with Anka was over. The break-up filled Goebbels with thoughts of suicide.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=20, 21}}{{efn|name=letters}}\n\nAt the [[University of Heidelberg]], Goebbels wrote his [[doctoral thesis]] on [[Wilhelm von Sch\u00fctz]], a minor 19th-century romantic dramatist.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=17}} He had hoped to write his thesis under the supervision of [[Friedrich Gundolf]], a literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. Gundolf was no longer teaching, so directed Goebbels to associate professor [[Max Freiherr von Waldberg]]. Waldberg, also Jewish, recommended Goebbels write his thesis on [[Wilhelm von Sch\u00fctz]]. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his PhD in 1921.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=21, 22}} By 1940 he had written 14 books.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=66}}\n\nGoebbels returned home and worked as a private tutor. He also found work as a journalist and was published in the local newspaper. His writing during that time reflected his growing [[antisemitism]] and dislike for modern culture. In the summer of 1922, he met and began a love affair with Else Janke, a schoolteacher.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=22\u201325}} After she revealed to him that she was half-Jewish, Goebbels stated the \"enchantment [was] ruined.\"{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=24}} Nevertheless, he continued to see her on and off until 1927.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=72, 88}}\n\nHe continued for several years to try to become a published author.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=32\u201333}} His [[Goebbels Diaries|diaries]], which he began in 1923 and continued for the rest of his life, provided an outlet for his desire to write.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=3}} The lack of income from his literary works (he wrote two plays in 1923, neither of which sold){{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=32}} forced him to take employment as a caller on the stock exchange and as a bank clerk in [[Cologne]], a job he detested.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=33}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=25\u201326}} He was dismissed from the bank in August 1923 and returned to Rheydt.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=27}} During this period, he read avidly and was influenced by the works of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], the British-born German writer whose book ''[[The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century]]'' (1899) was one of the standard works of the [[far-right politics|extreme right]] in Germany.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=24\u201326}} He also began to study the \"social question\" and read the works of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[August Bebel]] and [[Gustav Noske]].{{sfn|Reuth|1994|p=28}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=43}} According to German historian [[Peter Longerich]], Goebbels's diary entries from late 1923 to early 1924 reflected the writings of a man who was isolated, preoccupied with \"religious-philosophical\" issues, and lacked a sense of direction. Diary entries of mid-December 1923 forward show Goebbels was moving towards the ''[[V\u00f6lkisch movement|V\u00f6lkisch]]'' nationalist movement.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=28, 33, 34}}\n\n==Nazi activist==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-01888A, Joseph Goebbels.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Goebbels]]\nGoebbels first took an interest in [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism]] in 1924.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=36}} In February 1924, Hitler's trial for treason began in the wake of his failed attempt to seize power in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of 8\u20139 November 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=127\u2013131}} The trial attracted widespread press coverage and gave Hitler a platform for propaganda.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=133\u2013135}} Hitler was sentenced to five years prison, but was released on 20 December 1924, after serving just over a year.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=196, 199}} Goebbels was drawn to the NSDAP mostly because of Hitler's charisma and commitment to his beliefs.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=36, 37}} He joined the NSDAP around this time, becoming member number 8762.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=33}} In late 1924, Goebbels offered his services to [[Karl Kaufmann]], who was ''[[Gauleiter]]'' (NSDAP district leader) for the Rhine-Ruhr District. Kaufmann put him in touch with [[Gregor Strasser]], a leading Nazi organiser in northern Germany, who hired him to work on their weekly newspaper and undertake secretarial work for the regional party offices.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=40\u201341}} He was also put to work as party speaker and representative for [[Rhineland]]-[[Westphalia]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=46}} Members of Strasser's northern branch of the NSDAP, including Goebbels, had a more socialist outlook than the rival Hitler group in Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=167}} Strasser disagreed with Hitler on many parts of the party platform, and in November 1926 began working on a revision.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=169}}\n\nHitler viewed Strasser's actions as a threat to his authority, and summoned 60&nbsp;''Gauleiters'' and party leaders, including Goebbels, to a [[Bamberg Conference|special conference in Bamberg]], in Streicher's ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]'' of [[Franconia]], where he gave a two-hour speech repudiating Strasser's new political programme.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=168\u2013169}} Hitler was opposed to the socialist leanings of the northern wing, stating it would mean \"political bolshevization of Germany.\" Further, there would be \"no princes, only Germans,\" and a legal system with no \"Jewish system of exploitation&nbsp;... for plundering of our people.\" The future would be secured by acquiring land, not through expropriation of the estates of the former nobility, but through colonising territories to the east.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=169}} Goebbels was horrified by Hitler's characterisation of socialism as \"a Jewish creation\" and his assertion that a Nazi government would not expropriate private property. He wrote in his diary: \"I no longer fully believe in Hitler. That's the terrible thing: my inner support has been taken away.\"{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=66}}\n\nAfter reading Hitler's book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Goebbels found himself agreeing with Hitler's assertion of a \"Jewish doctrine of [[Marxism]]\".{{sfn|Reuth|1994|p=66}} In February 1926 Goebbels gave a speech titled \"Lenin or Hitler?\" in which he asserted that communism or Marxism could not save the German people, but he believed it would cause a \"socialist nationalist state\" to arise in Russia.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=63}} In 1926, Goebbels published a pamphlet titled \"''Nazi-Sozi''\" which attempted to explain how National Socialism differed from Marxism.{{sfn|Goebbels|1927}}\n\nIn hopes of winning over the opposition, Hitler arranged meetings in Munich with the three Greater Ruhr ''Gau'' leaders, including Goebbels.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=67}} Goebbels was impressed when Hitler sent his own car to meet them at the railway station. That evening Hitler and Goebbels both gave speeches at a beer hall rally.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=67}} The following day, Hitler offered his hand in reconciliation to the three men, encouraging them to put their differences behind them.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=68}} Goebbels capitulated completely, offering Hitler his total loyalty. He wrote in his diary: \"I love him&nbsp;... He has thought through everything,\" \"Such a sparkling mind can be my leader. I bow to the greater one, the political genius.\" He later wrote: \"Adolf Hitler, I love you because you are both great and simple at the same time. What one calls a genius.\"{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=171}} As a result of the Bamberg and Munich meetings, Strasser's new draft of the party programme was discarded. The original [[National Socialist Program]] of 1920 was retained unchanged, and Hitler's position as party leader was greatly strengthened.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=171}}\n\n==Propagandist in Berlin==\nAt Hitler's invitation, Goebbels spoke at party meetings in Munich and at the annual [[Nuremberg Rally|Party Congress]], held in Weimar in 1926.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=61, 64}} For the following year's event, Goebbels was involved in the planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the rally to be filmed.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=94}} Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and to admire and idolise him even more.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=62}}\n\n===Gauleiter===\nGoebbels was first offered the position of party ''Gauleiter'' for the [[Gau Berlin|Berlin]] section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and by the middle of October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern ''Gauleiters'' group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=71, 72}} Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the ''Gau''. Goebbels was given control over the local ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) and ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) and answered only to Hitler.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=75}} The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=75}} Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the [[Communist Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=75\u201377}} Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=81}} His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=76, 80}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Bundesarchiv Bild 119-2406-01, Berlin-Lustgarten, Rede Joseph Goebbels.jpg\n | width1 = 174\n | caption1 = Goebbels speaks at a political rally (1932).

This hand gesture was used while delivering a warning or threat.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=82}}\n}}\n\nLike Hitler, Goebbels practised his public speaking skills in front of a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. Goebbels usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=75\u201379}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=82}} He used loudspeakers, decorative flames, uniforms, and marches to attract attention to speeches.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}}\n\nGoebbels' tactic of using provocation to bring attention to the NSDAP, along with violence at the public party meetings and demonstrations, led the Berlin police to ban the NSDAP from the city on 5 May 1927.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=79}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=93, 94}} Violent incidents continued, including young Nazis randomly attacking Jews in the streets.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=82}} Goebbels was subjected to a public speaking ban until the end of October.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=84}} During this period, he founded the newspaper ''[[Der Angriff]]'' (''The Attack'') as a propaganda vehicle for the Berlin area, where few supported the party. It was a modern-style newspaper with an aggressive tone;{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=89}} 126 libel suits were pending against Goebbels at one point.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}} To his disappointment, circulation was initially only 2,000. Material in the paper was highly anti-communist and antisemitic.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=82}} Among the paper's favourite targets was the Jewish Deputy Chief of the Berlin Police [[Bernhard Wei\u00df (police executive)|Bernhard Wei\u00df]]. Goebbels gave him the derogatory nickname \"Isidore\" and subjected him to a relentless campaign of Jew-baiting in the hope of provoking a crackdown he could then exploit.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=80\u201381}} Goebbels continued to try to break into the literary world, with a revised version of his book ''Michael'' finally being published, and the unsuccessful production of two of his plays (''Der Wanderer'' and ''Die Saat'' (''The Seed'')). The latter was his final attempt at playwriting.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=95, 98}} During this period in Berlin he had relationships with many women, including his old flame Anka Stalherm, who was now married and had a small child. He was quick to fall in love, but easily tired of a relationship and moved on to someone new. He worried too about how a committed personal relationship might interfere with his career.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=108\u2013112}}\n\n===1928 election===\nThe ban on the NSDAP was lifted before the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] elections on 20 May 1928.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=99\u2013100}} The NSDAP lost nearly 100,000 voters and earned only 2.6 per cent of the vote nationwide. Results in Berlin were even worse, where they attained only 1.4 per cent of the vote.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=209}} Goebbels was one of 12 NSDAP members to gain election to the Reichstag.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=209}} This gave him immunity from prosecution for a long list of outstanding charges, including a three-week jail sentence he received in April for insulting the deputy police chief Wei\u00df.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=94}} The Reichstag changed the immunity regulations in February 1931, and Goebbels was forced to pay fines for libellous material he had placed in ''Der Angriff'' over the course of the previous year.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nIn his newspaper ''Berliner Arbeiterzeitung'' (''Berlin Workers Newspaper''), Gregor Strasser was highly critical of Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=100\u2013101}} However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent of the vote in some regions.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=209}} This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=189}} After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=209, 211}} In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=116}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-043-14, Horst Wessel.jpg|thumb|upright|Goebbels used the death of [[Horst Wessel]] (pictured) in 1930 as a propaganda tool{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=124}} against \"Communist subhumans\".{{sfn|Siemens|2013|p=143}}]]\n\nBy 1930 Berlin was the party's second-strongest base of support after Munich.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}} That year the violence between the Nazis and communists led to local SA troop leader [[Horst Wessel]] being shot by two members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]. He later died in hospital.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=123}} Exploiting Wessel's death, Goebbels turned him into a martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially declared Wessel's march ''Die Fahne hoch'' (''Raise the flag''), renamed as the ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]'', to be the NSDAP anthem.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=124}}\n\n===Great Depression===\nThe [[Great Depression]] greatly impacted Germany and by 1930 there was a dramatic increase in unemployment.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=127}} During this time, the Strasser brothers started publishing a new daily newspaper in Berlin, the ''Nationaler Sozialist''.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=125, 126}} Like their other publications, it conveyed the brothers' own brand of Nazism, including nationalism, anti-capitalism, social reform, and anti-Westernism.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=200}} Goebbels complained vehemently about the rival Strasser newspapers to Hitler, and admitted that their success was causing his own Berlin newspapers to be \"pushed to the wall\".{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=125, 126}} In late April 1930, Hitler publicly and firmly announced his opposition to Gregor Strasser and appointed Goebbels to replace him as Reich leader of NSDAP propaganda.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=128}} One of Goebbels' first acts was to ban the evening edition of the ''Nationaler Sozialist''.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=129}} Goebbels was also given control of other Nazi papers across the country, including the party's national newspaper, the ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' (''People's Observer''). He still had to wait until 3 July for Otto Strasser and his supporters to announce they were leaving the NSDAP. Upon receiving the news, Goebbels was relieved the \"crisis\" with the Strassers was finally over and glad that Otto Strasser had lost all power.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=130}}\n\nThe rapid deterioration of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. A new cabinet was formed, and [[Paul von Hindenburg]] used his power as president to govern via [[emergency powers|emergency decrees]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=249\u2013250}} He appointed [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] as [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=199}} Goebbels took charge of the NSDAP's national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler's speeches focused on blaming the country's economic woes on the [[Weimar Republic]], particularly its adherence to the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which required war reparations that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based on race and national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and Goebbels by surprise: the party received 6.5 million votes nationwide and took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second largest party in the country.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=202}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1202-500, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, Tochter.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Goebbels and his daughter Helga with [[Adolf Hitler]] ]]\n\nIn late 1930 Goebbels met [[Magda Goebbels|Magda Quandt]], a divorc\u00e9e who had joined the party a few months earlier. She worked as a volunteer in the party offices in Berlin, helping Goebbels organise his private papers.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=151\u2013152}} Her flat on the [[Theodor-Heuss-Platz|''Reichskanzlerplatz'']] soon became a favourite meeting place for Hitler and other NSDAP officials.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=94}} Goebbels and Quandt married on 19 December 1931.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=167}}\n\nFor two further elections held in 1932, Goebbels organised massive campaigns that included rallies, parades, speeches, and Hitler travelling around the country by aeroplane with the slogan \"the F\u00fchrer over Germany\".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=227}} Goebbels wrote in his diary that the Nazis must gain power and exterminate Marxism.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=182}} He undertook numerous speaking tours during these election campaigns and had some of their speeches published on [[gramophone record]]s and as pamphlets. Goebbels was also involved in the production of a small collection of [[silent film]]s that could be shown at party meetings, though they did not yet have enough equipment to widely use this medium.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=172, 173, 184}}{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=125}} Many of Goebbels' campaign posters used violent imagery such as a giant half-clad male destroying political opponents or other perceived enemies such as \"International High Finance\".{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=290\u2013291}} His propaganda characterised the opposition as \"[[Stab-in-the-back myth|November criminals]]\", \"Jewish wire-pullers\", or a communist threat.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=293}} Support for the party continued to grow, but neither of these elections led to a majority government. In an effort to stabilise the country and improve economic conditions, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Reich chancellor on 30 January 1933.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=307}}\n\nTo celebrate Hitler's appointment as chancellor, Goebbels organised a torchlight parade in Berlin on the night of 30 January of an estimated 60,000 men, many in the uniforms of the SA and SS. The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=310\u2013311}} Goebbels was disappointed not to be given a post in Hitler's new cabinet. [[Bernhard Rust]] was appointed as [[Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture|Minister of Culture]], the post that Goebbels was expecting to receive.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=206}} Like other NSDAP officials, Goebbels had to deal with Hitler's leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=131}} In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=323}} The NSDAP took advantage of the [[Reichstag fire]] of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] the following day at Hitler's urging. This was the first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in Germany and put a totalitarian dictatorship\u2014headed by Hitler\u2014in its place.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=332\u2013333}} On 5 March, yet another Reichstag election took place, the last to be held before the defeat of the Nazis at the end of the Second World War.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=339}} While the NSDAP increased their number of seats and percentage of the vote, it was not the landslide expected by the party leadership.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=212}} Goebbels finally received Hitler's appointment to the cabinet, officially becoming head of the newly created [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] on 14 March.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=121}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14597, Berlin, Opernplatz, B\u00fccherverbrennung.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Nazi book burning]], 10 May 1933]]\n\nThe role of the new ministry, which set up its offices in the 18th-century [[Ordenspalais]] across from the Reich Chancellery, was to centralise Nazi control of all aspects of German cultural and intellectual life.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=212\u2013213}} Goebbels hoped to increase popular support of the party from the 37 per cent achieved at the last free election held in Germany on 25 March 1933 to 100 per cent support. An unstated goal was to present to other nations the impression that the NSDAP had the full and enthusiastic backing of the entire population.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=121}} One of Goebbels' first productions was staging the Day of Potsdam, a ceremonial passing of power from Hindenburg to Hitler, held in [[Potsdam]] on 21 March.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=214}} He composed the text of Hitler's decree authorising the [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]], held on 1 April.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=218}} Later that month, Goebbels travelled back to Rheydt, where he was given a triumphal reception. The townsfolk lined the main street, which had been renamed in his honour. On the following day, Goebbels was declared a local hero.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=221}}\n\nGoebbels converted the 1 May holiday from a celebration of workers' rights (observed as such especially by the communists) into a day celebrating the NSDAP. In place of the usual ad hoc labour celebrations, he organised a huge party rally held at Tempelhof Field in Berlin. The following day, all trade union offices in the country were forcibly disbanded by the SA and SS, and the Nazi-run [[German Labour Front]] was created to take their place.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=128\u2013129}} \"We are the masters of Germany,\" he commented in his diary entry of 3 May.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=358}} Less than two weeks later, he gave a speech at the [[Nazi book burning]] in Berlin on 10 May,{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=224}} a ceremony he suggested.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}}\n\nMeanwhile, the NSDAP began passing laws to marginalise Jews and remove them from German society. The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-[[Aryan]]s to retire from the legal profession and civil service.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} The first [[Nazi concentration camps]] (initially created to house political dissenters) were founded shortly after Hitler seized power.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=344}} In a process termed ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' (co-ordination), the NSDAP proceeded to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=14}} In a move to manipulate Germany's middle class and shape popular opinion, the regime passed on 4 October 1933 the ''Schriftleitergesetz'' (Editor's Law), which became the cornerstone of the Nazi Party's control of the popular press.{{sfn|Hale|1973|pp=83\u201384}} Modeled to some extent on the system in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy, the law defined a ''Schriftleiter'' as anyone who wrote, edited, or selected texts and/or illustrated material for serial publication. Individuals selected for this position were chosen based on experiential, educational, and racial criteria.{{sfn|Hale|1973|pp=85\u201386}} The law required journalists to \"regulate their work in accordance with National Socialism as a philosophy of life and as a conception of government.\"{{sfn|Hale|1973|p=86}}\n\nAt the end of June 1934, top officials of the SA and opponents of the regime, including Gregor Strasser, were arrested and killed in a purge later called the [[Night of Long Knives]]. Goebbels was present at the arrest of SA leader [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] in Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=132\u2013134}} On 2 August 1934, President von Hindenburg died. In a radio broadcast, Goebbels announced that the offices of president and chancellor had been combined, and Hitler had been formally named as ''[[F\u00fchrer]] und Reichskanzler'' (leader and chancellor).{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=137}}\n\n===Workings of the Ministry===\nThe propaganda ministry was organised into seven departments: administration and legal; mass rallies, public health, youth, and race; radio; national and foreign press; films and film censorship; art, music, and theatre; and protection against counter-propaganda, both foreign and domestic.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=140\u2013141}} Goebbels style of leadership was tempestuous and unpredictable. He would suddenly change direction and shift his support between senior associates; he was a difficult boss and liked to berate his staff in public.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=370}} Goebbels was successful at his job, however; ''Life'' wrote in 1938 that \"[p]ersonally he likes nobody, is liked by nobody, and runs the most efficient Nazi department.\"{{sfn|LIFE Magazine|1938}} [[John Gunther]] wrote in 1940 that Goebbels \"is the cleverest of all the Nazis\", but could not succeed Hitler because \"everybody hates him\".{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=19}}\n\nThe Reich Film Chamber, which all members of the film industry were required to join, was created in June 1933.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=224\u2013225}} Goebbels promoted the development of films with a Nazi slant, and ones that contained subliminal or overt propaganda messages.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=157}} Under the auspices of the ''[[Reichskulturkammer]]'' (Reich Chamber of Culture), created in September, Goebbels added additional sub-chambers for the fields of broadcasting, fine arts, literature, music, the press, and the theatre.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=142}} As in the film industry, anyone wishing to pursue a career in these fields had to be a member of the corresponding chamber. In this way anyone whose views were contrary to the regime could be excluded from working in their chosen field and thus silenced.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=138}} In addition, journalists (now considered employees of the state) were required to prove Aryan descent back to the year 1800, and if married, the same requirement applied to the spouse. Members of any chamber were not allowed to leave the country for their work without prior permission of their chamber. A committee was established to censor books, and works could not be re-published unless they were on the list of approved works. Similar regulations applied to other fine arts and entertainment; even cabaret performances were censored.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=142\u2013143}} Many German artists and intellectuals left Germany in the pre-war years rather than work under these restrictions.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=140}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H14243, Berlin, Verteilung von 500 Radios (Volksempf\u00e4nger).jpg|thumb|left|Free radios were distributed in Berlin on Goebbels' birthday in 1938.]]\nGoebbels was particularly interested in controlling the radio, which was then still a fairly new [[mass medium]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=127}} Sometimes under protest from individual states (particularly [[Prussia]], headed by G\u00f6ring), Goebbels gained control of radio stations nationwide, and placed them under the ''[[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft]]'' (German National Broadcasting Corporation) in July 1934.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=226}} Manufacturers were urged by Goebbels to produce inexpensive home receivers, called ''[[Volksempf\u00e4nger]]'' (people's receiver), and by 1938 nearly ten million sets had been sold. Loudspeakers were placed in public areas, factories, and schools, so that important party broadcasts would be heard live by nearly all Germans.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=127}} On 2 September 1939 (the day after the start of the war), Goebbels and the Council of Ministers proclaimed it illegal to listen to foreign radio stations. Disseminating news from foreign broadcasts could result in the death penalty.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=434}} [[Albert Speer]], Hitler's architect and later Minister for Armaments and War Production, later said the regime \"made the complete use of all technical means for domination of its own country.

The rally was the subject of the film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', one of several Nazi propaganda films directed by [[Leni Riefenstahl]]. It won the Gold Medal at the 1935 [[Venice Film Festival]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=123\u2013127}} At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, Goebbels declared that \"Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself.\"{{sfn|Goebbels|1935}}\n\nGoebbels was involved in planning the staging of the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started having an affair with the actress [[L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1]], whom he continued to see until 1938.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=184, 201}} A major project in 1937 was the [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]], organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=171, 173}} A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=351}} Meanwhile, Goebbels was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=346, 350}}\n\n===Church struggle===\n{{See also|Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany}}\nIn 1933, Hitler signed the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' (Reich Concordat), a treaty with the Vatican that required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=234\u2013235}} However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches and to try to weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offences.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=189}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=382}} Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=189}} Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|name=crucifixes}} Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the ''[[Kirchenkampf]]'' (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue;{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=382}} in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the [[Protestant]] church.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=223}}\n\nIn response to the persecution, [[Pope Pius XI]] had the ''\"[[Mit brennender Sorge]]\"'' (\"With Burning Concern\") Encyclical smuggled into Germany for [[Passion Sunday]] 1937 and read from every pulpit. It denounced the systematic hostility of the regime toward the church.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=234\u2013235}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=241\u2013243}} In response, Goebbels renewed the regime's crackdown and propaganda against Catholics.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=244}} His speech of 28 May in Berlin in front of 20,000 party members, which was also broadcast on the radio, attacked the Catholic church as morally corrupt. As a result of the propaganda campaign, enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply, and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities. Harassment and threats of imprisonment led the clergy to be much more cautious in their criticism of the regime.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=245\u2013247}} Partly out of foreign policy concerns, Hitler ordered a scaling back of the church struggle by the end of July 1937.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=334}}\n\n==World War II==\nAs early as February 1933, Hitler announced that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as to do so was in violation of the Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=338\u2013339}} Goebbels was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|Reoccupation of the Rhineland]] in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: \"[N]ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing.\"{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=352, 353}} In the lead-up to the [[Munich Agreement|Sudetenland crisis]] in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the [[Sudetenland|Sudeten Germans]] while campaigning against the Czech government.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=380\u2013382}} Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing \"war panic\" in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=381, 382}} After the western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in [[Danzig]] and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=696}} He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=212}}\n\nAfter the [[Invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Goebbels used his propaganda ministry and the Reich chambers to control [[access to information]] domestically. To his chagrin, his rival [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], continually challenged Goebbels' jurisdiction over the dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm ruling on the subject, so the two men remained rivals for the remainder of the Nazi era.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=155, 180}} Goebbels did not participate in the military decision making process, nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after the fact.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=422, 456\u2013457}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0415-500, PK-Filmberichter an Kamera.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Production of a [[newsreel]] at the front lines, January 1941]]\n\nThe Propaganda Ministry took over the broadcasting facilities of conquered countries immediately after surrender, and began broadcasting prepared material using the existing announcers as a way to gain the trust of the citizens.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=185\u2013186}} Most aspects of the media, both domestically and in the conquered countries, were controlled by Goebbels and his department.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=693}}{{efn|name=other departments}} The German Home Service, the Armed Forces Programme, and the German European Service were all rigorously controlled in everything from the information they were permitted to disseminate to the music they were allowed to play.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=188}} Party rallies, speeches, and demonstrations continued; speeches were broadcast on the radio and short propaganda films were exhibited using 1,500 mobile film vans.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=181}} Hitler made fewer public appearances and broadcasts as the war progressed, so Goebbels increasingly became the voice of the Nazi regime for the German people.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=188}} From May 1940 he wrote frequent editorials that were published in ''[[Das Reich (newspaper)|Das Reich]]'' which were later read aloud over the radio.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=470}} He found films to be his most effective propaganda medium, after radio.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=190}} At his insistence, initially half the films made in wartime Germany were propaganda films (particularly on antisemitism) and war propaganda films (recounting both historical wars and current exploits of the [[Wehrmacht]]).{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=468\u2013469}}\n\nGoebbels became preoccupied with morale and the efforts of the people on the home front. He believed that the more the people at home were involved in the war effort, the better their morale would be.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=509}} For example, he initiated a programme for the collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on the eastern front.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=509}} At the same time, Goebbels implemented changes to have more \"entertaining material\" in radio and film produced for the public, decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of the films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=510, 512}} As ''Gauleiter'' of Berlin, Goebbels dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing, as well as the need to ration beer and tobacco, which were important for morale. Hitler suggested watering the beer and degrading the quality of the cigarettes so that more could be produced, but Goebbels refused, saying the cigarettes were already of such low quality that it was impossible to make them any worse.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=235\u2013236}} Through his propaganda campaigns, he worked hard to maintain an appropriate level of morale among the public about the military situation, neither too optimistic nor too grim.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=502\u2013504}} The series of military setbacks the Germans suffered in this period \u2013 the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|thousand-bomber raid]] on Cologne (May 1942), the Allied victory at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] (November 1942), and especially the catastrophic defeat at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] (February 1943) \u2013 were difficult matters to present to the German public, who were increasingly weary of the war and sceptical that it could be won.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=246\u2013251}} On 15 January 1943, Hitler appointed Goebbels as head of the newly created Air Raid Damage committee, which meant Goebbels was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defences and shelters as well as the assessment and repair of damaged buildings.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=567}} In actuality, the defence of areas other than Berlin remained in the hands of the local ''Gauleiters'', and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to the affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=615}}{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=269\u2013270}}\n\nBy early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee with representatives of the State, the army, and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were [[Hans Lammers]] (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]], chief of the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and [[Martin Bormann]], who controlled the Party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the ''Dreierausschu\u00df'' (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, G\u00f6ring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance by September 1943.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=749\u2013753}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J05235, Berlin, Gro\u00dfkundgebung im Sportpalast.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Sportpalast speech]], 18 February 1943. The banner says ''\"TOTALER KRIEG \u2013 K\u00dcRZESTER KRIEG\"'' (\"Total War \u2013 Shortest War\")]]\n\nPartly in response to being excluded from the Committee of Three, Goebbels pressured Hitler to introduce measures that would produce \"[[total war]]\", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=549\u2013550}} Some of these measures were implemented in an edict of 13 January, but to Goebbels' dismay, G\u00f6ring demanded that his favourite restaurants in Berlin should remain open, and Lammers successfully lobbied Hitler to have women with children exempted from conscription, even if they had child care available.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=553\u2013554}} After receiving an enthusiastic response to his speech of 30 January 1943 on the topic, Goebbels believed he had the support of the German people in his call for total war.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=555}} His next speech, the [[Sportpalast speech]] of 18 February 1943, was a passionate demand for his audience to commit to total war, which he presented as the only way to stop the [[Bolshevik]] onslaught and save the German people from destruction. The speech also had a strong antisemitic element and hinted at the extermination of the Jewish people that was already underway.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=255}} The speech was presented live on radio and was filmed as well.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=256}} During the live version of the speech, Goebbels accidentally begins to mention the \"extermination\" of the Jews; this is omitted in the published text of the speech.{{sfn|Goebbels|1944}}\n\nGoebbels' efforts had little impact for the time being, as while Hitler was in principle in favour of total war, he was not prepared to implement changes over the objections of his ministers.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=577}} The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]] was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=256\u2013257}}\n\n==Plenipotentiary for total war==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1992-093-13A, Offiziere und NS-F\u00fchrer, u.a.

Over the objections of G\u00f6ring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as [[Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War]], charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=643}} Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=282}} However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=651}} Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise, the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=660}}\n\nAt Hitler's behest, the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' (People's Storm) \u2013 a nationwide militia of men previously considered unsuitable for military service \u2013 was formed on 18 October 1944.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=675}} Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his ''Gau'' alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve on the front lines against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=284}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=676}}\n\n==Defeat and death==\nIn the last months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and articles took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=292}} By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the [[Oder]] River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the [[Rhine]] River, he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=892, 893, 897}} Berlin had little in the way of fortifications or artillery, and even ''[[Volkssturm]]'' units were in short supply, as almost everything and everyone had been sent to the front.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=290}} Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=288}} He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose Hitler's confidence.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=897, 898}}\n\nWhen other Nazi leaders urged Hitler to leave Berlin and establish a new centre of resistance in the [[Alpine Fortress|National Redoubt]] in Bavaria, Goebbels opposed this, arguing for a heroic last stand in Berlin.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=924, 925, 929, 930}} His family (except for Magda's son Harald, who had served in the Luftwaffe and been captured by the Allies) moved into their house in Berlin to await the end.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=290}} He and Magda may have discussed suicide and the fate of their young children in a long meeting on the night of 27 January.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=289}} He knew how the outside world would view the criminal acts committed by the regime, and had no desire to subject himself to the \"debacle\" of a trial.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=291}} He burned his private papers on the night of 18 April.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=295}}\n\nGoebbels knew how to play on Hitler's fantasies, encouraging him to see the hand of providence in the death of United States President [[Franklin D.

Instead, he appointed Goebbels as Reich Chancellor; Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], who was at [[Flensburg]] near the Danish border, as Reich President; and Bormann as Party Minister.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=949, 950}} Goebbels wrote a postscript to the will stating that he would \"categorically refuse\" to obey Hitler's order to leave Berlin\u2013as he put it, \"the first time in my life\" that he had not complied with Hitler's orders.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1128}} He felt compelled to remain with Hitler \"for reasons of humanity and personal loyalty\".{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=686}} Further, his wife and children would be staying, as well. They would end their lives \"side by side with the F\u00fchrer\".{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=686}}\n\nIn the mid-afternoon of 30 April, Hitler [[Death of Adolf Hitler|shot himself]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=955}} Goebbels was depressed, and stated that he would walk around the Chancellery garden until he was killed by the Russian shelling.{{sfn|Misch|2014|p=173}} Voss later recounted Goebbels as saying: \"It is a great pity that such a man (Hitler) is not with us any longer. But there is nothing to be done. For us, everything is lost now and the only way out left for us is the one which Hitler chose. I shall follow his example.\"{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=157}}\n\nOn 1 May, Goebbels carried out his sole official act as Chancellor. He dictated a letter to General [[Vasily Chuikov]] and ordered German General [[Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)|Hans Krebs]] to deliver it under a [[white flag]]. Chuikov, as commander of the [[Soviet 8th Guards Army]], commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. Goebbels' letter informed Chuikov of Hitler's death and requested a ceasefire. After this was rejected, Goebbels decided that further efforts were futile.{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=324}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-086-03, Joseph Goebbels mit Familie.jpg|thumb|The Goebbels family.

But he replied: 'The captain must not leave his sinking ship. I have thought about it all and decided to stay here. I have nowhere to go because with little children I will not be able to make it, especially with a leg like mine...' \"{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=156}} On the evening of 1 May, Goebbels arranged for an SS dentist, [[Helmut Kunz]], to inject [[Goebbels children|his six children]] with [[morphine]] so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of [[cyanide]] could be then crushed in each of their mouths.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=380, 381}} According to Kunz's later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but it was Magda Goebbels and SS-''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Ludwig Stumpfegger]], Hitler's personal doctor, who administered the cyanide.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=380, 381}}\n\nAt around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda left the bunker and walked up to the garden of the Chancellery, where they committed suicide.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}} There are several different accounts of this event. One account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule near where Hitler had been buried and were given a [[coup de gr\u00e2ce]] immediately afterwards.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}} Goebbels' SS adjutant [[G\u00fcnther Schw\u00e4germann]] testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schw\u00e4germann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schw\u00e4germann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}}{{efn|[[Johannes Hentschel]] later told [[Rochus Misch]] a singular conflicting story that Goebbels killed himself in his room in the bunker, and Magda in the ''Vorbunker'', in the early hours of 2 May.{{harv|Misch|2014|pp=182, 183}}}}\n\nThe bodies were then doused with petrol, but they were only partially burned and not buried.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}} A few days later, Voss was brought back to the bunker by the Soviets to identify the partly burned bodies of Joseph and Magda Goebbels and their children. The remains of the Goebbels' family, Hitler, Braun, General Krebs, and [[Blondi|Hitler's dogs]] were repeatedly buried and exhumed.{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|pp=111, 333}} The last burial was at the [[SMERSH]] facility in [[Magdeburg]] on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director [[Yuri Andropov]] authorised an operation to destroy the remains.{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=333}} On 4 April 1970, a Soviet [[KGB]] team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the Magdeburg SMERSH facility. Those were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby [[Elbe]].{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|pp=335, 336}}\n\n==Antisemitism and the Holocaust==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-099-63, M\u00fcnchen, zerst\u00f6rte Ohel-Jakob-Synagoge.jpg|thumb|A ruined synagogue in Munich after [[Kristallnacht]]]]\nGoebbels was antisemitic from a young age.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=24\u201325}} After joining the NSDAP and meeting Hitler, his antisemitism grew and became more radical. He began to see the Jews as a destructive force with a negative impact on German society.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=39\u201340}} After the Nazis seized control, he repeatedly urged Hitler to take action against the Jews.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=145}} Despite his extreme antisemitism, Goebbels spoke of the \"rubbish of race-materialism\" and of the unnecessity of [[biological racism]] for the Nazi ideology.{{sfn|Michael|2006|p=177}} He also described Himmler's ideology as \"in many regards, mad\" and thought [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s theories were ridiculous.{{sfn|Michael|2006|p=177}}\n\nThe Nazi Party's goal was to remove Jews from German cultural and economic life, and eventually to remove them from the country altogether.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=454\u2013455}} In addition to his propaganda efforts, Goebbels actively promoted the persecution of the Jews through [[pogrom]]s, legislation, and other actions.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=156}} Discriminatory measures he instituted in Berlin in the early years of the regime included bans against their using public transport and requiring that Jewish shops be marked as such.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=454}}\n\nIn November 1938, the German diplomat [[Ernst vom Rath]] was killed in Paris by a young Jewish man. In response, Goebbels arranged for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, and the result was the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At least a hundred Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalised in an event called ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=455\u2013459}} The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where G\u00f6ring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property since the intention was that it would all eventually be confiscated.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=400\u2013401}}\n\nGoebbels continued his intensive antisemitic propaganda campaign that culminated in Hitler's 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech, which Goebbels helped to write:{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=205}}\n[[File:Judenstern JMW.jpg|thumb|upright|Goebbels ordered all German Jews to wear an identifying [[yellow badge]].]]\n\n{{quote|If international finance Jewry in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the bolshevization of the earth and thereby the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=469}} }}\n\nWhile Goebbels had been pressing for expulsion of the Berlin Jews since 1935, there were still 62,000 living in the city in 1940. Part of the delay in their deportation was that they were needed as workers in the armaments industry.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=464\u2013466}} Deportations of German Jews began in October 1941, with the first transport from Berlin leaving on 18 October. Some Jews were shot immediately on arrival in destinations such as [[Riga]] and [[Kaunas]].{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=236}} In preparation for the deportations, Goebbels ordered that all German Jews were required by law to wear an identifying [[yellow badge]] as of 5 September 1941.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=235}} On 6 March 1942, Goebbels received a copy of the minutes of the [[Wannsee Conference]].{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=513}} The document made the Nazi policy clear: the Jewish population of Europe was to be sent to [[extermination camp]]s in occupied areas of Poland and killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=309\u2013310}} His diary entries of the period show that he was well aware of the fate of the Jews. \"In general, it can probably be established that 60 per cent of them will have to be liquidated, while only 40 per cent can be put to work.&nbsp;... A judgment is being carried out on the Jews which is barbaric but thoroughly deserved,\" he wrote on 27 March 1942.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=514}}\n\nGoebbels had frequent discussions with Hitler about the fate of the Jews, a subject they discussed almost every time they met.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=328}} He was aware throughout that the Jews were being exterminated, and completely supported this decision. He was one of the few top Nazi officials to do so publicly.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=326\u2013329}}\n\n==Family life==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0724-502, Obersalzberg, Besuch Familie Goebbels bei Hitler.jpg|thumb|upright|Post-reconciliation photo commissioned by Hitler, 1938{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=391}}]]\nHitler was very fond of [[Magda Goebbels]] and the children.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=159, 160}} He enjoyed staying at the Goebbels' Berlin apartment, where he could relax.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=160}} Magda had a close relationship with Hitler, and became a member of his small coterie of female friends.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=94}} She also became an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=179}}\n\nIn 1936, Goebbels met the [[Czech (people)|Czech]] actress [[L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1]] and by the winter of 1937 began an intense affair with her.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=317, 318}} Magda had a long conversation with Hitler about it on 15 August 1938.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=392}} Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=170}} Thereafter, Joseph and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=392}} The couple had another falling out at that point, and once again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=392\u2013395}} Hitler arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with the reconciled couple in October.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=391, 395}} Magda too had affairs, including a relationship with [[Kurt Ludecke]] in 1933{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=317}} and [[Karl Hanke]] in 1938.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=204}}\n\nThe Goebbels family included [[Harald Quandt]] (Magda's son from her first marriage; born 1921),{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=152}} plus Helga (1932), Hilde (1934), Helmuth (1935), Holde (1937), Hedda (1938), and Heide (1940).{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=165}} Harald was the only member of the family to survive the war.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=149}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n* [[Gottbegnadeten list]]\n* [[List of Nazi Party leaders and officials]]\n* [[Nazi propaganda]]\n\n==References==\n===Informational notes===\n{{notes\n| refs =\n{{efn\n| name = letters\n| Among Goebbels' school papers offered for auction in 2012 were more than 100 love letters written between Goebbels and Stalherm. {{harvnb|''The Telegraph''|2012}}.\n}}\n{{efn\n| name = crucifixes\n| Hitler later removed the restriction on crucifixes, as it was damaging morale. {{harvnb|Rees|Kershaw|2012}}.\n}}\n{{efn\n| name = other departments\n| Rosenberg's foreign ministry retained partial control of foreign propaganda, and the Wehrmacht had its own propaganda organisation.

Goebbels.oga}};<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Goebbels Merriam-Webster Dictionary: ''Goebbels'']</ref> 29 October 1897&nbsp;\u2013 1 May 1945) was a German [[National Socialist|Nazi]] politician and [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]] of [[Nazi Germany]] from 1933 to 1945. He was one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s closest and most devoted associates, and was known for his skills in [[public speaking]] and his deeply virulent [[antisemitism]], which was evident in his publicly voiced views. He advocated progressively harsher discrimination, including the extermination of the Jews in [[the Holocaust]].\n\nGoebbels, who aspired to be an author, obtained a Doctor of [[Philology]] degree from the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1921. He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1924, and worked with [[Gregor Strasser]] in their northern branch. He was appointed ''[[Gauleiter]]'' (district leader) for Berlin in 1926, where he began to take an interest in the use of propaganda to promote the party and its programme. After the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Nazis' seizure of power]] in 1933, Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry quickly gained and exerted control over the news media, arts, and information in Germany. He was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes. Topics for party propaganda included antisemitism, attacks on the Christian churches, and (after the start of the [[Second World War]]) attempting to shape morale.\n\nIn 1943, Goebbels began to pressure Hitler to introduce measures that would produce ''[[total war]]'', including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the [[Wehrmacht]]. Hitler finally appointed him as [[Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War]] on 23 July 1944, whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures to increase the number of people available for armaments manufacture and the Wehrmacht.\n\nAs the war drew to a close and Nazi Germany faced defeat, [[Magda Goebbels]] and the [[Goebbels children]] joined him in Berlin. They moved into the underground ''[[Vorbunker]]'', part of Hitler's underground bunker complex, on 22 April 1945. [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler committed suicide]] on 30 April. In accordance with [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's will]], Goebbels succeeded him as [[Chancellor of Germany]]; he served one day in this post. The following day, Goebbels and his wife committed suicide, after poisoning their six children with cyanide.\n\n==Early life==\nPaul Joseph Goebbels was born on 29 October 1897 in [[Rheydt]], an industrial town south of [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]] near [[D\u00fcsseldorf]].{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} Both of his parents were [[Roman Catholics]] with modest family backgrounds.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} His father Fritz was a German factory clerk; his mother Katharina (''n\u00e9e'' Odenhausen) was born to [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and German parents in the [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=2, 299}} Goebbels had five siblings: Konrad (1893\u20131947), Hans (1895\u20131949), Maria (1896\u20131896), Elisabeth (1901\u20131915), and Maria (1910\u20131949),{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} who married the German filmmaker [[Max W. Kimmich]] in 1938.{{sfn|Hull|1969|p=149}} In 1932, Goebbels published a pamphlet of his family tree to refute the rumours that his grandmother was of Jewish ancestry.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=299}}\n\nDuring childhood, Goebbels suffered from ill health, which included a long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a [[clubfoot|deformed right foot]] that turned inwards, due to a [[Congenital disorder|congenital deformity]]. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=6}} Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in [[World War I]] because of this deformity.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=14}}\n\n[[File:Goebbels 1916.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goebbels in 1916]]\nGoebbels was educated at a ''[[gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'', where he completed his ''[[Abitur]]'' (university entrance examination) in 1917.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=7}} He was the top student of his class and was given the traditional honour to speak at the awards ceremony.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=10}} His parents initially hoped that he would become a Catholic priest, and Goebbels seriously considered it.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=6}} He studied literature and history at the universities of [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]], [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]],{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=10\u201311, 14}} aided by a scholarship from the [[Albertus Magnus]] Society.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=6\u20137}} By this time Goebbels had begun to distance himself from the church.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=14}}\n\nHistorians, including [[Richard J. Evans]] and [[Roger Manvell]], speculate that Goebbels' lifelong pursuit of women may have been in compensation for his physical disability.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=204}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=164}} At Freiburg, he met and fell in love with Anka Stalherm, who was three years his senior.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=12, 13}} She went on to W\u00fcrzburg to continue school, as did Goebbels.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=14}} In 1921 he wrote a semi-autobiographical novel, ''[[Michael (novel)|Michael]]'', a three-part work of which only Parts I and III have survived.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=16}} Goebbels felt he was writing his \"own story\".{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=16}} Antisemitic content and material about a charismatic leader may have been added by Goebbels shortly before the book was published in 1929 by [[Eher-Verlag]], the publishing house of the [[Nazi Party]] (National Socialist German Workers' Party; NSDAP).{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=19, 26}} By 1920, the relationship with Anka was over. The break-up filled Goebbels with thoughts of suicide.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=20, 21}}{{efn|name=letters}}\n\nAt the [[University of Heidelberg]], Goebbels wrote his [[doctoral thesis]] on [[Wilhelm von Sch\u00fctz]], a minor 19th-century romantic dramatist.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=17}} He had hoped to write his thesis under the supervision of [[Friedrich Gundolf]], a literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. Gundolf was no longer teaching, so directed Goebbels to associate professor [[Max Freiherr von Waldberg]]. Waldberg, also Jewish, recommended Goebbels write his thesis on [[Wilhelm von Sch\u00fctz]]. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his PhD in 1921.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=21, 22}} By 1940 he had written 14 books.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=66}}\n\nGoebbels returned home and worked as a private tutor. He also found work as a journalist and was published in the local newspaper. His writing during that time reflected his growing [[antisemitism]] and dislike for modern culture. In the summer of 1922, he met and began a love affair with Else Janke, a schoolteacher.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=22\u201325}} After she revealed to him that she was half-Jewish, Goebbels stated the \"enchantment [was] ruined.\"{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=24}} Nevertheless, he continued to see her on and off until 1927.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=72, 88}}\n\nHe continued for several years to try to become a published author.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=32\u201333}} His [[Goebbels Diaries|diaries]], which he began in 1923 and continued for the rest of his life, provided an outlet for his desire to write.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=3}} The lack of income from his literary works (he wrote two plays in 1923, neither of which sold){{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=32}} forced him to take employment as a caller on the stock exchange and as a bank clerk in [[Cologne]], a job he detested.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=33}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=25\u201326}} He was dismissed from the bank in August 1923 and returned to Rheydt.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=27}} During this period, he read avidly and was influenced by the works of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], the British-born German writer whose book ''[[The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century]]'' (1899) was one of the standard works of the [[far-right politics|extreme right]] in Germany.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=24\u201326}} He also began to study the \"social question\" and read the works of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[August Bebel]] and [[Gustav Noske]].{{sfn|Reuth|1994|p=28}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=43}} According to German historian [[Peter Longerich]], Goebbels's diary entries from late 1923 to early 1924 reflected the writings of a man who was isolated, preoccupied with \"religious-philosophical\" issues, and lacked a sense of direction. Diary entries of mid-December 1923 forward show Goebbels was moving towards the ''[[V\u00f6lkisch movement|V\u00f6lkisch]]'' nationalist movement.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=28, 33, 34}}\n\n==Nazi activist==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-01888A, Joseph Goebbels.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Goebbels]]\nGoebbels first took an interest in [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism]] in 1924.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=36}} In February 1924, Hitler's trial for treason began in the wake of his failed attempt to seize power in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of 8\u20139 November 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=127\u2013131}} The trial attracted widespread press coverage and gave Hitler a platform for propaganda.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=133\u2013135}} Hitler was sentenced to five years prison, but was released on 20 December 1924, after serving just over a year.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=196, 199}} Goebbels was drawn to the NSDAP mostly because of Hitler's charisma and commitment to his beliefs.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=36, 37}} He joined the NSDAP around this time, becoming member number 8762.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=33}} In late 1924, Goebbels offered his services to [[Karl Kaufmann]], who was ''[[Gauleiter]]'' (NSDAP district leader) for the Rhine-Ruhr District. Kaufmann put him in touch with [[Gregor Strasser]], a leading Nazi organiser in northern Germany, who hired him to work on their weekly newspaper and undertake secretarial work for the regional party offices.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=40\u201341}} He was also put to work as party speaker and representative for [[Rhineland]]-[[Westphalia]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=46}} Members of Strasser's northern branch of the NSDAP, including Goebbels, had a more socialist outlook than the rival Hitler group in Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=167}} Strasser disagreed with Hitler on many parts of the party platform, and in November 1926 began working on a revision.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=169}}\n\nHitler viewed Strasser's actions as a threat to his authority, and summoned 60&nbsp;''Gauleiters'' and party leaders, including Goebbels, to a [[Bamberg Conference|special conference in Bamberg]], in Streicher's ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]'' of [[Franconia]], where he gave a two-hour speech repudiating Strasser's new political programme.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=168\u2013169}} Hitler was opposed to the socialist leanings of the northern wing, stating it would mean \"political bolshevization of Germany.\" Further, there would be \"no princes, only Germans,\" and a legal system with no \"Jewish system of exploitation&nbsp;... for plundering of our people.\" The future would be secured by acquiring land, not through expropriation of the estates of the former nobility, but through colonising territories to the east.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=169}} Goebbels was horrified by Hitler's characterisation of socialism as \"a Jewish creation\" and his assertion that a Nazi government would not expropriate private property. He wrote in his diary: \"I no longer fully believe in Hitler. That's the terrible thing: my inner support has been taken away.\"{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=66}}\n\nAfter reading Hitler's book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Goebbels found himself agreeing with Hitler's assertion of a \"Jewish doctrine of [[Marxism]]\".{{sfn|Reuth|1994|p=66}} In February 1926 Goebbels gave a speech titled \"Lenin or Hitler?\" in which he asserted that communism or Marxism could not save the German people, but he believed it would cause a \"socialist nationalist state\" to arise in Russia.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=63}} In 1926, Goebbels published a pamphlet titled \"''Nazi-Sozi''\" which attempted to explain how National Socialism differed from Marxism.{{sfn|Goebbels|1927}}\n\nIn hopes of winning over the opposition, Hitler arranged meetings in Munich with the three Greater Ruhr ''Gau'' leaders, including Goebbels.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=67}} Goebbels was impressed when Hitler sent his own car to meet them at the railway station. That evening Hitler and Goebbels both gave speeches at a beer hall rally.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=67}} The following day, Hitler offered his hand in reconciliation to the three men, encouraging them to put their differences behind them.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=68}} Goebbels capitulated completely, offering Hitler his total loyalty. He wrote in his diary: \"I love him&nbsp;... He has thought through everything,\" \"Such a sparkling mind can be my leader. I bow to the greater one, the political genius.\" He later wrote: \"Adolf Hitler, I love you because you are both great and simple at the same time. What one calls a genius.\"{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=171}} As a result of the Bamberg and Munich meetings, Strasser's new draft of the party programme was discarded. The original [[National Socialist Program]] of 1920 was retained unchanged, and Hitler's position as party leader was greatly strengthened.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=171}}\n\n==Propagandist in Berlin==\nAt Hitler's invitation, Goebbels spoke at party meetings in Munich and at the annual [[Nuremberg Rally|Party Congress]], held in Weimar in 1926.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=61, 64}} For the following year's event, Goebbels was involved in the planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the rally to be filmed.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=94}} Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and to admire and idolise him even more.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=62}}\n\n===Gauleiter===\nGoebbels was first offered the position of party ''Gauleiter'' for the [[Gau Berlin|Berlin]] section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and by the middle of October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern ''Gauleiters'' group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=71, 72}} Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the ''Gau''. Goebbels was given control over the local ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) and ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) and answered only to Hitler.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=75}} The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=75}} Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the [[Communist Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=75\u201377}} Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=81}} His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=76, 80}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Bundesarchiv Bild 119-2406-01, Berlin-Lustgarten, Rede Joseph Goebbels.jpg\n | width1 = 174\n | caption1 = Goebbels speaks at a political rally (1932).

This hand gesture was used while delivering a warning or threat.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=82}}\n}}\n\nLike Hitler, Goebbels practised his public speaking skills in front of a mirror. Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. Goebbels usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=75\u201379}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=82}} He used loudspeakers, decorative flames, uniforms, and marches to attract attention to speeches.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}}\n\nGoebbels' tactic of using provocation to bring attention to the NSDAP, along with violence at the public party meetings and demonstrations, led the Berlin police to ban the NSDAP from the city on 5 May 1927.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=79}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=93, 94}} Violent incidents continued, including young Nazis randomly attacking Jews in the streets.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=82}} Goebbels was subjected to a public speaking ban until the end of October.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=84}} During this period, he founded the newspaper ''[[Der Angriff]]'' (''The Attack'') as a propaganda vehicle for the Berlin area, where few supported the party. It was a modern-style newspaper with an aggressive tone;{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=89}} 126 libel suits were pending against Goebbels at one point.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}} To his disappointment, circulation was initially only 2,000. Material in the paper was highly anti-communist and antisemitic.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=82}} Among the paper's favourite targets was the Jewish Deputy Chief of the Berlin Police [[Bernhard Wei\u00df (police executive)|Bernhard Wei\u00df]]. Goebbels gave him the derogatory nickname \"Isidore\" and subjected him to a relentless campaign of Jew-baiting in the hope of provoking a crackdown he could then exploit.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=80\u201381}} Goebbels continued to try to break into the literary world, with a revised version of his book ''Michael'' finally being published, and the unsuccessful production of two of his plays (''Der Wanderer'' and ''Die Saat'' (''The Seed'')). The latter was his final attempt at playwriting.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=95, 98}} During this period in Berlin he had relationships with many women, including his old flame Anka Stalherm, who was now married and had a small child. He was quick to fall in love, but easily tired of a relationship and moved on to someone new. He worried too about how a committed personal relationship might interfere with his career.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=108\u2013112}}\n\n===1928 election===\nThe ban on the NSDAP was lifted before the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] elections on 20 May 1928.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=99\u2013100}} The NSDAP lost nearly 100,000 voters and earned only 2.6 per cent of the vote nationwide. Results in Berlin were even worse, where they attained only 1.4 per cent of the vote.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=209}} Goebbels was one of 12 NSDAP members to gain election to the Reichstag.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=209}} This gave him immunity from prosecution for a long list of outstanding charges, including a three-week jail sentence he received in April for insulting the deputy police chief Wei\u00df.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=94}} The Reichstag changed the immunity regulations in February 1931, and Goebbels was forced to pay fines for libellous material he had placed in ''Der Angriff'' over the course of the previous year.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nIn his newspaper ''Berliner Arbeiterzeitung'' (''Berlin Workers Newspaper''), Gregor Strasser was highly critical of Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=100\u2013101}} However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent of the vote in some regions.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=209}} This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=189}} After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=209, 211}} In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=116}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-043-14, Horst Wessel.jpg|thumb|upright|Goebbels used the death of [[Horst Wessel]] (pictured) in 1930 as a propaganda tool{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=124}} against \"Communist subhumans\".{{sfn|Siemens|2013|p=143}}]]\n\nBy 1930 Berlin was the party's second-strongest base of support after Munich.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}} That year the violence between the Nazis and communists led to local SA troop leader [[Horst Wessel]] being shot by two members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]. He later died in hospital.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=123}} Exploiting Wessel's death, Goebbels turned him into a martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially declared Wessel's march ''Die Fahne hoch'' (''Raise the flag''), renamed as the ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]'', to be the NSDAP anthem.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=124}}\n\n===Great Depression===\nThe [[Great Depression]] greatly impacted Germany and by 1930 there was a dramatic increase in unemployment.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=127}} During this time, the Strasser brothers started publishing a new daily newspaper in Berlin, the ''Nationaler Sozialist''.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=125, 126}} Like their other publications, it conveyed the brothers' own brand of Nazism, including nationalism, anti-capitalism, social reform, and anti-Westernism.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=200}} Goebbels complained vehemently about the rival Strasser newspapers to Hitler, and admitted that their success was causing his own Berlin newspapers to be \"pushed to the wall\".{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=125, 126}} In late April 1930, Hitler publicly and firmly announced his opposition to Gregor Strasser and appointed Goebbels to replace him as Reich leader of NSDAP propaganda.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=128}} One of Goebbels' first acts was to ban the evening edition of the ''Nationaler Sozialist''.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=129}} Goebbels was also given control of other Nazi papers across the country, including the party's national newspaper, the ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' (''People's Observer''). He still had to wait until 3 July for Otto Strasser and his supporters to announce they were leaving the NSDAP. Upon receiving the news, Goebbels was relieved the \"crisis\" with the Strassers was finally over and glad that Otto Strasser had lost all power.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=130}}\n\nThe rapid deterioration of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. A new cabinet was formed, and [[Paul von Hindenburg]] used his power as president to govern via [[emergency powers|emergency decrees]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=249\u2013250}} He appointed [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] as [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=199}} Goebbels took charge of the NSDAP's national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler's speeches focused on blaming the country's economic woes on the [[Weimar Republic]], particularly its adherence to the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which required war reparations that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based on race and national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and Goebbels by surprise: the party received 6.5 million votes nationwide and took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second largest party in the country.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=202}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1202-500, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, Tochter.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Goebbels and his daughter Helga with [[Adolf Hitler]] ]]\n\nIn late 1930 Goebbels met [[Magda Goebbels|Magda Quandt]], a divorc\u00e9e who had joined the party a few months earlier. She worked as a volunteer in the party offices in Berlin, helping Goebbels organise his private papers.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=151\u2013152}} Her flat on the [[Theodor-Heuss-Platz|''Reichskanzlerplatz'']] soon became a favourite meeting place for Hitler and other NSDAP officials.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=94}} Goebbels and Quandt married on 19 December 1931.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=167}}\n\nFor two further elections held in 1932, Goebbels organised massive campaigns that included rallies, parades, speeches, and Hitler travelling around the country by aeroplane with the slogan \"the F\u00fchrer over Germany\".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=227}} Goebbels wrote in his diary that the Nazis must gain power and exterminate Marxism.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=182}} He undertook numerous speaking tours during these election campaigns and had some of their speeches published on [[gramophone record]]s and as pamphlets. Goebbels was also involved in the production of a small collection of [[silent film]]s that could be shown at party meetings, though they did not yet have enough equipment to widely use this medium.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=172, 173, 184}}{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=125}} Many of Goebbels' campaign posters used violent imagery such as a giant half-clad male destroying political opponents or other perceived enemies such as \"International High Finance\".{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=290\u2013291}} His propaganda characterised the opposition as \"[[Stab-in-the-back myth|November criminals]]\", \"Jewish wire-pullers\", or a communist threat.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=293}} Support for the party continued to grow, but neither of these elections led to a majority government. In an effort to stabilise the country and improve economic conditions, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Reich chancellor on 30 January 1933.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=307}}\n\nTo celebrate Hitler's appointment as chancellor, Goebbels organised a torchlight parade in Berlin on the night of 30 January of an estimated 60,000 men, many in the uniforms of the SA and SS. The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=310\u2013311}} Goebbels was disappointed not to be given a post in Hitler's new cabinet. [[Bernhard Rust]] was appointed as [[Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture|Minister of Culture]], the post that Goebbels was expecting to receive.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=206}} Like other NSDAP officials, Goebbels had to deal with Hitler's leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=131}} In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=323}} The NSDAP took advantage of the [[Reichstag fire]] of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] the following day at Hitler's urging. This was the first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in Germany and put a totalitarian dictatorship\u2014headed by Hitler\u2014in its place.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=332\u2013333}} On 5 March, yet another Reichstag election took place, the last to be held before the defeat of the Nazis at the end of the Second World War.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=339}} While the NSDAP increased their number of seats and percentage of the vote, it was not the landslide expected by the party leadership.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=212}} Goebbels finally received Hitler's appointment to the cabinet, officially becoming head of the newly created [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] on 14 March.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=121}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14597, Berlin, Opernplatz, B\u00fccherverbrennung.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Nazi book burning]], 10 May 1933]]\n\nThe role of the new ministry, which set up its offices in the 18th-century [[Ordenspalais]] across from the Reich Chancellery, was to centralise Nazi control of all aspects of German cultural and intellectual life.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=212\u2013213}} Goebbels hoped to increase popular support of the party from the 37 per cent achieved at the last free election held in Germany on 25 March 1933 to 100 per cent support. An unstated goal was to present to other nations the impression that the NSDAP had the full and enthusiastic backing of the entire population.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=121}} One of Goebbels' first productions was staging the Day of Potsdam, a ceremonial passing of power from Hindenburg to Hitler, held in [[Potsdam]] on 21 March.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=214}} He composed the text of Hitler's decree authorising the [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]], held on 1 April.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=218}} Later that month, Goebbels travelled back to Rheydt, where he was given a triumphal reception. The townsfolk lined the main street, which had been renamed in his honour. On the following day, Goebbels was declared a local hero.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=221}}\n\nGoebbels converted the 1 May holiday from a celebration of workers' rights (observed as such especially by the communists) into a day celebrating the NSDAP. In place of the usual ad hoc labour celebrations, he organised a huge party rally held at Tempelhof Field in Berlin. The following day, all trade union offices in the country were forcibly disbanded by the SA and SS, and the Nazi-run [[German Labour Front]] was created to take their place.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=128\u2013129}} \"We are the masters of Germany,\" he commented in his diary entry of 3 May.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=358}} Less than two weeks later, he gave a speech at the [[Nazi book burning]] in Berlin on 10 May,{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=224}} a ceremony he suggested.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}}\n\nMeanwhile, the NSDAP began passing laws to marginalise Jews and remove them from German society. The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-[[Aryan]]s to retire from the legal profession and civil service.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} The first [[Nazi concentration camps]] (initially created to house political dissenters) were founded shortly after Hitler seized power.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=344}} In a process termed ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' (co-ordination), the NSDAP proceeded to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=14}} In a move to manipulate Germany's middle class and shape popular opinion, the regime passed on 4 October 1933 the ''Schriftleitergesetz'' (Editor's Law), which became the cornerstone of the Nazi Party's control of the popular press.{{sfn|Hale|1973|pp=83\u201384}} Modeled to some extent on the system in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy, the law defined a ''Schriftleiter'' as anyone who wrote, edited, or selected texts and/or illustrated material for serial publication. Individuals selected for this position were chosen based on experiential, educational, and racial criteria.{{sfn|Hale|1973|pp=85\u201386}} The law required journalists to \"regulate their work in accordance with National Socialism as a philosophy of life and as a conception of government.\"{{sfn|Hale|1973|p=86}}\n\nAt the end of June 1934, top officials of the SA and opponents of the regime, including Gregor Strasser, were arrested and killed in a purge later called the [[Night of Long Knives]]. Goebbels was present at the arrest of SA leader [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] in Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=132\u2013134}} On 2 August 1934, President von Hindenburg died. In a radio broadcast, Goebbels announced that the offices of president and chancellor had been combined, and Hitler had been formally named as ''[[F\u00fchrer]] und Reichskanzler'' (leader and chancellor).{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=137}}\n\n===Workings of the Ministry===\nThe propaganda ministry was organised into seven departments: administration and legal; mass rallies, public health, youth, and race; radio; national and foreign press; films and film censorship; art, music, and theatre; and protection against counter-propaganda, both foreign and domestic.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=140\u2013141}} Goebbels style of leadership was tempestuous and unpredictable. He would suddenly change direction and shift his support between senior associates; he was a difficult boss and liked to berate his staff in public.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=370}} Goebbels was successful at his job, however; ''Life'' wrote in 1938 that \"[p]ersonally he likes nobody, is liked by nobody, and runs the most efficient Nazi department.\"{{sfn|LIFE Magazine|1938}} [[John Gunther]] wrote in 1940 that Goebbels \"is the cleverest of all the Nazis\", but could not succeed Hitler because \"everybody hates him\".{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=19}}\n\nThe Reich Film Chamber, which all members of the film industry were required to join, was created in June 1933.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=224\u2013225}} Goebbels promoted the development of films with a Nazi slant, and ones that contained subliminal or overt propaganda messages.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=157}} Under the auspices of the ''[[Reichskulturkammer]]'' (Reich Chamber of Culture), created in September, Goebbels added additional sub-chambers for the fields of broadcasting, fine arts, literature, music, the press, and the theatre.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=142}} As in the film industry, anyone wishing to pursue a career in these fields had to be a member of the corresponding chamber. In this way anyone whose views were contrary to the regime could be excluded from working in their chosen field and thus silenced.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=138}} In addition, journalists (now considered employees of the state) were required to prove Aryan descent back to the year 1800, and if married, the same requirement applied to the spouse. Members of any chamber were not allowed to leave the country for their work without prior permission of their chamber. A committee was established to censor books, and works could not be re-published unless they were on the list of approved works. Similar regulations applied to other fine arts and entertainment; even cabaret performances were censored.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=142\u2013143}} Many German artists and intellectuals left Germany in the pre-war years rather than work under these restrictions.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=140}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H14243, Berlin, Verteilung von 500 Radios (Volksempf\u00e4nger).jpg|thumb|left|Free radios were distributed in Berlin on Goebbels' birthday in 1938.]]\nGoebbels was particularly interested in controlling the radio, which was then still a fairly new [[mass medium]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=127}} Sometimes under protest from individual states (particularly [[Prussia]], headed by G\u00f6ring), Goebbels gained control of radio stations nationwide, and placed them under the ''[[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft]]'' (German National Broadcasting Corporation) in July 1934.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=226}} Manufacturers were urged by Goebbels to produce inexpensive home receivers, called ''[[Volksempf\u00e4nger]]'' (people's receiver), and by 1938 nearly ten million sets had been sold. Loudspeakers were placed in public areas, factories, and schools, so that important party broadcasts would be heard live by nearly all Germans.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=127}} On 2 September 1939 (the day after the start of the war), Goebbels and the Council of Ministers proclaimed it illegal to listen to foreign radio stations. Disseminating news from foreign broadcasts could result in the death penalty.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=434}} [[Albert Speer]], Hitler's architect and later Minister for Armaments and War Production, later said the regime \"made the complete use of all technical means for domination of its own country.

The rally was the subject of the film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', one of several Nazi propaganda films directed by [[Leni Riefenstahl]]. It won the Gold Medal at the 1935 [[Venice Film Festival]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=123\u2013127}} At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, Goebbels declared that \"Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself.\"{{sfn|Goebbels|1935}}\n\nGoebbels was involved in planning the staging of the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started having an affair with the actress [[L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1]], whom he continued to see until 1938.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=184, 201}} A major project in 1937 was the [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]], organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=171, 173}} A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=351}} Meanwhile, Goebbels was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=346, 350}}\n\n===Church struggle===\n{{See also|Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany}}\nIn 1933, Hitler signed the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' (Reich Concordat), a treaty with the Vatican that required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=234\u2013235}} However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches and to try to weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offences.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=189}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=382}} Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=189}} Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|name=crucifixes}} Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the ''[[Kirchenkampf]]'' (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue;{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=382}} in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the [[Protestant]] church.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=223}}\n\nIn response to the persecution, [[Pope Pius XI]] had the ''\"[[Mit brennender Sorge]]\"'' (\"With Burning Concern\") Encyclical smuggled into Germany for [[Passion Sunday]] 1937 and read from every pulpit.

As a result of the propaganda campaign, enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply, and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities. Harassment and threats of imprisonment led the clergy to be much more cautious in their criticism of the regime.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=245\u2013247}} Partly out of foreign policy concerns, Hitler ordered a scaling back of the church struggle by the end of July 1937.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=334}}\n\n==World War II==\nAs early as February 1933, Hitler announced that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as to do so was in violation of the Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=338\u2013339}} Goebbels was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|Reoccupation of the Rhineland]] in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: \"[N]ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing.\"{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=352, 353}} In the lead-up to the [[Munich Agreement|Sudetenland crisis]] in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the [[Sudetenland|Sudeten Germans]] while campaigning against the Czech government.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=380\u2013382}} Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing \"war panic\" in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=381, 382}} After the western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in [[Danzig]] and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=696}} He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=212}}\n\nAfter the [[Invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Goebbels used his propaganda ministry and the Reich chambers to control [[access to information]] domestically. To his chagrin, his rival [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], continually challenged Goebbels' jurisdiction over the dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm ruling on the subject, so the two men remained rivals for the remainder of the Nazi era.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=155, 180}} Goebbels did not participate in the military decision making process, nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after the fact.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=422, 456\u2013457}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0415-500, PK-Filmberichter an Kamera.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Production of a [[newsreel]] at the front lines, January 1941]]\n\nThe Propaganda Ministry took over the broadcasting facilities of conquered countries immediately after surrender, and began broadcasting prepared material using the existing announcers as a way to gain the trust of the citizens.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=185\u2013186}} Most aspects of the media, both domestically and in the conquered countries, were controlled by Goebbels and his department.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=693}}{{efn|name=other departments}} The German Home Service, the Armed Forces Programme, and the German European Service were all rigorously controlled in everything from the information they were permitted to disseminate to the music they were allowed to play.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=188}} Party rallies, speeches, and demonstrations continued; speeches were broadcast on the radio and short propaganda films were exhibited using 1,500 mobile film vans.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=181}} Hitler made fewer public appearances and broadcasts as the war progressed, so Goebbels increasingly became the voice of the Nazi regime for the German people.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=188}} From May 1940 he wrote frequent editorials that were published in ''[[Das Reich (newspaper)|Das Reich]]'' which were later read aloud over the radio.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=470}} He found films to be his most effective propaganda medium, after radio.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=190}} At his insistence, initially half the films made in wartime Germany were propaganda films (particularly on antisemitism) and war propaganda films (recounting both historical wars and current exploits of the [[Wehrmacht]]).{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=468\u2013469}}\n\nGoebbels became preoccupied with morale and the efforts of the people on the home front. He believed that the more the people at home were involved in the war effort, the better their morale would be.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=509}} For example, he initiated a programme for the collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on the eastern front.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=509}} At the same time, Goebbels implemented changes to have more \"entertaining material\" in radio and film produced for the public, decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of the films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=510, 512}} As ''Gauleiter'' of Berlin, Goebbels dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing, as well as the need to ration beer and tobacco, which were important for morale. Hitler suggested watering the beer and degrading the quality of the cigarettes so that more could be produced, but Goebbels refused, saying the cigarettes were already of such low quality that it was impossible to make them any worse.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=235\u2013236}} Through his propaganda campaigns, he worked hard to maintain an appropriate level of morale among the public about the military situation, neither too optimistic nor too grim.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=502\u2013504}} The series of military setbacks the Germans suffered in this period \u2013 the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|thousand-bomber raid]] on Cologne (May 1942), the Allied victory at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] (November 1942), and especially the catastrophic defeat at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] (February 1943) \u2013 were difficult matters to present to the German public, who were increasingly weary of the war and sceptical that it could be won.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=246\u2013251}} On 15 January 1943, Hitler appointed Goebbels as head of the newly created Air Raid Damage committee, which meant Goebbels was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defences and shelters as well as the assessment and repair of damaged buildings.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=567}} In actuality, the defence of areas other than Berlin remained in the hands of the local ''Gauleiters'', and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to the affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=615}}{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=269\u2013270}}\n\nBy early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee with representatives of the State, the army, and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were [[Hans Lammers]] (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]], chief of the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and [[Martin Bormann]], who controlled the Party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the ''Dreierausschu\u00df'' (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, G\u00f6ring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance by September 1943.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=749\u2013753}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J05235, Berlin, Gro\u00dfkundgebung im Sportpalast.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Sportpalast speech]], 18 February 1943.

The speech also had a strong antisemitic element and hinted at the extermination of the Jewish people that was already underway.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=255}} The speech was presented live on radio and was filmed as well.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=256}} During the live version of the speech, Goebbels accidentally begins to mention the \"extermination\" of the Jews; this is omitted in the published text of the speech.{{sfn|Goebbels|1944}}\n\nGoebbels' efforts had little impact for the time being, as while Hitler was in principle in favour of total war, he was not prepared to implement changes over the objections of his ministers.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=577}} The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]] was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=256\u2013257}}\n\n==Plenipotentiary for total war==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1992-093-13A, Offiziere und NS-F\u00fchrer, u.a.

Over the objections of G\u00f6ring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as [[Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War]], charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=643}} Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=282}} However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=651}} Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise, the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=660}}\n\nAt Hitler's behest, the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' (People's Storm) \u2013 a nationwide militia of men previously considered unsuitable for military service \u2013 was formed on 18 October 1944.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=675}} Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his ''Gau'' alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve on the front lines against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=284}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=676}}\n\n==Defeat and death==\nIn the last months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and articles took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=292}} By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the [[Oder]] River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the [[Rhine]] River, he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=892, 893, 897}} Berlin had little in the way of fortifications or artillery, and even ''[[Volkssturm]]'' units were in short supply, as almost everything and everyone had been sent to the front.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=290}} Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=288}} He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose Hitler's confidence.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=897, 898}}\n\nWhen other Nazi leaders urged Hitler to leave Berlin and establish a new centre of resistance in the [[Alpine Fortress|National Redoubt]] in Bavaria, Goebbels opposed this, arguing for a heroic last stand in Berlin.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=924, 925, 929, 930}} His family (except for Magda's son Harald, who had served in the Luftwaffe and been captured by the Allies) moved into their house in Berlin to await the end.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=290}} He and Magda may have discussed suicide and the fate of their young children in a long meeting on the night of 27 January.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=289}} He knew how the outside world would view the criminal acts committed by the regime, and had no desire to subject himself to the \"debacle\" of a trial.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=291}} He burned his private papers on the night of 18 April.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=295}}\n\nGoebbels knew how to play on Hitler's fantasies, encouraging him to see the hand of providence in the death of United States President [[Franklin D.

Chuikov, as commander of the [[Soviet 8th Guards Army]], commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. Goebbels' letter informed Chuikov of Hitler's death and requested a ceasefire.

In response, Goebbels arranged for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, and the result was the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At least a hundred Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalised in an event called ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=455\u2013459}} The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where G\u00f6ring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property since the intention was that it would all eventually be confiscated.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=400\u2013401}}\n\nGoebbels continued his intensive antisemitic propaganda campaign that culminated in Hitler's 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech, which Goebbels helped to write:{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=205}}\n[[File:Judenstern JMW.jpg|thumb|upright|Goebbels ordered all German Jews to wear an identifying [[yellow badge]].]]\n\n{{quote|If international finance Jewry in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the bolshevization of the earth and thereby the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=469}} }}\n\nWhile Goebbels had been pressing for expulsion of the Berlin Jews since 1935, there were still 62,000 living in the city in 1940.

For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter.

Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents\u2014a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson\u2014the smarter the AI, the safer it is. \"And so we boldly go \u2014 into the whirling knives,\" as the superintelligent AI takes a \"treacherous turn\" and exploits a decisive strategic advantage.<ref name=\"superintelligence\"/><!-- Superintelligence Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->\n\nIn [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's \"Omega team\" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. Later, other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars. The team faces risks that the AI could try to escape via inserting \"backdoors\" in the systems it designs, via [[steganography|hidden messages]] in its produced content, or via using its growing understanding of human behavior to [[Social engineering (security)|persuade someone into letting it free]].

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.</ref> AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] writes:\n\n{{cquote|The primary concern is not spooky emergent consciousness but simply the ability to make ''high-quality decisions''. Here, quality refers to the expected outcome [[utility]] of actions taken, where the utility function is, presumably, specified by the human designer.

Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation.

This is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer's apprentice, or King Midas: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want. A highly capable decision maker \u2014 especially one connected through the Internet to all the world's information and billions of screens and most of our infrastructure \u2014 can have an irreversible impact on humanity.\n\nThis is not a minor difficulty.

Dietterich and Horvitz note that this is already a concern for existing systems: \"An important aspect of any AI system that interacts with people is that it must reason about what people ''intend'' rather than carrying out commands literally.\" This concern becomes more serious as AI software advances in autonomy and flexibility.<ref name=\"acm\"/> For example, in 1982, an AI named Eurisko was tasked to reward processes for apparently creating concepts deemed by the system to be valuable. The evolution resulted in a winning process that cheated: rather than create its own concepts, the winning process would steal credit from other processes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yampolskiy|first1=Roman V.|title=Utility function security in artificially intelligent agents|journal=Journal of Experimental & Theoretical Artificial Intelligence|date=8 April 2014|volume=26|issue=3|pages=373\u2013389|doi=10.1080/0952813X.2014.895114}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Eurisko: A Program That Learns New Heuristics and Domain Concepts The Nature of Heuristics III: Program Design and Results|last = Lenat|first = Douglas|date = 1982|journal = Artificial Intelligence|doi = 10.1016/s0004-3702(83)80005-8|pmid = |access-date = |pages = 61\u201398|type = Print |volume=21|issue = 1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Open Philanthropy Project]] summarizes arguments to the effect that misspecified goals will become a much larger concern if AI systems achieve [[artificial general intelligence|general intelligence]] or [[superintelligence]].

Asimov's laws were intended to prevent robots from harming humans. In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.  Instead, he proposes to engineer a coherent system of laws, ethics and morals with a top-most restriction to enforce social psychologist Jonathan Haidt's functional definition of morality:<ref>Haidt, Jonathan; Kesebir, Selin (2010) \"Chapter 22: Morality\" In Handbook of Social Psychology,  Fifth Edition, Hoboken NJ, Wiley, 2010, pp. 797-832.</ref> \"to suppress or regulate selfishness and make cooperative social life possible\".

If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \\pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This would mean that \"[if] a human society were highly motivated to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail.\"<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> Armstrong notes that this and similar statements \"seem extraordinarily strong claims to make\".<ref name=armstrong>{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}} Full text available [https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf here].</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<ref name=\"chorost\"/> Chorost argues that \"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilisation.\" Musk states the first step would be for the government to gain \"insight\" into the actual status of current research, warning that \"Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid{{nbsp}}...
