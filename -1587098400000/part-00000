The [[Frisians|Frisian people]], as being the direct offspring of the first Nordic settlers, had been able to preserve the cultural traditions of their forebears, which he considered as a key to the understanding of premeval [[monotheism]]. According to Wirth, Christ descended from a lost tribe of the original Aryans, who had left their traces in the Near East in the form of [[Megalithic monument]]s.\n\nChristianity, however, was corrupted by oriental despotism and local superstition, and came back to the Northern Europe in a distorted manner. As [[Judaism]] was largely responsible for this distortion, Christianity had to be cleansed from Judaic elements and revert to its original [[Fertility rite|fertility cults]], in which the [[Mother Goddess]] played a central part. Mai 1933 Wirth organized an groundbreaking exhibition in Berlin under the title of ''\"Heilbringer\": From Thule to Galilee and from Galilee to Thule''. Here humanity's religious history was linked to the expectation that [[Adolf Hitler]] would be the Healer and Savior of the German people.\n\nThe ''Palestinabuch'' may have been conceived as a counterpart to the ''Ura Linda Chronicle''. It was officially titled ''The Riddle of the Palestine's Megalithic Graves: From JAU to Jesus''. By 1969 the proposed title had changed into ''Between the North Sea and the [[Sea of Galilee|Sea of Genezareth]]'', implicitly referring to an influential book by the 19th-century reactionary [[Julius Langbehn]], ''Rembrandt as Educator'' (1890). The subtitle shifted between ''The Savior Myth of the Megalithic Religion's Crucified God'' and ''The Oriental-Occidental Community of the Megalithic Era''.<ref>Eberhard Baumann, ''[http://neon.niederlandistik.fu-berlin.de/static/nem_geschiedenis/Duits/Baumann_1995.pdf Verzeichnis der Schriften, Manuskripte und Vortr\u00e4ge von Herman Felix Wirth Roeper Bosch von 1908 bis 1993, sowie der Schriften f\u00fcr, gegen, zu und \u00fcber die Person und das Werk von Herman Wirth von 1908 bis 1995]'', Toppenstedt 1995, nrs. 488, 492, 510, 568, 575, 576.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Miguel Serrano]], Wirth considered the book his main opus, on which he had worked for many years.

Or that, for the same reason, references to the supposed text have been deliberately ignored by the administrators of his estate. Even Wirth's loyal publisher, the neonazi [[Wilhelm Landig]] left several manuscripts Wirth wrote for him unprinted.\n\n==Miguel Serrano==\nHerman Wirth died in February 1981. Some time before, on the 3rd of September 1979, he was interviewed by the Chilean former diplomat and nazi propagandist [[Miguel Serrano]] (1917-2009), who asked him about the history of the Jewish people.<ref>'''On Serrano:''' Gustavo Guzm\u00e1n, '[https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/actap/40/1/article-20190001.xml Miguel Serrano's Antisemitism and its Impact on the Twenty-First-Century Countercultural Rightists]', in: ''Analysis of Current Trends in Antisemitism (ACTA)'' 40 (2019), nr. 1.</ref> The story is told in Serrano's ''Adolf Hitler: The Ultimate Avatar'' (1984):\n\n<blockquote>It is difficult to know the true origin of this people. In the visit I made to professor Herman Wirth, founder of the Ahnenerbe, high specialized organism of investigation of the SS, and one of the most extraordinary students of Nordic pre-antiquity, I asked him about the Jews. He gave me a strange unexpected answer: \"Nomadic people, from slaves, who lived on the periphery of the great civilization of the Gobi...\" I deeply regret not having asked more about this. [...] When I knew him he was 94 years old and remained agile and alert. Even then, not long before dying, the manuscripts of his work were stolen from him, it is believed by his own collaborators. Marxist infiltrators, or perhaps even Catholics, caused this most valuable work to disappear. The world will never know of it. It is a tragedy as great as the destruction of the [[Library of Alexandria]]. At least for me. The identical hand will have committed the same crime to cover up evidence.<ref>Miguel Serrano, ''[https://archive.org/stream/serranomigueladolfhitlertheultimateavatar2000#page/n77/mode/1up Adolf Hitler, the Ultimate Avatar]'' (1984), 2011, p. 79, 295.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nIn subsequent publications Serrano blamed \"the Great Conspiracy\" for the loss. Wirths book would have \"definitively clarified the true history of the Jews\", but \"the manuscript may now be found in some synagogue or in the subterranean vaults beneath the Vatican\".<ref>Miguel Serrano, ''[[iarchive:manuforthemantocomeserrano/page/n139/mode/1up/search/wirth|Man\u00fa: For the Man That Comes]]'' (1991), Melbourne 2012, vol. 2, p. 150.</ref>\n\nAccording to Serrano, Wirth told him that the Frisian Sea-Kings, survivors of the catastrophe of Polar [[Hyperborea]], first met the Jews in Northern Africa, where they were known as ''Golen'' ([[Gauls]]) or ''[[Golem]]'', but the Frisians nicknamed them ''Triuweden'' ([[druid]]s), meaning 'those who have no truth'.

The [[Frisians|Frisian people]], as being the direct offspring of the first Nordic settlers, had been able to preserve the cultural traditions of their forebears, which he considered as a key to the understanding of premeval [[monotheism]]. According to Wirth, Christ descended from a lost tribe of the original Aryans, who had left their traces in the Near East in the form of [[Megalithic monument]]s.\n\nChristianity, however, was corrupted by oriental despotism and local superstition, and came back to the Northern Europe in a distorted manner. As [[Judaism]] was largely responsible for this distortion, Christianity had to be cleansed from Judaic elements and revert to its original [[Fertility rite|fertility cults]], in which the [[Mother Goddess]] played a central part. Mai 1933 Wirth organized an groundbreaking exhibition in Berlin under the title of ''\"Heilbringer\": From Thule to Galilee and from Galilee to Thule''. Here humanity's religious history was linked to the expectation that [[Adolf Hitler]] would be the Healer and Savior of the German people.\n\nThe ''Palestinabuch'' may have been conceived as a counterpart to the ''Ura Linda Chronicle''. It was officially titled ''The Riddle of the Palestine's Megalithic Graves: From JAU to Jesus''. By 1969 the proposed title had changed into ''Between the North Sea and the [[Sea of Galilee|Sea of Genezareth]]'', implicitly referring to an influential book by the 19th-century reactionary [[Julius Langbehn]], ''Rembrandt as Educator'' (1890). The subtitle shifted between ''The Savior Myth of the Megalithic Religion's Crucified God'' and ''The Oriental-Occidental Community of the Megalithic Era''.<ref>Eberhard Baumann, ''[http://neon.niederlandistik.fu-berlin.de/static/nem_geschiedenis/Duits/Baumann_1995.pdf Verzeichnis der Schriften, Manuskripte und Vortr\u00e4ge von Herman Felix Wirth Roeper Bosch von 1908 bis 1993, sowie der Schriften f\u00fcr, gegen, zu und \u00fcber die Person und das Werk von Herman Wirth von 1908 bis 1995]'', Toppenstedt 1995, nrs. 488, 492, 510, 568, 575, 576.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Miguel Serrano]], Wirth considered the book his main opus, on which he had worked for many years.

Or that, for the same reason, references to the supposed text have been deliberately ignored by the administrators of his estate.

Some time before, on the 3rd of September 1979, he was interviewed by the Chilean former diplomat and nazi propagandist [[Miguel Serrano]] (1917-2009), who asked him about the history of the Jewish people.<ref>'''On Serrano:''' Gustavo Guzm\u00e1n, '[https://www.degruyter.com/view/journals/actap/40/1/article-20190001.xml Miguel Serrano's Antisemitism and its Impact on the Twenty-First-Century Countercultural Rightists]', in: ''Analysis of Current Trends in Antisemitism (ACTA)'' 40 (2019), nr. 1.</ref> The story is told in Serrano's ''Adolf Hitler: The Ultimate Avatar'' (1984):\n\n<blockquote>It is difficult to know the true origin of this people.

[...] When I knew him he was 94 years old and remained agile and alert. Even then, not long before dying, the manuscripts of his work were stolen from him, it is believed by his own collaborators. Marxist infiltrators, or perhaps even Catholics, caused this most valuable work to disappear. The world will never know of it.
