In reality, little was done since Kiev had to take into account Russia, which remained its major trade partner and natural gas and fossil energy supplier.\n\nThe political dialogue between the EU and Ukraine started in 1994 when the [[Partnership and Cooperation Agreement]] (PCA) was signed. That document was focused on economic and social issues as well as on the necessity of improving public government and guaranteeing free press and civil rights. The framework set for political discussions was modest: yearly meeting between EU Troika and Ukrainian leadership and some inter ministerial consultations. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1994 entered into force in 1998 and expired in 2008. The first EU-Ukraine summit took place in September 1997 in [[Kiev]].<ref name=UW28212EUU>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/73494 \"EU-Ukraine Summits: 16 Years of Wheel-Spinning\"], ''[[The Ukrainian Week]]'' (28 February 2012)</ref> During the second summit in October 1998 in [[Vienna]], Ukraine\u2013EU relations were defined as a \"strategic and unique partnership\" and Ukraine first declared its desire to acquire associate membership in the EU.<ref name=UW28212EUU /> None of top level meetings brought major changes to a reserved EU approach. Leaders focused chiefly on [[post-communism]] economic transition and human rights records as well as on issues connected to the [[Chernobyl nuclear power plant]] and its containment.\n\nIn 2002, EU Enlargement Commissioner [[G\u00fcnter Verheugen]] said that \"a European perspective\" for [[Ukraine]] does not necessarily mean membership within 10 to 20 years; however, it is a possibility. The same year [[Ukrainian President]] [[Leonid Kuchma]] stated that Ukraine wanted to sign an association agreement with the EU by 2003\u20132004 and that his country would meet all EU membership requirements by 2007\u20132011.<ref name=UW28212EUU />\n\n=== Post-Orange Revolution relations ===\n[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP Summit 19 March 2009 (86) (1).jpg|thumb|300px|Left to right: Then Ukrainian Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] and President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] meeting with [[President of the European Council|European Council President]] [[Herman Van Rompuy]] in 2009.]]\nThe [[Orange Revolution]] of late 2004 improved Ukraine's European prospects; the opposition leader [[Viktor Yushchenko]] hinted that he would press the EU for deeper ties and described a four-point plan: acknowledgment of Ukraine as a market economy, entry in the [[World Trade Organization]], associate membership in the European Union, and, finally, full membership.<ref>[http://www.euobserver.com/?sid=24&aid=17977 EUobserver article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524013702/http://www.euobserver.com/?sid=24&aid=17977 |date=24 May 2005 }} (subscription only)</ref> [[Ukrainian President]] Viktor Yushchenko asked [[Brussels]] mid-December 2004 for a clearer indication of Ukraine's prospects for membership, saying that \"The approved Action Plan reflects only the level of Ukraine-EU relations that we could have reached before the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|presidential elections in 2004]].\"<ref>[http://www.euobserver.com/?sid=24&aid=18004 EUobserver article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050524014007/http://www.euobserver.com/?sid=24&aid=18004 |date=24 May 2005 }} (subscription only)</ref>\n\nOn 13 January 2005, the [[European Parliament]] almost unanimously (467 votes to 19 in favour) passed a [[motion (democracy)|motion]] stating the wish of the European Parliament to establish closer ties with Ukraine in view of the possibility of EU membership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+TA+P6-TA-2005-0009+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN|title=European Parliament resolution on the results of the Ukraine elections (13 January 2005)|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2017}}</ref> Though there is still a long way to go before negotiations about EU membership can start, the [[European Commission]] has stated that future EU membership will not be ruled out. Yushchenko has responded to the apathetic mood of the Commission by stating that he intends to send an application for EU membership \"in the near future\" and that he intends to scrutinise Ukraine's relationship with the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] in order to assure that EU integration is possible, and, if not, to make it possible. Several EU leaders have already stated strong support for closer economic ties with Ukraine, but have stopped short of direct support for such a bid.\n\nOn 21 March 2005, Polish Foreign Minister [[Adam Daniel Rotfeld]] noted that Poland will, in every way, promote Ukraine's desire to be integrated with the EU, achieve the status of a market-economy country, and join the [[World Trade Organization]]. He also said, \"At the present moment, we should talk concrete steps in cooperation instead of engaging in empty talk about European integration\". Three days later, a poll of the six largest EU nations conducted by a French research company showed that the European public would be more likely to accept Ukraine as a future EU member than any other country that is not currently an official candidate.\n\nIn October 2005, Commission president [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]] said that the future of Ukraine is ''in'' the EU. On 9 November 2005, however, the European Commission in a new strategy paper suggested that the current enlargement agenda ([[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatia]] and in the future the other ex-[[Yugoslavia]]n countries) could block the possibility of a future accession of Ukraine, [[Armenia]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Moldova]]. Commissioner [[Olli Rehn]] said that the EU should avoid overexpansion, adding that the current enlargement agenda is already quite full.<ref>[http://euobserver.com/9/20289 EUobserver article] (subscription only)</ref>\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian authorities, the ENP is not an adequate political instrument, since joining the EU was one of principal objectives of all governments since 1994.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} After the [[Orange Revolution]] of 2004 that brought to power [[Viktor Yushchenko]], the EU commission was very slow to react: little progress was made to put the largest European country on a path to eventual membership.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n==== Association negotiations ====\nIn March 2007, the EU and Ukraine started talks about a new \"wider agreement\", aiming at offering a legal framework for a closer economic cooperation and a better political dialogue.

Media reported that the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany were strongly opposed to including \"Ukraine is a European State\" into EU legally binding documents. This was considered a failure of Kuchma-era politician Mr. Roman Shpek, then Ukrainian ambassador to Brussels. He was replaced by Mr. A. Veselovskyy, a more experienced diplomat.\n\nA ''Joint EU\u2013Ukraine Action Plan'' was endorsed by the European Council on 21 February 2005.

According to Yushchenko, \"the agreement is half-ready, and he hopes that there will be a possibility to finalise and sign it under Swedish presidency in the EU\". He also welcomed the initiative of [[Eastern Partnership]] suggested earlier by Polish and Swedish Foreign Ministers.\n[[File:Msc 2009-Saturday, 08.30 - 11.00 Uhr-Moerk 013 Merkel Tymoshenko.jpg|thumb|left|320px|[[Angela Merkel]] ([[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor of Germany]]) in Conversation with [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] ([[Prime Minister of Ukraine]]) during the [[Munich Security Conference|45th Munich Security Conference]] (7 February 2009)]]\nOn 20\u201324 October 2008, the EU and Ukraine held a negotiation round on the free trade area chapter of the Association agreement. According to some Ukrainian media,{{Who|date=December 2013}} the \"EU promised to liberalise trade relations\". Ukraine's representative told that one must not \"focus too much\" on negotiation since there is much to be done by the Ukrainian government to meet certain criteria. He also said, that \"soon, the Balkans will enter into the European trade space and therefore Ukraine might lose these markets\". This was seen as a reason for Ukraine to move forward as least as soon as Balkans, the EU did not comment on that perception.\n\nOn 29 October 2008, the EU Commissioner Jacques Barrot and Ukrainian officials met in [[Brussels]] to launch negotiations on visa-free travel. Kiev had been asking for a \"road map\" to visa lifting, including travel document security, irregular migration, public order and foreign relations. But the EU justice commissioner avoided to give any specific dates. Moreover, the Ukrainian side argued that the 2007 visa facilitation agreement is not fully implemented by the EU member states. The European Commission representative was quoted as saying that Brussels is ready to impose sanctions against those who do not respect the agreement. Spanish, Dutch, German and Belgian embassies were cited among the most active rule breakers. Making visa processing lengthy and expensive is one of the major agreement violations. On 28 October 2008 [[List of Prime Ministers of Belgium|Belgian PM]] [[Yves Leterme]] told that Ukrainians need to avoid middlemen in visa procedures if they want to reduce their cost. The problem is that some consulates, including Belgian, oblige visa seekers to deal with a middleman.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian President Yushchenko, some embassies of EU countries often require Ukrainians to present documents, which had not been foreseen in the agreement on simplification of visa regulations. Around five per cent of Ukrainians willing to travel to the EU are denied visas, which, according to Yushchenko, \"does not meet the standards of our agreements with the EU\".<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-320724.html President requests to push improvement of Ukraine-EU visa relations], [[UNIAN]] (12 June 2009)</ref>\n\nOn 4 June 2009, some media outlets reported that Germany's [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] openly stated in its programme that Ukraine has the right for the EU membership in the long term.

Ukrainian politicians continue to insist that the implementation of that free visa regime take place by 2012, when the [[EURO 2012|European Football Championship]] will be held in Ukraine and [[Poland]]. According to Tarasyuk, the main obstacles to the implementation of a free visa regime between Ukraine and EU is the fact that Ukraine \"hasn't finished its work on legislation concerning forming a demographic [database], which then could become a good basis for issuing biometric passports\" and the fact that there is no general database on the issuing of foreign passports to Ukrainian citizens.

Indeed, Ukraine and the EU have already started the negotiations on new, enhanced political and free-trade agreements (Association and Free-Trade Agreements). Also, there has been some progress in liberalising the visa regime despite persistent problems in the EU Member States' visa approach towards Ukrainians.\n\nThat is why Ukraine has a specific view of the Eastern Partnership project.

However, Kiev pointed out that it remains pessimistic about the \"added value\" of this initiative. Indeed, Ukraine and the EU have already started the negotiations on new, enhanced political and free-trade agreements (Association and Free-Trade Agreements). Also, there has been some progress in liberalising the visa regime despite persistent problems in the EU Member States' visa approach towards Ukrainians.\n\nThat is why Ukraine has a specific view of the Eastern Partnership Project. According to the Ukrainian presidency, it should correspond, in case of his country, to the strategic foreign policy objective, i.e. the integration with the EU.<ref name=\"president.gov.ua\">http://www.president.gov.ua, 24 March 2009</ref> Yet, the Eastern Partnership documents (the European Council Declaration of May 2009)<ref name=\"consilium.europa.eu\">http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/en/er/107589.pdf</ref> do not confirm such priorities as political and economic integration or lifting visas.\n\nUkraine has expressed enthusiasm about the project.

Nevertheless, this increase didn't make Ukraine one of the EU's major trading partners. In 2007, Ukraine accounted for only 2% of EU exports and a mere 1% of European Union imports which is toward the bottom of the EU's top 20 trading partners (16th).<ref name=Eurostat>European Commission/Eurostat paper issued before 9 September EU-Ukraine summit in Paris.</ref>\n\nAccording to the European commission paper, trade with Ukraine is dominated by manufactured goods. Nearly half of the EU exports to Ukraine in 2007 were machinery and vehicles and a further quarter were other manufactured articles. A quite similar structure can be seen in imports: unspecified manufactured articles accounted for two fifths followed by a crude metal for a further fifth. At the more detailed level, the main EU exports to Ukraine in 2007 were medicine, motor vehicles and mobile phones, while the main imports were iron and steel products, as well as sunflower seed oil, ferro-nickel, iron ores and oil.<ref name=Eurostat/>\n\nAmong the EU27 Members States, Germany (5.9 bn Euro or 26% of EU exports) was the largest exporter, followed by [[Poland]] (4.1 bn or 18%).

The EU has always believed that WTO membership can play a key role in supporting Ukraine's economic reform, especially in the context of a transition economy.

That document was focused on economic and social issues as well as on the necessity of improving public government and guaranteeing free press and civil rights. The framework set for political discussions was modest: yearly meeting between EU Troika and Ukrainian leadership and some inter ministerial consultations. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1994 entered into force in 1998 and expired in 2008. The first EU-Ukraine summit took place in September 1997 in [[Kiev]].<ref name=UW28212EUU>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/73494 \"EU-Ukraine Summits: 16 Years of Wheel-Spinning\"], ''[[The Ukrainian Week]]'' (28 February 2012)</ref> During the second summit in October 1998 in [[Vienna]], Ukraine\u2013EU relations were defined as a \"strategic and unique partnership\" and Ukraine first declared its desire to acquire associate membership in the EU.<ref name=UW28212EUU /> None of top level meetings brought major changes to a reserved EU approach.

Yushchenko has responded to the apathetic mood of the Commission by stating that he intends to send an application for EU membership \"in the near future\" and that he intends to scrutinise Ukraine's relationship with the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] in order to assure that EU integration is possible, and, if not, to make it possible. Several EU leaders have already stated strong support for closer economic ties with Ukraine, but have stopped short of direct support for such a bid.\n\nOn 21 March 2005, Polish Foreign Minister [[Adam Daniel Rotfeld]] noted that Poland will, in every way, promote Ukraine's desire to be integrated with the EU, achieve the status of a market-economy country, and join the [[World Trade Organization]]. He also said, \"At the present moment, we should talk concrete steps in cooperation instead of engaging in empty talk about European integration\". Three days later, a poll of the six largest EU nations conducted by a French research company showed that the European public would be more likely to accept Ukraine as a future EU member than any other country that is not currently an official candidate.\n\nIn October 2005, Commission president [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]] said that the future of Ukraine is ''in'' the EU. On 9 November 2005, however, the European Commission in a new strategy paper suggested that the current enlargement agenda ([[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatia]] and in the future the other ex-[[Yugoslavia]]n countries) could block the possibility of a future accession of Ukraine, [[Armenia]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Moldova]]. Commissioner [[Olli Rehn]] said that the EU should avoid overexpansion, adding that the current enlargement agenda is already quite full.<ref>[http://euobserver.com/9/20289 EUobserver article] (subscription only)</ref>\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian authorities, the ENP is not an adequate political instrument, since joining the EU was one of principal objectives of all governments since 1994.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} After the [[Orange Revolution]] of 2004 that brought to power [[Viktor Yushchenko]], the EU commission was very slow to react: little progress was made to put the largest European country on a path to eventual membership.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n==== Association negotiations ====\nIn March 2007, the EU and Ukraine started talks about a new \"wider agreement\", aiming at offering a legal framework for a closer economic cooperation and a better political dialogue.

Media reported that the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany were strongly opposed to including \"Ukraine is a European State\" into EU legally binding documents. This was considered a failure of Kuchma-era politician Mr. Roman Shpek, then Ukrainian ambassador to Brussels. He was replaced by Mr. A.

According to some Ukrainian media,{{Who|date=December 2013}} the \"EU promised to liberalise trade relations\". Ukraine's representative told that one must not \"focus too much\" on negotiation since there is much to be done by the Ukrainian government to meet certain criteria. He also said, that \"soon, the Balkans will enter into the European trade space and therefore Ukraine might lose these markets\". This was seen as a reason for Ukraine to move forward as least as soon as Balkans, the EU did not comment on that perception.\n\nOn 29 October 2008, the EU Commissioner Jacques Barrot and Ukrainian officials met in [[Brussels]] to launch negotiations on visa-free travel. Kiev had been asking for a \"road map\" to visa lifting, including travel document security, irregular migration, public order and foreign relations. But the EU justice commissioner avoided to give any specific dates. Moreover, the Ukrainian side argued that the 2007 visa facilitation agreement is not fully implemented by the EU member states. The European Commission representative was quoted as saying that Brussels is ready to impose sanctions against those who do not respect the agreement. Spanish, Dutch, German and Belgian embassies were cited among the most active rule breakers. Making visa processing lengthy and expensive is one of the major agreement violations. On 28 October 2008 [[List of Prime Ministers of Belgium|Belgian PM]] [[Yves Leterme]] told that Ukrainians need to avoid middlemen in visa procedures if they want to reduce their cost. The problem is that some consulates, including Belgian, oblige visa seekers to deal with a middleman.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian President Yushchenko, some embassies of EU countries often require Ukrainians to present documents, which had not been foreseen in the agreement on simplification of visa regulations. Around five per cent of Ukrainians willing to travel to the EU are denied visas, which, according to Yushchenko, \"does not meet the standards of our agreements with the EU\".<ref>[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-320724.html President requests to push improvement of Ukraine-EU visa relations], [[UNIAN]] (12 June 2009)</ref>\n\nOn 4 June 2009, some media outlets reported that Germany's [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] openly stated in its programme that Ukraine has the right for the EU membership in the long term.

Ukrainian politicians continue to insist that the implementation of that free visa regime take place by 2012, when the [[EURO 2012|European Football Championship]] will be held in Ukraine and [[Poland]]. According to Tarasyuk, the main obstacles to the implementation of a free visa regime between Ukraine and EU is the fact that Ukraine \"hasn't finished its work on legislation concerning forming a demographic [database], which then could become a good basis for issuing biometric passports\" and the fact that there is no general database on the issuing of foreign passports to Ukrainian citizens.

Also, there has been some progress in liberalising the visa regime despite persistent problems in the EU Member States' visa approach towards Ukrainians.\n\nThat is why Ukraine has a specific view of the Eastern Partnership project.

The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1994 entered into force in 1998 and expired in 2008. None of the top level meetings brought any major changes to a reserved EU approach.

It was based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of 1994 and provided, according to the European Commission, a comprehensive and ambitious framework for joint work with Ukraine in all key areas of reform.\n\n==== Eastern Partnership (EaP) ====\n{{main|Eastern Partnership}}\n\nThe Eastern Partnership is a forum aiming to improve the political and economic trade-relations of the six [[Post-Soviet states]] of \"strategic importance\" \u2013 [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] with the [[European Union]].<ref name=\"EU funds\">[http://euobserver.com/9/27824  EU assigns funds and staff to 'Eastern Partnership'], ''[[EU Observer]]'', 20 March 2009</ref> The EU draft of the EaP states that: \"Shared values including democracy, the [[rule of law]], and respect for human rights will be at its core, as well as the principles of [[market economy]], [[sustainable development]] and [[good governance]].\" The Partnership is to provide the foundation for new Association Agreements between the EU and those partners who have made sufficient progress towards the principles and values mentioned.<ref name=\"EaP core\">[http://euobserver.com/24/27799 \"Values to form core of EU 'Eastern Partnership'\"], ''[[EU Observer]]'', 18 March 2009</ref>\n\nUkraine is one of six post-Soviet nations to be invited to cooperate with the EU within the new multilateral framework that the Eastern partnership is expected to establish. However, Kiev pointed out that it remains pessimistic about the \"added value\" of this initiative. Indeed, Ukraine and the EU have already started the negotiations on new, enhanced political and free-trade agreements (Association and Free-Trade Agreements). Also, there has been some progress in liberalising the visa regime despite persistent problems in the EU Member States' visa approach towards Ukrainians.\n\nThat is why Ukraine has a specific view of the Eastern Partnership Project. According to the Ukrainian presidency, it should correspond, in case of his country, to the strategic foreign policy objective, i.e. the integration with the EU.<ref name=\"president.gov.ua\">http://www.president.gov.ua, 24 March 2009</ref> Yet, the Eastern Partnership documents (the European Council Declaration of May 2009)<ref name=\"consilium.europa.eu\">http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/en/er/107589.pdf</ref> do not confirm such priorities as political and economic integration or lifting visas.\n\nUkraine has expressed enthusiasm about the project. Ukraine deputy premier [[Hryhoriy Nemyria]] said that the project is the way to modernise the country and that they welcome the Eastern Partnership policy, because it uses 'de facto' the same instruments as for [[Future enlargement of the European Union|EU candidates]].<ref name=\"more influ\" />\n\nUnder the Eastern Partnership, [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]] have reached a new agreement replacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30&nbsp;km of the border.

The Treaty establishing the Energy Community was signed in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], on 25 October 2005, and entered into force on 1 July 2006. Ukraine soon expressed its interest in full membership. Mandated by the Energy Community Ministerial Council, the [[European Commission]] had the first round of formal negotiations with Ukraine in late 2008. After three negotiation rounds, the technical negotiations with Ukraine were concluded in 2009. The Ministerial Council, however, made the membership conditional on legislative amendments.

Nevertheless, this increase didn't make Ukraine one of the EU's major trading partners. In 2007, Ukraine accounted for only 2% of EU exports and a mere 1% of European Union imports which is toward the bottom of the EU's top 20 trading partners (16th).<ref name=Eurostat>European Commission/Eurostat paper issued before 9 September EU-Ukraine summit in Paris.</ref>\n\nAccording to the European commission paper, trade with Ukraine is dominated by manufactured goods. Nearly half of the EU exports to Ukraine in 2007 were machinery and vehicles and a further quarter were other manufactured articles. A quite similar structure can be seen in imports: unspecified manufactured articles accounted for two fifths followed by a crude metal for a further fifth. At the more detailed level, the main EU exports to Ukraine in 2007 were medicine, motor vehicles and mobile phones, while the main imports were iron and steel products, as well as sunflower seed oil, ferro-nickel, iron ores and oil.<ref name=Eurostat/>\n\nAmong the EU27 Members States, Germany (5.9 bn Euro or 26% of EU exports) was the largest exporter, followed by [[Poland]] (4.1 bn or 18%). Italy (2.4 bn or 19%) was the largest importer followed by [[Bulgaria]] (1.6 bn or 13%) and Germany (1.3 bn or 11%).<ref name=Eurostat/>\n\nThe largest surpluses in trade with Ukraine in 2007 were observed in Germany (+ 4.6 bn Euro) and [[Poland]] (+2.8 bn Euro) while [[Bulgaria]] scored the highest deficit ( -1.4 bn Euro).<ref name=Eurostat/>\n\n=== EU Financial Assistance to Ukraine ===\n{{main|Third-country economic relationships with the European Union}}\nFor the 2000\u20132006 budgetary period, the financial assistance of the EU to Ukraine was framed in the '''TACIS''' programme, established in 1991, a programme of technical assistance that supports the process of transition to [[market economy|market economies]] for the 11 [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].\n\nFor the 2007\u20132013 budgetary period, '''ENPI''', standing for \"European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument\", covers the ENP countries, and replacing the TACIS funds for Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enpi-info.eu/index.php?lang_id=450|title=ENPI Info Centre|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref> Ukraine is moreover eligible for horizontal instruments, that cover countries regardless of their region, such as:\n* the '''[[Instrument for Stability]]''', a new instrument to tackle crises and instability in third countries and address trans-border challenges including [[nuclear safety]] and non-proliferation, the fight against trafficking, organised crime and terrorism;\n* the '''[[Macroeconomics|Macro Financial]] Assistance'''\n\n=== WTO membership of Ukraine (2009) ===\nSince 2009, with the accession of [[Ukraine]] to the [[World Trade Organization]], economic relations between the EU and Ukraine have to respect the WTO normative acquis. The EU has always believed that WTO membership can play a key role in supporting Ukraine's economic reform, especially in the context of a transition economy. In joining the WTO, Ukraine benefits from secure access to the markets of all WTO members and commits to providing the kind of stable trade and investment environment that will attract further trade

In July 1991, he made another historic statement in [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]]: \"Here we will build a great Serbian state, with the border on the left shore of [[Neretva]] and [[Dubrovnik]] as the capital\"<ref name=vreme/>\n\nSubsequently, he was installed as head of State security department of the Federal Ministry of Interior, and (almost secretly) as assistant to Federal Minister of Interior [[Petar Gra\u010danin]] (1992\u201393).<ref name=glas/> Prime Minister [[Milan Pani\u0107]] sacked him after an incident at the London Conference, when it was discovered that he induced [[Vladislav Jovanovi\u0107]] to carry a secret [[Covert listening device|listening device]], and that he was listening on the other end.<ref name=vreme>{{cite web|title=\u010cudesni svet Bracike Kertesa|url=http://www.vreme.com/arhiva_html/520/12.html|publisher=[[Vreme]]|date=2000-12-20|accessdate=2007-09-07| language=Serbian}}</ref> He was linked with formation of [[Serbian paramilitary]] units in Croatia (especially in [[SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia|eastern Slavonia]]) and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Dobbs|2000}}\n\nKertes's reached the ultimate and the most lucrative peak of the career when he was appointed the head of Yugoslav Customs Office in 1993, the post that he will hold up to 2000. That position allowed him to impose whatever tax was necessary on the goods, and the customs duties functioned as a state budget in shadow. They were a financial source for a vast range of operations, from funding the paramilitary units in wars of Croatia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], across money laundering in foreign off-shore banks, to natural filling of private pockets of people close to Milo\u0161evi\u0107.{{sfn|Dobbs|2000}} He had Milo\u0161evi\u0107's trust throughout his tenure.<ref name=vreme/> Corruption, nepotism, smuggling and money extortion took over in the service.

Apart from his (self-confessed) love to [[fishing|fish]] using the net and dynamite, he is also remembered for driving an armored limousine to his mother's house through the town. He had the power to sack whoever he didn't like, and provide benefits to loyals.

Other items found in the suite included [[US$]]&nbsp;1.3 million in various currencies, 18&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|pound]] of drugs, about 50 pieces of weapons, and 10 bulletproof luxury cars. After the brief detention, Kertes was permitted to leave the office, but subsequently faced various charges.{{sfn|Dobbs|2000}}\n\nAfter two retrials, in February 2007, Kertes was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for providing the truck to [[Special Operations Unit (Serbia)|executioners]] of opposition politicians, in the 1999 [[Ibarska magistrala assassination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/06/29/news/serbs.php|title=Milosevic commander convicted in '99 attack|publisher=International Herald Tribune|date=2007-02-16}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2007, he faced trial for abuse of office and [[embezzlement]].
