{"title_page": "Sustainable city", "text_new": "{{short description|city designed with consideration for social, economic, environmental impact}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2019}}\n'''Sustainable cities''', '''urban sustainability''', or '''eco-city''' (also \"ecocity\") is a pee pee poo poocity designed with consideration for [[Sustainability|social, economic, environmental impact]] (commonly referred to as the [[triple bottom line]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibrc.indiana.edu/ibr/2011/spring/article2.html|title=The Triple Bottom Line: What Is It and How Does It Work?|website=www.ibrc.indiana.edu|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>), and resilient habitat for existing populations, without compromising the ability of future generations to experience the same. These cities are inhabited by people whom are dedicated towards minimizing required inputs of energy, water, food, [[waste]], output of heat, [[air pollution]] - {{CO2|link=yes}}, [[methane]], and [[water pollution]]. Richard Register first coined the term \"''ecocity''\" in his 1987 book ''Ecocity Berkeley: Building Cities for a Healthy Future,'' where he offers innovative city planning solutions that would work anywhere.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ecocity_Berkeley.html?id=QYE-Q8MAF3MC|title=Ecocity Berkeley: Building Cities for a Healthy Future|last=Register|first=Richard|date=1987|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=9781556430091|language=en}}</ref> Other leading figures who envisioned the sustainable city are [[architect]] [[Paul F Downton]], who later founded the company Ecopolis Pty Ltd, as well as authors [[Timothy Beatley]] and [[Steffen Lehmann]], who have written extensively on the subject. The field of [[industrial ecology]] is sometimes used in planning these cities.\n\nThere remains no completely agreed upon definition for what a sustainable city should be or completely agreed upon paradigm for what components should be included. Generally, developmental experts agree that a sustainable city should meet the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The ambiguity within this idea leads to a great deal of variation in terms of how cities carry out their attempts to become sustainable.\n\nIdeally, a sustainable city creates an enduring way of life across the four domains of [[ecology]], [[economics]], [[politics]] and [[culture]]. Goals of a sustainable city are to be able to feed itself with a sustainable reliance on the surrounding natural environment and have the ability to power itself with [[Renewable energy|renewable sources of energy]]. The central focus of this topic is to create the smallest conceivable [[ecological footprint]] while also producing the lowest quantity of [[pollution]] achievable. All of this is to be accomplished by efficiently using the land in ways such as [[compost]]ing used materials, [[recycling]], and/or converting [[waste-to-energy]]. The idea is that these contributions will lead to a decrease of the city's impact on [[climate change]]. The Adelaide City Council<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/?204334/Adelaide-green-city|title=Adelaide green city {{!}} WWF|website=wwf.panda.org|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> states that socially sustainable cities should be equitable, diverse, connected, democratic, and provide a good quality of life.\n\nToday, 55% of the world is estimated to be living in [[urban area]]s and the [[United Nations]] estimates that by the year 2050, that number will rise to 68%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html|title=68% of the world population projected to live in urban areas by 2050, says UN|date=2018-05-16|website=UN DESA {{!}} United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> These large communities provide both challenges and opportunities for [[environmentally-conscious]] developers. There are distinct advantages to further defining and working towards the goals of sustainable cities. Humans are social creatures and thrive in urban spaces that foster social connections. [[Richard Florida]], an urban studies theorist, focuses on the social impact of sustainable cities and states that cities need to be more than a competitive business climate; they need to be a great people climate that appeals to individuals and families of all types. Because of this, a shift to more dense, urban living would provide an outlet for social interaction and conditions under which humans can prosper. These types of urban areas would also promote the use of public transit, walkability and biking which would benefit citizens health wise but also be environmentally beneficial.\n\n==Practical achievement==\nThese ecological cities are achieved through various means, such as:\n*Different [[Agriculture|agricultural systems]] such as agricultural plots within the city ([[suburbs]] or [[City center|centre]]).<!-- British form of 'center' --> This reduces the distance food has to travel from [[food miles|field to fork]]. Practical work out of this may be done by either small scale/private farming plots or through larger scale agriculture (e.g. [[Vertical farming|farmscrapers]]).\n*[[Renewable energy]] sources, such as [[wind turbines]], [[solar panel]]s, or [[bio-gas]] created from [[sewage]]. Cities provide [[economies of scale]] that make such energy sources viable. \n*Various methods to reduce the need for [[air conditioning]] (a massive energy demand), such as planting trees and lightening surface colors, [[Natural ventilation|natural ventilation systems]], an increase in water features, and green spaces equaling at least 20% of the city's surface. These measures counter the \"[[heat island effect]]\" caused by an abundance of tarmac and asphalt, which can make urban areas several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas&mdash;as much as six degrees Celsius during the evening.\n*Improved [[public transport]] and an increase in pedestrianization to reduce car emissions. This requires a radically different approach to city planning, with integrated business, industrial, and residential zones. Roads may be designed to make driving difficult.\n*Optimal building density to make public transport viable but avoid the creation of [[urban heat island]]s.\n*Solutions to decrease [[urban sprawl]], by seeking new ways of allowing people to live closer to the workspace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.perc.org/2012/03/22/how-can-cities-reverse-urban-sprawl-increase-transit-use-reduce-emissions/|title=How Can Cities Reverse Urban Sprawl, Increase Transit Use, Reduce Emissions?|date=2012-03-22|website=PERC|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Since the workplace tends to be in the city, downtown, or urban center, they are seeking a way to increase density by changing the antiquated attitudes many suburbanites have towards inner-city areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/10/what-neighborhood-revitalization-actually-looks/3627/|title=This Is What a Neighborhood Revitalization Actually Looks Like|last=Benfield|first=Kaid|website=CityLab|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> One of the new ways to achieve this is by solutions worked out by the [[Smart Growth]] Movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n*[[Green roof]]s alter the surface energy balance and can help mitigate the urban heat island effect. Incorporating [[Green roof|eco roofs]] or green roofs in your design will help with air quality, climate and water runoff.\n*[[Zero-emission transport]]\n*[[Zero-energy building]]\n*[[Sustainable urban drainage systems]] or SUDS\n*[[Energy conservation|energy conservation systems/devices]]\n*[[Xeriscaping]] - garden and landscape design for water conservation\n*[[Sustainable transport]], incorporates five elements: fuel economy, occupancy, electrification, pedal power, and urbanization.\n*[[Key Performance Indicator]]s - development and operational management tool providing guidance and M&V for city administrators\n*Sustainable Sites Initiative or SSI,Voluntary national guidelines and performance benchmarks for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices. Key areas of focus are soil, vegetation, hydrology, materials, and human health and well being.\n*Increase of [[Cycling infrastructure]] would increase cycling within cities and reduce the number of cars being driven and in turn reduce car emissions. This would also benefit the health of citizens as they would be able to get more exercise through cycling.\n*Educating residents of cities about the positive impacts of living in a more sustainable city and why it is important would increase the initiative to have sustainable developments and push people to live in a more sustainable way.\n\n== Architecture ==\nBuildings provide the infrastructure for a functioning city and allow for many opportunities to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. A commitment to sustainable architecture encompasses all phases of building including the planning, building, and restructuring. Sustainable Site Initiatives is used by landscape architects, designers, engineers, architects, developers, policy-makers and others to align land development and management with innovative sustainable design.\n\n=== Eco-industrial park ===\nThe purpose of an eco-industrial park is to connect a number of firms and organizations to work together to decrease their environmental impact while simultaneously improving their economic performance. The community of businesses accomplishes this goal through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues, such as energy, water, and materials. The components for building an eco-industrial park include natural systems, more efficient use of energy, and more efficient material and water flows Industrial parks should be built to fit into their natural settings in order to reduce environmental impacts, which can be accomplished through plant design, landscaping, and choice of materials. For instance, there is an industrial park in Michigan built by Phoenix Designs that is made almost entirely from recycled materials. The landscaping of the building will include native trees, grasses, and flowers, and the landscaping design will also act as climate shelter for the facility. In choosing the materials for building an eco-industrial park, designers must consider the life-cycle analysis of each medium that goes into the building to assess their true impact on the environment and to ensure that they are using it from one plant to another, steam connections from firms to provide heating for homes in the area, and using renewable energy such as wind and solar power. In terms of material flows, the companies in an eco-industrial park may have common waste treatment facilities, a means for transporting by-products from one plant to another, or anchoring the park around [[resource recovery]] companies that are recruited to the location or started from scratch. To create more efficient water flows in industrial parks, the processed water from one plant can be reused by another plant and the parks infrastructure can include a way to collect and reuse storm water runoff.\n\n==== Example ====\n\n===== Recycled Park in Rotterdam, The Netherlands =====\nThe Recycled Park in Rotterdam, the second-largest city in the Netherlands, is an initiative introduced by Recycled Island Foundation, a Netherlands-based organization focused on recycling littered waste via creating their iconic island-parks, among other sustainable projects. Rotterdam's Recycled Park is a cluster of floating, green hexagonal \u201cislands\u201d composed of reused litter. The group has utilized a system of passive litter traps<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.recycledisland.com/litter-traps|title=Litter traps|website=Recycled Island|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> to collect this litter from the Maas River. The park's location upon the Maas River reflects a circular process aimed at creating a more sustainable city.\n\nOn the underside of the recycled park are materials which will support the growth of plants and wildlife indigenous to the area. This interest in growing the biodiversity of Rotterdam's natural elements is also reflected in other cities. Chicago's Urban Rivers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbanriv.org/the-wild-mile|title=Home|website=Urban Rivers|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> organization is similarly trying to solve this issue by building and growing the Wild Mile of floating parks and forests along the [[Chicago River]] with the goal of [[revegetation]]. Both Urban Rivers\u2019 and Recycled Island Foundation's interest in improving the area's biodiversity reflects an interest in greening the built urbanism of the surrounding city.\n\nRotterdam's Recycled Park may suggest a greater trend in creating floating structures in response to greater climate-change-motivated impacts. The Floating Farm<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/architecture/floating-farm-rotterdam-cows-05-15-2019/|title=world's first floating farm welcomes cows in rotterdam|date=2019-05-15|website=designboom {{!}} architecture & design magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> in Rotterdam sustainably approaches food production and transport. Other floating structures include renewable energy-powered houseboats<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/architecture/plus-31-architects-floating-houseboat-solar-power-naturecruiser-03-13-2019/|title=+31architects' floating houseboat uses solar power to sail across lakes and rivers|date=2019-03-13|website=designboom {{!}} architecture & design magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> and luxury residences some 800 meters from the coast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/architecture/wojciech-morsztyn-ocean-community-vessel-rising-sea-levels-luxury-houseboats-11-07-2019/|title=the 'ocean community' responds to rising sea levels with luxury houseboats|date=2019-11-07|website=designboom {{!}} architecture & design magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> The Dutch city of Amsterdam likewise boasts a neighborhood of artificial, floating islands in the suburb of [[IJburg]].\n\nThe idea of expanding both commercial enterprise and residential developments onto the water is oftentimes reflective of the demand to limit land-usage in urban areas. This has various, wide-reaching environmental impacts: reducing the aggregation of the [[Urban heat island|urban heat-island effect]], the zoning efforts expended on engineering and regulating the [[floodplain]] (and potentially, the capacity of [[Wastewater|waste-water reservoirs]]), and reduce the demands of the [[automobility]] state.\n\nThe Recycled Park is a holistic approach to limiting the expense of waste. The employment of greenery has air-purifying effects, to reduce pollution. Additionally, the modular, hexagonal design allows reconstruction of each \u201cisland;\u201d this space thus also offers environmental sustainability, as well as an open space for community-growing and other social opportunities.\n\n=== Urban farming ===\n{{See also|Urban Agriculture}}\n\n[[Urban farming]] is the process of growing and distributing food, as well as raising animals, in and around a city or in urban area. According to the RUAF Foundation, urban farming is different from rural agriculture because it is integrated into the urban economic and ecological system: urban agriculture is embedded in and interacting with the urban ecosystem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ruaf.org/|title=The RUAF Foundation|website=The RUAF Foundation|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> Such linkages include the use of urban residents as laborers; use of typical urban resources (such as utilizing organic waste as compost or urban wastewater for irrigation); direct links with urban consumers; direct impacts on urban ecology (positive and negative); being part of the urban food system; competing for land with other urban functions; being influenced by urban policies and plans. One motivation for urban agriculture in sustainable cites includes saving energy that would be used in food transportation. In order for urban farming to be a successful method of sustainable food growth, cities must allot a common area for community gardens or farms, as well as a common area for a farmers market in which the foodstuffs grown within the city can be sold to the residents of the urban system.\n\n=== New Urbanism ===\nThe most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism is known as the Charter of [[New Urbanism]]. It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the [[built environment]] to create and preserve smart cities which support [[sustainable transport]]. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in [[Urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs. The concept of [[circular flow land use management]] has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl.\n\n[[Sustainable architecture]], a recent movement of [[New Classical Architecture]], promotes a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], walkability, [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular tradition]], and [[Classical architecture|classical design]]. This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture and opposes solitary [[housing estate]]s and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s.\n\n=== Individual buildings (LEED) ===\n{{Main|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design}}\n\nThe Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System\u00ae encourages and accelerates global adoption of sustainable green building and development practices through the creation and implementation of universally understood and accepted tools and performance criteria.\n\nLEED, or [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]], is an internationally recognized [[green building]] certification system. LEED recognizes whole building sustainable design by identifying key areas of excellence including: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, Locations & Linkages, Awareness and Education, Innovation in Design, Regional Priority. In order for a building to become LEED certified sustainability needs to be prioritized in design, construction, and use. One example of sustainable design would be including a [[certified wood]] like bamboo. Bamboo is fast growing and has an incredible replacement rate after being harvested. By far the most credits are rewarded for optimizing energy performance. This promotes innovative thinking about alternative forms of energy and encourages increased efficiency.\n\n=== Sustainable Sites Initiative (SSI) ===\nSustainable Sites Initiative, a combined effort of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at The [[University of Texas at Austin]], and the [[United States Botanic Garden]], is a voluntary national guideline and performance benchmark for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices. The building principles of SSI are to design with nature and culture, use a decision-making hierarchy of preservation, conservation, and regeneration, use a system thinking approach, provide regenerative systems, support a living process, use a collaborative and ethical approach, maintain integrity in leadership and research, and finally foster [[environmental stewardship]]. All of these help promote solutions to common environmental issues such as [[greenhouse gas]]es, [[urban climate]] issues, [[water pollution]] and waste, [[energy consumption]], and health and wellbeing of site users. The main focus is hydrology, soils, vegetation, materials, and human health and well being.\n\nIn SSI, the main goal for [[hydrology]] in sites is to protect and restore existing hydrologic functions. To design storm water features to be accessible to site users, and manage and clean water on site. For site design of [[soil]] and [[vegetation]]<nowiki/>many steps can be done during the construction process to help minimize the [[urban heat island]] effects, to and minimize the building heating requirements by using plants.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Energy Efficiency of different Transport Modes.png|thumb]]\nAs major focus of the sustainable cities, [[sustainable transportation]] attempts to reduce a city's reliance and use of greenhouse emitting gases by utilizing eco friendly [[urban planning]], low environmental impact vehicles, and residential proximity to create an urban center that has greater environmental responsibility and [[social equity]].\n\nDue to the significant impact that transportation services have on a city's energy consumption, the last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on sustainable transportation by developmental experts. Currently, transportation systems account for nearly a quarter of the world's energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission. In order to reduce the environmental impact caused by transportation in metropolitan areas, sustainable transportation has three widely agreed upon pillars that it utilizes to create more healthy and productive urban centers.\n\nThe [[Carbon Trust]] states that there are three main ways cities can innovate to make transport more sustainable without increasing journey times - better land use planning, modal shift to encourage people to choose more efficient forms of transport, and making existing transport modes more efficient.\n\n=== Car free city ===\nThe concept of [[Carfree city|car free cities]] or a city with large [[pedestrian area]]s is often part of the design of a sustainable city. A large part of the [[carbon footprint]] of a city is generated by cars so the car free concept is often considered an integral part of the design of a sustainable city.\n\n=== Emphasis on proximity ===\nCreated by eco friendly urban planning, the concept of urban proximity is an essential element of current and future sustainable transportation systems. This requires that cities be built and added onto with appropriate population and landmark density so that destinations are reached with reduced time in transit. This reduced time in transit allows for reduced fuel expenditure and also opens the door to alternative means of transportation such as bike riding and walking.\nTransportation in downtown [[Chicago]]\nFurthermore, close proximity of residents and major landmarks allows for the creation of efficient public transportation by eliminating long sprawled out routes and reducing commute time. This in turn decreases the social cost to residents who choose to live in these cities by allowing them more time with families and friends instead by eliminating part of their commute time.\n\nSee also: [[Compact city]] and [[Pocket neighborhood]]\n\n=== Diversity in modes of transportation ===\nSustainable transportation emphasizes the use of a diversity of [[fuel-efficient]] transportation vehicles in order to reduce greenhouse emissions and diversity fuel demand. Due to the increasingly expensive and volatile cost of energy, this strategy has become very important because it allows a way for city residents to be less susceptible to varying highs and lows in various energy prices.\n\nAmong the different [[modes of transport]]ation, the use alternative energy cars and widespread installation of refueling stations has gained increasing importance, while the creation of centralized [[Bike path|bike]] and [[walking path]]s remains a staple of the sustainable transportation movement.\n\n=== Access to transportation ===\nIn order to maintain the aspect of [[social responsibility]] inherent within the concept of sustainable cities, implementing [[sustainable transportation]] must include access to transportation by all levels of society. Due to the fact that car and fuel cost are often too expensive for lower income urban residents, completing this aspect often revolves around efficient and accessible public transportation.\n\nIn order to make public transportation more accessible, the cost of rides must be affordable and stations must be located no more than walking distance in each part of the city. As studies have shown, this accessibility creates a great increase in social and productive opportunity for city residents. By allowing lower income residents cheap and available transportation, it allows for individuals to seek employment opportunities all over the urban center rather than simply the area in which they live. This in turn reduces unemployment and a number of associated social problems such as crime, drug use, and violence.\n\n== Urban strategic planning ==\nAlthough there is not an international policy regarding sustainable cities and there are not established international standards, there is an organization, the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG) that is working to establish universal urban strategic guidelines. The UCLG a democratic and decentralized structure that operates in Africa, Asia, Eurasia, Europe, Latin America, North America, Middle East, West Asian and a Metropolitan section work to promote a more sustainable society. The 60 members of the UCLG committee evaluate urban development strategies and debate these experiences to make the best recommendations. Additionally, the UCLG accounts for differences in regional and national context. All the organizations are making a great effort to promote this concept by media and internet, and in conferences and workshops. An International conference was held in Italy at Universit\u00e0 del Salento and Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Basilicata, called 'Green Urbanism', from 12\u201314 October 2016.\n\n=== Development ===\nRecently, local and national governments and regional bodies such as the European Union have recognized the need for a holistic understanding of [[urban planning]]. This is instrumental to establishing an international policy that focuses on cities challenges and the role of the local authorities responses. Generally, in terms of urban planning, the responsibility of local governments are limited to [[land use]] and infrastructure provision excluding inclusive urban development strategies. The advantages of urban strategic planning include an increase in governance and cooperation that aids local governments in establishing performance based-management, clearly identifying the challenges facing local community and more effectively responding on a local level rather than national level, and improves institutional responses and local decision making. Additionally, it increases dialogue between stakeholders and develops consensus-based solutions, establishing continuity between sustainability plans and change in local government; it places environmental issues as the priority for the sustainable development of cities and serves as a platform to develop concepts and new models of housing, energy and mobility.\n\n=== Obstacles ===\nThe City Development Strategies (CDS) addresses new challenges and provides space for innovative policies that involves all stakeholders. The inequality in spatial development and socio-economic classes paired with concerns of [[poverty reduction]] and [[climate change]] are factors in achieving global sustainable cities. According to the [[UCLG]] there are differences between regional and national conditions, framework and practice that are overcome in the international commitment to communication and negotiation with other governments, communities and the private sector to continue to develop through innovative and participatory approaches in strategic decisions, building consensus and monitoring performance management and raising investment.\n\n=== Social factors of sustainable cities ===\nAccording to [[UN Habitat]], around half of the world's population is concentrated in cities, which is set to rise to 60% within a couple decades. The UCLG has specifically identified 13 global challenges to establishing sustainable cities: demographic change and migration, globalisation of the job market, poverty and unmet Millennium Development Goals, segregation, spatial patterns and urban growth, metropolisation and the rise of urban regions, more political power for local authorities, new actors for developing a city and providing services, decline in public funding for development, the environment and climate change, new and accessible building technologies, preparing for uncertainty and limits of growth and global communications and partnerships.\n\n==Examples==\n===Australia===\n\n==== Adelaide ====\n'''Urban forests'''\n\nIn [[Adelaide]], South Australia (a city of 1.3 million people) Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area. The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days. Sites include parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses and coastline. Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity. Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C02 a year. He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss.\n\n'''Solar power'''\n\nThe Rann government also launched an initiative for Adelaide to lead Australia in the take-up of solar power. In addition to Australia's first 'feed-in' tariff to stimulate the purchase of solar panels for domestic roofs, the government committed millions of dollars to place arrays of solar panels on the roofs of public buildings such as the museum, art gallery, Parliament, Adelaide Airport, 200 schools and Australia's biggest rooftop array on the roof of Adelaide Showgrounds' convention hall which was registered as a power station.\n\n'''Wind power'''\n\nSouth Australia went from zero wind power in 2002 to wind power, making up 26% of its electricity generation by October 2011. In the five years preceding 2011 there was a 15% drop in emissions, despite strong economic growth.\n\n'''Waste recycling'''\n\nFor Adelaide the South Australian government also embraced a Zero Waste recycling strategy, achieving a recycling rate of nearly 80% by 2011 with 4.3 million tonnes of materials diverted from landfill to recycling. On a per capita basis this was the best result in Australia, the equivalent of preventing more than a million tonnes of C02 entering the atmosphere. In the 1970s container deposit legislation was introduced. Consumers are paid a 10 cent rebate on each bottle, can, or container they return to recycling. In 2009 non-reusable plastic bags used in supermarket checkouts were banned by the Rann Government, preventing 400 million plastic bags per year entering the litter stream. In 2010 Zero Waste SA was commended by a UN Habitat Report entitled 'Solid Waste Management in the World Cities'.\n\n[[Melbourne]]\n\n* [[City of Moreland]]. The City of Moreland in Melbourne's north, has programs for becoming carbon neutral, one of which is '[https://web.archive.org/web/20160407004537/http://www.morelandsolarcity.org.au/ Zero Carbon Moreland]', amongst other existing sustainable implementations and proposals.\n* [[City of Melbourne]].

This is being done as part of an initiative to create a Green Special Economic Zone, where it is intended that as many as 20 research and development centers will be built focusing on renewable energy and clean technology, creating up to 300,000 new green jobs.\n\nThe Federal Department of Town and Country Planning (FDTCP) in peninsular Malaysia is a focal point for the implementation of the Malaysian Urban Rural National Indicators Network for Sustainable Development (MURNInets)MURNInets includes 36 sets of compulsory indicators grouped under 21 themes under six dimensions. Most of the targets and standards for the selected indicators were adjusted according to hierarchy of local authorities. In MURNInets at least three main new features are introduced. These include the Happiness Index, an indicator under the quality of life theme to meet the current development trend that emphasizes on the well-being of the community. Another feature introduced is the customer or people satisfaction level towards local authorities' services. Through the introduction of these indicators the bottom-up approach in measuring sustainability is adopted.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nThe city of [[Waitakere]], the Western part of the greater [[Auckland]] urban region, was [[New Zealand]]'s first eco-city, working from the Greenprint, a guiding document that the City Council developed in the early 1990s.\n\n=== Philippines ===\n[[Clark Freeport Zone]] is a former United States Air Force base in the Philippines. It is located on the northwest side of Angeles City and on the west side of Mabalacat City in the province of Pampanga, about 40 miles (60&nbsp;km) northwest of Metro Manila. A multi-billion project will convert the 36,000 hectare former Clark Air Force Base into a mix of industrial, commercial and institutional areas of green environment. The heart of the project is a 9,450-hectare metropolis dubbed as the \"[[Clark Green City]]\". Builders will use the green building system for environmentally-friendly structures. Its facilities will tap renewable energy such as solar and hydro power.\n\n=== Portugal ===\nThe organization Living PlanIT is currently constructing a city from scratch near Porto, Portugal. Buildings will be electronically connected to vehicles giving the user a sense of personal eco-friendliness.\n\n=== Spain ===\n\n* [[Bilbao]]: The city faced economic turmoil following the decline of the steel and port industries but through communication between stakeholders and authorities to create inner-city transformation, the local government benefited from the increase in land value in old port areas. The Strategic Plan for the Revitalisation of Metropolitan Bibao was launched in 1922 and have flourished regenerating old steel and port industries. The conversion from depleted steel and port industries to one of Europe's most flourishing markets is a prime example of a sustainable project in action.\n* [[Barcelona]]: The city is planning an urban redesign of civic super blocks, they plan to convert nine-block areas into unified mega block neighbourhoods. The aim is to decrease car related traffic, noise and pollution by over 20% and to free up to 60% of road areas for reuse as citizen spaces. This is being done because they realized that people in Barcelona die prematurely due to poor air quality and everyday noise levels are deemed harmful. By converting roads to spaces for festivals, farmer markets, bikes, and walkability it promotes a healthier lifestyle and potentially a happier one.\n\n=== Sweden ===\n\n* Norra \u00c4lvstranden (Swedish), in [[Gothenburg]] by the river [[G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv]], is an example of a sustainable city in Sweden.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup> It has low environmental impact, and contains passive houses, recycling system for waste, etc.\n* [[Hammarby Sj\u00f6stad]]<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n* V\u00e4stra Hamnen or [[Bo01]], Malm\u00f6<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n* Stockholm Royal Seaport\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\n\n* [[Masdar City]], [[Abu Dhabi]] is a planned city that relies entirely on solar energy and other renewable energy sources, with a sustainable, zero-carbon, zero-waste ecology.\n* [[Dubai The Sustainable City]], [[Dubai]]\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\n* [[London Borough of Sutton]] is the first One Planet Region in the United Kingdom, with significant targets for reducing the ecological footprint of residents and creating the UK's greenest borough.\n* [[Middlesbrough]] is another One Planet Region in the United Kingdom.\n* [[St Davids]], the smallest city in the United Kingdom, aims to be the first carbon neutral city in the world.\n* [[Leicester]] is the United Kingdom's first environment city.\n\n===United States===\n* [[Arcosanti]], Arizona\n* [[Treasure Island development|Treasure Island]], San Francisco: is another project that aims to create a small eco city.\n*[[Coyote Springs, Nevada|Coyote Springs]] Nevada largest planned city in the [[United States]].\n*[[Babcock Ranch Florida|Babcock Ranch]] Florida a proposed solar-powered city.\n*[[Douglass Ranch in Buckeye]] Arizona\n*[[Mesa del Sol]] in [[Albuquerque]],New Mexico\n*Sonoma Mountain Village in Rohnert Park, California*\n\n==See also==\n[[Sustainable design|See also the Sustainability navigational box at the bottom of the page.]]\n\n* [[2000-watt society]]\n* [[BedZED]]\n* [[Bicycle City]]\n* [[Carfree city]]\n* [[Circles of Sustainability]]\n* [[Covenant of Mayors]]\n* [[Eco-cities]]\n* [[Ecodistrict]]\n* [[Environmental economics]]\n* [[Floating ecopolis]]\n* [[Global Ecovillage Network]]\n* [[Prix Versailles]]\n* [[Sustainable design]]\n* [[Sustainable urbanism]]\n* [[Transition town]]\n* [[Urban design]]\n* [[Zero-carbon city]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Helmut Bott, Gregor Grassl, Stephan Anders (2019) [https://shop.detail.de/eu_e/sustainable-urban-planning.html Sustainable Urban Planning: Vibrant Neighbourhoods \u2013 Smart Cities \u2013 Resilience], DETAIL Publishers, Volume 1, {{ISBN|978-3-95553-462-2}}\n*Stanislav E.

These cities are inhabited by people whom are dedicated towards minimizing required inputs of energy, water, food, [[waste]], output of heat, [[air pollution]] - {{CO2|link=yes}}, [[methane]], and [[water pollution]]. Richard Register first coined the term \"''ecocity''\" in his 1987 book ''Ecocity Berkeley: Building Cities for a Healthy Future,'' where he offers innovative city planning solutions that would work anywhere.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ecocity_Berkeley.html?id=QYE-Q8MAF3MC|title=Ecocity Berkeley: Building Cities for a Healthy Future|last=Register|first=Richard|date=1987|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=9781556430091|language=en}}</ref> Other leading figures who envisioned the sustainable city are [[architect]] [[Paul F Downton]], who later founded the company Ecopolis Pty Ltd, as well as authors [[Timothy Beatley]] and [[Steffen Lehmann]], who have written extensively on the subject. The field of [[industrial ecology]] is sometimes used in planning these cities.\n\nThere remains no completely agreed upon definition for what a sustainable city should be or completely agreed upon paradigm for what components should be included. Generally, developmental experts agree that a sustainable city should meet the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The ambiguity within this idea leads to a great deal of variation in terms of how cities carry out their attempts to become sustainable.\n\nIdeally, a sustainable city creates an enduring way of life across the four domains of [[ecology]], [[economics]], [[politics]] and [[culture]]. Goals of a sustainable city are to be able to feed itself with a sustainable reliance on the surrounding natural environment and have the ability to power itself with [[Renewable energy|renewable sources of energy]]. The central focus of this topic is to create the smallest conceivable [[ecological footprint]] while also producing the lowest quantity of [[pollution]] achievable. All of this is to be accomplished by efficiently using the land in ways such as [[compost]]ing used materials, [[recycling]], and/or converting [[waste-to-energy]]. The idea is that these contributions will lead to a decrease of the city's impact on [[climate change]]. The Adelaide City Council<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/?204334/Adelaide-green-city|title=Adelaide green city {{!}} WWF|website=wwf.panda.org|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> states that socially sustainable cities should be equitable, diverse, connected, democratic, and provide a good quality of life.\n\nToday, 55% of the world is estimated to be living in [[urban area]]s and the [[United Nations]] estimates that by the year 2050, that number will rise to 68%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html|title=68% of the world population projected to live in urban areas by 2050, says UN|date=2018-05-16|website=UN DESA {{!}} United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> These large communities provide both challenges and opportunities for [[environmentally-conscious]] developers. There are distinct advantages to further defining and working towards the goals of sustainable cities. Humans are social creatures and thrive in urban spaces that foster social connections. [[Richard Florida]], an urban studies theorist, focuses on the social impact of sustainable cities and states that cities need to be more than a competitive business climate; they need to be a great people climate that appeals to individuals and families of all types. Because of this, a shift to more dense, urban living would provide an outlet for social interaction and conditions under which humans can prosper. These types of urban areas would also promote the use of public transit, walkability and biking which would benefit citizens health wise but also be environmentally beneficial.\n\n==Practical achievement==\nThese ecological cities are achieved through various means, such as:\n*Different [[Agriculture|agricultural systems]] such as agricultural plots within the city ([[suburbs]] or [[City center|centre]]).<!-- British form of 'center' --> This reduces the distance food has to travel from [[food miles|field to fork]]. Practical work out of this may be done by either small scale/private farming plots or through larger scale agriculture (e.g. [[Vertical farming|farmscrapers]]).\n*[[Renewable energy]] sources, such as [[wind turbines]], [[solar panel]]s, or [[bio-gas]] created from [[sewage]]. Cities provide [[economies of scale]] that make such energy sources viable. \n*Various methods to reduce the need for [[air conditioning]] (a massive energy demand), such as planting trees and lightening surface colors, [[Natural ventilation|natural ventilation systems]], an increase in water features, and green spaces equaling at least 20% of the city's surface. These measures counter the \"[[heat island effect]]\" caused by an abundance of tarmac and asphalt, which can make urban areas several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas&mdash;as much as six degrees Celsius during the evening.\n*Improved [[public transport]] and an increase in pedestrianization to reduce car emissions. This requires a radically different approach to city planning, with integrated business, industrial, and residential zones. Roads may be designed to make driving difficult.\n*Optimal building density to make public transport viable but avoid the creation of [[urban heat island]]s.\n*Solutions to decrease [[urban sprawl]], by seeking new ways of allowing people to live closer to the workspace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.perc.org/2012/03/22/how-can-cities-reverse-urban-sprawl-increase-transit-use-reduce-emissions/|title=How Can Cities Reverse Urban Sprawl, Increase Transit Use, Reduce Emissions?|date=2012-03-22|website=PERC|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Since the workplace tends to be in the city, downtown, or urban center, they are seeking a way to increase density by changing the antiquated attitudes many suburbanites have towards inner-city areas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/10/what-neighborhood-revitalization-actually-looks/3627/|title=This Is What a Neighborhood Revitalization Actually Looks Like|last=Benfield|first=Kaid|website=CityLab|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> One of the new ways to achieve this is by solutions worked out by the [[Smart Growth]] Movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n*[[Green roof]]s alter the surface energy balance and can help mitigate the urban heat island effect. Incorporating [[Green roof|eco roofs]] or green roofs in your design will help with air quality, climate and water runoff.\n*[[Zero-emission transport]]\n*[[Zero-energy building]]\n*[[Sustainable urban drainage systems]] or SUDS\n*[[Energy conservation|energy conservation systems/devices]]\n*[[Xeriscaping]] - garden and landscape design for water conservation\n*[[Sustainable transport]], incorporates five elements: fuel economy, occupancy, electrification, pedal power, and urbanization.\n*[[Key Performance Indicator]]s - development and operational management tool providing guidance and M&V for city administrators\n*Sustainable Sites Initiative or SSI,Voluntary national guidelines and performance benchmarks for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices. Key areas of focus are soil, vegetation, hydrology, materials, and human health and well being.\n*Increase of [[Cycling infrastructure]] would increase cycling within cities and reduce the number of cars being driven and in turn reduce car emissions. This would also benefit the health of citizens as they would be able to get more exercise through cycling.\n*Educating residents of cities about the positive impacts of living in a more sustainable city and why it is important would increase the initiative to have sustainable developments and push people to live in a more sustainable way.\n\n== Architecture ==\nBuildings provide the infrastructure for a functioning city and allow for many opportunities to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. A commitment to sustainable architecture encompasses all phases of building including the planning, building, and restructuring. Sustainable Site Initiatives is used by landscape architects, designers, engineers, architects, developers, policy-makers and others to align land development and management with innovative sustainable design.\n\n=== Eco-industrial park ===\nThe purpose of an eco-industrial park is to connect a number of firms and organizations to work together to decrease their environmental impact while simultaneously improving their economic performance. The community of businesses accomplishes this goal through collaboration in managing environmental and resource issues, such as energy, water, and materials. The components for building an eco-industrial park include natural systems, more efficient use of energy, and more efficient material and water flows Industrial parks should be built to fit into their natural settings in order to reduce environmental impacts, which can be accomplished through plant design, landscaping, and choice of materials. For instance, there is an industrial park in Michigan built by Phoenix Designs that is made almost entirely from recycled materials. The landscaping of the building will include native trees, grasses, and flowers, and the landscaping design will also act as climate shelter for the facility. In choosing the materials for building an eco-industrial park, designers must consider the life-cycle analysis of each medium that goes into the building to assess their true impact on the environment and to ensure that they are using it from one plant to another, steam connections from firms to provide heating for homes in the area, and using renewable energy such as wind and solar power. In terms of material flows, the companies in an eco-industrial park may have common waste treatment facilities, a means for transporting by-products from one plant to another, or anchoring the park around [[resource recovery]] companies that are recruited to the location or started from scratch. To create more efficient water flows in industrial parks, the processed water from one plant can be reused by another plant and the parks infrastructure can include a way to collect and reuse storm water runoff.\n\n==== Example ====\n\n===== Recycled Park in Rotterdam, The Netherlands =====\nThe Recycled Park in Rotterdam, the second-largest city in the Netherlands, is an initiative introduced by Recycled Island Foundation, a Netherlands-based organization focused on recycling littered waste via creating their iconic island-parks, among other sustainable projects. Rotterdam's Recycled Park is a cluster of floating, green hexagonal \u201cislands\u201d composed of reused litter. The group has utilized a system of passive litter traps<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.recycledisland.com/litter-traps|title=Litter traps|website=Recycled Island|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> to collect this litter from the Maas River. The park's location upon the Maas River reflects a circular process aimed at creating a more sustainable city.\n\nOn the underside of the recycled park are materials which will support the growth of plants and wildlife indigenous to the area. This interest in growing the biodiversity of Rotterdam's natural elements is also reflected in other cities. Chicago's Urban Rivers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.urbanriv.org/the-wild-mile|title=Home|website=Urban Rivers|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> organization is similarly trying to solve this issue by building and growing the Wild Mile of floating parks and forests along the [[Chicago River]] with the goal of [[revegetation]]. Both Urban Rivers\u2019 and Recycled Island Foundation's interest in improving the area's biodiversity reflects an interest in greening the built urbanism of the surrounding city.\n\nRotterdam's Recycled Park may suggest a greater trend in creating floating structures in response to greater climate-change-motivated impacts. The Floating Farm<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.designboom.com/architecture/floating-farm-rotterdam-cows-05-15-2019/|title=world's first floating farm welcomes cows in rotterdam|date=2019-05-15|website=designboom {{!}} architecture & design magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> in Rotterdam sustainably approaches food production and transport.

This has various, wide-reaching environmental impacts: reducing the aggregation of the [[Urban heat island|urban heat-island effect]], the zoning efforts expended on engineering and regulating the [[floodplain]] (and potentially, the capacity of [[Wastewater|waste-water reservoirs]]), and reduce the demands of the [[automobility]] state.\n\nThe Recycled Park is a holistic approach to limiting the expense of waste. The employment of greenery has air-purifying effects, to reduce pollution. Additionally, the modular, hexagonal design allows reconstruction of each \u201cisland;\u201d this space thus also offers environmental sustainability, as well as an open space for community-growing and other social opportunities.\n\n=== Urban farming ===\n{{See also|Urban Agriculture}}\n\n[[Urban farming]] is the process of growing and distributing food, as well as raising animals, in and around a city or in urban area. According to the RUAF Foundation, urban farming is different from rural agriculture because it is integrated into the urban economic and ecological system: urban agriculture is embedded in and interacting with the urban ecosystem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ruaf.org/|title=The RUAF Foundation|website=The RUAF Foundation|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> Such linkages include the use of urban residents as laborers; use of typical urban resources (such as utilizing organic waste as compost or urban wastewater for irrigation); direct links with urban consumers; direct impacts on urban ecology (positive and negative); being part of the urban food system; competing for land with other urban functions; being influenced by urban policies and plans. One motivation for urban agriculture in sustainable cites includes saving energy that would be used in food transportation. In order for urban farming to be a successful method of sustainable food growth, cities must allot a common area for community gardens or farms, as well as a common area for a farmers market in which the foodstuffs grown within the city can be sold to the residents of the urban system.\n\n=== New Urbanism ===\nThe most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism is known as the Charter of [[New Urbanism]]. It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the [[built environment]] to create and preserve smart cities which support [[sustainable transport]]. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in [[Urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs. The concept of [[circular flow land use management]] has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl.\n\n[[Sustainable architecture]], a recent movement of [[New Classical Architecture]], promotes a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], walkability, [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular tradition]], and [[Classical architecture|classical design]]. This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture and opposes solitary [[housing estate]]s and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s.\n\n=== Individual buildings (LEED) ===\n{{Main|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design}}\n\nThe Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System\u00ae encourages and accelerates global adoption of sustainable green building and development practices through the creation and implementation of universally understood and accepted tools and performance criteria.\n\nLEED, or [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]], is an internationally recognized [[green building]] certification system. LEED recognizes whole building sustainable design by identifying key areas of excellence including: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, Locations & Linkages, Awareness and Education, Innovation in Design, Regional Priority. In order for a building to become LEED certified sustainability needs to be prioritized in design, construction, and use. One example of sustainable design would be including a [[certified wood]] like bamboo. Bamboo is fast growing and has an incredible replacement rate after being harvested. By far the most credits are rewarded for optimizing energy performance. This promotes innovative thinking about alternative forms of energy and encourages increased efficiency.\n\n=== Sustainable Sites Initiative (SSI) ===\nSustainable Sites Initiative, a combined effort of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center at The [[University of Texas at Austin]], and the [[United States Botanic Garden]], is a voluntary national guideline and performance benchmark for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices. The building principles of SSI are to design with nature and culture, use a decision-making hierarchy of preservation, conservation, and regeneration, use a system thinking approach, provide regenerative systems, support a living process, use a collaborative and ethical approach, maintain integrity in leadership and research, and finally foster [[environmental stewardship]]. All of these help promote solutions to common environmental issues such as [[greenhouse gas]]es, [[urban climate]] issues, [[water pollution]] and waste, [[energy consumption]], and health and wellbeing of site users. The main focus is hydrology, soils, vegetation, materials, and human health and well being.\n\nIn SSI, the main goal for [[hydrology]] in sites is to protect and restore existing hydrologic functions. To design storm water features to be accessible to site users, and manage and clean water on site. For site design of [[soil]] and [[vegetation]]<nowiki/>many steps can be done during the construction process to help minimize the [[urban heat island]] effects, to and minimize the building heating requirements by using plants.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Energy Efficiency of different Transport Modes.png|thumb]]\nAs major focus of the sustainable cities, [[sustainable transportation]] attempts to reduce a city's reliance and use of greenhouse emitting gases by utilizing eco friendly [[urban planning]], low environmental impact vehicles, and residential proximity to create an urban center that has greater environmental responsibility and [[social equity]].\n\nDue to the significant impact that transportation services have on a city's energy consumption, the last decade has seen an increasing emphasis on sustainable transportation by developmental experts. Currently, transportation systems account for nearly a quarter of the world's energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission. In order to reduce the environmental impact caused by transportation in metropolitan areas, sustainable transportation has three widely agreed upon pillars that it utilizes to create more healthy and productive urban centers.\n\nThe [[Carbon Trust]] states that there are three main ways cities can innovate to make transport more sustainable without increasing journey times - better land use planning, modal shift to encourage people to choose more efficient forms of transport, and making existing transport modes more efficient.\n\n=== Car free city ===\nThe concept of [[Carfree city|car free cities]] or a city with large [[pedestrian area]]s is often part of the design of a sustainable city. A large part of the [[carbon footprint]] of a city is generated by cars so the car free concept is often considered an integral part of the design of a sustainable city.\n\n=== Emphasis on proximity ===\nCreated by eco friendly urban planning, the concept of urban proximity is an essential element of current and future sustainable transportation systems. This requires that cities be built and added onto with appropriate population and landmark density so that destinations are reached with reduced time in transit. This reduced time in transit allows for reduced fuel expenditure and also opens the door to alternative means of transportation such as bike riding and walking.\nTransportation in downtown [[Chicago]]\nFurthermore, close proximity of residents and major landmarks allows for the creation of efficient public transportation by eliminating long sprawled out routes and reducing commute time. This in turn decreases the social cost to residents who choose to live in these cities by allowing them more time with families and friends instead by eliminating part of their commute time.\n\nSee also: [[Compact city]] and [[Pocket neighborhood]]\n\n=== Diversity in modes of transportation ===\nSustainable transportation emphasizes the use of a diversity of [[fuel-efficient]] transportation vehicles in order to reduce greenhouse emissions and diversity fuel demand. Due to the increasingly expensive and volatile cost of energy, this strategy has become very important because it allows a way for city residents to be less susceptible to varying highs and lows in various energy prices.\n\nAmong the different [[modes of transport]]ation, the use alternative energy cars and widespread installation of refueling stations has gained increasing importance, while the creation of centralized [[Bike path|bike]] and [[walking path]]s remains a staple of the sustainable transportation movement.\n\n=== Access to transportation ===\nIn order to maintain the aspect of [[social responsibility]] inherent within the concept of sustainable cities, implementing [[sustainable transportation]] must include access to transportation by all levels of society. Due to the fact that car and fuel cost are often too expensive for lower income urban residents, completing this aspect often revolves around efficient and accessible public transportation.\n\nIn order to make public transportation more accessible, the cost of rides must be affordable and stations must be located no more than walking distance in each part of the city. As studies have shown, this accessibility creates a great increase in social and productive opportunity for city residents. By allowing lower income residents cheap and available transportation, it allows for individuals to seek employment opportunities all over the urban center rather than simply the area in which they live. This in turn reduces unemployment and a number of associated social problems such as crime, drug use, and violence.\n\n== Urban strategic planning ==\nAlthough there is not an international policy regarding sustainable cities and there are not established international standards, there is an organization, the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG) that is working to establish universal urban strategic guidelines. The UCLG a democratic and decentralized structure that operates in Africa, Asia, Eurasia, Europe, Latin America, North America, Middle East, West Asian and a Metropolitan section work to promote a more sustainable society. The 60 members of the UCLG committee evaluate urban development strategies and debate these experiences to make the best recommendations. Additionally, the UCLG accounts for differences in regional and national context. All the organizations are making a great effort to promote this concept by media and internet, and in conferences and workshops. An International conference was held in Italy at Universit\u00e0 del Salento and Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Basilicata, called 'Green Urbanism', from 12\u201314 October 2016.\n\n=== Development ===\nRecently, local and national governments and regional bodies such as the European Union have recognized the need for a holistic understanding of [[urban planning]]. This is instrumental to establishing an international policy that focuses on cities challenges and the role of the local authorities responses. Generally, in terms of urban planning, the responsibility of local governments are limited to [[land use]] and infrastructure provision excluding inclusive urban development strategies. The advantages of urban strategic planning include an increase in governance and cooperation that aids local governments in establishing performance based-management, clearly identifying the challenges facing local community and more effectively responding on a local level rather than national level, and improves institutional responses and local decision making. Additionally, it increases dialogue between stakeholders and develops consensus-based solutions, establishing continuity between sustainability plans and change in local government; it places environmental issues as the priority for the sustainable development of cities and serves as a platform to develop concepts and new models of housing, energy and mobility.\n\n=== Obstacles ===\nThe City Development Strategies (CDS) addresses new challenges and provides space for innovative policies that involves all stakeholders. The inequality in spatial development and socio-economic classes paired with concerns of [[poverty reduction]] and [[climate change]] are factors in achieving global sustainable cities. According to the [[UCLG]] there are differences between regional and national conditions, framework and practice that are overcome in the international commitment to communication and negotiation with other governments, communities and the private sector to continue to develop through innovative and participatory approaches in strategic decisions, building consensus and monitoring performance management and raising investment.\n\n=== Social factors of sustainable cities ===\nAccording to [[UN Habitat]], around half of the world's population is concentrated in cities, which is set to rise to 60% within a couple decades. The UCLG has specifically identified 13 global challenges to establishing sustainable cities: demographic change and migration, globalisation of the job market, poverty and unmet Millennium Development Goals, segregation, spatial patterns and urban growth, metropolisation and the rise of urban regions, more political power for local authorities, new actors for developing a city and providing services, decline in public funding for development, the environment and climate change, new and accessible building technologies, preparing for uncertainty and limits of growth and global communications and partnerships.\n\n==Examples==\n===Australia===\n\n==== Adelaide ====\n'''Urban forests'''\n\nIn [[Adelaide]], South Australia (a city of 1.3 million people) Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) launched an urban forest initiative in 2003 to plant 3 million native trees and shrubs by 2014 on 300 project sites across the metro area. The projects range from large habitat restoration projects to local biodiversity projects. Thousands of Adelaide citizens have participated in community planting days. Sites include parks, reserves, transport corridors, schools, water courses and coastline. Only trees native to the local area are planted to ensure genetic integrity. Premier Rann said the project aimed to beautify and cool the city and make it more liveable; improve air and water quality and reduce Adelaide's greenhouse gas emissions by 600,000 tonnes of C02 a year. He said it was also about creating and conserving habitat for wildlife and preventing species loss.\n\n'''Solar power'''\n\nThe Rann government also launched an initiative for Adelaide to lead Australia in the take-up of solar power. In addition to Australia's first 'feed-in' tariff to stimulate the purchase of solar panels for domestic roofs, the government committed millions of dollars to place arrays of solar panels on the roofs of public buildings such as the museum, art gallery, Parliament, Adelaide Airport, 200 schools and Australia's biggest rooftop array on the roof of Adelaide Showgrounds' convention hall which was registered as a power station.\n\n'''Wind power'''\n\nSouth Australia went from zero wind power in 2002 to wind power, making up 26% of its electricity generation by October 2011. In the five years preceding 2011 there was a 15% drop in emissions, despite strong economic growth.\n\n'''Waste recycling'''\n\nFor Adelaide the South Australian government also embraced a Zero Waste recycling strategy, achieving a recycling rate of nearly 80% by 2011 with 4.3 million tonnes of materials diverted from landfill to recycling. On a per capita basis this was the best result in Australia, the equivalent of preventing more than a million tonnes of C02 entering the atmosphere. In the 1970s container deposit legislation was introduced. Consumers are paid a 10 cent rebate on each bottle, can, or container they return to recycling. In 2009 non-reusable plastic bags used in supermarket checkouts were banned by the Rann Government, preventing 400 million plastic bags per year entering the litter stream. In 2010 Zero Waste SA was commended by a UN Habitat Report entitled 'Solid Waste Management in the World Cities'.\n\n[[Melbourne]]\n\n* [[City of Moreland]]. The City of Moreland in Melbourne's north, has programs for becoming carbon neutral, one of which is '[https://web.archive.org/web/20160407004537/http://www.morelandsolarcity.org.au/ Zero Carbon Moreland]', amongst other existing sustainable implementations and proposals.\n* [[City of Melbourne]]. Over the past 10 years, various methods of improving public transport have been implemented, car free zones and entire streets have also been implemented.\n\n==== City of Greater Taree, New South Wales ====\nThe [[City of Greater Taree]] north of Sydney has developed a masterplan for Australia's first low-to-no carbon urban development.\n\n=== Brazil ===\n'''Belo Horizonte, Brazil''' was created in 1897 and is the third largest metropolis in Brazil, with 2.4 million inhabitants. The Strategic Plan for Belo Horizonte (2010\u20132030) is being prepared by external consultants based on similar cities' infrastructure, incorporating the role of local government, state government, city leaders and encouraging citizen participation. The need for environmental sustainable development is led by the initiative of new government following planning processes from the state government. Overall, the development of the metropolis is dependent on the land regularization and infrastructure improvement that will better support the cultural technology and economic landscape.

An additional project was made in 2007 in this area: an Eco-Village based on the concept made by an Italian professor from the School of Architecture of Tianjin University.\n* [[Huangbaiyu]], [[Benxi]], [[Liaoning]] is a small village of 42 homes that has come under great criticism: most of the homes are unoccupied by villagers.\n* [[Nanjing]]: As of April 2008, an ecocity collaboration project is being proposed here.\n* [[Rizhao]], [[Shandong]] mandates solar water heaters for households, and has been designated the Environmental Model City by China's [[State Environmental Protection Administration|SEPA]].\n* [[Chengdu Tianfu District Great City]] is a planned city located just outside [[Chengdu]] that is planned to be sustainable and has the goal of being a self-sustaining city that discourages the use of cars.\n\n=== Denmark ===\nTwo comprehensive studies were carried out for the whole of Denmark in 2010 (The IDA Climate Plan 2050) and 2011 (The Danish Commission on Climate Change Policy). The studies analysed the benefits and obstacles of running Denmark on [[100% renewable energy]] from the year 2050. There is also a larger, ambitious plan in action: the Copenhagen 2025 Climate Plan.\n\nOn a more local level, the [[Kalundborg Eco-industrial Park|industrial park in Kalundborg]] is often cited as a model for industrial ecology. However, projects have been carried out in several Danish cities promoting 100% renewable energy. Examples include [[Aalborg]], [[Ballerup]] and [[Frederikshavn]]. [[Aalborg University]] has launched a master education program on sustainable cities (Sustainable Cities @ Aalborg University Copenhagen). See also the Danish Wikipedia.\n\n* [[Copenhagen]]: [[Cycling in Copenhagen]]: One of the most bicycle-friendly city's in the world where over 50% of the population get around on bikes. The city has infrastructure that caters to cycling with hundreds of kilometres of curb segregated bike lanes to separate cyclists and car traffic.

It is one of the few cities with a [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green]] mayor and is known for its strong solar energy industry. [[Vauban, Freiburg]] is a sustainable model district. All houses are built to a low energy consumption standard and the whole district is designed to be carfree. Another green district in Freiburg is Rieselfeld, where houses generate more energy than they consume. There are several other green sustainable city projects such as Kronsberg in Hannover and current developments around Munich, Hamburg and Frankfurt.\n\n* [[Berlin]]: The [[Tiergarten (park)]] is a large park that takes up 520 acres and is an example of social sustainability where it is a green space but also used for transportation. The Tiergarten has inter paths where people can safely bike and walk without the disturbance of cars. Paths connect to notable areas within the city, such as government buildings, shopping areas and monuments.\n* [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] is often referred to{{by whom|date=September 2019}} as green city. It is known for its strong solar economy. [[Vauban, Freiburg]] is a sustainable model district. All houses are built to a low energy consumption standard and the whole district is designed to be car-free.\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\nThe government portrays the proposed [[Hung Shui Kiu]] [[new town]] as an eco-city. The same happened with the urban development plan on the site of the former [[Kai Tak Airport]].\n\n=== Ireland ===\nSouth Dublin County Council announced plans in late 2007 to develop Clonburris, a new suburb of Dublin to include up to 15,000 new homes, to be designed to achieve the highest of international standards. The plans for Clonburris include countless green innovations such as high levels of energy efficiency, mandatory renewable energy for heating and electricity, the use of recycled and sustainable building materials, a district heating system for distributing heat, the provision of allotments for growing food, and even the banning of tumble driers, with natural drying areas being provided instead.\n\nIn 2012 an energy plan was carried out by the Danish [[Aalborg University]] for the municipalities of [[Limerick]] and [[County Clare|Clare]]. The project was a short-term 2020 renewable energy strategy giving a 20% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, while ensuring that short-term actions are beneficial to the long-term goal of 100% renewable energy.\n\n===India===\n[[India]] is working on [[Gujarat International Finance Tec-City]] or GIFT which is an under-construction world-class city in the Indian state of [[Gujarat]].

These include a central park irrigated with seawater, a subway line, bicycle lanes, rainwater catchment systems, and pneumatic waste collection system. 75% of the waste generated by the construction of the city will be recycled.\n\nGwanggyo City Centre is another planned sustainable city.\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nAs of 2014 a Low Carbon Cities programme is being piloted in Malaysia by KeTTHA, the Malaysian Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water, Malaysian Green Technology Corporation (GreenTech Malaysia) and the [[Carbon Trust]].\n\n[[Malacca]] has a stated ambition to become a carbon-free city, taking steps towards creating a smart electricity grid. This is being done as part of an initiative to create a Green Special Economic Zone, where it is intended that as many as 20 research and development centers will be built focusing on renewable energy and clean technology, creating up to 300,000 new green jobs.\n\nThe Federal Department of Town and Country Planning (FDTCP) in peninsular Malaysia is a focal point for the implementation of the Malaysian Urban Rural National Indicators Network for Sustainable Development (MURNInets)MURNInets includes 36 sets of compulsory indicators grouped under 21 themes under six dimensions. Most of the targets and standards for the selected indicators were adjusted according to hierarchy of local authorities. In MURNInets at least three main new features are introduced. These include the Happiness Index, an indicator under the quality of life theme to meet the current development trend that emphasizes on the well-being of the community. Another feature introduced is the customer or people satisfaction level towards local authorities' services. Through the introduction of these indicators the bottom-up approach in measuring sustainability is adopted.\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nThe city of [[Waitakere]], the Western part of the greater [[Auckland]] urban region, was [[New Zealand]]'s first eco-city, working from the Greenprint, a guiding document that the City Council developed in the early 1990s.\n\n=== Philippines ===\n[[Clark Freeport Zone]] is a former United States Air Force base in the Philippines. It is located on the northwest side of Angeles City and on the west side of Mabalacat City in the province of Pampanga, about 40 miles (60&nbsp;km) northwest of Metro Manila. A multi-billion project will convert the 36,000 hectare former Clark Air Force Base into a mix of industrial, commercial and institutional areas of green environment. The heart of the project is a 9,450-hectare metropolis dubbed as the \"[[Clark Green City]]\". Builders will use the green building system for environmentally-friendly structures. Its facilities will tap renewable energy such as solar and hydro power.\n\n=== Portugal ===\nThe organization Living PlanIT is currently constructing a city from scratch near Porto, Portugal. Buildings will be electronically connected to vehicles giving the user a sense of personal eco-friendliness.\n\n=== Spain ===\n\n* [[Bilbao]]: The city faced economic turmoil following the decline of the steel and port industries but through communication between stakeholders and authorities to create inner-city transformation, the local government benefited from the increase in land value in old port areas. The Strategic Plan for the Revitalisation of Metropolitan Bibao was launched in 1922 and have flourished regenerating old steel and port industries. The conversion from depleted steel and port industries to one of Europe's most flourishing markets is a prime example of a sustainable project in action.\n* [[Barcelona]]: The city is planning an urban redesign of civic super blocks, they plan to convert nine-block areas into unified mega block neighbourhoods. The aim is to decrease car related traffic, noise and pollution by over 20% and to free up to 60% of road areas for reuse as citizen spaces. This is being done because they realized that people in Barcelona die prematurely due to poor air quality and everyday noise levels are deemed harmful.

It probably descends from the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'',{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}} which is also known as \"wild saffron\"{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=24}} and originated in [[Crete]] or [[Central Asia]].{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} ''[[Crocus thomasii|C.&nbsp;thomasii]]'' and ''[[Crocus pallasii|C.&nbsp;pallasii]]'' are other possible sources.{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=28}} As a genetically monomorphic clone,{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} it slowly propagated throughout much of [[Eurasia]].\n\nIt is a sterile [[polyploidy|triploid]] form, which means that three homologous sets of [[chromosome]]s make up each specimen's genetic complement; ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' bears eight chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Being sterile, the purple flowers of ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' fail to produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on human assistance: clusters of [[corm]]s, underground, bulb-like, starch-storing organs, must be dug up, divided, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing via this vegetative division up to ten \"cormlets\" that can grow into new plants in the next season.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}} The compact corms are small, brown globules that can measure as large as {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, have a flat base, and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibres; this coat is referred to as the \"corm tunic\". Corms also bear vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up to {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} above the plant's neck.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\nThe plant sprouts 5\u201311 white and non-[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] leaves known as [[cataphyll]]s. These membrane-like structures cover and protect 5 to 11 true leaves as they bud and develop on the crocus flower. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are {{Convert|1|\u2013|3|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, in diameter, which either expand after the flowers have opened (\"hysteranthous\") or do so simultaneously with their blooming (\"synanthous\"). ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigated relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear [[bract]]eoles, or specialised leaves, that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]].{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} After [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivating]] in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} in length. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=3}} The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon flowering, the plants are {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height and bear up to four flowers. A three-pronged [[style (botany)|style]] {{Convert|25|\u2013|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, emerges from each flower. Each prong terminates with a vivid crimson [[stigma (botany)|stigma]], which are the distal end of a [[carpel]].{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\n===Cultivation===\nThe saffron crocus, unknown in the wild, probably descends from ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]''. It is a [[polyploid|triploid]] that is \"self-incompatible\" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant [[meiosis]] and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction\u2014all propagation is by [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative multiplication]] via manual \"divide-and-set\" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=30\u201331}}{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}\n\n''Crocus sativus'' thrives in the Mediterranean [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], an ecotype superficially resembling the North American [[chaparral]], and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi-arid lands. It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating frosts as low as {{Convert|\u221210|C|0}} and short periods of snow cover.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=2\u20133}} Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as [[Kashmir]], where annual rainfall averages {{Convert|1000|\u2013|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}}; saffron-growing regions in Greece ({{Convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} annually) and Spain ({{Convert|400|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops,{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=2}} and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. [[Nematode]]s, leaf [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], and corm rot pose other threats. Yet ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.{{Sfn|Sharaf-Eldin et al.|2008}}\n\nThe plants fare poorly in shady conditions; they grow best in full sunlight. Fields that slope towards the sunlight are optimal (i.e., south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere). Planting is mostly done in June in the Northern Hemisphere, where corms are lodged {{Convert|7|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep; its roots, stems, and leaves can develop between October and February.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Planting depth and corm spacing, in concert with climate, are critical factors in determining yields. Mother corms planted deeper yield higher-quality saffron, though form fewer flower buds and daughter corms. Italian growers optimise thread yield by planting {{Convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep and in rows {{Convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} apart; depths of {{Convert|8|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} optimise flower and corm production. Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers employ distinct depths and spacings that suit their locales.\n\n''C.&nbsp;sativus'' prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-[[calcareous]] soils with high organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was historically boosted via application of some {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|t|LT ST}} of manure per hectare. Afterwards, and with no further manure application, corms were planted.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do they flower. Harvests are by necessity a speedy affair: after blossoming at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=3\u20134}} All plants bloom within a window of one or two weeks.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=4}} Stigmas are dried quickly upon extraction and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=8}}\n\n===Harvesting===\nThe high retail value of saffron is maintained on world markets because of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some 200,000 saffron stigmas to be hand-picked from 70,000 crocus flowers for each {{convert|1|lb}} of saffron product.<ref name=hooker/><ref name=cnn/>{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=273}}{{Sfn|Rau|1969|p=35}} Forty hours of labour are needed to pick 150,000 flowers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lak |first=Daniel |date=11 November 1998 |title=Kashmiris pin hopes on saffron |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/212491.stm |accessdate=11 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne freshly picked crocus flower yields an average {{Convert|30|mg|oz|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron or {{Convert|7|mg|oz|abbr=on}} dried; roughly 150 flowers yield {{Convert|1|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dry saffron threads; to produce {{Convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dried saffron, {{Convert|1|lb|abbr=on}} of flowers are needed; {{Convert|1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron yields {{Convert|0.2|oz|g|abbr=on}} of dried spice.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} \n\n==Spice==\n\n===Phytochemistry and sensory properties===\n[[File:Picrocrocin.svg|thumb|Structure of picrocrocin:{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}}\n{|\n|-\n|{{Legend|#AEAEFF|[[Anomer|\u03b2]]\u2013[[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]-glucopyranose derivative}}\n|-\n|{{Legend|#F5D76C|safranal moiety}}\n|}\n]]\n[[File:Crocetin safranal esterification.png|thumb|[[Esterification|Esterification reaction]] between [[crocetin]] and [[gentiobiose]].

The two esterified gentiobioses make \u03b1-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}}\n\nThe bitter [[glucoside]] [[picrocrocin]] is responsible for saffron's [[pungency|pungent flavour]].<ref name=dhar/> Picrocrocin ([[chemical formula]]: {{Chem|C|16|H|26|O|7}}; systematic name: 4-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an [[aldehyde]] sub-molecule known as [[safranal]] (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] that is produced via [[redox|oxidative]] cleavage, and is the [[glycoside]] of the [[terpene]] [[aldehyde]] safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}}\n\nWhen saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield [[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]\u2013[[glucose]] and a free safranal molecule.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}} Safranal, a [[essential oil|volatile]] oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=423}}{{Sfn|Dharmananda|2005}} Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}} A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Chemists find this is the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating [[pH]] levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and [[redox|oxidising]] agents. It must, therefore, be stored away in air-tight containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.\n\n===Grades and ISO 3632 categories===\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Red threads and yellow styles from Iran]]\n[[File:Safran-Weinviertel Niederreiter 2 Gramm 8285.jpg|thumb|left|upright|High quality red threads from Austrian saffron]]\n[[File:Pure Kashmiri saffron pack 08.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kashmir]]i saffron package]]\n\nSaffron is not all of the same quality and strength. Strength is related to several factors including the amount of style picked along with the red stigma. Age of the saffron is also a factor. More style included means the saffron is less strong gram for gram because the colour and flavour are concentrated in the red stigmas. Saffron from [[Iran]], [[Spain]] and [[Kashmir]] is classified into various grades according to the relative amounts of red stigma and yellow styles it contains. Grades of Iranian saffron are: \"sargol\" (red stigma tips only, strongest grade), \"pushal\" or \"pushali\" (red stigmas plus some yellow style, lower strength), \"bunch\" saffron (red stigmas plus large amount of yellow style, presented in a tiny bundle like a miniature wheatsheaf) and \"konge\" (yellow style only, claimed to have aroma but with very little, if any, colouring potential). Grades of Spanish saffron are \"coup\u00e9\" (the strongest grade, like Iranian sargol), \"mancha\" (like Iranian pushal), and in order of further decreasing strength \"rio\", \"standard\" and \"sierra\" saffron. The word \"mancha\" in the Spanish classification can have two meanings: a general grade of saffron or a very high quality Spanish-grown saffron from a specific geographical origin. Real Spanish-grown La Mancha saffron has [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union#Protected designation of origin (PDO)|PDO]] protected status and this is displayed on the product packaging. Spanish growers fought hard for Protected Status because they felt that imports of Iranian saffron re-packaged in Spain and sold as \"Spanish Mancha saffron\" were undermining the genuine La Mancha brand. Similar was the case in Kashmir where imported Iranian saffron is mixed with local saffron and sold as \"Kashmir brand\" at a higher price.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.academia.edu/30720498 |title=Sustainable Saffron (''Crocus sativus'' Kashmirianus) Production: Technological and Policy Interventions for Kashmir |author1=Amjad Masood Husaini |author2=Azra N.

Artisan producers in Europe and New Zealand have offset their higher labour charges for saffron harvesting by targeting quality, only offering extremely high-grade saffron.\n\nIn addition to descriptions based on how the saffron is picked, saffron may be categorised under the international standard ISO 3632 after laboratory measurement of crocin (responsible for saffron's colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance or aroma) content.{{Sfn|Verma|Middha|2010|p=1\u20132}} However, often there is no clear grading information on the product packaging and little of the saffron readily available in the UK is labelled with ISO category. This lack of information makes it hard for customers to make informed choices when comparing prices and buying saffron.\n\nUnder ISO 3632, determination of non-stigma content (\"floral waste content\") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material (\"[[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]\") are also key. Grading standards are set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric [[absorbance]]. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20\u201350 for all categories.\n\nThese data are measured through [[spectrophotometry]] reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply greater levels of crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin is known as the \"colouring strength\" of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coup\u00e9 saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and Mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.\n\nHowever, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=274}} However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out a value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.\n\n===Adulteration===\n\nDespite attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron [[adulteration]], particularly among the cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the ''Safranschou'' code.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=102\u2013104}} Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like [[beetroot]], [[pomegranate]] fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like [[honey]] or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with [[turmeric]], [[paprika]], and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/long-reads/kashmirs-saffron-harvest-sees-sharp-decline-4216123.html|title=Kashmir's saffron harvest sees sharp decline |website=Firstpost|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freepresskashmir.com/2018/09/22/from-35kgs-earlier-to-1kg-yield-now-successful-saffron-mission-paves-way-for-apples-in-pampore/|title=From 35kgs earlier to 1kg yield now, 'successful' Saffron Mission paves way for apples in Pampore|last=Rashid|first=Afshan|date=2018-09-22|website=Free Press Kashmir|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=4 November 2003 |title=Kashmiri Saffron Producers See Red over Iranian Imports |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corp.]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/1504154 |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hussain |first=A. |date=28 January 2005 |title=Saffron Industry in Deep Distress |work=BBC News |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4216493.stm |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref> [[Safflower]] is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron.

Varieties (not varieties in the botanical sense) from Spain, including the tradenames \"Spanish Superior\" and \"Creme\", are generally mellower in colour, flavour, and aroma; they are graded by government-imposed standards. Italian varieties are slightly more potent than Spanish.

The \"Aquila\" saffron, or ''zafferano dell'Aquila'', is defined by high safranal and crocin content, distinctive thread shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour; it is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's [[Abruzzo]] region, near [[L'Aquila]]. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican friar from inquisition-era Spain.{{when|date=October 2016}} But the biggest saffron cultivation in Italy is in [[San Gavino Monreale]], Sardinia, where it is grown on 40 hectares, representing 60% of Italian production; it too has unusually high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the \"Mongra\" or \"Lacha\" saffron of Kashmir (''Crocus sativus'' 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in Kashmir combine with an Indian export ban, contribute to its prohibitive overseas prices. Kashmiri saffron is recognisable by its dark maroon-purple hue; it is among the world's darkest, which hints at strong flavour, aroma, and colouring effect.\n\n<br />\n\n== Use of Saffron in food ==\n'''Shole Zard:''' This food is similar to [[Aush]], Sholezard (Persian: \u0634\u0644\u0647\u200c\u0632\u0631\u062f\u200e /\u0283\u028all\u0259 z\u00e6rd/) is an Iranian traditional [[saffron]] rice pudding dessert.\n\n'''ThahChin''': ([[Tahchin]] Persian: \u062a\u0647 \u0686\u06cc\u0646\u200e), also spelled as '''tah chin''' or '''tah-chin''', is an Iranian rice cake primarily consisting of rice, yogurt, '''saffron''', and eggs.\n\n'''ISaffron Icecream''': Other name ([[Bastani sonnati]]), Very tasty ice cream with <u>Cream</u> or  <u>[https://iranguidance.com/iranian-pistachios/ iranain pistachio]</u>.\n\n'''Jojeh Kebab''': Or ([[Jujeh kabab]]) Roast chicken in a mixture saffron.

Ancient Persians cultivated Persian saffron (''Crocus sativus'' 'Hausknechtii') in [[Derbent]], [[Isfahan]], and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by the 10th century BC. At such sites, saffron threads were woven into textiles,{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=2}} ritually offered to divinities, and used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=17\u201318}} Saffron threads would thus be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Non-Persians also feared the Persians' usage of saffron as a drugging agent and aphrodisiac.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=41}} During his Asian campaigns, [[Alexander the Great]] used Persian saffron in his infusions, rice, and baths as a curative for battle wounds.

Its use in foods and dyes subsequently spread throughout South Asia. Buddhist monks wear saffron-coloured robes; however, the robes are not dyed with costly saffron but [[turmeric]], a less expensive dye, or [[jackfruit]].{{Sfn|Finlay|2003|p=224}} Monks' robes are dyed the same colour to show equality with each other, and turmeric or ochre were the cheapest, most readily available dyes.

It probably descends from the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'',{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}} which is also known as \"wild saffron\"{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=24}} and originated in [[Crete]] or [[Central Asia]].{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} ''[[Crocus thomasii|C.&nbsp;thomasii]]'' and ''[[Crocus pallasii|C.&nbsp;pallasii]]'' are other possible sources.{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=28}} As a genetically monomorphic clone,{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} it slowly propagated throughout much of [[Eurasia]].\n\nIt is a sterile [[polyploidy|triploid]] form, which means that three homologous sets of [[chromosome]]s make up each specimen's genetic complement; ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' bears eight chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Being sterile, the purple flowers of ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' fail to produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on human assistance: clusters of [[corm]]s, underground, bulb-like, starch-storing organs, must be dug up, divided, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing via this vegetative division up to ten \"cormlets\" that can grow into new plants in the next season.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}} The compact corms are small, brown globules that can measure as large as {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, have a flat base, and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibres; this coat is referred to as the \"corm tunic\". Corms also bear vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up to {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} above the plant's neck.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\nThe plant sprouts 5\u201311 white and non-[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] leaves known as [[cataphyll]]s. These membrane-like structures cover and protect 5 to 11 true leaves as they bud and develop on the crocus flower. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are {{Convert|1|\u2013|3|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, in diameter, which either expand after the flowers have opened (\"hysteranthous\") or do so simultaneously with their blooming (\"synanthous\"). ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigated relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear [[bract]]eoles, or specialised leaves, that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]].{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} After [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivating]] in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} in length. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=3}} The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon flowering, the plants are {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height and bear up to four flowers. A three-pronged [[style (botany)|style]] {{Convert|25|\u2013|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, emerges from each flower. Each prong terminates with a vivid crimson [[stigma (botany)|stigma]], which are the distal end of a [[carpel]].{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\n===Cultivation===\nThe saffron crocus, unknown in the wild, probably descends from ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]''. It is a [[polyploid|triploid]] that is \"self-incompatible\" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant [[meiosis]] and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction\u2014all propagation is by [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative multiplication]] via manual \"divide-and-set\" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=30\u201331}}{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}\n\n''Crocus sativus'' thrives in the Mediterranean [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], an ecotype superficially resembling the North American [[chaparral]], and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi-arid lands. It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating frosts as low as {{Convert|\u221210|C|0}} and short periods of snow cover.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=2\u20133}} Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as [[Kashmir]], where annual rainfall averages {{Convert|1000|\u2013|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}}; saffron-growing regions in Greece ({{Convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} annually) and Spain ({{Convert|400|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops,{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=2}} and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. [[Nematode]]s, leaf [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], and corm rot pose other threats. Yet ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.{{Sfn|Sharaf-Eldin et al.|2008}}\n\nThe plants fare poorly in shady conditions; they grow best in full sunlight. Fields that slope towards the sunlight are optimal (i.e., south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere). Planting is mostly done in June in the Northern Hemisphere, where corms are lodged {{Convert|7|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep; its roots, stems, and leaves can develop between October and February.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Planting depth and corm spacing, in concert with climate, are critical factors in determining yields. Mother corms planted deeper yield higher-quality saffron, though form fewer flower buds and daughter corms. Italian growers optimise thread yield by planting {{Convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep and in rows {{Convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} apart; depths of {{Convert|8|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} optimise flower and corm production. Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers employ distinct depths and spacings that suit their locales.\n\n''C.&nbsp;sativus'' prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-[[calcareous]] soils with high organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was historically boosted via application of some {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|t|LT ST}} of manure per hectare. Afterwards, and with no further manure application, corms were planted.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do they flower. Harvests are by necessity a speedy affair: after blossoming at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=3\u20134}} All plants bloom within a window of one or two weeks.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=4}} Stigmas are dried quickly upon extraction and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=8}}\n\n===Harvesting===\nThe high retail value of saffron is maintained on world markets because of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some 200,000 saffron stigmas to be hand-picked from 70,000 crocus flowers for each {{convert|1|lb}} of saffron product.<ref name=hooker/><ref name=cnn/>{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=273}}{{Sfn|Rau|1969|p=35}} Forty hours of labour are needed to pick 150,000 flowers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lak |first=Daniel |date=11 November 1998 |title=Kashmiris pin hopes on saffron |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/212491.stm |accessdate=11 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne freshly picked crocus flower yields an average {{Convert|30|mg|oz|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron or {{Convert|7|mg|oz|abbr=on}} dried; roughly 150 flowers yield {{Convert|1|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dry saffron threads; to produce {{Convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dried saffron, {{Convert|1|lb|abbr=on}} of flowers are needed; {{Convert|1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron yields {{Convert|0.2|oz|g|abbr=on}} of dried spice.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} \n\n==Spice==\n\n===Phytochemistry and sensory properties===\n[[File:Picrocrocin.svg|thumb|Structure of picrocrocin:{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}}\n{|\n|-\n|{{Legend|#AEAEFF|[[Anomer|\u03b2]]\u2013[[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]-glucopyranose derivative}}\n|-\n|{{Legend|#F5D76C|safranal moiety}}\n|}\n]]\n[[File:Crocetin safranal esterification.png|thumb|[[Esterification|Esterification reaction]] between [[crocetin]] and [[gentiobiose]].

This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocins themselves are a series of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] carotenoids that are either [[glycosyl|monoglycosyl]] or diglycosyl [[polyene]] esters of crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocetin is a [[conjugated system|conjugated]] polyene [[carboxylic acid|dicarboxylic acid]] that is [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is [[esterification|esterified]] with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are [[carbohydrate|sugars]], a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant \u03b1-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may make up more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make \u03b1-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}}\n\nThe bitter [[glucoside]] [[picrocrocin]] is responsible for saffron's [[pungency|pungent flavour]].<ref name=dhar/> Picrocrocin ([[chemical formula]]: {{Chem|C|16|H|26|O|7}}; systematic name: 4-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an [[aldehyde]] sub-molecule known as [[safranal]] (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] that is produced via [[redox|oxidative]] cleavage, and is the [[glycoside]] of the [[terpene]] [[aldehyde]] safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}}\n\nWhen saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield [[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]\u2013[[glucose]] and a free safranal molecule.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}} Safranal, a [[essential oil|volatile]] oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=423}}{{Sfn|Dharmananda|2005}} Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}} A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Chemists find this is the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating [[pH]] levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and [[redox|oxidising]] agents. It must, therefore, be stored away in air-tight containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.\n\n===Grades and ISO 3632 categories===\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Red threads and yellow styles from Iran]]\n[[File:Safran-Weinviertel Niederreiter 2 Gramm 8285.jpg|thumb|left|upright|High quality red threads from Austrian saffron]]\n[[File:Pure Kashmiri saffron pack 08.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kashmir]]i saffron package]]\n\nSaffron is not all of the same quality and strength. Strength is related to several factors including the amount of style picked along with the red stigma. Age of the saffron is also a factor. More style included means the saffron is less strong gram for gram because the colour and flavour are concentrated in the red stigmas. Saffron from [[Iran]], [[Spain]] and [[Kashmir]] is classified into various grades according to the relative amounts of red stigma and yellow styles it contains. Grades of Iranian saffron are: \"sargol\" (red stigma tips only, strongest grade), \"pushal\" or \"pushali\" (red stigmas plus some yellow style, lower strength), \"bunch\" saffron (red stigmas plus large amount of yellow style, presented in a tiny bundle like a miniature wheatsheaf) and \"konge\" (yellow style only, claimed to have aroma but with very little, if any, colouring potential). Grades of Spanish saffron are \"coup\u00e9\" (the strongest grade, like Iranian sargol), \"mancha\" (like Iranian pushal), and in order of further decreasing strength \"rio\", \"standard\" and \"sierra\" saffron. The word \"mancha\" in the Spanish classification can have two meanings: a general grade of saffron or a very high quality Spanish-grown saffron from a specific geographical origin. Real Spanish-grown La Mancha saffron has [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union#Protected designation of origin (PDO)|PDO]] protected status and this is displayed on the product packaging. Spanish growers fought hard for Protected Status because they felt that imports of Iranian saffron re-packaged in Spain and sold as \"Spanish Mancha saffron\" were undermining the genuine La Mancha brand. Similar was the case in Kashmir where imported Iranian saffron is mixed with local saffron and sold as \"Kashmir brand\" at a higher price.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.academia.edu/30720498 |title=Sustainable Saffron (''Crocus sativus'' Kashmirianus) Production: Technological and Policy Interventions for Kashmir |author1=Amjad Masood Husaini |author2=Azra N.

Artisan producers in Europe and New Zealand have offset their higher labour charges for saffron harvesting by targeting quality, only offering extremely high-grade saffron.\n\nIn addition to descriptions based on how the saffron is picked, saffron may be categorised under the international standard ISO 3632 after laboratory measurement of crocin (responsible for saffron's colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance or aroma) content.{{Sfn|Verma|Middha|2010|p=1\u20132}} However, often there is no clear grading information on the product packaging and little of the saffron readily available in the UK is labelled with ISO category. This lack of information makes it hard for customers to make informed choices when comparing prices and buying saffron.\n\nUnder ISO 3632, determination of non-stigma content (\"floral waste content\") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material (\"[[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]\") are also key. Grading standards are set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric [[absorbance]]. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20\u201350 for all categories.\n\nThese data are measured through [[spectrophotometry]] reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply greater levels of crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin is known as the \"colouring strength\" of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coup\u00e9 saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and Mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.\n\nHowever, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=274}} However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out a value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.\n\n===Adulteration===\n\nDespite attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron [[adulteration]], particularly among the cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the ''Safranschou'' code.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=102\u2013104}} Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like [[beetroot]], [[pomegranate]] fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like [[honey]] or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with [[turmeric]], [[paprika]], and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/long-reads/kashmirs-saffron-harvest-sees-sharp-decline-4216123.html|title=Kashmir's saffron harvest sees sharp decline |website=Firstpost|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freepresskashmir.com/2018/09/22/from-35kgs-earlier-to-1kg-yield-now-successful-saffron-mission-paves-way-for-apples-in-pampore/|title=From 35kgs earlier to 1kg yield now, 'successful' Saffron Mission paves way for apples in Pampore|last=Rashid|first=Afshan|date=2018-09-22|website=Free Press Kashmir|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=4 November 2003 |title=Kashmiri Saffron Producers See Red over Iranian Imports |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corp.]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/1504154 |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hussain |first=A. |date=28 January 2005 |title=Saffron Industry in Deep Distress |work=BBC News |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4216493.stm |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref> [[Safflower]] is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron.

The \"Aquila\" saffron, or ''zafferano dell'Aquila'', is defined by high safranal and crocin content, distinctive thread shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour; it is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's [[Abruzzo]] region, near [[L'Aquila]]. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican friar from inquisition-era Spain.{{when|date=October 2016}} But the biggest saffron cultivation in Italy is in [[San Gavino Monreale]], Sardinia, where it is grown on 40 hectares, representing 60% of Italian production; it too has unusually high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the \"Mongra\" or \"Lacha\" saffron of Kashmir (''Crocus sativus'' 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in Kashmir combine with an Indian export ban, contribute to its prohibitive overseas prices.

The theft of one such shipment by noblemen sparked the fourteen-week-long ''[[Saffron War]]''.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=99}} The conflict and resulting fear of rampant saffron piracy spurred corm cultivation in [[Basel]]; it thereby grew prosperous.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=101}} The crop then spread to [[Nuremberg]], where endemic and insalubrious adulteration brought on the ''Safranschou'' code\u2014whereby culprits were variously fined, imprisoned, and executed.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=103\u2013104}} Meanwhile, cultivation continued in southern France, Italy, and Spain.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=133}}\n\nThe [[Essex]] town of [[Saffron Walden]], named for its new specialty crop, emerged as a prime saffron growing and trading centre in the 16th and 17th centuries but cultivation there was abandoned; saffron was re-introduced around 2013 as well as other parts of the UK (Cheshire).<ref name=BBCessex2014>{{cite news|last1=Granleese|first1=Bob|title=Interview: Meet the saffron producer: 'It seemed ridiculous that the UK didn't grow it' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/16/meet-the-saffron-producer-uk |work=The Guardian|date=16 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Saffron spice returns to Essex after 200 years |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-essex-29943720 |work=BBC News|date=7 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===The Americas===\nEuropeans introduced saffron to the Americas when immigrant members of the [[Schwenkfelder Church]] left Europe with a trunk containing its corms. Church members had grown it widely in Europe.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=143}} By 1730, the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] cultivated saffron throughout eastern Pennsylvania. Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron, and high demand ensured that saffron's list price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was equal to gold.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=138}} Trade with the Caribbean later collapsed in the aftermath of the War of 1812, when many saffron-bearing merchant vessels were destroyed.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=138\u2013139}} Yet the Pennsylvania Dutch continued to grow lesser amounts of saffron for local trade and use in their cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=142\u2013146}} American saffron cultivation survives into modern times, mainly in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=143}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Books'''\n{{Refbegin|33em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Celsus|first=Aulus Cornelius|translator-last=Spencer|translator-first=W.

The champion also receives a gold medal, which they are allowed to keep permanently.

It is the sequel to 1997's ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'', and the second installment of the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]]. The game focuses on players taking on the role of a criminal as they roam a fictional futuristic city, conducting jobs for various crime syndicates and having free reign to do whatever they wish to achieve their goal. The game's intro is unique for a title in the series, as it involved live-action scenes filmed by Rockstar Games.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews from critics, though the GBC version fared the worst, but was a modest commercial success. ''Grand Theft Auto 2'' was succeed by ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' in October 2001, while the game itself was re-released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/1395/ |title=News \u2013 Rockstar Games Brings Full Line-up to Steam |author=[[Steam (software)|Steam]] |publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820162759/http://store.steampowered.com/news/1395 |archivedate=20 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[Image:GTA2 PC in-game screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''Grand Theft Auto 2'' being played at \"dusk\" in the Windows version.]]\nLike its predecessor ''Grand Theft Auto'', the game focuses on players completing a series of levels, each requiring a set target [[Score (game)#Video games|score]] being achieved in order to progress to the next stage. Points are awarded from various criminal actions such as destroying cars, selling vehicles, and completing [[Quest (video gaming)|missions]] for various crime syndicates, with the latter awarding more points than doing simple criminal actions. Unlike its predecessor, ''Grand Theft Auto 2'' is set in an unspecified time period - conflicting sources suggest anything from \"three weeks into the future\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/gta2/frameset.html |title=GTA2 \u2013 Frameset |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date= |accessdate=5 February 2011 }}</ref> to the year to be 2013,<ref name=\"rockstargames.com\"/> despite in-game references - and within a [[Retrofuturism|retrofuturistic]] metropolis referred to only as \"Anywhere, USA\",<ref name=\"rockstargames.com\">{{cite web | url=http://www.rockstargames.com/gta2/journal/journal_list.html | title=GTA2 \u2013 Individual Police Files |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |accessdate=29 April 2007 }}</ref> with each level focused on a different district of the city. Completing jobs earns points and a multiplier bonus, while failing them earns nothing. Creating chaos from their crimes will cause the player to be wanted by the police who will hound the player to arrest or kill them, with higher wanted levels increasing the level of response used. Being arrested or dying loses the player any equipment they found, and impacts their multiplier bonus.\n\n''Grand Theft Auto 2'' introduced several new features and improvements to the game. Players can now [[Saved game|save their game]] during a playthrough of a level by visiting the church they start at, but must pay a set amount of points to do so. Jobs on offer come from three different syndicates - each level features two unique syndicates, alongside a third syndicate present in all levels. By doing jobs for a syndicate and successfully completing it, the player gains respect with that syndicate, allowing them to take on tougher jobs with enough respect, but lose it with their chief rivals, locking them out of their jobs and making the syndicate's members hostile to the player. Other improvements include vehicles and pedestrians being more interactive with the game's environment - such as gang members engaging in fights with police - the presence of other criminals (such as muggers),<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/161/161648p1.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 \u2013 IGN |last=Blevins |first=Tal |website=[[IGN]] |date=18 November 1999 |accessdate=29 April 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213210410/http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/161/161648p1.html |archivedate=13 February 2008 }}</ref> a [[Health (gaming)|health meter]], garages that can modify vehicles with special improvements, a selection of side missions ranging from running a taxi to driving a semi-truck, and groups of 'hidden' [[Item (gaming)|packages]] to find across the level.\n\n== ''GTA 2 \u2013 The Movie'' ==\nThe game was developed with an eight-minute [[short film]] of [[live-action]] footage, filmed within New York City. The movie was devised as an introductory sequence for the game, and was made available on [[Rockstar Games]]'s website. The film focuses on the exploit of a criminal named Claude Speed ([[Scott Maslen]]), who conducts jobs around Anywhere City, before being killed by an assassin from one of the syndicates. The film was based on a screenplay by [[Dan Houser]], and directed by [[Alex De Rakoff]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\nEach area features five radio stations from a pool of eleven, one of which is heard as the player drives most vehicles in game. Changing radio stations for preference is possible. \"Head Radio\" was present in the original ''Grand Theft Auto'', ''Grand Theft Auto III'' and ''Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories''. Each gang has its own radio station that transmits within a limited area. Police vehicles, ambulances, fire trucks and tanks had no ability to listen to the radio channels. Instead, the player would hear the radio transmitter of the emergency services.\n\nAll the [[Video game music|music]] and the ads included in the game are exclusive, following the tradition of previous games. People in charge of the musical content were Craig Conner, Stuart Ross, Paul Scargill, Colin Anderson, Bert Reid and [[Moving Shadow]]. Some of these producers would keep their work on subsequent GTA releases.\n\nThe Game Boy Color version uses some real songs, one of which is a sped up version of [[Back in Black (song)|Back in Black]] by [[AC/DC]]. The Character Selection theme is an old Brazilian song titled \"[[Chega de Saudade]]\".\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 71.50% (PC)<ref name=\"GR PC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/197478-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for PC |accessdate=12 August 2012 |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620024652/http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/197478-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |archivedate=20 June 2012 }}</ref><br />70.80% (DC)<ref name=\"GR DC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/dreamcast/197479-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for Dreamcast |accessdate=12 August 2012 |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830094948/http://www.gamerankings.com/dreamcast/197479-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |archivedate=30 August 2012 }}</ref><br />69.92% (PS1)<ref name=\"GR PS1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps/185853-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for PlayStation |accessdate=12 August 2012 |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905210433/http://www.gamerankings.com/ps/185853-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |archivedate=5 September 2012 }}</ref><br />35.00% (GBC)<ref name=\"GR GBC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/gbc/562989-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for Game Boy Color |accessdate=12 August 2012 |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809001631/http://www.gamerankings.com/gbc/562989-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |archivedate=9 August 2012 }}</ref>\n| MC = 70/100 (PS1)<ref name=\"MC PS1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/grand-theft-auto-2 |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for PlayStation Reviews |accessdate=13 February 2013 |website=[[Metacritic]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430224838/http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/grand-theft-auto-2 |archivedate=30 April 2013 }}</ref>\n| GSpot = 6.9/10 (PS1)<ref name=\"GSpot PS\">{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/grand-theft-auto-2/platform/ps/ |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 -

The game focuses on players taking on the role of a criminal as they roam a fictional futuristic city, conducting jobs for various crime syndicates and having free reign to do whatever they wish to achieve their goal. The game's intro is unique for a title in the series, as it involved live-action scenes filmed by Rockstar Games.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews from critics, though the GBC version fared the worst, but was a modest commercial success. ''Grand Theft Auto 2'' was succeed by ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' in October 2001, while the game itself was re-released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/1395/ |title=News \u2013 Rockstar Games Brings Full Line-up to Steam |author=[[Steam (software)|Steam]] |publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]] |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820162759/http://store.steampowered.com/news/1395 |archivedate=20 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[Image:GTA2 PC in-game screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''Grand Theft Auto 2'' being played at \"dusk\" in the Windows version.]]\nLike its predecessor ''Grand Theft Auto'', the game focuses on players completing a series of levels, each requiring a set target [[Score (game)#Video games|score]] being achieved in order to progress to the next stage. Points are awarded from various criminal actions such as destroying cars, selling vehicles, and completing [[Quest (video gaming)|missions]] for various crime syndicates, with the latter awarding more points than doing simple criminal actions. Unlike its predecessor, ''Grand Theft Auto 2'' is set in an unspecified time period - conflicting sources suggest anything from \"three weeks into the future\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/gta2/frameset.html |title=GTA2 \u2013 Frameset |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date= |accessdate=5 February 2011 }}</ref> to the year to be 2013,<ref name=\"rockstargames.com\"/> despite in-game references - and within a [[Retrofuturism|retrofuturistic]] metropolis referred to only as \"Anywhere, USA\",<ref name=\"rockstargames.com\">{{cite web | url=http://www.rockstargames.com/gta2/journal/journal_list.html | title=GTA2 \u2013 Individual Police Files |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |accessdate=29 April 2007 }}</ref> with each level focused on a different district of the city. Completing jobs earns points and a multiplier bonus, while failing them earns nothing. Creating chaos from their crimes will cause the player to be wanted by the police who will hound the player to arrest or kill them, with higher wanted levels increasing the level of response used. Being arrested or dying loses the player any equipment they found, and impacts their multiplier bonus.\n\n''Grand Theft Auto 2'' introduced several new features and improvements to the game. Players can now [[Saved game|save their game]] during a playthrough of a level by visiting the church they start at, but must pay a set amount of points to do so. Jobs on offer come from three different syndicates - each level features two unique syndicates, alongside a third syndicate present in all levels. By doing jobs for a syndicate and successfully completing it, the player gains respect with that syndicate, allowing them to take on tougher jobs with enough respect, but lose it with their chief rivals, locking them out of their jobs and making the syndicate's members hostile to the player. Other improvements include vehicles and pedestrians being more interactive with the game's environment - such as gang members engaging in fights with police - the presence of other criminals (such as muggers),<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/161/161648p1.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 \u2013 IGN |last=Blevins |first=Tal |website=[[IGN]] |date=18 November 1999 |accessdate=29 April 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213210410/http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/161/161648p1.html |archivedate=13 February 2008 }}</ref> a [[Health (gaming)|health meter]], garages that can modify vehicles with special improvements, a selection of side missions ranging from running a taxi to driving a semi-truck, and groups of 'hidden' [[Item (gaming)|packages]] to find across the level.\n\n== ''GTA 2 \u2013 The Movie'' ==\nThe game was developed with an eight-minute [[short film]] of [[live-action]] footage, filmed within New York City. The movie was devised as an introductory sequence for the game, and was made available on [[Rockstar Games]]'s website. The film focuses on the exploit of a criminal named Claude Speed ([[Scott Maslen]]), who conducts jobs around Anywhere City, before being killed by an assassin from one of the syndicates. The film was based on a screenplay [[Dan Houser]] and directed by [[Alex De Rakoff]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n\nEach area features five radio stations from a pool of eleven, one of which is heard as the player drives most vehicles in game. Changing radio stations for preference is possible. \"Head Radio\" was present in the original ''Grand Theft Auto'', ''Grand Theft Auto III'' and ''Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories''. Each gang has its own radio station that transmits within a limited area. Police vehicles, ambulances, fire trucks and tanks had no ability to listen to the radio channels. Instead, the player would hear the radio transmitter of the emergency services.\n\nAll the [[Video game music|music]] and the ads included in the game are exclusive, following the tradition of previous games. People in charge of the musical content were Craig Conner, Stuart Ross, Paul Scargill, Colin Anderson, Bert Reid and [[Moving Shadow]]. Some of these producers would keep their work on subsequent GTA releases.\n\nThe Game Boy Color version uses some real songs, one of which is a sped up version of [[Back in Black (song)|Back in Black]] by [[AC/DC]]. The Character Selection theme is an old Brazilian song titled \"[[Chega de Saudade]]\".\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 71.50% (PC)<ref name=\"GR PC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/197478-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for PC |accessdate=12 August 2012 |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620024652/http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/197478-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |archivedate=20 June 2012 }}</ref><br />70.80% (DC)<ref name=\"GR DC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/dreamcast/197479-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for Dreamcast |accessdate=12 August 2012 |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830094948/http://www.gamerankings.com/dreamcast/197479-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |archivedate=30 August 2012 }}</ref><br />69.92% (PS1)<ref name=\"GR PS1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/ps/185853-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for PlayStation |accessdate=12 August 2012 |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905210433/http://www.gamerankings.com/ps/185853-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |archivedate=5 September 2012 }}</ref><br />35.00% (GBC)<ref name=\"GR GBC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/gbc/562989-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for Game Boy Color |accessdate=12 August 2012 |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809001631/http://www.gamerankings.com/gbc/562989-grand-theft-auto-2/index.html |archivedate=9 August 2012 }}</ref>\n| MC = 70/100 (PS1)<ref name=\"MC PS1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/grand-theft-auto-2 |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 for PlayStation Reviews |accessdate=13 February 2013 |website=[[Metacritic]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430224838/http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/grand-theft-auto-2 |archivedate=30 April 2013 }}</ref>\n| GSpot = 6.9/10 (PS1)<ref name=\"GSpot PS\">{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/grand-theft-auto-2/platform/ps/ |title=Grand Theft Auto 2 -

{"title_page": "Group ring", "text_new": "{{about|the algebraic group ring of a group|the case of a topological group|group algebra of a topological group}}\n\nIn [[algebra]], a '''group ring''' is a [[free module]] and at the same time a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], constructed in a natural way from any given ring and any given [[Group (mathematics)|group]]. As a free module, its ring of scalars is the given ring, and its basis is one-to-one with the given group. As a ring, its addition law is that of the free module and its multiplication extends \"by linearity\" the given group law on the basis. Less formally, a group ring is a generalization of a given group, by attaching to each element of the group a \"weighting factor\" from a given ring.\n\nA group ring is also referred to as a '''group algebra''', for it is indeed an [[Algebra over a ring|algebra]] over the given ring. A group algebra over a field has a further structure of a [[Hopf algebra]]; in this case, it is thus called a [[group Hopf algebra]].\n\nThe apparatus of group rings is especially useful in the theory of [[group representation]]s.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''G'' be a group, written multiplicatively, and let ''R'' be a ring. The group ring of ''G'' over ''R'', which we will denote by ''R''[''G''] (or simply ''RG''), is the set of mappings {{nowrap|''f'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''R''}} of [[Support (mathematics)#Generalization|finite support]],<ref name=\"Polcino\">Polcino & Sehgal (2002), p. 131.</ref> where the module scalar product ''\u03b1f'' of a scalar ''\u03b1'' in ''R'' and a vector (or mapping) ''f'' is defined as the vector <math>x \\mapsto \\alpha \\cdot f(x)</math>, and the module group sum of two vectors ''f'' and ''g'' is defined as the vector <math>x \\mapsto f(x) + g(x)</math>. To turn the additive group ''R''[''G''] into a ring, we define the product of ''f'' and ''g'' to be the vector\n:<math>x\\mapsto\\sum_{uv=x}f(u)g(v)=\\sum_{u\\in G}f(u)g(u^{-1}x).</math>\nThe summation is legitimate because ''f'' and ''g'' are of finite support, and the ring axioms are readily verified.\n\nSome variations in the notation and terminology are in use. In particular, the mappings such as {{nowrap|''f'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''R''}} are sometimes written as what are called \"formal linear combinations of elements of ''G'', with coefficients in ''R''\":<ref>Polcino & Sehgal (2002), p. 129 and 131.</ref>\n:<math>\\sum_{g\\in G}f(g) g,</math>\nor simply\n:<math>\\sum_{g\\in G}f_g g,</math>\nwhere this doesn't cause confusion.<ref name=\"Polcino\" />\n\n==Examples==\n1. Let {{nowrap|1=''G'' = ''C''<sub>3</sub>}}, the [[cyclic group]] of order 3, with generator <math>a</math> and identity element 1<sub>''G''</sub>. An element ''r'' of '''C'''[''G''] can be written as\n\n:<math>r = z_0 1_G + z_1 a + z_2 a^2\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''z''<sub>0</sub>, ''z''<sub>1</sub> and ''z''<sub>2</sub> are in '''C''', the [[complex numbers]]. This is the same thing as a [[polynomial ring]] in variable <math>a</math> such that <math>a^3=a^0=1</math> i.e. '''C'''[''G''] is isomorphic to the ring '''C'''[<math>a</math>]/<math>(a^3-1)</math>. Writing a different element ''s'' as <math>s=w_0 1_G +w_1 a +w_2 a^2\\,</math>\n\ntheir sum is\n\n:<math>r + s = (z_0+w_0) 1_G + (z_1+w_1) a + (z_2+w_2) a^2\\,</math>\n\nand their product is\n\n:<math>rs = (z_0w_0 + z_1w_2 + z_2w_1) 1_G  +(z_0w_1 + z_1w_0 + z_2w_2)a +(z_0w_2 + z_2w_0 + z_1w_1)a^2.</math>\n\nNotice that the identity element 1<sub>''G''</sub> of ''G'' induces a canonical embedding of the coefficient ring (in this case '''C''') into '''C'''[''G'']; however strictly speaking the multiplicative identity element of '''C'''[''G''] is 1\u22c51<sub>''G''</sub> where the first ''1'' comes from '''C''' and the second from ''G''. The additive identity element is zero.\n\nWhen ''G'' is a non-commutative group, one must be careful to preserve the order of the group elements (and not accidentally commute them) when multiplying the terms.\n\n2. A different example is that of the [[Laurent polynomial]]s over a ring ''R'': these are nothing more or less than the group ring of the [[infinite cyclic group]] '''Z''' over ''R''.\n\n3. Let ''Q'' be the [[quaternion group]] with elements <math>\\{e, \\bar{e}, i, \\bar{i}, j, \\bar{j}, k, \\bar{k}\\}</math>. Consider the group ring '''R'''''Q'', where '''R''' is the set of real numbers. An arbitrary element of this group ring is of the form\n\n:<math>x_1 \\cdot e + x_2 \\cdot \\bar{e} + x_3 \\cdot i + x_4 \\cdot \\bar{i} + x_5 \\cdot j + x_6 \\cdot \\bar{j} + x_7 \\cdot k + x_8 \\cdot \\bar{k}</math>\nwhere <math>x_i </math> is a real number.\n\nMultiplication, like in any other group ring, is defined based on the group operation. For example,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\big(3 \\cdot e + \\sqrt{2} \\cdot i \\big)\\big(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\bar{j}\\big) &= (3 \\cdot e)(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\bar{j}) + (\\sqrt{2} \\cdot i)(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\bar{j})\\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\big((e)(\\bar{j})\\big) + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\big((i)(\\bar{j})\\big)\\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\bar{j} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot k\n\\end{align}.</math>\n\nNote that '''R'''''Q'' is not the same as the Hamilton [[quaternions]] over '''R'''. This is because the Hamilton quaternions satisfy additional relations in the ring, such as <math>-1 \\cdot i = -i</math>, whereas in the group ring '''R'''''Q'', <math>-1\\cdot i</math> is not equal to <math>1\\cdot \\bar{i}</math>. To be more specific, '''R'''''Q'' has dimension 8 as a real [[vector space]], while the Hamilton quaternions have dimension 4 as a [[real vector space]].\n\n==Some basic properties==\nAssuming that the ring ''R'' has a unit element 1, and denoting the group unit by 1<sub>''G''</sub>, the ring ''R''[''G''] contains a subring isomorphic to ''R'', and its group of invertible elements contains a subgroup isomorphic to ''G''. For considering the  [[indicator function]] of {1<sub>''G''</sub>}, which is the vector ''f'' defined by\n:<math>f(g)= 1\\cdot 1_G + \\sum_{g\\not= 1_G}0 \\cdot g= \\mathbf{1}_{\\{1_G\\}}(g)=\\begin{cases}\n1 & g = 1_G \\\\\n0 & g \\ne 1_G\n\\end{cases},</math>\nthe set of all scalar multiples of ''f'' is a subring of ''R''[''G''] isomorphic to ''R''. And if we map each element ''s'' of ''G'' to the indicator function of {''s''}, which is the vector ''f'' defined by\n:<math>f(g)= 1\\cdot s + \\sum_{g\\not= s}0 \\cdot g= \\mathbf{1}_{\\{s\\}}(g)=\\begin{cases}\n1 & g = s \\\\\n0 & g \\ne s\n\\end{cases}</math>\nthe resulting mapping is an injective group homomorphism (with respect to multiplication, not addition, in ''R''[''G'']).\n\nIf ''R'' and ''G'' are both commutative (i.e., ''R'' is commutative and ''G'' is an [[abelian group]]), ''R''[''G''] is commutative.\n\nIf ''H'' is a [[subgroup]] of ''G'', then ''R''[''H''] is a [[subring]] of ''R''[''G''].  Similarly, if ''S'' is a subring of ''R'', ''S''[''G''] is a subring of ''R''[''G''].\n\nIf the order of the group ''G'' is strictly greater than 1; |''G''|>1, then ''R''[''G''] always has [[zero divisors]]. For example, consider an element ''g'' of ''G'' of order |''g''|>1. Then 1 - ''g'' is a zero divisor. Let |''g''| = ''m'' >1.\n\n:<math>\n(1 - g)(1 + g+...+g^{m-1}) = 1 - g^m = 1 - 1 =0\n</math>\n\nFor example, consider the group ring '''Z'''[''S''<sub>3</sub>] and the element of order 3 ''g''=(123). In this case,\n\n:<math>\n(1 - (123))(1 + (123)+ (132)) = 1 - (123)^3 = 1 - 1 =0\n</math>\n\n==Group algebra over a finite group==\nGroup algebras occur naturally in the theory of [[group representation]]s of [[finite group]]s. The group algebra ''K''[''G''] over a field ''K'' is essentially the group ring, with the field ''K'' taking the place of the ring. As a set and vector space, it is the [[free vector space]] on ''G'' over the field ''K''. That is, for ''x'' in ''K''[''G''],\n:<math>x=\\sum_{g\\in G} a_g g.</math>\n\nThe [[algebra over a field|algebra]] structure on the vector space is defined using the multiplication in the group:\n:<math>g \\cdot h = gh,</math>\nwhere on the left, ''g'' and ''h'' indicate elements of the group algebra, while the multiplication on the right is the group operation (denoted by juxtaposition).\n\nBecause the above multiplication can be confusing, one can also write the [[basis vector]]s of ''K''[''G''] as ''e''<sub>''g''</sub> (instead of ''g''), in which case the multiplication is written as:\n:<math>e_g \\cdot e_h = e_{gh}.</math>\n\n===Interpretation as functions===\nThinking of the [[free vector space]] as ''K''-valued functions on ''G'', the algebra multiplication is [[convolution]] of functions.\n\nWhile the group algebra of a ''finite'' group can be identified with the space of functions on the group, for an infinite group these are different. The group algebra, consisting of ''finite'' sums, corresponds to functions on the group that vanish for [[cofinitely]] many points; topologically (using the [[discrete topology]]), these correspond to functions with [[compact support]].\n\nHowever, the group algebra ''K''[''G''] and the space of functions {{nowrap|1=''K''<sup>''G''</sup> := Hom(''G'', ''K'')}} are dual: given an element of the group algebra\n\n:<math>x = \\sum_{g\\in G} a_g g</math>\n\nand a function on the group {{nowrap|''f'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''K''}} these pair to give an element of ''K'' via\n\n:<math>(x,f) = \\sum_{g\\in G} a_g f(g),</math>\n\nwhich is a well-defined sum because it is finite.\n\n===Regular representation===\n{{Main|Regular representation}}\nThe group algebra is an algebra over itself; under the correspondence of representations over ''R'' and ''R''[''G''] modules, it is the [[regular representation]] of the group.\n\nWritten as a representation, it is the representation ''g'' {{mapsto}} ''\u03c1''<sub>''g''</sub> with the action given by <math>\\rho(g)\\cdot e_h = e_{gh}</math>, or\n\n:<math>\\rho(g)\\cdot r =  \\sum_{h\\in G} k_h \\rho(g)\\cdot e_h = \\sum_{h\\in G} k_h e_{gh}. </math>\n\n===Properties===\nThe dimension of the vector space ''K''[''G''] is just equal to the number of elements in the group. The field ''K'' is commonly taken to be the complex numbers '''C''' or the reals '''R''', so that one discusses the group algebras '''C'''[''G''] or '''R'''[''G''].\n\nThe group algebra '''C'''[''G''] of a finite group over the complex numbers is a [[semisimple ring]]. This result, [[Maschke's theorem]], allows us to understand '''C'''[''G''] as a finite [[Product of rings|product]] of [[matrix ring]]s with entries in '''C'''.\n\n===Representations of a group algebra===\nTaking ''K''[''G''] to be an abstract algebra, one may ask for concrete [[group representation|representations]] of the algebra over a vector space ''V''. Such a representation\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}:K[G]\\rightarrow \\mbox{End} (V).</math>\n\nis an algebra homomorphism from the group algebra to the set of [[endomorphism]]s on ''V''. Taking ''V'' to be an [[abelian group]], with group addition given by vector addition, such a representation is in fact a [[module (mathematics)|left ''K''[''G'']-module]] over the abelian group ''V''.  This is demonstrated below, where each axiom of a module is confirmed.\n\nPick {{nowrap|''r'' \u2208 ''K''[''G'']}} so that \n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\in \\mbox{End}(V).</math>\nThen <math>\\tilde{\\rho}(r)</math> is a homomorphism of abelian groups, in that\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot (v_1 +v_2) =  \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot v_1 + \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot v_2</math>\n\nfor any {{nowrap|''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''V''}}. Next, one notes that the set of endomorphisms of an abelian group is an [[endomorphism ring]]. The representation <math>\\tilde{\\rho}</math> is a ring homomorphism, in that one has\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(r+s)\\cdot v =  \\tilde{\\rho}(r)\\cdot v + \\tilde{\\rho}(s)\\cdot v </math>\n\nfor any two {{nowrap|''r'', ''s'' \u2208 ''K''[''G'']}} and {{nowrap|''v'' \u2208 ''V''}}. Similarly, under multiplication,\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(rs)\\cdot v =  \\tilde{\\rho}(r)\\cdot \\tilde{\\rho}(s)\\cdot v. </math>\n\nFinally, one has that the unit is mapped to the identity:\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(1)\\cdot v = v</math>\n\nwhere 1 is the multiplicative unit of ''K''[''G'']; that is,\n\n: <math>1 = e_e</math>\n\nis the vector corresponding to the identity element ''e'' in ''G''.\n\nThe last three equations show that <math>\\tilde{\\rho}</math> is a ring homomorphism from ''K''[''G''] taken as a group ring, to the endomorphism ring. The first identity showed that individual elements are group homomorphisms. Thus, a representation <math>\\tilde{\\rho}</math> is a left ''K''[''G'']-module over the abelian group ''V''.\n\nNote that given a general ''K''[''G'']-module, a vector-space structure is induced on ''V'', in that one has an additional axiom\n\n:<math> \\tilde{\\rho}(ar) \\cdot v_1 + \\tilde{\\rho}(br) \\cdot v_2 = a \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot v_1 + b \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot v_2 = \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot (av_1 +bv_2)</math>\n\nfor scalar {{nowrap|''a'', ''b'' \u2208 ''K''}}.\n\nAny group representation\n\n:<math>\\rho:G\\rightarrow \\mbox{Aut}(V),</math>\n\nwith ''V'' a vector space over the field ''K'', can be extended to an algebra representation\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}:K[G]\\rightarrow \\mbox{End}(V),</math>\n\nsimply by letting <math>\\tilde{\\rho}(e_g) = \\rho(g)</math> and extending linearly. Thus, representations of the group correspond exactly to representations of the algebra, and so, in a certain sense, talking about the one is the same as talking about the other.\n\n===Center of a group algebra===\nThe [[center of a group|center]] of the group algebra is the set of elements that commute with all elements of the group algebra:\n:<math>\\mathrm{Z}(K[G]) := \\left\\{ z \\in K[G] : \\forall r \\in K[G], zr = rz \\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe center is equal to the set of [[class function]]s, that is the set of elements that are constant on each conjugacy class\n:<math>\\mathrm{Z}(K[G]) = \\left\\{ \\sum_{g \\in G} a_g g :  \\forall g,h \\in G, a_g = a_{h^{-1}gh}\\right\\}.</math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|1=''K'' = '''C'''}}, the set of irreducible [[character theory|characters]] of ''G'' forms an orthonormal basis of Z(''K''[''G'']) with respect to the inner product\n:<math>\\left \\langle \\sum_{g \\in G} a_g g, \\sum_{g \\in G} b_g g \\right \\rangle = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} \\bar{a}_g b_g.</math>\n\n==Group rings over an infinite group==\nMuch less is known in the case where ''G'' is countably infinite, or uncountable, and this is an area of active research.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Passman, Donald S.|title=What is a group ring?|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|volume=83|year=1976|pages=173\u2013185|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/what-is-a-group-ring|doi=10.2307/2977018}}</ref> The case where ''R'' is the field of complex numbers is probably the one best studied. In this case, [[Irving Kaplansky]] proved that if ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of '''C'''[''G''] with {{nowrap|1=''ab'' = 1}}, then {{nowrap|1=''ba'' = 1}}. Whether this is true if ''R'' is a field of positive characteristic remains unknown.\n\nA long-standing conjecture of Kaplansky (~1940) says that if ''G'' is a [[torsion-free group]], and ''K'' is a field, then the group ring ''K''[''G''] has no non-trivial [[zero divisor]]s. This conjecture is equivalent to ''K''[''G''] having no non-trivial [[nilpotent]]s under the same hypotheses for ''K'' and ''G''.\n\nIn fact, the condition that ''K'' is a field can be relaxed to any ring that can be embedded into an [[integral domain]].\n\nThe conjecture remains open in full generality, however some special cases of torsion-free groups have been shown to satisfy the zero divisor conjecture. These include:\n\n* Unique product groups (e.g. [[orderable group]]s, in particular [[free group]]s)\n* [[Elementary amenable group]]s (e.g. [[virtually abelian group]]s)\n* Diffuse groups \u2013 in particular, groups that act freely isometrically on ''R''-trees, and the fundamental groups of surface groups except for the fundamental groups of direct sums of one, two or three copies of the projective plane.\n\nThe case of ''G'' being a [[topological group]] is discussed in greater detail in the article [[group algebra of a locally compact group]].\n\n==Representations of a group ring==\nA module ''M'' over ''R''[''G''] is then the same as a [[group representation|linear representation]] of ''G'' over the field ''R''. There is no particular reason to limit ''R'' to be a field here. However, the classical results were obtained first when ''R'' is the [[complex number]] field and ''G'' is a finite group, so this case deserves close attention. It was shown that ''R''[''G''] is a [[semisimple ring]], under those conditions, with profound implications for the representations of finite groups. More generally, whenever the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the field ''R'' does not divide the order of the finite group ''G'', then ''R''[''G''] is semisimple ([[Maschke's theorem]]).\n\nWhen ''G'' is a finite [[abelian group]], the group ring is commutative, and its structure is easy to express in terms of [[root of unity|roots of unity]]. When ''R'' is a field of characteristic ''p'', and the prime number ''p'' divides the order of the finite group ''G'', then the group ring is ''not'' semisimple: it has a non-zero [[Jacobson radical]], and this gives the corresponding subject of [[modular representation theory]] its own, deeper character.\n\n==Category theory==\n\n===Adjoint===\n[[Category theory|Categorically]], the group ring construction is [[left adjoint]] to \"[[group of units]]\"; the following functors are an [[adjoint functors|adjoint pair]]:\n:<math>R[-]\\colon \\mathbf{Grp} \\to R\\mathbf{\\text{-}Alg}</math>\n:<math>(-)^\\times\\colon R\\mathbf{\\text{-}Alg} \\to \\mathbf{Grp}</math>\nwhere <math>R[-]</math> takes a group to its group ring over ''R'', and <math>(-)^\\times</math> takes an ''R''-algebra to its group of units.\n\nWhen {{nowrap|1=''R'' = '''Z'''}}, this gives an adjunction between the [[category of groups]] and the [[category of rings]], and the unit of the adjunction takes a group ''G'' to a group that contains trivial units: {{nowrap|1=''G'' \u00d7 {\u00b11} = {\u00b1''g''}.}} In general, group rings contain nontrivial units. If ''G'' contains elements ''a'' and ''b'' such that <math>a^n=1</math> and ''b'' does not normalize <math>\\langle a\\rangle</math> then the square of\n\n:<math>x=(a-1)b \\left (1+a+a^2+...+a^{n-1} \\right )</math>\n\nis zero, hence <math>(1+x)(1-x)=1</math>. The element {{nowrap|1 + ''x''}} is a unit of infinite order.\n\n=== Universal Property ===\nThe above adjunction expresses a universal property of group rings.<ref name=\"Polcino\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/group+algebra#general|title=group algebra in nLab|website=ncatlab.org|access-date=2017-11-01}}</ref> Let {{var|R}} be a  (commutative) ring, let {{var|G}} be a group, and let {{var|S}} be an {{var|R}}-algebra.

As a free module, its ring of scalars is the given ring, and its basis is one-to-one with the given group. As a ring, its addition law is that of the free module and its multiplication extends \"by linearity\" the given group law on the basis. Less formally, a group ring is a generalization of a given group, by attaching to each element of the group a \"weighting factor\" from a given ring.\n\nA group ring is also referred to as a '''group algebra''', for it is indeed an [[Algebra over a ring|algebra]] over the given ring. A group algebra over a field has a further structure of a [[Hopf algebra]]; in this case, it is thus called a [[group Hopf algebra]].\n\nThe apparatus of group rings is especially useful in the theory of [[group representation]]s.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''G'' be a group, written multiplicatively, and let ''R'' be a ring. The group ring of ''G'' over ''R'', which we will denote by ''R''[''G''] (or simply ''RG''), is the set of mappings {{nowrap|''f'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''R''}} of [[Support (mathematics)#Generalization|finite support]],<ref name=\"Polcino\">Polcino & Sehgal (2002), p. 131.</ref> where the module scalar product ''\u03b1f'' of a scalar ''\u03b1'' in ''R'' and a vector (or mapping) ''f'' is defined as the vector <math>x \\mapsto \\alpha \\cdot f(x)</math>, and the module group sum of two vectors ''f'' and ''g'' is defined as the vector <math>x \\mapsto f(x) + g(x)</math>. To turn the additive group ''R''[''G''] into a ring, we define the product of ''f'' and ''g'' to be the vector\n:<math>x\\mapsto\\sum_{uv=x}f(u)g(v)=\\sum_{u\\in G}f(u)g(u^{-1}x).</math>\nThe summation is legitimate because ''f'' and ''g'' are of finite support, and the ring axioms are readily verified.\n\nSome variations in the notation and terminology are in use. In particular, the mappings such as {{nowrap|''f'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''R''}} are sometimes written as what are called \"formal linear combinations of elements of ''G'', with coefficients in ''R''\":<ref>Polcino & Sehgal (2002), p. 129 and 131.</ref>\n:<math>\\sum_{g\\in G}f(g) g,</math>\nor simply\n:<math>\\sum_{g\\in G}f_g g,</math>\nwhere this doesn't cause confusion.<ref name=\"Polcino\" />\n\n==Examples==\n1. Let {{nowrap|1=''G'' = ''C''<sub>3</sub>}}, the [[cyclic group]] of order 3, with generator <math>a</math> and identity element 1<sub>''G''</sub>. An element ''r'' of '''C'''[''G''] can be written as\n\n:<math>r = z_0 1_G + z_1 a + z_2 a^2\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''z''<sub>0</sub>, ''z''<sub>1</sub> and ''z''<sub>2</sub> are in '''C''', the [[complex numbers]]. This is the same thing as a [[polynomial ring]] in variable <math>a</math> such that <math>a^3=a^0=1</math> i.e. '''C'''[''G''] is isomorphic to the ring '''C'''[<math>a</math>]/<math>(a^3-1)</math>. Writing a different element ''s'' as <math>s=w_0 1_G +w_1 a +w_2 a^2\\,</math>\n\ntheir sum is\n\n:<math>r + s = (z_0+w_0) 1_G + (z_1+w_1) a + (z_2+w_2) a^2\\,</math>\n\nand their product is\n\n:<math>rs = (z_0w_0 + z_1w_2 + z_2w_1) 1_G  +(z_0w_1 + z_1w_0 + z_2w_2)a +(z_0w_2 + z_2w_0 + z_1w_1)a^2.</math>\n\nNotice that the identity element 1<sub>''G''</sub> of ''G'' induces a canonical embedding of the coefficient ring (in this case '''C''') into '''C'''[''G'']; however strictly speaking the multiplicative identity element of '''C'''[''G''] is 1\u22c51<sub>''G''</sub> where the first ''1'' comes from '''C''' and the second from ''G''. The additive identity element is zero.\n\nWhen ''G'' is a non-commutative group, one must be careful to preserve the order of the group elements (and not accidentally commute them) when multiplying the terms.\n\n2. A different example is that of the [[Laurent polynomial]]s over a ring ''R'': these are nothing more or less than the group ring of the [[infinite cyclic group]] '''Z''' over ''R''.\n\n3. Let ''Q'' be the [[quaternion group]] with elements <math>\\{e, \\bar{e}, i, \\bar{i}, j, \\bar{j}, k, \\bar{k}\\}</math>. Consider the group ring '''R'''''Q'', where '''R''' is the set of real numbers. An arbitrary element of this group ring is of the form\n\n:<math>x_1 \\cdot e + x_2 \\cdot \\bar{e} + x_3 \\cdot i + x_4 \\cdot \\bar{i} + x_5 \\cdot j + x_6 \\cdot \\bar{j} + x_7 \\cdot k + x_8 \\cdot \\bar{k}</math>\nwhere <math>x_i </math> is a real number.\n\nMultiplication, like in any other group ring, is defined based on the group operation. For example,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\big(3 \\cdot e + \\sqrt{2} \\cdot i \\big)\\big(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\bar{j}\\big) &= (3 \\cdot e)(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\bar{j}) + (\\sqrt{2} \\cdot i)(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\bar{j})\\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\big((e)(\\bar{j})\\big) + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot \\big((i)(\\bar{j})\\big)\\\\\n&= \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\bar{j} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\cdot k\n\\end{align}.</math>\n\nNote that '''R'''''Q'' is not the same as the Hamilton [[quaternions]] over '''R'''. This is because the Hamilton quaternions satisfy additional relations in the ring, such as <math>-1 \\cdot i = -i</math>, whereas in the group ring '''R'''''Q'', <math>-1\\cdot i</math> is not equal to <math>1\\cdot \\bar{i}</math>. To be more specific, '''R'''''Q'' has dimension 8 as a real [[vector space]], while the Hamilton quaternions have dimension 4 as a [[real vector space]].\n\n==Some basic properties==\nAssuming that the ring ''R'' has a unit element 1, and denoting the group unit by 1<sub>''G''</sub>, the ring ''R''[''G''] contains a subring isomorphic to ''R'', and its group of invertible elements contains a subgroup isomorphic to ''G''. For considering the  [[indicator function]] of {1<sub>''G''</sub>}, which is the vector ''f'' defined by\n:<math>f(g)= 1\\cdot 1_G + \\sum_{g\\not= 1_G}0 \\cdot g= \\mathbf{1}_{\\{1_G\\}}(g)=\\begin{cases}\n1 & g = 1_G \\\\\n0 & g \\ne 1_G\n\\end{cases},</math>\nthe set of all scalar multiples of ''f'' is a subring of ''R''[''G''] isomorphic to ''R''. And if we map each element ''s'' of ''G'' to the indicator function of {''s''}, which is the vector ''f'' defined by\n:<math>f(g)= 1\\cdot s + \\sum_{g\\not= s}0 \\cdot g= \\mathbf{1}_{\\{s\\}}(g)=\\begin{cases}\n1 & g = s \\\\\n0 & g \\ne s\n\\end{cases}</math>\nthe resulting mapping is an injective group homomorphism (with respect to multiplication, not addition, in ''R''[''G'']).\n\nIf ''R'' and ''G'' are both commutative (i.e., ''R'' is commutative and ''G'' is an [[abelian group]]), ''R''[''G''] is commutative.\n\nIf ''H'' is a [[subgroup]] of ''G'', then ''R''[''H''] is a [[subring]] of ''R''[''G''].  Similarly, if ''S'' is a subring of ''R'', ''S''[''G''] is a subring of ''R''[''G''].\n\nIf the order of the group ''G'' is strictly greater than 1; |''G''|>1, then ''R''[''G''] always has [[zero divisors]]. For example, consider an element ''g'' of ''G'' of order |''g''|>1. Then 1 - ''g'' is a zero divisor. Let |''g''| = ''m'' >1.\n\n:<math>\n(1 - g)(1 + g+...+g^{m-1}) = 1 - g^m = 1 - 1 =0\n</math>\n\nFor example, consider the group ring '''Z'''[''S''<sub>3</sub>] and the element of order 3 ''g''=(123). In this case,\n\n:<math>\n(1 - (123))(1 + (123)+ (132)) = 1 - (123)^3 = 1 - 1 =0\n</math>\n\n==Group algebra over a finite group==\nGroup algebras occur naturally in the theory of [[group representation]]s of [[finite group]]s. The group algebra ''K''[''G''] over a field ''K'' is essentially the group ring, with the field ''K'' taking the place of the ring. As a set and vector space, it is the [[free vector space]] on ''G'' over the field ''K''. That is, for ''x'' in ''K''[''G''],\n:<math>x=\\sum_{g\\in G} a_g g.</math>\n\nThe [[algebra over a field|algebra]] structure on the vector space is defined using the multiplication in the group:\n:<math>g \\cdot h = gh,</math>\nwhere on the left, ''g'' and ''h'' indicate elements of the group algebra, while the multiplication on the right is the group operation (denoted by juxtaposition).\n\nBecause the above multiplication can be confusing, one can also write the [[basis vector]]s of ''K''[''G''] as ''e''<sub>''g''</sub> (instead of ''g''), in which case the multiplication is written as:\n:<math>e_g \\cdot e_h = e_{gh}.</math>\n\n===Interpretation as functions===\nThinking of the [[free vector space]] as ''K''-valued functions on ''G'', the algebra multiplication is [[convolution]] of functions.\n\nWhile the group algebra of a ''finite'' group can be identified with the space of functions on the group, for an infinite group these are different. The group algebra, consisting of ''finite'' sums, corresponds to functions on the group that vanish for [[cofinitely]] many points; topologically (using the [[discrete topology]]), these correspond to functions with [[compact support]].\n\nHowever, the group algebra ''K''[''G''] and the space of functions {{nowrap|1=''K''<sup>''G''</sup> := Hom(''G'', ''K'')}} are dual: given an element of the group algebra\n\n:<math>x = \\sum_{g\\in G} a_g g</math>\n\nand a function on the group {{nowrap|''f'' : ''G'' \u2192 ''K''}} these pair to give an element of ''K'' via\n\n:<math>(x,f) = \\sum_{g\\in G} a_g f(g),</math>\n\nwhich is a well-defined sum because it is finite.\n\n===Regular representation===\n{{Main|Regular representation}}\nThe group algebra is an algebra over itself; under the correspondence of representations over ''R'' and ''R''[''G''] modules, it is the [[regular representation]] of the group.\n\nWritten as a representation, it is the representation ''g'' {{mapsto}} ''\u03c1''<sub>''g''</sub> with the action given by <math>\\rho(g)\\cdot e_h = e_{gh}</math>, or\n\n:<math>\\rho(g)\\cdot r =  \\sum_{h\\in G} k_h \\rho(g)\\cdot e_h = \\sum_{h\\in G} k_h e_{gh}. </math>\n\n===Properties===\nThe dimension of the vector space ''K''[''G''] is just equal to the number of elements in the group. The field ''K'' is commonly taken to be the complex numbers '''C''' or the reals '''R''', so that one discusses the group algebras '''C'''[''G''] or '''R'''[''G''].\n\nThe group algebra '''C'''[''G''] of a finite group over the complex numbers is a [[semisimple ring]]. This result, [[Maschke's theorem]], allows us to understand '''C'''[''G''] as a finite [[Product of rings|product]] of [[matrix ring]]s with entries in '''C'''.\n\n===Representations of a group algebra===\nTaking ''K''[''G''] to be an abstract algebra, one may ask for concrete [[group representation|representations]] of the algebra over a vector space ''V''. Such a representation\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}:K[G]\\rightarrow \\mbox{End} (V).</math>\n\nis an algebra homomorphism from the group algebra to the set of [[endomorphism]]s on ''V''. Taking ''V'' to be an [[abelian group]], with group addition given by vector addition, such a representation is in fact a [[module (mathematics)|left ''K''[''G'']-module]] over the abelian group ''V''.  This is demonstrated below, where each axiom of a module is confirmed.\n\nPick {{nowrap|''r'' \u2208 ''K''[''G'']}} so that \n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\in \\mbox{End}(V).</math>\nThen <math>\\tilde{\\rho}(r)</math> is a homomorphism of abelian groups, in that\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot (v_1 +v_2) =  \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot v_1 + \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot v_2</math>\n\nfor any {{nowrap|''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2208 ''V''}}. Next, one notes that the set of endomorphisms of an abelian group is an [[endomorphism ring]]. The representation <math>\\tilde{\\rho}</math> is a ring homomorphism, in that one has\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(r+s)\\cdot v =  \\tilde{\\rho}(r)\\cdot v + \\tilde{\\rho}(s)\\cdot v </math>\n\nfor any two {{nowrap|''r'', ''s'' \u2208 ''K''[''G'']}} and {{nowrap|''v'' \u2208 ''V''}}. Similarly, under multiplication,\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(rs)\\cdot v =  \\tilde{\\rho}(r)\\cdot \\tilde{\\rho}(s)\\cdot v. </math>\n\nFinally, one has that the unit is mapped to the identity:\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}(1)\\cdot v = v</math>\n\nwhere 1 is the multiplicative unit of ''K''[''G'']; that is,\n\n: <math>1 = e_e</math>\n\nis the vector corresponding to the identity element ''e'' in ''G''.\n\nThe last three equations show that <math>\\tilde{\\rho}</math> is a ring homomorphism from ''K''[''G''] taken as a group ring, to the endomorphism ring. The first identity showed that individual elements are group homomorphisms. Thus, a representation <math>\\tilde{\\rho}</math> is a left ''K''[''G'']-module over the abelian group ''V''.\n\nNote that given a general ''K''[''G'']-module, a vector-space structure is induced on ''V'', in that one has an additional axiom\n\n:<math> \\tilde{\\rho}(ar) \\cdot v_1 + \\tilde{\\rho}(br) \\cdot v_2 = a \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot v_1 + b \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot v_2 = \\tilde{\\rho}(r) \\cdot (av_1 +bv_2)</math>\n\nfor scalar {{nowrap|''a'', ''b'' \u2208 ''K''}}.\n\nAny group representation\n\n:<math>\\rho:G\\rightarrow \\mbox{Aut}(V),</math>\n\nwith ''V'' a vector space over the field ''K'', can be extended to an algebra representation\n\n:<math>\\tilde{\\rho}:K[G]\\rightarrow \\mbox{End}(V),</math>\n\nsimply by letting <math>\\tilde{\\rho}(e_g) = \\rho(g)</math> and extending linearly. Thus, representations of the group correspond exactly to representations of the algebra, and so, in a certain sense, talking about the one is the same as talking about the other.\n\n===Center of a group algebra===\nThe [[center of a group|center]] of the group algebra is the set of elements that commute with all elements of the group algebra:\n:<math>\\mathrm{Z}(K[G]) := \\left\\{ z \\in K[G] : \\forall r \\in K[G], zr = rz \\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe center is equal to the set of [[class function]]s, that is the set of elements that are constant on each conjugacy class\n:<math>\\mathrm{Z}(K[G]) = \\left\\{ \\sum_{g \\in G} a_g g :  \\forall g,h \\in G, a_g = a_{h^{-1}gh}\\right\\}.</math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|1=''K'' = '''C'''}}, the set of irreducible [[character theory|characters]] of ''G'' forms an orthonormal basis of Z(''K''[''G'']) with respect to the inner product\n:<math>\\left \\langle \\sum_{g \\in G} a_g g, \\sum_{g \\in G} b_g g \\right \\rangle = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} \\bar{a}_g b_g.</math>\n\n==Group rings over an infinite group==\nMuch less is known in the case where ''G'' is countably infinite, or uncountable, and this is an area of active research.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Passman, Donald S.|title=What is a group ring?|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|volume=83|year=1976|pages=173\u2013185|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/what-is-a-group-ring|doi=10.2307/2977018}}</ref> The case where ''R'' is the field of complex numbers is probably the one best studied. In this case, [[Irving Kaplansky]] proved that if ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of '''C'''[''G''] with {{nowrap|1=''ab'' = 1}}, then {{nowrap|1=''ba'' = 1}}. Whether this is true if ''R'' is a field of positive characteristic remains unknown.\n\nA long-standing conjecture of Kaplansky (~1940) says that if ''G'' is a [[torsion-free group]], and ''K'' is a field, then the group ring ''K''[''G''] has no non-trivial [[zero divisor]]s. This conjecture is equivalent to ''K''[''G''] having no non-trivial [[nilpotent]]s under the same hypotheses for ''K'' and ''G''.\n\nIn fact, the condition that ''K'' is a field can be relaxed to any ring that can be embedded into an [[integral domain]].\n\nThe conjecture remains open in full generality, however some special cases of torsion-free groups have been shown to satisfy the zero divisor conjecture. These include:\n\n* Unique product groups (e.g. [[orderable group]]s, in particular [[free group]]s)\n* [[Elementary amenable group]]s (e.g. [[virtually abelian group]]s)\n* Diffuse groups \u2013 in particular, groups that act freely isometrically on ''R''-trees, and the fundamental groups of surface groups except for the fundamental groups of direct sums of one, two or three copies of the projective plane.\n\nThe case of ''G'' being a [[topological group]] is discussed in greater detail in the article on [[group algebra of a locally compact group]]s.\n\n==Representations of a group ring==\nA module ''M'' over ''R''[''G''] is then the same as a [[group representation|linear representation]] of ''G'' over the field ''R''. There is no particular reason to limit ''R'' to be a field here. However, the classical results were obtained first when ''R'' is the [[complex number]] field and ''G'' is a finite group, so this case deserves close attention. It was shown that ''R''[''G''] is a [[semisimple ring]], under those conditions, with profound implications for the representations of finite groups. More generally, whenever the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the field ''R'' does not divide the order of the finite group ''G'', then ''R''[''G''] is semisimple ([[Maschke's theorem]]).\n\nWhen ''G'' is a finite [[abelian group]], the group ring is commutative, and its structure is easy to express in terms of [[root of unity|roots of unity]]. When ''R'' is a field of characteristic ''p'', and the prime number ''p'' divides the order of the finite group ''G'', then the group ring is ''not'' semisimple: it has a non-zero [[Jacobson radical]], and this gives the corresponding subject of [[modular representation theory]] its own, deeper character.\n\n==Category theory==\n\n===Adjoint===\n[[Category theory|Categorically]], the group ring construction is [[left adjoint]] to \"[[group of units]]\"; the following functors are an [[adjoint functors|adjoint pair]]:\n:<math>R[-]\\colon \\mathbf{Grp} \\to R\\mathbf{\\text{-}Alg}</math>\n:<math>(-)^\\times\\colon R\\mathbf{\\text{-}Alg} \\to \\mathbf{Grp}</math>\nwhere <math>R[-]</math> takes a group to its group ring over ''R'', and <math>(-)^\\times</math> takes an ''R''-algebra to its group of units.\n\nWhen {{nowrap|1=''R'' = '''Z'''}}, this gives an adjunction between the [[category of groups]] and the [[category of rings]], and the unit of the adjunction takes a group ''G'' to a group that contains trivial units: {{nowrap|1=''G'' \u00d7 {\u00b11} = {\u00b1''g''}.}} In general, group rings contain nontrivial units. If ''G'' contains elements ''a'' and ''b'' such that <math>a^n=1</math> and ''b'' does not normalize <math>\\langle a\\rangle</math> then the square of\n\n:<math>x=(a-1)b \\left (1+a+a^2+...+a^{n-1} \\right )</math>\n\nis zero, hence <math>(1+x)(1-x)=1</math>. The element {{nowrap|1 + ''x''}} is a unit of infinite order.\n\n=== Universal Property ===\nThe above adjunction expresses a universal property of group rings.<ref name=\"Polcino\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/group+algebra#general|title=group algebra in nLab|website=ncatlab.org|access-date=2017-11-01}}</ref> Let {{var|R}} be a  (commutative) ring, let {{var|G}} be a group, and let {{var|S}} be an {{var|R}}-algebra.
