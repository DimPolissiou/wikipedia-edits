The high homology between the internal genes of [[H9N2]], [[H6N1]], and the [[H5N1]] isolates indicates that these subtypes are able to exchange their internal genes and are therefore a potential source of new pathogenic influenza virus strains.\"<ref>[http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/74/14/6309 Journal of Virology, July 2000, p. 6309-6315, Vol. 74, No. 14] article ''Characterization of the Influenza A Virus Gene Pool in Avian Species in Southern China: Was H6N1 a Derivative or a Precursor of H5N1?''</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fujian flu]]\n\n==Sources and notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/76/2/507#T1 Journal of Virology, January 2002, p. 507-516, Vol. 76, No. 2] article ''Molecular Evolution of H6 Influenza Viruses from Poultry in Southeastern China: Prevalence of H6N1 Influenza Viruses Possessing Seven A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1)-Like Genes in Poultry''\n\n{{Influenza}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q5584055}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goose Guandong Virus}}\n[[Category:Influenza A virus subtype H5N1]]\n[[Category:Infraspecific virus taxa]]\n", "name_user": "CaradhrasAiguo", "label": "safe", "comment": "Bypass redirect after move", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose_Guangdong_virus"}

This panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species especially over a wide area) outbreak was stopped by the killing of the entire domestic poultry population within the territory. The name ''H5N1'' refers to the subtypes of surface [[antigen]]s present on the [[virus]]: [[hemagglutinin]] type 5 and [[neuraminidase]] type 1.\n\nGenotype Z of H5N1 is now the dominant genotype of H5N1. Genotype Z is endemic in birds in southeast Asia and represents a long term pandemic threat.\n\n[[Influenza A virus]]es have 11 genes on eight separate [[RNA]] molecules [https://web.archive.org/web/20090221142916/http://www.microbiologybytes.com/virology/Orthomyxoviruses.html]:\n* PB2 ([[polymerase]] basic 2)\n* PB1 (polymerase basic 1)\n* PB1-F2 (alternate open reading frame near the 5' end of the PB1 gene)\n* PA (polymerase acidic)\n* HA ([[Hemagglutinin (influenza)|hemagglutinin]])\n* NP ([[Influenza virus nucleoprotein|nucleoprotein]])\n* NA ([[Viral neuraminidase|neuraminidase]])\n* [[M1 protein|M1]] and [[M2 protein|M2]] (matrix)\n* [[NS1 influenza protein|NS1]] (non-structural)\n*NEP/NS2 (nuclear export of vRNPs)\n\nTwo of the most important RNA molecules are HA and PB1. HA creates a surface antigen that is especially important in [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]]. PB1 creates a [[RNA polymerase|viral polymerase]] molecule that is especially important in [[virulence]].\n\nThe HA [[RNA]] molecule contains the HA gene, which codes for [[hemagglutinin]], which is an [[antigen]]ic [[glycoprotein]] found on the surface of the [[influenza]] [[virus]]es and is responsible for binding the virus to the [[cell (biology)|cell]] that is being infected. Hemagglutinin forms spikes at the surface of flu viruses that function to attach viruses to [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. This attachment is required for efficient transfer of flu virus genes into cells, a process that can be blocked by antibodies that bind to the hemagglutinin proteins.\n\nOne genetic factor in distinguishing between human flu viruses and avian flu viruses is that avian influenza HA bind alpha 2-3 [[sialic acid]] receptors while human influenza HA bind alpha 2-6 sialic acid receptors. Swine influenza viruses have the ability to bind both types of sialic acid receptors. Humans have avian-type receptors at very low densities and chickens have human-type receptors at very low densities. Some isolates taken from H5N1-infected human have been observed to have HA mutations at positions 182, 192, 223, 226, or 228 and these mutations have been shown to influence the selective binding of the virus to those previously mentioned sialic acid avian and/or human cell surface receptors. These are the types of mutations that can change a [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] virus into a [[flu pandemic]] virus.\n\nA 2008 [[virulence]] study that mated in a laboratory an [[avian flu]] [[H5N1]] virus that circulated in [[Thailand]] in 2004 and a [[human flu]] [[H3N2]] virus recovered in [[Wyoming]] in 2003 produced 63 viruses representing various potential combinations of human and avian [[influenza A virus]] genes. One in five were lethal to [[mice]] at low doses. The virus that most closely matched H5N1 for virulence was one with the [[hemagglutinin]] (HA), the [[neuraminidase]] (NA) and the PB1 avian flu virus RNA molecules with their genes combined with the remaining five RNA molecules (PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS) with their genes from the human flu virus.  Both the viruses from the [[1957 pandemic]] and [[1968 pandemic]] carried an avian flu virus PB1 gene. The authors suggest that picking up an avian flu virus PB1 gene may be a critical step in a potential [[flu pandemic]] virus arising through [[reassortment]].\"<ref>[http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5itNh1YRrll_NtPHKailnUqgYJz4g Canadian Press] article ''Study shows hybrids of bird flu and human flu viruses fit well, could occur'' published June 1, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605003734/http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5itNh1YRrll_NtPHKailnUqgYJz4g |date=June 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nPB1 codes for the PB1 protein and the PB1-F2 protein.

One of these is the Genus \"Influenzavirus A\" which consists of a single species called \"[[Influenza A virus]]\"; one of its subtypes is [[H5N1]].\n\nH5N1 (like the other avian flu viruses) has strains called \"highly pathogenic\" (HP) and \"low-pathogenic\" (LP). Avian influenza viruses that cause HPAI are highly [[virulent]], and mortality rates in infected [[Flock (birds)|flocks]] often approach 100%. LPAI viruses are generally of lower virulence, but these viruses can serve as progenitors to HPAI viruses. The current strain of H5N1 responsible for die-offs of domestic birds in Asia is an HPAI strain; other strains of H5N1 occurring elsewhere in the world are less virulent and, therefore, are classified as LPAI strains.

This panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species especially over a wide area) outbreak was stopped by the killing of the entire domestic poultry population within the territory. The name ''H5N1'' refers to the subtypes of surface [[antigen]]s present on the [[virus]]: [[hemagglutinin]] type 5 and [[neuraminidase]] type 1.\n\nGenotype Z of H5N1 is now the dominant genotype of H5N1. Genotype Z is endemic in birds in southeast Asia and represents a long term pandemic threat.\n\n[[Influenza A virus]]es have 11 genes on eight separate [[RNA]] molecules [https://web.archive.org/web/20090221142916/http://www.microbiologybytes.com/virology/Orthomyxoviruses.html]:\n* PB2 ([[polymerase]] basic 2)\n* PB1 (polymerase basic 1)\n* PB1-F2 (alternate open reading frame near the 5' end of the PB1 gene)\n* PA (polymerase acidic)\n* HA ([[Hemagglutinin (influenza)|hemagglutinin]])\n* NP ([[Influenza virus nucleoprotein|nucleoprotein]])\n* NA ([[Viral neuraminidase|neuraminidase]])\n* [[M1 protein|M1]] and [[M2 protein|M2]] (matrix)\n* [[NS1 influenza protein|NS1]] (non-structural)\n*NEP/NS2 (nuclear export of vRNPs)\n\nTwo of the most important RNA molecules are HA and PB1. HA creates a surface antigen that is especially important in [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]]. PB1 creates a [[RNA polymerase|viral polymerase]] molecule that is especially important in [[virulence]].\n\nThe HA [[RNA]] molecule contains the HA gene, which codes for [[hemagglutinin]], which is an [[antigen]]ic [[glycoprotein]] found on the surface of the [[influenza]] [[virus]]es and is responsible for binding the virus to the [[cell (biology)|cell]] that is being infected. Hemagglutinin forms spikes at the surface of flu viruses that function to attach viruses to [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. This attachment is required for efficient transfer of flu virus genes into cells, a process that can be blocked by antibodies that bind to the hemagglutinin proteins.\n\nOne genetic factor in distinguishing between human flu viruses and avian flu viruses is that avian influenza HA bind alpha 2-3 [[sialic acid]] receptors while human influenza HA bind alpha 2-6 sialic acid receptors. Swine influenza viruses have the ability to bind both types of sialic acid receptors. Humans have avian-type receptors at very low densities and chickens have human-type receptors at very low densities. Some isolates taken from H5N1-infected human have been observed to have HA mutations at positions 182, 192, 223, 226, or 228 and these mutations have been shown to influence the selective binding of the virus to those previously mentioned sialic acid avian and/or human cell surface receptors. These are the types of mutations that can change a [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] virus into a [[flu pandemic]] virus.\n\nA 2008 [[virulence]] study that mated in a laboratory an [[avian flu]] [[H5N1]] virus that circulated in [[Thailand]] in 2004 and a [[human flu]] [[H3N2]] virus recovered in [[Wyoming]] in 2003 produced 63 viruses representing various potential combinations of human and avian [[influenza A virus]] genes. One in five were lethal to [[mice]] at low doses. The virus that most closely matched H5N1 for virulence was one with the [[hemagglutinin]] (HA), the [[neuraminidase]] (NA) and the PB1 avian flu virus RNA molecules with their genes combined with the remaining five RNA molecules (PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS) with their genes from the human flu virus.  Both the viruses from the [[1957 pandemic]] and [[1968 pandemic]] carried an avian flu virus PB1 gene. The authors suggest that picking up an avian flu virus PB1 gene may be a critical step in a potential [[flu pandemic]] virus arising through [[reassortment]].\"<ref>[http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5itNh1YRrll_NtPHKailnUqgYJz4g Canadian Press] article ''Study shows hybrids of bird flu and human flu viruses fit well, could occur'' published June 1, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605003734/http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5itNh1YRrll_NtPHKailnUqgYJz4g |date=June 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nPB1 codes for the PB1 protein and the PB1-F2 protein.

One of these is the Genus \"Influenzavirus A\" which consists of a single species called \"[[Influenza A virus]]\"; one of its subtypes is [[H5N1]].\n\nH5N1 (like the other avian flu viruses) has strains called \"highly pathogenic\" (HP) and \"low-pathogenic\" (LP). Avian influenza viruses that cause HPAI are highly [[virulent]], and mortality rates in infected [[Flock (birds)|flocks]] often approach 100%. LPAI viruses are generally of lower virulence, but these viruses can serve as progenitors to HPAI viruses. The current strain of H5N1 responsible for die-offs of domestic birds in Asia is an HPAI strain; other strains of H5N1 occurring elsewhere in the world are less virulent and, therefore, are classified as LPAI strains. All HPAI strains identified to date have involved H5 and H7 subtypes. The distinction concerns pathogenicity in poultry, not humans. Normally a highly pathogenic avian virus is not highly pathogenic to either humans or non-poultry birds. This current strain of H5N1 is unusual in being deadly to so many species.\n\nBoth \"influenza\" (meaning flu) and \"A\" (meaning species type A) can be used as adjectives of the noun \"virus\" resulting in the noun phrase \"influenza A virus\"; which when capitalized  is the proper noun [[Influenza A virus]] which is the name of the species the noun phrase ''also'' refers to.\n\n==Context==\n[[Image:Flu und legende color c.jpg|thumb|500px]]\n;Virus\nA [[virus]] is one type of microscopic [[parasite]] that [[Infectious diseases|infect]]s [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in biological organisms.\n\n;Orthomyxoviridae\nThe [[Orthomyxoviridae]] are a family of [[RNA virus]]es which infect vertebrates.

The segmentation of the influenza [[genome]] facilitates [[genetic recombination]] by segment reassortment in hosts who are infected with two different influenza viruses at the same time. H5N1 viruses can [[reassortment|reassort]] genes with other strains that co-infect a host organism, such as a pig, bird, or human, and mutate into a form that can pass easily among humans. This is one of many possible paths to a pandemic.\n\nThe ability of various influenza strains to show species-selectivity is largely due to variation in the [[hemagglutinin]] genes. Genetic [[mutation]]s in the hemagglutinin gene that cause single [[amino acid]] substitutions can significantly alter the ability of viral hemagglutinin proteins to bind to [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on the surface of host cells. Such mutations in avian H5N1 viruses can change virus strains from being inefficient at infecting human cells to being as efficient in causing human infections as more common human influenza virus types.<ref name=\"Gambaryan\">{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Gambaryan A, Tuzikov A, Pazynina G, Bovin N, Balish A, Klimov A | title=Fatal Evolution of the receptor binding phenotype of influenza A (H5) viruses | journal=Virology | year=2006 | pages=432\u2013438 | volume=344 | issue=2 | pmid=16226289 | doi=10.1016/j.virol.2005.08.035\n\n}}</ref> This doesn't mean that one amino acid substitution can cause a pandemic, but it does mean that one amino acid substitution can cause an avian flu virus that is not pathogenic in humans to become pathogenic in humans.\n\n[[H3N2]] (\"[[swine flu]]\") is endemic in pigs in China, and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains.

The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment is a major concern.

Our analysis showed several new findings. First, all European, Middle Eastern, and African samples fall into a clade that is distinct from other contemporary Asian clades, all of which share common ancestry with the original 1997 Hong Kong strain. Phylogenetic trees built on each of the 8 segments show a consistent picture of 3 lineages, as illustrated by the HA tree shown in Figure 1. Two of the clades contain exclusively Vietnamese isolates; the smaller of these, with 5 isolates, we label V1; the larger clade, with 9 isolates, is V2. The remaining 22 isolates all fall into a third, clearly distinct clade, labeled EMA, which comprises samples from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Trees for the other 7 segments display a similar topology, with clades V1, V2, and EMA clearly separated in each case.

Our analysis showed several new findings. First, all European, Middle Eastern, and African samples fall into a clade that is distinct from other contemporary Asian clades, all of which share common ancestry with the original 1997 Hong Kong strain. Phylogenetic trees built on each of the 8 segments show a consistent picture of 3 lineages, as illustrated by the HA tree shown in Figure 1. Two of the clades contain exclusively Vietnamese isolates; the smaller of these, with 5 isolates, we label V1; the larger clade, with 9 isolates, is V2. The remaining 22 isolates all fall into a third, clearly distinct clade, labeled EMA, which comprises samples from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Trees for the other 7 segments display a similar topology, with clades V1, V2, and EMA clearly separated in each case.

Avian influenza viruses that cause HPAI are highly [[virulence|virulent]], and mortality rates in infected flocks often approach 100%. LPAI viruses have negligible virulence, but these viruses can serve as progenitors to HPAI viruses.

All HPAI strains identified to date have involved H5 and H7 subtypes. The distinction concerns pathogenicity in poultry, not humans. Normally, a highly pathogenic avian virus is not highly pathogenic to either humans or nonpoultry birds.

Therefore, USDA now tracks these detections in wild birds, backyard flocks, commercial flocks and live bird markets.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB?contentidonly=true&contentid=2006/08/0296.xml| publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA)| title=Avian Influenza Low Pathogenic H5N1 vs. Highly Pathogenic H5N1 - Latest Update| date=August 17, 2006| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409045125/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB?contentidonly=true&contentid=2006%2F08%2F0296.xml| archive-date=April 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===High mutation rate===\nInfluenza viruses have a relatively high mutation rate that is characteristic of [[RNA virus]]es.

Genetic [[mutation]]s in the hemagglutinin gene that cause single [[amino acid]] substitutions can significantly alter the ability of viral hemagglutinin proteins to bind to [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] on the surface of host cells. Such mutations in avian H5N1 viruses can change virus strains from being inefficient at infecting human cells to being as efficient in causing human infections as more common human influenza virus types.<ref name=Gambaryan>{{cite journal|vauthors=Gambaryan A, Tuzikov A, Pazynina G, Bovin N, Balish A, Klimov A | title=Fatal Evolution of the receptor binding phenotype of influenza A (H5) viruses | journal=Virology | year=2006 | pages=432\u2013438 | volume=344 | issue=2 | pmid=16226289| doi=10.1016/j.virol.2005.08.035}}</ref> This doesn't mean that one amino acid substitution can cause a pandemic, but it does mean that one amino acid substitution can cause an avian flu virus that is not pathogenic in humans to become pathogenic in humans.\n\n[[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2]] is endemic in pigs in China, and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. The dominant strain of annual flu virus in January 2006 was [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]], which is now resistant to the standard antiviral drugs [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]]. The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment is a major concern. If a reassortment in H5N1 occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype, or it could shift subtypes, as [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2|H2N2]] did when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]].\n\nBoth the [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2|H2N2]] and [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]] pandemic strains contained [[avian influenza]] virus RNA segments. \"While the pandemic human influenza viruses of 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) clearly arose through reassortment between human and avian viruses, the influenza virus causing the 'Spanish flu' in 1918 appears to be entirely derived from an avian source\".<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book| author1 = Harder, T.

(''Source: Dr. Erskine Palmer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Image Library'')]]\n\nInfected birds transmit H5N1 through their [[saliva]], [[mucus|nasal secretions]], [[feces]] and [[blood]]. Other animals may become infected with the virus through direct contact with these bodily fluids or through contact with surfaces contaminated with them. H5N1 remains infectious after over 30 days at {{Convert|0|C}} (over one month at freezing temperature) or 6 days at {{Convert|37|C}} (one week at human body temperature); at ordinary temperatures it lasts in the environment for weeks. In Arctic temperatures, it does not degrade at all.\n\nBecause migratory birds are among the carriers of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, it is spreading to all parts of the world. H5N1 is different from all previously known highly pathogenic avian flu viruses in its ability to be spread by animals other than poultry.\n\nIn October 2004, researchers discovered H5N1 is far more dangerous than was previously believed. [[Waterfowl]] were revealed to be directly spreading this highly pathogenic strain to [[chicken]]s, [[crow]]s, [[pigeon]]s, and other birds, and the virus was increasing its ability to infect mammals, as well. From this point on, avian flu experts increasingly referred to containment as a strategy that can delay, but not ultimately prevent, a future avian flu pandemic.\n\n\"Since 1997, studies of influenza A (H5N1) indicate that these viruses continue to evolve, with changes in antigenicity and internal gene constellations; an expanded host range in avian species and the ability to infect felids; enhanced pathogenicity in experimentally infected mice and ferrets, in which they cause systemic infections; and increased environmental stability.\"<ref name=biegel>{{cite journal|author=Beigel JH, Farrar J, Han AM, Hayden FG, Hyer R, de Jong MD, Lochindarat S, Nguyen TK, Nguyen TH, Tran TH, Nicoll A, Touch S, Yuen KY; Writing Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) Consultation on Human Influenza A/H5.|title=Avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in humans|journal=N.

Before our project, GenBank contained only 5 other complete genomes from Europe for the 2004\u20132006 period, and it contained no whole genomes from the Middle East or northern Africa. Our analysis showed several new findings. First, all European, Middle Eastern, and African samples fall into a clade that is distinct from other contemporary Asian clades, all of which share common ancestry with the original 1997 Hong Kong strain. Phylogenetic trees built on each of the 8 segments show a consistent picture of 3 lineages, as illustrated by the HA tree shown in Figure 1. Two of the clades contain exclusively Vietnamese isolates; the smaller of these, with 5 isolates, we label V1; the larger clade, with 9 isolates, is V2.

Avian influenza viruses that cause HPAI are highly [[virulence|virulent]], and mortality rates in infected flocks often approach 100%. LPAI viruses have negligible virulence, but these viruses can serve as progenitors to HPAI viruses. The strain of H5N1 responsible for the deaths of birds across the world is an HPAI strain; all other strains of H5N1, including a North American strain that causes no disease at all in any species, are LPAI strains. All HPAI strains identified to date have involved H5 and H7 subtypes. The distinction concerns pathogenicity in poultry, not humans. Normally, a highly pathogenic avian virus is not highly pathogenic to either humans or nonpoultry birds. This deadly strain of H5N1 is unusual in being deadly to so many species, including some, like domestic cats, never previously susceptible to any [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza virus]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Parker-Pope |first=Tara |url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/the-cat-who-got-swine-flu/ |title=The Cat Who Got Swine Flu |work=The New York Times |date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2010-04-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108150018/http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/the-cat-who-got-swine-flu/ |archive-date=November 8, 2009 |name-list-format=vanc }}</ref>\n\n===Genetic structure and related subtypes===\n[[File:Neuraminidase Ribbon Diagram.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''N'' in H5N1 stands for \"[[Viral neuraminidase|Neuraminidase]]\", the protein depicted in this ribbon diagram]]\nH5N1 is a subtype of the species ''Influenza A virus'' of the [[genus]] ''[[Alphainfluenzavirus]]'' of the family ''[[Orthomyxoviridae]]''.

The dominant strain of annual flu virus in January 2006 was [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]], which is now resistant to the standard antiviral drugs [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]]. The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment is a major concern. If a reassortment in H5N1 occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype, or it could shift subtypes, as [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2|H2N2]] did when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]].\n\nBoth the [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2|H2N2]] and [[Influenza A virus subtype H3N2|H3N2]] pandemic strains contained [[avian influenza]] virus RNA segments. \"While the pandemic human influenza viruses of 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) clearly arose through reassortment between human and avian viruses, the influenza virus causing the 'Spanish flu' in 1918 appears to be entirely derived from an avian source\".<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book| author1 = Harder, T.

(''Source: Dr. Erskine Palmer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Image Library'')]]\n\nInfected birds transmit H5N1 through their [[saliva]], [[mucus|nasal secretions]], [[feces]] and [[blood]]. Other animals may become infected with the virus through direct contact with these bodily fluids or through contact with surfaces contaminated with them. H5N1 remains infectious after over 30 days at {{Convert|0|C}} (over one month at freezing temperature) or 6 days at {{Convert|37|C}} (one week at human body temperature); at ordinary temperatures it lasts in the environment for weeks. In Arctic temperatures, it does not degrade at all.\n\nBecause migratory birds are among the carriers of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, it is spreading to all parts of the world. H5N1 is different from all previously known highly pathogenic avian flu viruses in its ability to be spread by animals other than poultry.\n\nIn October 2004, researchers discovered H5N1 is far more dangerous than was previously believed. [[Waterfowl]] were revealed to be directly spreading this highly pathogenic strain to [[chicken]]s, [[crow]]s, [[pigeon]]s, and other birds, and the virus was increasing its ability to infect mammals, as well. From this point on, avian flu experts increasingly referred to containment as a strategy that can delay, but not ultimately prevent, a future avian flu pandemic.\n\n\"Since 1997, studies of influenza A (H5N1) indicate that these viruses continue to evolve, with changes in antigenicity and internal gene constellations; an expanded host range in avian species and the ability to infect felids; enhanced pathogenicity in experimentally infected mice and ferrets, in which they cause systemic infections; and increased environmental stability.\"<ref name=biegel>{{cite journal|author=Beigel JH, Farrar J, Han AM, Hayden FG, Hyer R, de Jong MD, Lochindarat S, Nguyen TK, Nguyen TH, Tran TH, Nicoll A, Touch S, Yuen KY; Writing Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) Consultation on Human Influenza A/H5.|title=Avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in humans|journal=N.
