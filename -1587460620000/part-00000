Tom was a prominent doctor at Salem University Hospital and fathered five children, [[Tom Horton, Jr.|Tommy]], [[Addie Horton|Addie]], [[Mickey Horton|Mickey]], [[Bill Horton (Days of our Lives)|Bill]], and [[Marie Horton|Marie]]. In 1968 Tom would learn that his son Mickey was sterile, and when he confronted [[Laura Horton]] (Mickey's current wife) about her pregnancy she told Tom that Bill had raped her. The two agreed to keep their secrets from Mickey to spare his feelings. In 1977, Tom had a heart attack and remained in the hospital for several months. In 1978, Tom was promoted to Chief of Staff at University Hospital. Tom Horton read poetry, which he wrote himself, under the name Norm De Plume. He also wore a disguise so Alice wouldn't know what he was up to. When it was discovered their first marriage was invalid they married again on October 17, 1989. In 1993, Alice and Tom founded the Horton Center, which ran out of their home. The Horton Center provided shelter and help to run-away teens or families in need. Tom last appeared onscreen on February 9, 1994 due to Carey's failing health. Following Carey's death in March 1994, the character of Tom died off screen on June 21, 1994.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horton, Tom}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1965]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n\n\n{{soap-char-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{for|the rugby player|Tom Horton (rugby union)}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2012}}\n{{all plot|date=October 2012}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Days of our Lives\n| portrayer = [[MacDonald Carey]]\n| years = 1965\u201394\n| first = November 8, 1965\n| last = February 9, 1994\n| cause = Died peacefully in his sleep from a heart attack\n| image1 = File:MacDonaldCarey.jpg\n| caption1 = MacDonald Carey as Dr. Tom Horton\n| alias = Dr. H <br> Norm de Plume\n| gender = Male\n| creator        = Peggy Phillips<br> Kenneth Rosen\n| introducer = [[Ted Corday]]\n| family = Horton\n| classification = [[List of previous Days of Our Lives cast members|Former, regular]]\n| occupation = Chief of Staff of Salem University Hospital <br> Co-founder of the Horton Center <br> Former Chief of Internal Medicine at University Hospital <br> Former Staff physician at University Hospital <br> Former Professional of internal medicine at Salem University Medical School <br> Former Captain in the U.S. military <br> Former Minor league baseball player (pitcher; while in college) \n| parents = William Horton <br> Adelaide Horton \n| spouse = [[Alice Horton|Alice Grayson]]<!--maiden name for here--> <br> (1930\u201388, 1988\u201394)<ref name=\"Tom and Alice\">{{Cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512064220/http://www.nbc.com/Days_of_our_Lives/features/love.shtml|url=http://www.nbc.com/Days_of_our_Lives/features/love.shtml|title=Days of our Life Soap Opera|publisher=[[NBC]]|work=[[Days of Our Lives]]|archivedate=May 12, 2008|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref>\n| children = [[Tom Horton, Jr.]] <br>[[Addie Horton]] <br>[[Mickey Horton]] <br>[[Bill Horton (Days of our Lives)|Bill Horton]]<br>[[Marie Horton]]\n| grandchildren = [[Julie Olson Williams]]<br>Steve Olson <br> [[Sandy Horton]] <br> Jessica Blake Fallon <br> [[Mike Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Mike Horton]]<br>[[Hope Williams Brady]] <br> [[Jennifer Horton]] <br>[[Melissa Horton]] (adoptive) <br>[[Sarah Horton]] (legal)<br>[[Lucas Horton]]\n| grandparents =\n| aunts/uncles =\n| cousins =\n}}\n'''Dr. Thomas \"Tom\" Horton''' is a [[fictional character]] and patriarch of the Horton family on the [[NBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''.
