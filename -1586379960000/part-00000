life peer and one-time Conservative cabinet minister. He spent part of his childhood in Sydney, Australia, while his father edited the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''. On the family's return to the UK, he was educated at [[Abingdon School]], at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], and at the [[University of Law|College of Law]]. He was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]] at the [[Inner Temple]] in 1977, and practised criminal law.\n\nHe served as a member of [[Westminster City Council]] from 1978 to 1984.\n\n==Political career==\n\n===In government, 1983\u20131992===\nMaude was first elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to represent the constituency of [[North Warwickshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Warwickshire]] in the Conservative Party's landslide victory at the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]]. In 1984, he became the [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the [[Minister of State|Minister]] for Employment [[Peter Morrison]]. Maude then became an assistant government [[whip (politics)|whip]] (1985\u201387) and Minister for Corporate and Consumer Affairs (1987\u201389), then part of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]]. A Thatcherite, Maude was appointed in 1989 the [[Minister for Europe]] in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] to spearhead the policy outlined in the [[Bruges Group (United Kingdom)|Bruges Speech]], attacking the [[Delors Commission|Delors Plan]] in order to exclude Britain from an economic and political Union of Europe. In 1992 he acted as deputy for [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Norman Lamont]] and was one of the two UK signatories to the [[Maastricht Treaty]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/cf373d1a-0c53-11e1-8ac6-00144feabdc0|title=Subscribe to read {{!}} Financial Times|website=www.ft.com|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\nMaude was one of the first \"men in grey suits\" to hold discussions with [[Margaret Thatcher]] in November 1990 after she failed to win the first round of a [[1990 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|leadership election]]. He told Thatcher that he would support her as long as she went on, but he did not believe she could win the leadership contest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Falling from power: Cabinet overboard (memoirs extract)|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/commentary/displaydocument.asp?docid=109189|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate =16 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[John Major]] became [[Prime Minister]], Maude was made the [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]]. However, in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] he lost his seat to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate, [[Mike O'Brien (UK politician)|Mike O'Brien]], and was thus forced to vacate his ministerial roles. According to [[Daniel Finkelstein]] of ''[[The Times]]'' the loss came as a 'terrible blow' to Maude; all his peers had managed to cling on and were together forming a government. In the [[1992 Dissolution Honours|Dissolution Honours that year]], he was made a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=52943 |date=5 June 1992 |page=2  |supp=y}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2006 interview, Maude stated that the introduction of [[Section 28]] legislation whilst he was in Government (which banned Councils from promoting homosexuality and led to the closure of gay support groups) was \"a mistake\", adding it might have even contributed to the [[AIDS]] death of his brother Charles, who was homosexual, among others.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tory Chairman: Gay policies were wrong|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-448.html#|newspaper=Pink News|date=9 February 2006|accessdate=12 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085109/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-448.html|archive-date=29 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2012 he expanded further on his views on [[Section 28]], saying \"in hindsight, it was very wrong \u2014 very wrong. It was a legislative provision that came out of honourable motives. It took me some time to realise what an emblem of intolerance Section 28 had become for gay people. It was the tip of a deep iceberg \u2014 the iceberg below the surface being a host of anti-gay social attitudes.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/9150056/Francis-Maude-My-brothers-Aids-death-transformed-my-views-on-gay-marriage.html |title=Francis Maude: My brother's Aids death transformed my views on gay marriage|author= Patrick Sawer|work=Daily Telegraph|date=17 March 2012|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Out of Parliament, 1992\u20131997===\nOut of [[Parliament]] after the 1992 general election, Maude began a series of business roles. He worked in banking as managing director at [[Morgan Stanley]] from 1993 to 1997. He was also appointed a non-executive director of [[Asda|ASDA Group Plc]] in July 1992, and served as a director of [[Salomon Brothers]] from 1992 to 1993. He also chaired the government's Deregulation Task Force from 1994 to 1997. This was preparation as Cabinet Office Minister from 2010, when he was required to highlight areas of expenditure where savings could be made from streamlining the delivery and implementation of policy goals.\n\n===Shadow Cabinet, 1997\u20132010===\nIn the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] Maude was elected MP for [[Horsham (UK Parliament constituency)|Horsham]]. Almost immediately he was re-appointed to the Conservative [[front bench]], now the [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]] in Parliament. He served as Shadow [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]], Shadow [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], and Shadow [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] until 2001.\n\nMaude managed [[Michael Portillo]]'s unsuccessful bid for the Conservative leadership in 2001, after which he declined a front bench role under the new Party Leader [[Iain Duncan Smith]]. He was considered to be a 'moderniser' and on the centre-left of the party, writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (24 June 2002), he said that the Conservative Party's electoral problems had been caused by its failure to \"look and sound like modern Britain\". [[Norman Tebbit]]'s secretary, Beryl Goldsmith, criticised Maude after this, asking:{{quote|How many male, white, straight Conservative MPs currently passionately campaigning for the selection of more women, and more men and women from ethnic minorities, would voluntarily relinquish their own seats in order to encourage local associations to follow the policy line they preach from their own smug, safe base? Precious few I would guess \u2013 including The Hon. Francis Maude.}} Outside the Shadow Cabinet, Maude founded Conservatives for Change, ''CChange'', becoming its first [[chairman]]. ''CChange'' was designed to promote the modernisation of the Conservative Party. Around the same point he also founded [[Policy Exchange]].\n\nAfter the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], Maude returned to the Shadow Cabinet as [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]]. As the so-called Holy Spirit of Conservative modernisation, Maude set the Tory Party on the path to reform which saw David Cameron selected as Party Leader. In his first speech to the Conservative Conference as Party Chairman, Maude presented what he calls his \"killer slide\". The slide revealed that \"voters confronted with the party\u2019s immigration policy neutrally supported it by two to one, but when told that it was a Conservative policy the proportions reversed\". The point he was making was not that sound conservative ideas damaged the Conservative Party but that 'The Conservative Party, as it was then seen, was damaging good Conservative policies\". During his tenure, alongside newly elected Leader David Cameron, the Conservatives adopted the [[A-List (Conservative)|A-List]] of [[Prospective parliamentary candidate|parliamentary candidate]]s, with priority being given to women and people from ethnic minorities.\n\nIn July 2007, Maude was made Shadow Cabinet Office Minister and Shadow [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], with responsibility for preparing the Conservatives for government, with some dubbing him the Party's \"enforcer\". At the Conservative Party Conference in October 2007 he said: \"David (Cameron) has asked me to lead an implementation team that will ensure that we are as well-prepared as any incoming government has ever been. Our priorities rigorously sorted. Our teams armed with the knowledge and capabilities that will enable new ministers to start making a difference from day one.\" Ahead of the 2010 general election, Maude led attempts by the then-Conservative Opposition to work with the UK Civil Service to prepare for government.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/2518435/Civil-servants-preparing-for-Conservative-Government-with-secret-meetings.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Robert | last=Winnett | title=Civil servants 'preparing for Conservative Government' with secret meetings | date=7 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nMaude supported [[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] [[John McCain]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 U.S. Presidential election]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Convention fever: MPs fly in hoping to find prescription for success|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4583484.ece|work=The Times |location=London |date=22 August 2008|accessdate=12 September 2008|first1=Tom|last1=Baldwin|first2=Siobhan|last2=Kennedy}}</ref> He led the Conservative Party delegation to the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]].\n\n===Return to Government, 2010\u20132016===\n[[File:Francis Maude.jpg|thumb|left|Maude in the [[Cabinet Office]] in 2013]]\nMaude was appointed [[Paymaster General]] and [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]], with the right to attend Cabinet, on 12 May 2010, following the formation of the [[Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat Coalition]]. As Cabinet Office Minister, Maude was [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976001073 responsible] for: public service efficiency and reform groups, [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]] issues, [[industrial relations]] strategy in the [[public sector]], [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], [[Civil Contingencies Secretariat|civil contingencies]], [[civil society]] and [[cyber-security]].\n\n====Efficiency and Reform====\n\nIn 2010 Maude set up the [[Efficiency and Reform Group]] (ERG), in the [[Cabinet Office]] to work with [[HM Treasury]] with the aim of making government departments more efficient. This [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/efficiency-and-reform-group%20 work] includes stopping wasteful spending; improving the way government buys goods and services; reducing losses from fraud, error and debt; raising money by selling empty buildings and underused properties; and reviewing and reshaping large scale projects.\n\nSavings are difficult to measure, but the work of ERG claims to have contributed to \u00a33.75 billion of savings in 2010\u201311, \u00a35.5 billion in 2011-12 and an \"unprecedented\" \u00a310 billion in 2012\u201313. ERG claims to achieve savings of at least \u00a320 billion in the financial year 2014 to 2015. Cumulatively, by 2015 Maude had delivered more than \u00a350 billion of audited savings during the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/3603-francis-maude/|title=Francis Maude: Shaking up the UK\u2019s status quo|accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThese savings included [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215147/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-saves-10-billion-for-taxpayers%20 include] \u00a33.4 billion by reducing the size of the Civil Service and reforming Civil Service pensions; \u00a33.8 billion by linking together departments to buy goods and services and enforcing controls on recruitment and use of consultants; and \u00a30.6 billion by exiting 500,000 square metres of property.  In December 2014 Francis Maude set out plans to make a further \u00a310 billion of efficiency savings between 2017 and 2018 and an additional \u00a315 to \u00a320 billion for 2019 to 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/efficiency-and-reform-in-the-next-parliament|title=Efficiency and reform in the next Parliament|author=|date=|work=www.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Civil Service reform====\nIn June 2012 Maude laid out his [http://my.civilservice.gov.uk/reform/the-reform-plan/ plans] for reforming the Civil Service. The Reform programme was endorsed by leadership of the Civil Service, the Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Civil Service. The document laid out a series of practical actions including steps to improve the skills, abilities and performance of civil servants; introduce a sharper performance management system; create a modern employment offer for staff; improve IT and flexible working across departments; and tighten the delivery of major projects. A year after the publication of the initial plan, Maude updated Parliament with a One Year On document, setting out successes and failures. This document included various further steps: establishing the principle of Extended Ministerial Offices, and introducing Functional Leadership across Whitehall. However, in November 2013, former [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet secretary]] [[Lord Butler of Brockwell]] told the BBC that \"Mr Maude and some of his colleagues don't understand leadership.\"<ref name= brock>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25163208|title=Francis Maude criticised over leadership by Lord Butler|work=BBC News:Politics|date=30 November 2013 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> Butler said the relationship between ministers and the Civil Service worked best when there was loyalty on both side and public criticism showed something was wrong. A spokesman for Maude said good leadership required issues to be addressed, not swept under the carpet.<ref name= brock/>\n\n====Transparency====\nMaude oversaw the Government's groundbreaking transparency policy. This work includes making sure that departments include specific open data commitments in their business plans, regularly publishing open data sets on all central and local government spending over \u00a325,000, senior staff salary details and how the government is performing against objectives. [[Data.gov.uk]] contains over 9,000 datasets including local crime statistics, sentencing rates, hospital infection rates and GP performance.\n\nMaude also led the UK Government's work with the [[Open Government Partnership]]. This work helped make the British government the most open in the world at the time, and led directly to the creation of services such as the [[Citymapper]] app and challenger banks like [[Monzo (bank)|Monzo]].<ref>Cameron, David (2019). For the Record. United Kingdom: William Collins. p. 213. {{ISBN|0-008-23928-2}}.</ref>\n\nFollowing Maude's reforms the United Nations rated the UK government as the most open in world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey-2016|title=UN E-Government Survey 2016|accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Government Digital Service and Gov.uk====\nMaude was responsible for the creation of the [[Government Digital Service]], with the aim to consolidate internal IT and replace government 1,700 various websites with a single web hub, [[gov.uk]]. The new consolidated website won Design of the Year 2013 at the [[Design Museum]] awards, beating [[The Shard]] and the [[2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics cauldron]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Wainwright|first=Oliver|title='Direct and well-mannered' government website named design of the year|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/apr/16/government-website-design-of-year|accessdate=16 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 April 2013}}</ref> Its revolutionary single source model inspired government websites around the world, including in the United States, New Zealand and Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/sprint-14-speech-by-francis-maude |title=Sprint 14|accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/3603-francis-maude/|title=Francis Maude: Shaking up the UK\u2019s status quo|accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Government Digital Strategy also committed Departments to redesigning all existing government services that serve more than 100,000 users each year. Maude's office estimated that moving services from offline to digital channels could save approximately \u00a31.8 billion a year; at the time digital transactions cost 20 pence each compared to \u00a33 for a phone call and \u00a37 for a physical letter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#what-the-strategy-is-about%20|title=Government Digital Strategy|author=|date=|work=cabinetoffice.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>Cameron, David (2019).

life peer and one-time Conservative cabinet minister. He spent part of his childhood in Sydney, Australia, while his father edited the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''. On the family's return to the UK, he was educated at [[Abingdon School]], at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], and at the [[University of Law|College of Law]]. He was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]] at the [[Inner Temple]] in 1977, and practised criminal law.\n\nHe served as a member of [[Westminster City Council]] from 1978 to 1984.\n\n==Political career==\n\n===In government, 1983\u20131992===\nMaude was first elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to represent the constituency of [[North Warwickshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Warwickshire]] in the Conservative Party's landslide victory at the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]]. In 1984, he became the [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the [[Minister of State|Minister]] for Employment [[Peter Morrison]]. Maude then became an assistant government [[whip (politics)|whip]] (1985\u201387) and Minister for Corporate and Consumer Affairs (1987\u201389), then part of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]]. A Thatcherite, Maude was appointed in 1989 the [[Minister for Europe]] in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] to spearhead the policy outlined in the [[Bruges Group (United Kingdom)|Bruges Speech]], attacking the [[Delors Commission|Delors Plan]] in order to exclude Britain from an economic and political Union of Europe. In 1992 he acted as deputy for [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Norman Lamont]] and was one of the two UK signatories to the [[Maastricht Treaty]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/cf373d1a-0c53-11e1-8ac6-00144feabdc0|title=Subscribe to read {{!}} Financial Times|website=www.ft.com|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\nMaude was one of the first \"men in grey suits\" to hold discussions with [[Margaret Thatcher]] in November 1990 after she failed to win the first round of a [[1990 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|leadership election]]. He told Thatcher that he would support her as long as she went on, but he did not believe she could win the leadership contest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Falling from power: Cabinet overboard (memoirs extract)|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/commentary/displaydocument.asp?docid=109189|publisher=Margaret Thatcher Foundation|accessdate =16 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[John Major]] became [[Prime Minister]], Maude was made the [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]]. However, in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] he lost his seat to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate, [[Mike O'Brien (UK politician)|Mike O'Brien]], and was thus forced to vacate his ministerial roles. According to [[Daniel Finkelstein]] of ''[[The Times]]'' the loss came as a 'terrible blow' to Maude; all his peers had managed to cling on and were together forming a government. In the [[1992 Dissolution Honours|Dissolution Honours that year]], he was made a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=52943 |date=5 June 1992 |page=2  |supp=y}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2006 interview, Maude stated that the introduction of [[Section 28]] legislation whilst he was in Government (which banned Councils from promoting homosexuality and led to the closure of gay support groups) was \"a mistake\", adding it might have even contributed to the [[AIDS]] death of his brother Charles, who was homosexual, among others.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tory Chairman: Gay policies were wrong|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-448.html#|newspaper=Pink News|date=9 February 2006|accessdate=12 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085109/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-448.html|archive-date=29 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2012 he expanded further on his views on [[Section 28]], saying \"in hindsight, it was very wrong \u2014 very wrong. It was a legislative provision that came out of honourable motives. It took me some time to realise what an emblem of intolerance Section 28 had become for gay people. It was the tip of a deep iceberg \u2014 the iceberg below the surface being a host of anti-gay social attitudes.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/mother-tongue/9150056/Francis-Maude-My-brothers-Aids-death-transformed-my-views-on-gay-marriage.html |title=Francis Maude: My brother's Aids death transformed my views on gay marriage|author= Patrick Sawer|work=Daily Telegraph|date=17 March 2012|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Out of Parliament, 1992\u20131997===\nOut of [[Parliament]] after the 1992 general election, Maude began a series of business roles. He worked in banking as managing director at [[Morgan Stanley]] from 1993 to 1997. He was also appointed a non-executive director of [[Asda|ASDA Group Plc]] in July 1992, and served as a director of [[Salomon Brothers]] from 1992 to 1993. He also chaired the government's Deregulation Task Force from 1994 to 1997. This was preparation as Cabinet Office Minister from 2010, when he was required to highlight areas of expenditure where savings could be made from streamlining the delivery and implementation of policy goals.\n\n===Shadow Cabinet, 1997\u20132010===\nIn the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] Maude was elected MP for [[Horsham (UK Parliament constituency)|Horsham]]. Almost immediately he was re-appointed to the Conservative [[front bench]], now the [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]] in Parliament. He served as Shadow [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]], Shadow [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], and Shadow [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] until 2001.\n\nMaude managed [[Michael Portillo]]'s unsuccessful bid for the Conservative leadership in 2001, after which he declined a front bench role under the new Party Leader [[Iain Duncan Smith]]. He was considered to be a 'moderniser' and on the centre-left of the party, writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (24 June 2002), he said that the Conservative Party's electoral problems had been caused by its failure to \"look and sound like modern Britain\". [[Norman Tebbit]]'s secretary, Beryl Goldsmith, criticised Maude after this, asking:{{quote|How many male, white, straight Conservative MPs currently passionately campaigning for the selection of more women, and more men and women from ethnic minorities, would voluntarily relinquish their own seats in order to encourage local associations to follow the policy line they preach from their own smug, safe base? Precious few I would guess \u2013 including The Hon. Francis Maude.}} Outside the Shadow Cabinet, Maude founded Conservatives for Change, ''CChange'', becoming its first [[chairman]]. ''CChange'' was designed to promote the modernisation of the Conservative Party. Around the same point he also founded [[Policy Exchange]].\n\nAfter the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], Maude returned to the Shadow Cabinet as [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]]. As the so-called Holy Spirit of Conservative modernisation, Maude set the Tory Party on the path to reform which saw David Cameron selected as Party Leader. In his first speech to the Conservative Conference as Party Chairman, Maude presented what he calls his \"killer slide\". The slide revealed that \"voters confronted with the party\u2019s immigration policy neutrally supported it by two to one, but when told that it was a Conservative policy the proportions reversed\". The point he was making was not that sound conservative ideas damaged the Conservative Party but that 'The Conservative Party, as it was then seen, was damaging good Conservative policies\". During his tenure, alongside newly elected Leader David Cameron, the Conservatives adopted the [[A-List (Conservative)|A-List]] of [[Prospective parliamentary candidate|parliamentary candidate]]s, with priority being given to women and people from ethnic minorities.\n\nIn July 2007, Maude was made Shadow Cabinet Office Minister and Shadow [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], with responsibility for preparing the Conservatives for government, with some dubbing him the Party's \"enforcer\". At the Conservative Party Conference in October 2007 he said: \"David (Cameron) has asked me to lead an implementation team that will ensure that we are as well-prepared as any incoming government has ever been. Our priorities rigorously sorted. Our teams armed with the knowledge and capabilities that will enable new ministers to start making a difference from day one.\" Ahead of the 2010 general election, Maude led attempts by the then-Conservative Opposition to work with the UK Civil Service to prepare for government.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/2518435/Civil-servants-preparing-for-Conservative-Government-with-secret-meetings.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Robert | last=Winnett | title=Civil servants 'preparing for Conservative Government' with secret meetings | date=7 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nMaude supported [[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] [[John McCain]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 U.S. Presidential election]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Convention fever: MPs fly in hoping to find prescription for success|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4583484.ece|work=The Times |location=London |date=22 August 2008|accessdate=12 September 2008|first1=Tom|last1=Baldwin|first2=Siobhan|last2=Kennedy}}</ref> He led the Conservative Party delegation to the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]].\n\n===Return to Government, 2010\u20132016===\n[[File:Francis Maude.jpg|thumb|left|Maude in the [[Cabinet Office]] in 2013]]\nMaude was appointed [[Paymaster General]] and [[Minister for the Cabinet Office]], with the right to attend Cabinet, on 12 May 2010, following the formation of the [[Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|Conservative\u2013Liberal Democrat Coalition]]. As Cabinet Office Minister, Maude was [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976001073 responsible] for: public service efficiency and reform groups, [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]] issues, [[industrial relations]] strategy in the [[public sector]], [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], [[Civil Contingencies Secretariat|civil contingencies]], [[civil society]] and [[cyber-security]].\n\n====Efficiency and Reform====\n\nIn 2010 Maude set up the [[Efficiency and Reform Group]] (ERG), in the [[Cabinet Office]] to work with [[HM Treasury]] with the aim of making government departments more efficient. This [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/efficiency-and-reform-group%20 work] includes stopping wasteful spending; improving the way government buys goods and services; reducing losses from fraud, error and debt; raising money by selling empty buildings and underused properties; and reviewing and reshaping large scale projects.\n\nSavings are difficult to measure, but the work of ERG claims to have contributed to \u00a33.75 billion of savings in 2010-11, \u00a35.5 billion in 2011-12 and an \"unprecedented\" \u00a310 billion in 2012-13. ERG claims to achieve savings of at least \u00a320 billion in the financial year 2014 to 2015. Cumulatively, by 2015 Maude had delivered more than \u00a350 billion of audited savings during the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/3603-francis-maude/|title=Francis Maude: Shaking up the UK\u2019s status quo|accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThese savings included [https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215147/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-saves-10-billion-for-taxpayers%20 include] \u00a33.4 billion by reducing the size of the Civil Service and reforming Civil Service pensions; \u00a33.8 billion by linking together departments to buy goods and services and enforcing controls on recruitment and use of consultants; and \u00a30.6 billion by exiting 500,000 square metres of property.  In December 2014 Francis Maude set out plans to make a further \u00a310 billion of efficiency savings between 2017 and 2018 and an additional \u00a315 to \u00a320 billion for 2019 to 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/efficiency-and-reform-in-the-next-parliament|title=Efficiency and reform in the next Parliament|author=|date=|work=www.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\n====Civil Service reform====\nIn June 2012 Maude laid out his [http://my.civilservice.gov.uk/reform/the-reform-plan/ plans] for reforming the Civil Service. The Reform programme was endorsed by leadership of the Civil Service, the Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Civil Service. The document laid out a series of practical actions including steps to improve the skills, abilities and performance of civil servants; introduce a sharper performance management system; create a modern employment offer for staff; improve IT and flexible working across departments; and tighten the delivery of major projects. A year after the publication of the initial plan, Maude updated Parliament with a One Year On document, setting out successes and failures. This document included various further steps: establishing the principle of Extended Ministerial Offices, and introducing Functional Leadership across Whitehall. However, in November 2013, former [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet secretary]] [[Lord Butler of Brockwell]] told the BBC that \"Mr Maude and some of his colleagues don't understand leadership.\"<ref name= brock>{{cite news|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25163208|title=Francis Maude criticised over leadership by Lord Butler|work=BBC News:Politics|date=30 November 2013 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> Butler said the relationship between ministers and the Civil Service worked best when there was loyalty on both side and public criticism showed something was wrong. A spokesman for Maude said good leadership required issues to be addressed, not swept under the carpet.<ref name= brock/>\n\n====Transparency====\nMaude oversaw the Government's groundbreaking transparency policy. This work includes making sure that departments include specific open data commitments in their business plans, regularly publishing open data sets on all central and local government spending over \u00a325,000, senior staff salary details and how the government is performing against objectives. [[Data.gov.uk]] contains over 9,000 datasets including local crime statistics, sentencing rates, hospital infection rates and GP performance.\n\nMaude also led the UK Government's work with the [[Open Government Partnership]]. This work helped make the British government the most open in the world at the time, and led directly to the creation of services such as the [[Citymapper]] app and challenger banks like [[Monzo (bank)|Monzo]].<ref>Cameron, David (2019).

Maude's office estimated that moving services from offline to digital channels could save approximately \u00a31.8 billion a year; at the time digital transactions cost 20 pence each compared to \u00a33 for a phone call and \u00a37 for a physical letter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#what-the-strategy-is-about%20|title=Government Digital Strategy|author=|date=|work=cabinetoffice.gov.uk}}</ref><ref>Cameron, David (2019).

His remarks were criticized by organizations who work with the elderly partly on the grounds that poorer people may not be able to afford computer facilities and, partly because even computer literate people may lose their skills in old age. Whilst critics estimated that over 5 million pensioners have never used the internet, Maude said that 'refuseniks' could be offered a one-off lesson.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/10889563/Go-on-the-internet-or-lose-access-to-government-services-Francis-Maude-tells-pensioners.html#disqus_thread|title=Go on the internet - or lose access to government services, Francis Maude tells pensioners|author= Christopher Hope|work=Daily Telegraph|date=10 June 2014|accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Elevation to the Lords ====\nIn February 2015, Maude announced he would be standing down at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later.

{"title_page": "Sean Hughes (politician)", "text_new": "{{Other people|Sean Hughes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2016}}\n'''Sean Francis Hughes''' (8 May 1946 \u2013 24 June 1990) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] history teacher and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician. He was the local successor to Sir [[Harold Wilson]] as a Member of Parliament, and served as a [[whip (politics)|whip]] and a spokesman on defence issues for his party. Respected for his Parliamentary abilities and able to use his historical knowledge in Parliamentary speeches, he played a role in changing Labour's defence policy from unilateral nuclear disarmament to a multilateral approach. His Parliamentary career was cut short by his early death from cancer.\n\n==Early life==\nHughes was born in [[Huyton]] to a Welsh father and Irish Catholic mother.<ref name=\"Times obituary\">Sean Hughes obituary, ''The Times'', 26 June 1990.</ref><ref name=\"Profiles\">\"Sean F HUGHES\" in Andrew Roth, \"Parliamentary Profiles\" vol II E-K, Parliamentary Profile Services, 1984, p. 398.</ref> His early life was described as \"impeccably working class\",<ref name=\"Times obituary\"/> with his father Francis Hughes working as a ship fender-maker in Liverpool. After his father's death, his mother Mary moved back to Ireland with his five sisters. He attended St Aloysius Primary School,<ref name=\"Profiles\"/> where he proved to be naturally bright and won a scholarship<ref name=\"Times obituary\"/> to [[West Park Grammar School]] in St Helens; he spent some time at [[St John's College (Portsmouth)|St John's College, Southsea]]<ref name=\"Times Guide 1974\">\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons, 1974\", Times Newspapers Ltd, 1974, p. 94.</ref> which was, like West Park Grammar School, run by the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|De La Salle brothers]]. He went on to [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool University]] where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree and [[University of Manchester|Manchester University]] for a [[Master of Arts]] degree. He attended a Roman Catholic seminary but did not take a religious vocation.<ref name=\"Profiles\"/>\n\n===Teaching career===\nIn 1969 Hughes began work as a trainee personnel manager at the [[Unilever]] plant in [[Port Sunlight]]. However he was very interested in the subject of history; and obtained a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|Certificate of Education]] from Liverpool University.<ref name=\"Profiles\"/> In 1970 he joined the staff of Ruffwood Comprehensive School as a history teacher and from 1973 he was head of the history department.<ref name=\"Times obituary\"/> Initially a member of the [[NASUWT|National Association of Schoolmasters]],<ref name=\"Times Guide 1974\"/> he was later a member of the [[National Union of Teachers]].<ref name=\"Profiles\"/>\n\n==Politics==\nAfter joining the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1966, Hughes was elected to [[Huyton with Roby Urban District|Huyton-with-Roby Urban District Council]] in 1969 and served until the council was abolished in local government reform in 1974.<ref name=\"Profiles\"/> Hughes chaired the Housing Committee of the council, in charge of its council housing:<ref name=\"Times Guide 1983\">\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1983\", Times Books, Revised and Updated edition 1984, p. 148.</ref> he found he had the power to decide whether a family would be housed.<ref name=\"Appreciation\">Gerry Harrison, \"Appreciation: Sean Hughes\", ''The Guardian'', 27 June 1990, p. 39.</ref>\n\nIn 1972 he was selected as [[prospective Parliamentary candidate]] for [[Crosby (UK Parliament constituency)|Crosby]],<ref>[[F. W. S. Craig|F.W.S. Craig]], \"Political Companion\" No. 11 (April/June 1972), p. 110. Hughes' name does not appear as a prospective Parliamentary candidate in No. 10 (January/March 1972) indicating his selection took place in the early months of 1972.</ref> then a safe Conservative seat. At the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] Hughes came second in Crosby, with 27.2% of the vote and 15,570 votes behind the Conservative winner.<ref name=\"Times Guide 1974\"/> He was shortlisted for the Labour candidacy in [[Wallasey (UK Parliament constituency)|Wallasey]], which was a [[marginal constituency]], before the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 general election]], although he was not selected.<ref name=\"Profiles\"/>\n\nHe was chairman of [[Labour Party Young Socialists]] in the Northern Region for 1970\u201371. Hughes had in 1973 been elected to [[Merseyside County Council]], serving one term until 1977. He became chairman of [[Huyton (UK Parliament constituency)|Huyton]] [[Constituency Labour Party]] in 1974, an office which had additional significance because the local Labour MP was [[Harold Wilson]] who was then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].<ref name=\"Profiles\"/> In later years Hughes was able to regale friends with anecdotes about Wilson's time in the constituency. He managed to prevent the [[Militant tendency]] infiltrating the constituency party, explaining that \"I'm known as a good Catholic who doesn't want trouble\".<ref name=\"Appreciation\"/>\n\n==Election to Parliament==\nDuring the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 election]] campaign, Sir Harold Wilson (who had resigned as Prime Minister in 1976) intimated that it would be his last contest. On 27 February 1981, Huyton Labour Party formally announced that Wilson would not seek renomination for the constituency at the next general election.<ref>\"Sir Harold not to stand again\", ''The Times'', 28 February 1981, p. 1.</ref> Hughes put his name forward for the new selection, and on 17 May he was selected as prospective Parliamentary candidate for Huyton. Hughes was immediately identified as a moderate within the Labour Party,<ref>\"Huyton candidate\", ''The Times'', 18 May 1981, p. 3.</ref>  which was in the middle of an intense internal struggle between left-wingers and moderates. He was duly endorsed by the [[National Executive Committee]] in the same month.<ref name=\"Profiles\" />\n\nSir Harold Wilson wrote in April 1983 that Huyton CLP had \"consistently kept the extreme left-wing faction in check\" and stated that Hughes had twice been responsible for proposing motions which defeated left-wing manoeuvring intended to take over the party \u2013 including one quite recent attempt.<ref>\"Sir Harold and 'Trots'\" (letter), ''The Times'', 23 April 1983, p.  9.</ref> Boundary changes enacted shortly before the election abolished the Huyton constituency, and Hughes transferred to the new constituency of [[Knowsley South (UK Parliament constituency)|Knowsley South]] which was based on Huyton and Roby. At the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] Hughes was elected with a majority of 11,769.<ref name=\"Times Guide 1983\" /> Although there was a national [[Swing (politics)|swing]] to the Conservatives, in Knowsley South the swing was to Labour and Hughes had a higher majority than there would have been for a Labour candidate in 1979.<ref>Ivor Crewe, Anthony Fox, \"British Parliamentary Constituencies: A Statistical Compendium\", {{ISBN|0571132367}}, Faber & Faber, 1984, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==In Parliament==\nMaking his [[maiden speech]] on 27 June 1983, Hughes referred to the council estates that made up most of his constituency as \"monotonous labyrinths, bleak, grimly regimented and dehumanising\".<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1983/jun/27/welfare-state#1983-06-27T20:42:00Z Hansard]'' HC 6ser vol 44 col 418.</ref> He complained that the resources to improve the estates were being withheld and that parts of the constituency had unemployment problems even more severe than elsewhere on Merseyside.<ref>\"Fowler defends record on health service spending\", ''The Times'', 28 June 1983, p. 4.</ref> Later that year he deplored the closure of the [[Huntley & Palmers]] biscuits plant at Huyton, and pledged to raise the issue with the Government although he was sure they would refuse to intervene.<ref>\"1,300 jobs go in biscuit factory closures\", ''The Times'', 7 September 1983, p. 2.</ref>\n\nHughes quickly grew disillusioned about some of the routine work of a \"voting fodder\" Member of Parliament, and began suffering what he called \"[[backbencher]] blues\"; where once he had been able to decide housing allocations, he now felt he could do very little for the same families. He did get on well with the catering staff of the Houses of Parliament; they nicknamed him '[[Yosser Hughes|Yosser]]', while he noted that they had trained at a catering college in his constituency.<ref name=\"Appreciation\"/> His Parliamentary speeches were often enlivened by historical allusions,<ref name=\"Times obituary\"/> and were often scathing of the Thatcher Government but also for good humour, which won him friends on both sides of the Commons. Hughes' good humour was said to desert him only on Monday mornings if [[Everton F.C.]] had been defeated at the weekend.<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\">Ron Davies, \"Sean Hughes - The radical loyalist\" (obituary), ''The Guardian'', 26 June 1990, p. 39.</ref>\n\nHe was particularly passionate about improving education,<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\"/> serving on the Select Committee on Education from 1983.<ref name=\"Profiles\"/> He also spoke forcefully on unemployment in his constituency,<ref name=\"Times obituary\" /> and was interested in the politics of Ireland, where he opposed extremist nationalism partly due to his understanding of European history.<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\"/>\n\n==Opposition whip==\nIn 1984 Hughes was appointed as an opposition [[whip (politics)|whip]];<ref name=\"Dod\">\"Dod's Parliamentary Companion 1988\", p. 440.</ref> it was said that he would regard being called a \"loyalist\" as an accolade. When [[Robert Kilroy-Silk]] resigned as MP for the next door constituency of [[Knowsley North (UK Parliament constituency)|Knowsley North]], Hughes was chosen as the organiser for the campaign of his successor [[George Howarth]] who had been imposed on a Militant dominated CLP by the Labour Party headquarters. Militant had hoped to see one of their members selected, and some of their fury was taken out on Hughes.<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\"/> Howarth was comfortably elected in the [[1986 Knowsley North by-election|by-election]].\n\nHughes' skill as an organiser was also seen earlier that year when the [[1986 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]] was a [[Merseyside derby]] played between Everton F.C. (which he supported) and their great local rivals, [[Liverpool F.C.]]. Hughes realised that Scottish MPs were given two free tickets to the English FA Cup in which few were interested; he lobbied nearly all the 72 Scots asking if they wanted the tickets or would give them to his constituents. The response was said to be good.<ref>\"Scouse nous\", ''The Times'', 23 April 1986.</ref>\n\n==Shadow Defence minister==\nRe-elected in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] with a majority nearly doubled on 1983,<ref>Robert Waller. ''The Almanac of British Politics\" 4th Edition'', 1991, {{ISBN|0415064341}}, Routledge, pp. 147-48.</ref> Hughes was appointed as a member of the defence shadow ministerial team to speak on issues relating to the Army.<ref name=\"Dod\"/> His historical knowledge came to be very helpful and Hughes established a strong reputation for being able to spot weaknesses in Government policy; Ministers were said to have made sure they were well briefed when facing him.<ref name=\"Times obituary\"/> A report in the Conservative supporting ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' described him as \"the sort of MP that Labour doesn't deserve to have\", a joke which Hughes himself reportedly enjoyed.<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\"/>\n\nHe had been a lifelong supporter of [[unilateralism|unilateral]] [[nuclear disarmament]] and [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|CND]],<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\"/> but the Labour Party was embarking on a policy review. When [[Denzil Davies]] resigned as Shadow Secretary of State for Defence and was replaced by [[Martin O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Clackmannan|Martin O'Neill]] in 1988, Hughes assisted the team in helping to draft a new defence policy which would not lose votes for the party (as the policy in 1987 was thought to have done).

He was the local successor to Sir [[Harold Wilson]] as a Member of Parliament, and served as a [[whip (politics)|whip]] and a spokesman on defence issues for his party. Respected for his Parliamentary abilities and able to use his historical knowledge in Parliamentary speeches, he played a role in changing Labour's defence policy from unilateral nuclear disarmament to a multilateral approach. His Parliamentary career was cut short by his early death from cancer.\n\n==Early life==\nHughes was born in [[Huyton]] to a Welsh father and Irish Catholic mother.<ref name=\"Times obituary\">Sean Hughes obituary, ''The Times'', 26 June 1990.</ref><ref name=\"Profiles\">\"Sean F HUGHES\" in Andrew Roth, \"Parliamentary Profiles\" vol II E-K, Parliamentary Profile Services, 1984, p. 398.</ref> His early life was described as \"impeccably working class\",<ref name=\"Times obituary\"/> with his father Francis Hughes working as a ship fender-maker in Liverpool. After his father's death, his mother Mary moved back to Ireland with his five sisters. He attended St Aloysius Primary School,<ref name=\"Profiles\"/> where he proved to be naturally bright and won a scholarship<ref name=\"Times obituary\"/> to [[West Park Grammar School]] in St Helens; he spent some time at [[St John's College (Portsmouth)|St John's College, Southsea]]<ref name=\"Times Guide 1974\">\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons, 1974\", Times Newspapers Ltd, 1974, p. 94.</ref> which was, like West Park Grammar School, run by the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|De La Salle brothers]]. He went on to [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool University]] where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree and [[University of Manchester|Manchester University]] for a [[Master of Arts]] degree. He attended a Roman Catholic seminary but did not take a religious vocation.<ref name=\"Profiles\"/>\n\n===Teaching career===\nIn 1969 Hughes began work as a trainee personnel manager at the [[Unilever]] plant in [[Port Sunlight]]. However he was very interested in the subject of history; and obtained a [[Postgraduate Certificate in Education|Certificate of Education]] from Liverpool University.<ref name=\"Profiles\"/> In 1970 he joined the staff of Ruffwood Comprehensive School as a history teacher and from 1973 he was head of the history department.<ref name=\"Times obituary\"/> Initially a member of the [[NASUWT|National Association of Schoolmasters]],<ref name=\"Times Guide 1974\"/> he was later a member of the [[National Union of Teachers]].<ref name=\"Profiles\"/>\n\n==Politics==\nAfter joining the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1966, Hughes was elected to [[Huyton with Roby Urban District|Huyton-with-Roby Urban District Council]] in 1969 and served until the council was abolished in local government reform in 1974.<ref name=\"Profiles\"/> Hughes chaired the Housing Committee of the council, in charge of its council housing:<ref name=\"Times Guide 1983\">\"The Times Guide to the House of Commons 1983\", Times Books, Revised and Updated edition 1984, p. 148.</ref> he found he had the power to decide whether a family would be housed.<ref name=\"Appreciation\">Gerry Harrison, \"Appreciation: Sean Hughes\", ''The Guardian'', 27 June 1990, p. 39.</ref>\n\nIn 1972 he was selected as [[prospective Parliamentary candidate]] for [[Crosby (UK Parliament constituency)|Crosby]],<ref>[[F. W. S. Craig|F.W.S. Craig]], \"Political Companion\" No. 11 (April/June 1972), p. 110. Hughes' name does not appear as a prospective Parliamentary candidate in No. 10 (January/March 1972) indicating his selection took place in the early months of 1972.</ref> then a safe Conservative seat. At the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] Hughes came second in Crosby, with 27.2% of the vote and 15,570 votes behind the Conservative winner.<ref name=\"Times Guide 1974\"/> He was shortlisted for the Labour candidacy in [[Wallasey (UK Parliament constituency)|Wallasey]], which was a [[marginal constituency]], before the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 general election]], although he was not selected.<ref name=\"Profiles\"/>\n\nHe was chairman of [[Labour Party Young Socialists]] in the Northern Region for 1970-71. Hughes had in 1973 been elected to [[Merseyside County Council]], serving one term until 1977. He became chairman of [[Huyton (UK Parliament constituency)|Huyton]] [[Constituency Labour Party]] in 1974, an office which had additional significance because the local Labour MP was [[Harold Wilson]] who was then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].<ref name=\"Profiles\"/> In later years Hughes was able to regale friends with anecdotes about Wilson's time in the constituency. He managed to prevent the [[Militant tendency]] infiltrating the constituency party, explaining that \"I'm known as a good Catholic who doesn't want trouble\".<ref name=\"Appreciation\"/>\n\n==Election to Parliament==\nDuring the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 election]] campaign, Sir Harold Wilson (who had resigned as Prime Minister in 1976) intimated that it would be his last contest. On 27 February 1981, Huyton Labour Party formally announced that Wilson would not seek renomination for the constituency at the next general election.<ref>\"Sir Harold not to stand again\", ''The Times'', 28 February 1981, p. 1.</ref> Hughes put his name forward for the new selection, and on 17 May he was selected as prospective Parliamentary candidate for Huyton. Hughes was immediately identified as a moderate within the Labour Party,<ref>\"Huyton candidate\", ''The Times'', 18 May 1981, p. 3.</ref>  which was in the middle of an intense internal struggle between left-wingers and moderates. He was duly endorsed by the [[National Executive Committee]] in the same month.<ref name=\"Profiles\" />\n\nSir Harold Wilson wrote in April 1983 that Huyton CLP had \"consistently kept the extreme left-wing faction in check\" and stated that Hughes had twice been responsible for proposing motions which defeated left-wing manoeuvring intended to take over the party \u2013 including one quite recent attempt.<ref>\"Sir Harold and 'Trots'\" (letter), ''The Times'', 23 April 1983, p.  9.</ref> Boundary changes enacted shortly before the election abolished the Huyton constituency, and Hughes transferred to the new constituency of [[Knowsley South (UK Parliament constituency)|Knowsley South]] which was based on Huyton and Roby. At the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] Hughes was elected with a majority of 11,769.<ref name=\"Times Guide 1983\" /> Although there was a national [[Swing (politics)|swing]] to the Conservatives, in Knowsley South the swing was to Labour and Hughes had a higher majority than there would have been for a Labour candidate in 1979.<ref>Ivor Crewe, Anthony Fox, \"British Parliamentary Constituencies: A Statistical Compendium\", {{ISBN|0571132367}}, Faber & Faber, 1984, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==In Parliament==\nMaking his [[maiden speech]] on 27 June 1983, Hughes referred to the council estates that made up most of his constituency as \"monotonous labyrinths, bleak, grimly regimented and dehumanising\".<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1983/jun/27/welfare-state#1983-06-27T20:42:00Z Hansard]'' HC 6ser vol 44 col 418.</ref> He complained that the resources to improve the estates were being withheld and that parts of the constituency had unemployment problems even more severe than elsewhere on Merseyside.<ref>\"Fowler defends record on health service spending\", ''The Times'', 28 June 1983, p. 4.</ref> Later that year he deplored the closure of the [[Huntley & Palmers]] biscuits plant at Huyton, and pledged to raise the issue with the Government although he was sure they would refuse to intervene.<ref>\"1,300 jobs go in biscuit factory closures\", ''The Times'', 7 September 1983, p. 2.</ref>\n\nHughes quickly grew disillusioned about some of the routine work of a \"voting fodder\" Member of Parliament, and began suffering what he called \"[[backbencher]] blues\"; where once he had been able to decide housing allocations, he now felt he could do very little for the same families. He did get on well with the catering staff of the Houses of Parliament; they nicknamed him '[[Yosser Hughes|Yosser]]', while he noted that they had trained at a catering college in his constituency.<ref name=\"Appreciation\"/> His Parliamentary speeches were often enlivened by historical allusions,<ref name=\"Times obituary\"/> and were often scathing of the Thatcher Government but also for good humour, which won him friends on both sides of the Commons. Hughes' good humour was said to desert him only on Monday mornings if [[Everton F.C.]] had been defeated at the weekend.<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\">Ron Davies, \"Sean Hughes - The radical loyalist\" (obituary), ''The Guardian'', 26 June 1990, p. 39.</ref>\n\nHe was particularly passionate about improving education,<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\"/> serving on the Select Committee on Education from 1983.<ref name=\"Profiles\"/> He also spoke forcefully on unemployment in his constituency,<ref name=\"Times obituary\" /> and was interested in the politics of Ireland, where he opposed extremist nationalism partly due to his understanding of European history.<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\"/>\n\n==Opposition whip==\nIn 1984 Hughes was appointed as an opposition [[whip (politics)|whip]];<ref name=\"Dod\">\"Dod's Parliamentary Companion 1988\", p. 440.</ref> it was said that he would regard being called a \"loyalist\" as an accolade. When [[Robert Kilroy-Silk]] resigned as MP for the next door constituency of [[Knowsley North (UK Parliament constituency)|Knowsley North]], Hughes was chosen as the organiser for the campaign of his successor [[George Howarth]] who had been imposed on a Militant dominated CLP by the Labour Party headquarters. Militant had hoped to see one of their members selected, and some of their fury was taken out on Hughes.<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\"/> Howarth was comfortably elected in the [[1986 Knowsley North by-election|by-election]].\n\nHughes' skill as an organiser was also seen earlier that year when the [[1986 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]] was a [[Merseyside derby]] played between Everton F.C. (which he supported) and their great local rivals, [[Liverpool F.C.]]. Hughes realised that Scottish MPs were given two free tickets to the English FA Cup in which few were interested; he lobbied nearly all the 72 Scots asking if they wanted the tickets or would give them to his constituents. The response was said to be good.<ref>\"Scouse nous\", ''The Times'', 23 April 1986.</ref>\n\n==Shadow Defence minister==\nRe-elected in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]] with a majority nearly doubled on 1983,<ref>Robert Waller. ''The Almanac of British Politics\" 4th Edition'', 1991, {{ISBN|0415064341}}, Routledge, pp. 147-48.</ref> Hughes was appointed as a member of the defence shadow ministerial team to speak on issues relating to the Army.<ref name=\"Dod\"/> His historical knowledge came to be very helpful and Hughes established a strong reputation for being able to spot weaknesses in Government policy; Ministers were said to have made sure they were well briefed when facing him.<ref name=\"Times obituary\"/> A report in the Conservative supporting ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' described him as \"the sort of MP that Labour doesn't deserve to have\", a joke which Hughes himself reportedly enjoyed.<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\"/>\n\nHe had been a lifelong supporter of [[unilateralism|unilateral]] [[nuclear disarmament]] and [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|CND]],<ref name=\"Guardian obituary\"/> but the Labour Party was embarking on a policy review. When [[Denzil Davies]] resigned as Shadow Secretary of State for Defence and was replaced by [[Martin O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Clackmannan|Martin O'Neill]] in 1988, Hughes assisted the team in helping to draft a new defence policy which would not lose votes for the party (as the policy in 1987 was thought to have done). He organised a referendum in his constituency party which appeared to repudiate unilateralism: 68% of party members thought that Britain should give up nuclear weapons only if other countries did so too.<ref name=\"Times obituary\"/> The Labour Party adopted a policy of multilateral disarmament at its 1989 conference.\n\n==Death==\nHughes had been suffering from [[cancer]] for some time before his death in June 1990, one of three Labour MPs on Merseyside to have died in their 40s that year. He left a wife and young daughter.<ref name=\"Times obituary\"/>\n\n==References==\n* ''The Times Guide to the House of Commons'', [[The Times|Times Newspapers Ltd]], 1987 & 1992\n* {{Rayment-hc|date=March 2012}}\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Hansard-contribs|mr-sean-hughes|Sean Hughes}}\n* [http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//ITN/1988/10/05/AS051088022/?s=Sean+Hughes&st=0&pn=4 ITN news report] from 5 October 1988 in which Hughes is interviewed\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{s-new | constituency }}\n{{s-ttl\n  | title  = [[Knowsley South (UK Parliament constituency)|Member for Knowsley South]]\n  | years  = [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] \u2013 [[1990 Knowsley South by-election|1990]]\n}}\n{{s-aft | after  = [[Eddie O'Hara (politician)|Eddie O'Hara]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hughes, Sean}}\n[[Category:1946 births]]\n[[Category:1990 deaths]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Liverpool]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Manchester]]\n[[Category:Deaths from cancer in England]]\n[[Category:Councillors in Merseyside]]\n[[Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:People from Huyton]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992]]\n[[Category:People who died in office]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePolitics:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1970-71 \u2192 1970\u201371", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Hughes_(politician)"}
