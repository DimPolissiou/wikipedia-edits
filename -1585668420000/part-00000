{"title_page": "Roland VK-7", "text_new": "[[Image:Roland VK-7.JPG|thumb|300px|Roland VK-7]]\nThe [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] VK-7 is an electronic keyboard introduced in 1997 which simulates the sound of an electromechanical [[Hammond organ]]. Like other electronic [[musical instrument]]s that emulate (or \"clone\") the sound of the electromechanical tonewheel-based organs formerly manufactured by [[Hammond organ|Hammond]], the VK-7 is referred to as a [[clonewheel organ]].  Currently it is replaced by the [[VK-8]] and the [[VK-88]].\n\nSince transporting the heavy, vintage electromechanical Hammond organs to performances was cumbersome, there was a strong demand amongst musicians for way of recreating the Hammond sound in a more portable fashion. Refinements to Hammond emulations eventually led to the development of relatively lightweight electronic keyboard instruments such as the Roland VK-09 (1981), KORG BX-3 and CX-3 (1980), Roland VK-7 (1997), and Kurzweil K2600 (1999) that produce a fairly realistic re-creation of the Hammond tone.\n\n==Description==\nThe VK-7 is designed to recreate the organ sounds of the 1960s and 1970s jazz and popular music. The instrument has nine harmonic drawbars so that the organist can control the volume of different overtones. The instrument also provides vibrato, chorus, and reverb effects and an overdrive knob, which adds simulated [[tube amplifier]] \"growl\". As with most clonewheel emulator keyboards, the drawbars are positioned to the left of the keyboard. Unlike the Hammond organ, which had two manuals (keyboards), the VK-7 has only a single manual with 61 keys.\n\nNevertheless, the keyboard can be split into two sections, so that the bass drawbars are applied to the low end of the keyboard, and the nine upper drawbars are applied to the rest of the keyboard. This keyboard-split function allows an organist to perform low-register [[bassline]]s and high-register chords and solos on a single keyboard. The organist can view the effect and registration settings on a small LCD screen.\n\nAs well, the instrument contains an orchestral voice section that can be layered with the organ sounds. The sounds include strings, brasses, choirs, percussion instruments (e.g., glockenspiel) and bass sounds. The keyboard has an 11-pin rotary cabinet connector which allows it to be connected to external rotary speaker, such as a [[Leslie speaker|Leslie Speaker]]. It has [[MIDI]] inputs, which means that bass [[pedal keyboard]]s can be used with the instrument, or an additional MIDI keyboard can be connected to the VK-7 (so that the player can have lower and upper manuals with different pre-set tones set up). The chassis has a wood finish with alder wood sideboards.<ref>Mark Vail.

He praised the use of real wood in the chassis and the \"very solid and substantial\" construction, which gave the instrument an authentic \"feel.\"  He praised the ergonomics and layout of the instrument, stating that \"The presets and LCD screen are perfectly positioned centre rear of the keys.\" As well, he noted that \"The drawbars feel smooth and positive and are situated a comfortable 3 cms [sic] in from the left-hand end cheek.\" He argues that Roland should not have placed the volume and reverb knobs on the right side of the keyboard, because the organist must stop playing their right-hand chords or melody to change the volume.

Initially used in a number of television advertisements and serials, the song was released as the album's [[lead single]] on 2005. Written and produced by Madonna in collaboration with [[Stuart Price]], \"Hung Up\" prominently features a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from the instrumental introduction to [[ABBA]]'s hit single \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\", for which Madonna personally sought permission from its songwriters, [[Benny Andersson]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]].\n\nMusically the song is influenced by pop from the 1980s, with a chugging groove and chorus and a background element of a ticking clock that suggests the fear of wasting time. Lyrically the song is written as a traditional [[Dance music|dance]] number about a strong, [[independent woman]] who has relationship troubles. \"Hung Up\" received critical praise from reviewers, who considered it among Madonna's best dance tracks and believed that the track would restore her popularity, which had diminished following the release of her 2003 album ''[[American Life]]''. \"Hung Up\" became a global commercial success, peaking atop the charts of 41 countries and earning a place in the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]''. It was Madonna's 36th top 10 single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard Hot'' 100]], tying her with [[Elvis Presley]] as the artist with most top ten hits. It also became the most successful dance song of the decade in the United States. \"Hung Up\" remains one of the [[List of best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling singles]] of all time, with sales of over nine million copies worldwide.\n\nThe [[music video]] is a tribute to [[John Travolta]] and his movies, and to [[dancing]] in general. Directed by [[Johan Renck]], the clip starts with Madonna clad in a pink [[leotard]] dancing alone in a ballet studio and concludes at a gaming parlor where she dances with her backup troupe. Interspersed are scenes of people displaying their dancing skills in a variety of settings, including a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, a small restaurant and the London Underground. Madonna has performed the song in a number of live appearances, including as the final number of 2006's [[Confessions Tour]], a heavy metal-inspired arrangement in the 2008 leg of the [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]], and 2012's [[The MDNA Tour]], where the singer performed the song while [[slacklining]].\n\n==Background and release==\n[[File:ABBA - TopPop 1974 5.png|thumb|\"Hung Up\" was inspired by [[ABBA]] and samples their 1979 song \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\".]]\nIn 2004, after the release of her ninth studio album ''[[American Life]]'', Madonna began working on two different musicals: one tentatively called ''Hello Suckers'' and another one with [[Luc Besson]],<ref name=attitude>{{cite magazine|url=http://attitude.co.uk/attitude-vaults-madonnas-in-depth-2005-interview/|title=Attitude Archives: Madonna\u2019s in-depth 2005 interview|last1=Todd|first1=Matthew|date=February 1, 2015|magazine=[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]|access-date=May 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523200419/http://attitude.co.uk/attitude-vaults-madonnas-in-depth-2005-interview/|archive-date=May 23, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> who previously directed the music video for her single \"[[Love Profusion]]\",<ref>{{cite web|last=D'Angelo|first=Joe|last2=Cornell|first2=Jeff|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1480436/20031114/madonna.jhtml|title=Madonna Dances With Fairies And Wishes For Animated 'Roses'|publisher=[[MTV News]].

He wanted the video to have a \"documentary\"-style look, much like that of his 2005 film, ''[[Rize (film)|Rize]]'', in which five of the dancers from the \"Hung Up\" video appeared.<ref name=\"mtvvma\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1539338/vmas-behind-camera-madonna.jhtml|title=With No Director And Broken Ribs, Madonna Was 'Hung Up'|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|date=August 25, 2006|publisher=MTV|accessdate=June 24, 2009}}</ref> LaChapelle and Madonna disagreed on the concept, prompting the project to be reassigned to [[Johan Renck]], who worked with Madonna in her video for \"[[Nothing Really Matters]]\". According to an interview with [[MTV]], Renck was directing [[Kate Moss]] for a [[H&M]] commercial when he received a phone call from Madonna who desperately wanted to work with him.<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/> The next day he went to Los Angeles to meet the stylist and the choreographer hired by Madonna, who mailed him with her ideas for the video.<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/> The director explained that he \"kind of liked that we didn't have time to over-think this and be too clever, I like being out on a limb and not know what we're doing and why. Just deal with it, the mayhem, you know?\"<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/>\n\nMadonna clarified that the video was a tribute to [[John Travolta]] and to dance in general. Her dance moves for the video, which were inspired by Travolta's movies like ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977), ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978) and ''[[Perfect (1985 film)|Perfect]]'' (1985) took three hours to shoot.<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/> Madonna had broken eight bones in a horseback-riding accident a few weeks before shooting the video and faced difficulty doing the steps devised by choreographer [[Jamie King]]. Renck said,\n<blockquote>\n\"She was such a trooper, [...] She just fell off a horse! [Madonna said] 'If you were a real dance choreographer, you could tell I can't lift my left arm higher than this'&nbsp;\u2014 and it was like, what, a 20-centimeter difference? [...] But when she said it 'hurts like f---,' she'd take a break and sit down for two minutes. [Madonna]'I have broken ribs, remember that!' I just can't imagine dancing like that. Talk about priorities.\"<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nMadonna wanted to use a few performers from her tour, such as [[Cloud (dancer)|Daniel \"Cloud\" Campos]], [[Miss Prissy (dancer)]] from LaChapelle's ''Rize'' crew and [[traceur]] [[Sebastien Foucan]], a practitioner of [[Parkour]], a philosophical French sport. Renck said that \"It's not about the music, but the bodily expression, [...] We wanted to show the whole spectrum, be it krumping, breakdancing, jazz or disco.\"<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/> Since they could not shoot all over the world, Madonna wanted the video to have an \"omnipresent feel\", with the middle section of the song generating a sense of congregation. Renck suggested that they include a [[boombox]], used as a means of uniting everyone and everything since it was through listening to songs on a boombox that street dancing started. Though some scenes in the video feature cities like London, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai and Tokyo, in reality the actual sets were constructed in Los Angeles and London only. A London suburb was made to look like a Parisian one, where the routine for Parkour takes place, whereas a restaurant in London's Chinatown was used for the Shanghai sequence and Compton stood in for the Bronx. The dancers' scenes were shot in early October 2005 within half a day, for a total of six days of shooting.<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/>\n\n===Release and reception===\nMadonna was also associated with the editing process of the video. She was Renck's editing supervisor. Madonna wanted a raw documentary look for the video which allowed her to be portrayed more realistically. Regarding the making of \"Hung Up\", Renck said that it was a massive work to undertake, \"It's like you form this little family that's flourished and prospered for the month, and then you chop it down like a tree, [...] You come out with a sense of yearning and longing, like, 'Can we just do that again? Please?'\"<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/>\n\nThe video starts with Madonna coming to a ballet studio carrying a boombox. She switches it on as the clock ticking sound of the music starts.<ref name=\"mtvvideo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/madonna/64760/hung-up.jhtml|title=Hung Up&nbsp;\u2013 Madonna music video|publisher=MTV|accessdate=June 25, 2009}}</ref> Wearing a pink leotard, Madonna starts gyrating to the music while doing warm up exercises.

Initially used in a number of television advertisements and serials, the song was released as the album's [[lead single]] on October 17, 2005. Written and produced by Madonna in collaboration with [[Stuart Price]], \"Hung Up\" prominently features a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from the instrumental introduction to [[ABBA]]'s hit single \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\", for which Madonna personally sought permission from its songwriters, [[Benny Andersson]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus]].\n\nMusically the song is influenced by pop from the 1980s, with a chugging groove and chorus and a background element of a ticking clock that suggests the fear of wasting time. Lyrically the song is written as a traditional [[Dance music|dance]] number about a strong, [[independent woman]] who has relationship troubles. \"Hung Up\" received critical praise from reviewers, who considered it among Madonna's best dance tracks and believed that the track would restore her popularity, which had diminished following the release of her 2003 album ''[[American Life]]''. \"Hung Up\" became a global commercial success, peaking atop the charts of 41 countries and earning a place in the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]''. It was Madonna's 36th top 10 single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard Hot'' 100]], tying her with [[Elvis Presley]] as the artist with most top ten hits. It also became the most successful dance song of the decade in the United States. \"Hung Up\" remains one of the [[List of best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling singles]] of all time, with sales of over nine million copies worldwide.\n\nThe [[music video]] is a tribute to [[John Travolta]] and his movies, and to [[dancing]] in general. Directed by [[Johan Renck]], the clip starts with Madonna clad in a pink [[leotard]] dancing alone in a ballet studio and concludes at a gaming parlor where she dances with her backup troupe. Interspersed are scenes of people displaying their dancing skills in a variety of settings, including a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, a small restaurant and the London Underground. Madonna has performed the song in a number of live appearances, including as the final number of 2006's [[Confessions Tour]], a heavy metal-inspired arrangement in the 2008 leg of the [[Sticky & Sweet Tour]], and 2012's [[The MDNA Tour]], where the singer performed the song while [[slacklining]].\n\n==Background and release==\n[[File:ABBA - TopPop 1974 5.png|thumb|\"Hung Up\" was inspired by [[ABBA]] and samples their 1979 song \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\".]]\nIn 2004, after the release of her ninth studio album ''[[American Life]]'', Madonna began working on two different musicals: one tentatively called ''Hello Suckers'' and another one with [[Luc Besson]],<ref name=attitude>{{cite magazine|url=http://attitude.co.uk/attitude-vaults-madonnas-in-depth-2005-interview/|title=Attitude Archives: Madonna\u2019s in-depth 2005 interview|last1=Todd|first1=Matthew|date=February 1, 2015|magazine=[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]|access-date=May 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523200419/http://attitude.co.uk/attitude-vaults-madonnas-in-depth-2005-interview/|archive-date=May 23, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> who previously directed the music video for her single \"[[Love Profusion]]\",<ref>{{cite web|last=D'Angelo|first=Joe|last2=Cornell|first2=Jeff|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1480436/20031114/madonna.jhtml|title=Madonna Dances With Fairies And Wishes For Animated 'Roses'|publisher=[[MTV News]].

He wanted the video to have a \"documentary\"-style look, much like that of his 2005 film, ''[[Rize (film)|Rize]]'', in which five of the dancers from the \"Hung Up\" video appeared.<ref name=\"mtvvma\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1539338/vmas-behind-camera-madonna.jhtml|title=With No Director And Broken Ribs, Madonna Was 'Hung Up'|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|date=August 25, 2006|publisher=MTV|accessdate=June 24, 2009}}</ref> LaChapelle and Madonna disagreed on the concept, prompting the project to be reassigned to [[Johan Renck]], who worked with Madonna in her video for \"[[Nothing Really Matters]]\". According to an interview with [[MTV]], Renck was directing [[Kate Moss]] for a [[H&M]] commercial when he received a phone call from Madonna who desperately wanted to work with him.<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/> The next day he went to Los Angeles to meet the stylist and the choreographer hired by Madonna, who mailed him with her ideas for the video.<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/> The director explained that he \"kind of liked that we didn't have time to over-think this and be too clever, I like being out on a limb and not know what we're doing and why. Just deal with it, the mayhem, you know?\"<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/>\n\nMadonna clarified that the video was a tribute to [[John Travolta]] and to dance in general. Her dance moves for the video, which were inspired by Travolta's movies like ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977), ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978) and ''[[Perfect (1985 film)|Perfect]]'' (1985) took three hours to shoot.<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/> Madonna had broken eight bones in a horseback-riding accident a few weeks before shooting the video and faced difficulty doing the steps devised by choreographer [[Jamie King]]. Renck said,\n<blockquote>\n\"She was such a trooper, [...] She just fell off a horse! [Madonna said] 'If you were a real dance choreographer, you could tell I can't lift my left arm higher than this'&nbsp;\u2014 and it was like, what, a 20-centimeter difference? [...] But when she said it 'hurts like f---,' she'd take a break and sit down for two minutes. [Madonna]'I have broken ribs, remember that!' I just can't imagine dancing like that. Talk about priorities.\"<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nMadonna wanted to use a few performers from her tour, such as [[Cloud (dancer)|Daniel \"Cloud\" Campos]], [[Miss Prissy (dancer)]] from LaChapelle's ''Rize'' crew and [[traceur]] [[Sebastien Foucan]], a practitioner of [[Parkour]], a philosophical French sport. Renck said that \"It's not about the music, but the bodily expression, [...] We wanted to show the whole spectrum, be it krumping, breakdancing, jazz or disco.\"<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/> Since they could not shoot all over the world, Madonna wanted the video to have an \"omnipresent feel\", with the middle section of the song generating a sense of congregation. Renck suggested that they include a [[boombox]], used as a means of uniting everyone and everything since it was through listening to songs on a boombox that street dancing started. Though some scenes in the video feature cities like London, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai and Tokyo, in reality the actual sets were constructed in Los Angeles and London only. A London suburb was made to look like a Parisian one, where the routine for Parkour takes place, whereas a restaurant in London's Chinatown was used for the Shanghai sequence and Compton stood in for the Bronx. The dancers' scenes were shot in early October 2005 within half a day, for a total of six days of shooting.<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/>\n\n===Release and reception===\nMadonna was also associated with the editing process of the video. She was Renck's editing supervisor. Madonna wanted a raw documentary look for the video which allowed her to be portrayed more realistically. Regarding the making of \"Hung Up\", Renck said that it was a massive work to undertake, \"It's like you form this little family that's flourished and prospered for the month, and then you chop it down like a tree, [...] You come out with a sense of yearning and longing, like, 'Can we just do that again? Please?'\"<ref name=\"mtvvma\"/>\n\nThe video starts with Madonna coming to a ballet studio carrying a boombox.

As a result, (then) Governor George W. Bush publicly defended Teen Challenge and pursued alternative licensing procedures for faith-based organizations.

Its documented success rates played a role in the establishment of the [[White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives]] in 2001.\n\nConversely, such funding has come under attack through comments by John Castellani, the former President of Teen Challenge USA, during a House Government Reform subcommittee, examining the efficacy of religious social service providers.

His results also showed that Teen Challenge graduates were much more likely to be employed, with 18 of the 59 working at Teen Challenge itself, which utilizes graduates in its operations.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web | last = Goodstein| first = Laurie| authorlink = | title =  Church-Based Projects Lack Data on Results| work = New York Times| date = 2001-04-24| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03EED61F30F937A15757C0A9679C8B63| format = | doi = | accessdate = 2008-06-12}}</ref>\n\nMuch of these results were to Teen Challenge's benefit, and the high success rates (up to 86%) he found have been quoted in numerous Teen Challenge and Christian Counseling websites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acadc.citymax.com/page/page/2495014.htm|title=Significant research that everybody should know|accessdate=2009-01-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221065833/http://www.acadc.citymax.com/page/page/2495014.htm|archivedate=2009-02-21}}</ref> According to a 2001 ''New York Times'' item, some social scientists complain that the 86 percent success rate of Teen Challenge disregards those who dropped out of the program, and that like many private and religious organizations, Teen Challenge selects its clients. Teen Challenge reports that 25 to 30 percent typically drop out in the program's first four-month phase, and 10 percent more in the next eight months.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> In their testimony before the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]], [[Texas Freedom Network]] Education Fund, have claimed that the much-quoted success rates \"dramatically distort the truth\", due to the lack of reference to the drop-out rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waysandmeans.house.gov/legacy/humres/107cong/6-14-01/6-14smoo.htm|title=Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Human Resources and Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures of the House Committee on Ways and Means|date=2001-06-14|publisher=House Committee on Ways and Means|accessdate=2009-01-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112035516/http://waysandmeans.house.gov/legacy/humres/107cong/6-14-01/6-14smoo.htm|archivedate=2009-01-12}}</ref> Doug Wever, author of \"The Teen Challenge Therapeutic Model\", stated, \"I would respectfully suggest that the Texas Freedom Network's position here is overstated in that it's not unusual at all for the research design of effectiveness studies to look only at graduates; therefore the outcomes of these independent studies do provide a legitimate and dramatic basis for comparison given the results.  At the same time, Teen Challenge must be careful to communicate what has actually been measured.\"<ref>Doug Wever of Alabama Teen Challenge and Global Teen Challenge in an interview, June 2009, Seale, AL</ref>\n\n==Public policy effects==\nIn 1995, auditors from the Texas Commission for Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA) demanded that Teen Challenge obtain state licensing and employ state-licensed counselors. As a result, (then) Governor George W. Bush publicly defended Teen Challenge and pursued alternative licensing procedures for faith-based organizations. ''\u201cTeen Challenge should view itself as a pioneer in how Texas approaches faith-based programs. I'll call together people, ask them to make recommendations... licensing standards have to be different from what they are today,\u201d'' then-Governor Bush said.<ref Name=\"World\">{{cite web | last = Maynard| first = Roy | authorlink = |author2=Marvin Olasky | date= 8 May 1995 | title = Governor Bush backs Teen Challenge | publisher = World Magazine |url=http://www.worldmag.com/articles/11016}}</ref>\n\nBush then created a state Task Force on Faith-Based Programs, to identify and lift regulatory barriers for faith-based social service providers.[https://web.archive.org/web/20030316133310/http://www.twc.state.tx.us/svcs/charchoice/faithful.pdf] The task force included J. Herbert Meppelink, the Executive Director of South Texas Teen Challenge.[https://web.archive.org/web/20030316133310/http://www.twc.state.tx.us/svcs/charchoice/faithful.pdf] The resultant 1997 and 1999 Texas legislation exempted Faith-Based Programs, such as Teen Challenge, from state licensing and the health, safety and quality of care standards that accompany that licensing.\n\nLater, when Bush became US president, Teen Challenge was cited in public policy debates as an example of why such programs merit the federal funding of faith-based organizations. Its documented success rates played a role in the establishment of the [[White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives]] in 2001.\n\nConversely, such funding has come under attack through comments by John Castellani, the former President of Teen Challenge USA, during a House Government Reform subcommittee, examining the efficacy of religious social service providers. During the hearing, Castellani said Teen Challenge does not hire non-Christians as employees and, when asked if the group takes non-Christians as clients, he said yes, and boasted that some Jews who finish his Teen Challenge program become \"completed Jews.\" <ref name=\"AU\">{{cite web| title =Faith-Based Group Draws Criticism for Telling House Congressional Committee about \"Completed Jews\"| publisher =Americans United for Separation of Church and State| date =2001-05-24| url =http://www.au.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=6061&abbr=pr&security=1002&news_iv_ctrl=1379| accessdate =2008-04-01| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080513090856/http://www.au.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=6061&abbr=pr&security=1002&news_iv_ctrl=1379| archive-date =2008-05-13| url-status =dead}}</ref><ref name =\"NYT2\">{{cite web| last = Goodstein| first = Laurie| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01EED71E3DF936A15756C0A9679C8B63&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/J/Jews%20and%20Judaism | title = A Reference to Jews Heats Up Aid Debate |work= New York Times | date =2001-05-25 |page= A19}}</ref> The \"completed Jews\" phrase has been used by some Christians and Messianic Jews to refer to people who previously followed Judaism and have become believers in Yeshua (Jesus);<ref name=\"AU\"/><ref name =\"NYT2\"/> many Jewish groups consider it offensive because of the implication that those who don't believe in Jesus are \"incomplete\".<ref name=\"AU\"/><ref name =\"NYT2\"/> Critics of faith-based funding cite this as an example of how  religious intolerance could be publicly funded.[https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190609/http://waysandmeans.house.gov/legacy/humres/107cong/6-14-01/record/foltin.htm#8]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.teenchallengeusa.com/ Official USA Website]\n*[http://globaltc.org/ Official Global website]\n\n{{Portal|Evangelical Christianity|}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adult and Teen Challenge}}\n[[Category:Evangelical Christian humanitarian organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug rehabilitation]]\n[[Category:Addiction and substance abuse organizations]]\n", "name_user": "Komakose", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_%26_Teen_Challenge"}
