These troops were generally [[Filipinos]] and [[Filipino-Americans]] assigned to the [[United States Army]] [[Philippine Department]], under the command of [[white American]] [[commissioned officer]]s (though a handful of Filipino Americans received commissions from the [[United States Military Academy]]). Philippine Scout units were given the suffix \"'''(PS)'''\", to distinguish them from other U.S. Army units.\n\nThe first Scout companies were organized by the US in 1901 to combat the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] led at that time by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. In 1919\u20131920, the PS companies were grouped into regiments as part of the [[United States Army|US Army]] and redesignated the [[43d Infantry Regiment (PS)|43d]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th]], and [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)|57th Infantry Regiments]], plus the [[24th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|25th Field Artillery Regiments]], the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] and the [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st]] and [[92nd Coast Artillery (United States)|92nd Coast Artillery Regiments]]. Service and support formations were also organized as engineer, medical, quartermaster and military police units. The infantry and field artillery regiments were grouped together with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment]] to form the U.S. Army's [[Philippine Division]]. At this point, the Scouts became the U.S. Army's front line troops in the Pacific.\n\nThe Philippine Department assigned the Scouts to subdue the [[Moro people|Moro tribes]] on the island of Mindanao (see [[Moro rebellion]]), and to establish tranquility throughout the islands. In the 1930s, Philippine Scouts, along with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]], saw action at [[Palawan|Jolo, Palawan]].\n\nPhilippine Scout regiments became the first United States Army units to be in combat during World War II, until the surrender of [[USAFFE]] in May 1942. Even after that some individual soldiers and units refused to surrender and become beginning elements of the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines#Resistance|resistance to the Japanese occupation]]. Later paroled [[POWs]] would also join the resistance.\n\n==Macabebe Scouts==\n{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name=Macabebe Scouts\n|image=\n|caption=\n|dates=1896\u20131901\n|country={{flagdeco|Spain|1785}} [[Restoration (Spain)|Spain]]<br>{{small|(1896\u20131898)}}<br />{{flag|United States|1896}}<br>{{small|(1898\u20131901)}}\n|allegiance={{flagdeco|Spain|1785}} [[Restoration (Spain)|Kingdom of Spain]]\n* {{flagdeco|Spain|1785}} [[Spanish East Indies]]<br>{{small|(1896\u20131898)}}\n{{flag|United States of America|1896}}\n* {{flagdeco|United States|1896}} [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|Military Government]]<br>{{small|(1899\u20131901)}}\n|branch={{flagdeco|Spain|1785}} [[Spanish Army]] (1896\u20131898)<br>\n{{army|United States}} (1899\u20131901)\n|type= [[Irregular military|Irregulars]]\n|role= [[military intelligence|intelligence]], [[reconnaissance]]\n|size= 1402 in December 1900<ref name=dum>{{cite web |last=Dumindin |first=Arnaldo |title=Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 |url=http://www.filipinoamericanwar.com/thewarrages1899.htm |accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n|command_structure=\n|garrison=\n|garrison_label=\n|nickname=\n|patron=\n|motto=\n|colors=\n|march=\n|mascot=\n|equipment=\n|equipment_label=\n|battles=[[Philippine Revolution]]<br>[[Spanish\u2013American War]]<br>[[Philippine\u2013American War]]<br>[[Moro rebellion]]\n|anniversaries=\n|decorations=\n|battle_honours=\n|disbanded=\n<!-- Commanders -->\n|commander1=\n|commander1_label=\n|commander2=\n|commander2_label=\n|commander3=\n|commander3_label=\n|notable_commanders=Col.

Over the next three months the Japanese Army marched through [[Southeast Asia]], and by March 1942 the Japanese had completely overrun every country and island in the western Pacific\u2014except the Philippines.\n\nOn the [[Bataan Peninsula]] of [[Luzon Island]], the Philippine Scouts, a few U.S. Army National Guard units, and ten divisions of poorly equipped, almost untrained [[Philippine Army]] soldiers held out against the Japanese. Survivors of the [[Battle of Bataan]], to a man, describe the Philippine Scouts as the backbone of the American defense there. President Franklin Roosevelt awarded the U.S. Army\u2019s first three [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] of World War II to Philippine Scouts: to Sergeant [[Jose Calugas]] for action at Culis, Bataan on January 6, 1942, to Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]] for action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, and to Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] for action near Bagac, Bataan on February 3, 1942.\n\nWith the U.S. Navy at [[Pearl Harbor]] in shambles, and the Japanese Navy blockading the Philippines, there was no way to send adequate amounts of food, medicine, ammunition or reinforcements to Bataan. Early in the campaign, in January 1942, General MacArthur ordered that his forces be fed one-half daily rations because the USAFFE food-stocks on Bataan were insufficient for the planned six-month siege. Such a diet did not provide enough calories for men working and fighting in the tropical heat of the Philippines' Dry Season. Nonetheless, the Scouts and the other soldiers held out for more than four months without adequate food or medicine, while malaria, dysentery and malnutrition ravaged their ranks, and Japanese attacks drove them further down the [[Bataan Peninsula]]. In the midst of the [[Battle of Bataan]], on 11 March 1942, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]] spirited out of the Philippines by PT boat and airplane.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nThe [[Battle of Bataan]] ended on April 9, 1942, when [[Edward P. King|Major General Edward P. King, Jr.]], surrendered rather than see any more of his starving, diseased men slaughtered by the advancing enemy. At that point 70,000 men became [[Prisoners of War]]: about 16,000 Americans and 54,000 Filipinos. Japanese soldiers marched the emaciated Scouts, American soldiers, and Philippine Army men sixty-five miles up the Bataan Peninsula's East Road on the notorious \"March of Death,\" the [[Bataan Death March]]. During the March, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted between 7,000 and 10,000 men who fell, attempted to escape, or just stopped to quench their thirst at roadside spigots or puddles. They also beat and sometimes killed Filipino civilians who attempted to give food and water to the POWs, and at times flashed the \"V\" for \"Victory\" hand-gesture to the defeated soldiers along the length of the Death March. The March ended at the railroad head in San Fernando, Pampanga province. There the POWs were forced into overcrowded \"40 and 10\" railroad cars, which only had enough room for them to sit down in shifts on the final leg of the trip to Capas, Tarlac province. At Capas they were herded into Camp O'Donnell, a former Philippine Army training camp, which was to be their prison camp.\n\nAt [[Camp O'Donnell]] the Japanese crammed all 60,000 survivors into a Philippine Army camp designed to accommodate 10,000 men. There, the Japanese commander greeted each new group of arrivals with the discouraging \"Goddamn you to Hell\" speech in his native language, and assured the men that they were \"captives,\" not Prisoners of War, and would be treated as such. There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care, and only slit trenches for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoner's food, and malaria, dysentery, beriberi and a host of other diseases swept through the crowds of men. They began to die at the rate of four hundred per day.\n\nFrom September through December 1942, the Japanese gradually paroled the surviving Philippine Scouts and other Filipino soldiers to their families and to the mayors of their hometowns. But by the time Camp O'Donnell closed in January 1943, after eight months of operation, 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino [[Prisoners of War]] had died there.\n\nThe Japanese transferred the American prisoners to [[Cabanatuan]], Nueva Ecija province, where conditions were only marginally better. But as U.S. forces pulled closer to the Philippines in 1944, they [[Hell ship|evacuated]] the healthiest American prisoners to [[Japan]] and [[Manchuria]], for use as slave laborers. Thousands of men were crammed into the dark holds of cargo ships so tightly that they could not sit or lay down. Again, food and water were scarce, sanitary facilities were non-existent, and the heat in the closed holds of the ships was unbearable. Men suffocated to death standing up. The Japanese ships were unmarked and some of them were torpedoed by American submarines. More of the men died of malnutrition and exposure in the work camps. By the time Japan surrendered and the U.S. and Filipino Army liberated the Bataan Prisoners of War, two-thirds of the American prisoners had died in Japanese custody.\n\n==Liberation and the \"New\" Scouts==\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines an extensive Filipino [[guerrilla]] movement sprang up. In some cases the guerrilla units were led by escaped American officers (e.g., [[Wendell Fertig]]) and often included \"paroled\" Philippine Scout and Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers, along with civilian members of the Philippine underground. As MacArthur\u2019s forces, supported by the guerrillas, liberated the [[Philippine Islands]], the surviving Philippine Scouts stepped forward and rejoined the U.S. Army. The Filipino guerrillas joined them, and the U.S. Army set up new Philippine Scout units, reconstituting the old Philippine Division as the [[Philippine Division (United States)|12th Infantry Division]]. Subordinate units included the [[43rd Infantry Regiment (PS)|43rd]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (PS)|44th]] and [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th Infantry Regiments]] (PS); [[23rd Field Artillery (PS)|23rd]], [[24th Field Artillery (PS)|24th]] and [[88th Field Artillery (PS)|88th Field Artillery]] (PS) Battalions; [[56th Engineer Battalion (PS)]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)]]. The \"New Scouts\" actively participated in combat against the Japanese Army in north [[Luzon]], served as [[military police]] to restore order and help locate pockets of escaped Japanese in the south, and served as occupation forces on [[Okinawa]]. As planning for the invasion of Japan progressed, the Philippine Scouts were included in the invasion forces, and were selected to become part of the occupying force once Japan was defeated.\n\nAfter Japan surrendered in August 1945, the United States granted the Republic of the Philippines full independence on July 4, 1946. At that point the ethnically Filipino Philippine Scouts held a unique status in U.S. military history: they were soldiers in the regular U.S. Army, but now they were citizens of a foreign country. To solve this dilemma, the United States offered the Filipinos in the Philippine Scouts full [[U.S. citizenship]]. Many of the surviving Scouts, perhaps around 1,000, accepted, and the Army transferred them to other units to finish their military careers.\n\nWith the consent of the Philippine government, Congress approved the maintenance of 50,000 Philippine Scouts. Under Major General Hibbs, Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division (PS) was reconstituted. Unlike its previous organization enlisted personnel of the division were exclusively Philippine Scouts. The War Department also proposed organizing a second Philippine Scout division, the [[14th Infantry Division (United States)|14th]], but never did so.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

Children of the Scouts (known as \"Army Soup\" in pre-World War II Fort William McKinley days) sometimes carried on their fathers' military traditions and also became US Army soldiers and Marines. Two Philippine Scout children even earned the stars of US Army generals: Lt. General [[Edward Soriano]] and Major General [[Antonio M. Taguba]]. A third, Brig. General [[Oscar Hilman]], a native of Washington state and an armor officer who had started out as an enlisted man, earned his star in a long career in the Army National Guard.\n\nUnlike other non-citizen veterans, veterans of the Philippine Division and other Filipinos who fought as part of the [[USAFFE]] were never granted citizenship. Since 1993, various bills have been introduced to the [[United States Congress]] under the name [[Filipino Veterans Fairness Act]] to rectify this. However, this was a complicated matter as after the liberation of the Philippines members of the Philippine Scouts were offered enlistments and in some applicable cases commissions in the US Army and subsequent citizenship. Large numbers of \"old\" Philippine Scouts (those enlisting before or during World War II) took advantage of this. However, most \"new\" Philippine Scouts (those recruited following the war, mostly for occupation duty on Okinawa and elsewhere) were not offered citizenship. Language similar to the aforementioned proposed legislation was inserted by the Senate into the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Maze |title=Senate puts Filipino vet pensions in stimulus |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/01/military_filipinoscouts_stimulus_012909w/ |format=News article |work=Army Times |date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Buried inside the Senate bill, which includes tax cuts and new spending initiatives intended to create jobs in the U.S., the Filipino payment was inserted at the urging of Sen.

This provided a one-time payment to those veterans who are recognized as being soldiers or recognized guerrilla members by the United States or their surviving spouse. Even this, however, falls far short of the benefits available to similar veterans of other units.\n\nIn 2012, a [[documentary film]] named ''Forgotten Soldiers'' was produced by Donald A.

These troops were generally [[Filipinos]] and [[Filipino-Americans]] assigned to the [[United States Army]] [[Philippine Department]], under the command of [[white American]] [[commissioned officer]]s (though a handful of Filipino Americans received commissions from the [[United States Military Academy]]). Philippine Scout units were given the suffix \"'''(PS)'''\", to distinguish them from other U.S. Army units.\n\nThe first Scout companies were organized by the US in 1901 to combat the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] led at that time by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. In 1919\u20131920, the PS companies were grouped into regiments as part of the [[United States Army|US Army]] and redesignated the [[43d Infantry Regiment (PS)|43d]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th]], and [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)|57th Infantry Regiments]], plus the [[24th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|25th Field Artillery Regiments]], the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] and the [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st]] and [[92nd Coast Artillery (United States)|92nd Coast Artillery Regiments]]. Service and support formations were also organized as engineer, medical, quartermaster and military police units. The infantry and field artillery regiments were grouped together with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment]] to form the U.S. Army's [[Philippine Division]]. At this point, the Scouts became the U.S. Army's front line troops in the Pacific.\n\nThe Philippine Department assigned the Scouts to subdue the [[Moro people|Moro tribes]] on the island of Mindanao (see [[Moro rebellion]]), and to establish tranquility throughout the islands.

MacArthur took command of all military forces in the Philippines except the U.S. Navy's [[Asiatic Fleet]]. The [[Philippine Division]], [[Philippine Department]] and all other Philippine Scout units were included in USAFFE, as was the U.S. Army's [[United States Far East Air Force|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF). At the time of USAFFE's formation, the unit consisted of 22,532 troops, of which 11,972 were Philippine Scouts.\n\nOf the 22,532 troops, 10,473 were members of the Philippine Division, itself containing 2,552 Americans and 7,921 Filipinos. All of the division's enlisted men, with the exception of the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]] and some of the [[Military Police Corps (United States)|military police]] and headquarters troops, were Philippine Scouts.\n\n==Filipino Officers within the Philippine Division, July 1941==\nIn 1910, the U.S. Army began sending one outstanding Filipino soldier per year to West Point.

Over the next three months the Japanese Army marched through [[Southeast Asia]], and by March 1942 the Japanese had completely overrun every country and island in the western Pacific\u2014except the Philippines.\n\nOn the [[Bataan Peninsula]] of [[Luzon Island]], the Philippine Scouts, a few U.S. Army National Guard units, and ten divisions of poorly equipped, almost untrained [[Philippine Army]] soldiers held out against the Japanese. Survivors of the [[Battle of Bataan]], to a man, describe the Philippine Scouts as the backbone of the American defense there. President Franklin Roosevelt awarded the U.S. Army\u2019s first three [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] of World War II to Philippine Scouts: to Sergeant [[Jose Calugas]] for action at Culis, Bataan on January 6, 1942, to Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]] for action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, and to Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] for action near Bagac, Bataan on February 3, 1942.\n\nWith the U.S. Navy at [[Pearl Harbor]] in shambles, and the Japanese Navy blockading the Philippines, there was no way to send adequate amounts of food, medicine, ammunition or reinforcements to Bataan. Early in the campaign, in January 1942, General MacArthur ordered that his forces be fed one-half daily rations because the USAFFE food-stocks on Bataan were insufficient for the planned six-month siege. Such a diet did not provide enough calories for men working and fighting in the tropical heat of the Philippines' Dry Season. Nonetheless, the Scouts and the other soldiers held out for more than four months without adequate food or medicine, while malaria, dysentery and malnutrition ravaged their ranks, and Japanese attacks drove them further down the [[Bataan Peninsula]]. In the midst of the [[Battle of Bataan]], on 11 March 1942, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]] spirited out of the Philippines by PT boat and airplane.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nThe [[Battle of Bataan]] ended on April 9, 1942, when [[Edward P. King|Major General Edward P. King, Jr.]], surrendered rather than see any more of his starving, diseased men slaughtered by the advancing enemy. At that point 70,000 men became [[Prisoners of War]]: about 16,000 Americans and 54,000 Filipinos. Japanese soldiers marched the emaciated Scouts, American soldiers, and Philippine Army men sixty-five miles up the Bataan Peninsula's East Road on the notorious \"March of Death,\" the [[Bataan Death March]]. During the March, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted between 7,000 and 10,000 men who fell, attempted to escape, or just stopped to quench their thirst at roadside spigots or puddles. They also beat and sometimes killed Filipino civilians who attempted to give food and water to the POWs, and at times flashed the \"V\" for \"Victory\" hand-gesture to the defeated soldiers along the length of the Death March. The March ended at the railroad head in San Fernando, Pampanga province. There the POWs were forced into overcrowded \"40 and 10\" railroad cars, which only had enough room for them to sit down in shifts on the final leg of the trip to Capas, Tarlac province. At Capas they were herded into Camp O'Donnell, a former Philippine Army training camp, which was to be their prison camp.\n\nAt [[Camp O'Donnell]] the Japanese crammed all 60,000 survivors into a Philippine Army camp designed to accommodate 10,000 men. There, the Japanese commander greeted each new group of arrivals with the discouraging \"Goddamn you to Hell\" speech in his native language, and assured the men that they were \"captives,\" not Prisoners of War, and would be treated as such. There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care, and only slit trenches for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoner's food, and malaria, dysentery, beriberi and a host of other diseases swept through the crowds of men. They began to die at the rate of four hundred per day.\n\nFrom September through December 1942, the Japanese gradually paroled the surviving Philippine Scouts and other Filipino soldiers to their families and to the mayors of their hometowns. But by the time Camp O'Donnell closed in January 1943, after eight months of operation, 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino [[Prisoners of War]] had died there.\n\nThe Japanese transferred the American prisoners to [[Cabanatuan]], Nueva Ecija province, where conditions were only marginally better. But as U.S. forces pulled closer to the Philippines in 1944, they [[Hell ship|evacuated]] the healthiest American prisoners to [[Japan]] and [[Manchuria]], for use as slave laborers. Thousands of men were crammed into the dark holds of cargo ships so tightly that they could not sit or lay down. Again, food and water were scarce, sanitary facilities were non-existent, and the heat in the closed holds of the ships was unbearable. Men suffocated to death standing up. The Japanese ships were unmarked and some of them were torpedoed by American submarines. More of the men died of malnutrition and exposure in the work camps. By the time Japan surrendered and the U.S. and Filipino Army liberated the Bataan Prisoners of War, two-thirds of the American prisoners had died in Japanese custody.\n\n==Liberation and the \"New\" Scouts==\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines an extensive Filipino [[guerrilla]] movement sprang up. In some cases the guerrilla units were led by escaped American officers (e.g., [[Wendell Fertig]]) and often included \"paroled\" Philippine Scout and Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers, along with civilian members of the Philippine underground. As MacArthur\u2019s forces, supported by the guerrillas, liberated the [[Philippine Islands]], the surviving Philippine Scouts stepped forward and rejoined the U.S. Army. The Filipino guerrillas joined them, and the U.S. Army set up new Philippine Scout units, reconstituting the old Philippine Division as the [[Philippine Division (United States)|12th Infantry Division]]. Subordinate units included the [[43rd Infantry Regiment (PS)|43rd]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (PS)|44th]] and [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th Infantry Regiments]] (PS); [[23rd Field Artillery (PS)|23rd]], [[24th Field Artillery (PS)|24th]] and [[88th Field Artillery (PS)|88th Field Artillery]] (PS) Battalions; [[56th Engineer Battalion (PS)]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)]]. The \"New Scouts\" actively participated in combat against the Japanese Army in north [[Luzon]], served as [[military police]] to restore order and help locate pockets of escaped Japanese in the south, and served as occupation forces on [[Okinawa]]. As planning for the invasion of Japan progressed, the Philippine Scouts were included in the invasion forces, and were selected to become part of the occupying force once Japan was defeated.\n\nAfter Japan surrendered in August 1945, the United States granted the Republic of the Philippines full independence on July 4, 1946. At that point the ethnically Filipino Philippine Scouts held a unique status in U.S. military history: they were soldiers in the regular U.S. Army, but now they were citizens of a foreign country. To solve this dilemma, the United States offered the Filipinos in the Philippine Scouts full [[U.S. citizenship]]. Many of the surviving Scouts, perhaps around 1,000, accepted, and the Army transferred them to other units to finish their military careers.\n\nWith the consent of the Philippine government, Congress approved the maintenance of 50,000 Philippine Scouts. Under Major General Hibbs, Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division (PS) was reconstituted. Unlike its previous organization enlisted personnel of the division were exclusively Philippine Scouts. The War Department also proposed organizing a second Philippine Scout division, the [[14th Infantry Division (United States)|14th]], but never did so.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

Children of the Scouts (known as \"Army Soup\" in pre-World War II Fort William McKinley days) sometimes carried on their fathers' military traditions and also became US Army soldiers and Marines. Two Philippine Scout children even earned the stars of US Army generals: Lt. General [[Edward Soriano]] and Major General [[Antonio M. Taguba]]. A third, Brig. General [[Oscar Hilman]], a native of Washington state and an armor officer who had started out as an enlisted man, earned his star in a long career in the Army National Guard.\n\nUnlike other non-citizen veterans, veterans of the Philippine Division and other Filipinos who fought as part of the [[USAFFE]] were never granted citizenship. Since 1993, various bills have been introduced to the [[United States Congress]] under the name [[Filipino Veterans Fairness Act]] to rectify this. However, this was a complicated matter as after the liberation of the Philippines members of the Philippine Scouts were offered enlistments and in some applicable cases commissions in the US Army and subsequent citizenship. Large numbers of \"old\" Philippine Scouts (those enlisting before or during World War II) took advantage of this. However, most \"new\" Philippine Scouts (those recruited following the war, mostly for occupation duty on Okinawa and elsewhere) were not offered citizenship. Language similar to the aforementioned proposed legislation was inserted by the Senate into the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Maze |title=Senate puts Filipino vet pensions in stimulus |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/01/military_filipinoscouts_stimulus_012909w/ |format=News article |work=Army Times |date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Buried inside the Senate bill, which includes tax cuts and new spending initiatives intended to create jobs in the U.S., the Filipino payment was inserted at the urging of Sen.

This provided a one-time payment to those veterans who are recognized as being soldiers or recognized guerrilla members by the United States or their surviving spouse. Even this, however, falls far short of the benefits available to similar veterans of other units.\n\nIn 2012, a [[documentary film]] named ''Forgotten Soldiers'' was produced by Donald A.

The committee is said to be waiting for the administration to nominate individuals to fill two more vacancies at the commission before it holds the hearing, according to Senate aides and people familiar with the process,\" reported the ''Wall Street Journal''.<ref name=\"wsj01\"/>\n\nIn July 2017, the ''New York Times'' assessed the pace and reported that Trump had announced 36 percent of \"leadership positions below the secretary level\" compared with 78 percent by Obama over the same period. Average approval time has been nine days slower for Trump appointees versus Obama's. Ten of 15 Cabinet agencies had no number two, several deputy secretaries were not nominated until after the Administration's 100-day mark, and some had not yet been nominated.<ref>Yourish, Karen, and Gregor Aisch, [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/17/us/politics/trump-appointments.html \"The Top Jobs in Trump\u2019s Administration Are Mostly Vacant: Who\u2019s to Blame?\"], ''New York Times'', July 17, 2017.

The film was produced by K\u014dichir\u014d It\u014d and Katsuhiro Takei, with music composed by [[Radwimps]]. ''Your Name'' tells the story of Taki, a high school boy in [[Tokyo]] and Mitsuha, a high school girl in a rural town, who suddenly and inexplicably begin to [[Body swap|swap bodies]]. The film stars the voices of [[Ryunosuke Kamiki]], [[Mone Kamishiraishi]], [[Masami Nagasawa]] and [[Etsuko Ichihara]]. Shinkai's [[Your Name (novel)|eponymous novel]] was published a month before the film's premiere.\n\n''Your Name'' was distributed by [[Toho]]. It premiered at the [[Anime Expo|Anime Expo 2016]] convention in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on July 3, 2016, and in Japan on August 26, 2016.

The film was followed by [[stand-alone sequel]] ''[[Weathering with You]]'' in 2019, in which Taki and Mitsuha appear in supporting roles. An American live-action remake set in the United States is currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\nMitsuha Miyamizu is a high school girl living in the town of Itomori in Japan's mountainous [[Hida region]]. She is bored with country life and wishes to be a handsome boy in her next life. She begins to [[Body swap|switch bodies]] intermittently with Taki Tachibana, a high school boy in Tokyo, when they wake up. They communicate by writing messages on paper, their phones, and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha causes Taki to develop a relationship with his coworker Miki, while Taki causes Mitsuha to become popular in school.\n\nOne day, Taki, as Mitsuha, accompanies her grandmother and sister to leave the ritual alcohol ''[[kuchikamizake]]'', made by Mitsuha, as an offering at the family [[Shinto shrine|shrine]] on a mountaintop outside the town. The shrine is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god ruling human experiences and connections. Mitsuha's latest note tells Taki about the comet [[Tiamat]] expected to pass Earth on the day of her town [[Japanese festivals|festival]].\n\nThe next day, Taki wakes up in his body. After an unsuccessful date with Miki, he tries to call Mitsuha but cannot reach her, and the body-switching ends. He decides to meet her directly, but not knowing the town's name he has to rely on his memories of the scenery. A restaurant owner in Hida finally recognizes Itomori from Taki's sketch and tells him when the comet unexpectedly split into two; the larger piece kept moving, but the smaller one crashed onto Earth and destroyed the town. Looking at the site of the crater and while in disbelief that Mitsuha was dead this whole time, her messages on his phone disappear and his memories start fading away. Taki finds Mitsuha's name in the records of fatalities and discovers from the date of the disaster that their timelines were separated by three years.\n\nTaki goes to the shrine to drink Mitsuha's sake from the bottle, hoping to reconnect with her body and warn her about the comet strike. Through a vision, Taki discovers that a girl he encountered on the train three years prior was Mitsuha: not knowing they were separated by three years, she, having fallen in love with him, had met his past self while trying to meet with him personally. He wakes up in her body on the morning of the town festival; Mitsuha's grandmother deduces what is happening and tells him the body-switching is part of the family history as caretakers of the shrine. He convinces Mitsuha's friends, Tessie and Sayaka, to help evacuate the town by cutting the power and broadcasting a [[Broadcast signal intrusion|false emergency alert]], but the plan fails. Realizing that Mitsuha must be in his body at the shrine, he goes back to find her.\n\nMitsuha wakes up in Taki's body at the shrine. When Taki reaches the shrine as the sun is setting, the two sense each other's presence, but are separated by three years. However, when twilight falls (referred to in the film as \"magic hour\"),{{refn|group=\"note\"|\"Kataware-Doki,\" the word Taki and Mitsuha use, is turned from \"kawatare-doki,\" an old Japanese word meaning twilight. \"Kawatare\" (\u5f7c\u306f\u8ab0) literally means \"Who is he/she?\"; \"kataware\" also has the same sound as a word meaning one of the couple (\u7247\u5272\u308c). In old Japan, people believed that supernatural occurrences were possible at twilight.}} they return to their own bodies and meet. They attempt to write each other's names on their hands so they will remember each other, but twilight passes and Mitsuha disappears before she can write hers.\n\nAs Mitsuha races back to convince her father, the town mayor, to evacuate the town, her memories of Taki start to fade, and discovers that Taki wrote \"I love you\" on her hand instead of his name. The comet piece crashes to Earth, destroying the town. Taki wakes up in his own time, only to remember nothing.\n\nFive years later, Taki has graduated from university and is searching for a job. He senses he is missing something important, and learns that the inhabitants of the town survived by following the mayor's order. One day, Taki and Mitsuha see each other when their trains draw parallel, and are compelled to disembark and search for one another, finally meeting on a staircase. They initially walk past each other, before Taki uneasily asks Mitsuha if he had met her before, and she replies that she felt the same way: their connection reestablishing, they shed tears of happiness, and simultaneously ask for each other's names.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n!

The film was followed by [[stand-alone sequel]] ''[[Weathering with You]]'' in 2019, in which Taki and Mitsuha appear in supporting roles. An American live-action remake set in the United States is currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\nMitsuha Miyamizu is a high school girl living in the town of Itomori in Japan's mountainous [[Hida region]]. She is bored with country life and wishes to be a handsome boy in her next life. She begins to [[Body swap|switch bodies]] intermittently with Taki Tachibana, a high school boy in Tokyo, when they wake up. They communicate by writing messages on paper, their phones, and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha causes Taki to develop a relationship with his coworker Miki, while Taki causes Mitsuha to become popular in school.\n\nOne day, Taki, as Mitsuha, accompanies her grandmother and sister to leave the ritual alcohol ''[[kuchikamizake]]'', made by Mitsuha, as an offering at the family [[Shinto shrine|shrine]] on a mountaintop outside the town. The shrine is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god ruling human experiences and connections. Mitsuha's latest note tells Taki about the comet [[Tiamat]] expected to pass Earth on the day of her town [[Japanese festivals|festival]].\n\nThe next day, Taki wakes up in his body. After an unsuccessful date with Miki, he tries to call Mitsuha but cannot reach her, and the body-switching ends. He decides to meet her directly, but not knowing the town's name he has to rely on his memories of the scenery. A restaurant owner in Hida finally recognizes Itomori from Taki's sketch and tells him when the comet unexpectedly split into two; the larger piece kept moving, but the smaller one crashed onto Earth and destroyed the town. Looking at the site of the crater and while in disbelief that Mitsuha was dead this whole time, her messages on his phone disappear and his memories start fading away. Taki finds Mitsuha's name in the records of fatalities and discovers from the date of the disaster that their timelines were separated by three years.\n\nTaki goes to the shrine to drink Mitsuha's sake from the bottle, hoping to reconnect with her body and warn her about the comet strike. Through a vision, Taki discovers that a girl he encountered on the train three years prior was Mitsuha: not knowing they were separated by three years, she, having fallen in love with him, had met his past self while trying to meet with him personally. He wakes up in her body on the morning of the town festival; Mitsuha's grandmother deduces what is happening and tells him the body-switching is part of the family history as caretakers of the shrine. He convinces Mitsuha's friends, Tessie and Sayaka, to help evacuate the town by cutting the power and broadcasting a [[Broadcast signal intrusion|false emergency alert]], but the plan fails. Realizing that Mitsuha must be in his body at the shrine, he goes back to find her.\n\nMitsuha wakes up in Taki's body at the shrine. When Taki reaches the shrine as the sun is setting, the two sense each other's presence, but are separated by three years. However, when twilight falls (referred to in the film as \"magic hour\"),{{refn|group=\"note\"|\"Kataware-Doki,\" the word Taki and Mitsuha use, is turned from \"kawatare-doki,\" an old Japanese word meaning twilight. \"Kawatare\" (\u5f7c\u306f\u8ab0) literally means \"Who is he/she?\"; \"kataware\" also has the same sound as a word meaning one of the couple (\u7247\u5272\u308c). In old Japan, people believed that supernatural occurrences were possible at twilight.}} they return to their own bodies and meet. They attempt to write each other's names on their hands so they will remember each other, but twilight passes and Mitsuha disappears before she can write hers.\n\nAs Mitsuha races back to convince her father, the town mayor, to evacuate the town, her memories of Taki start to fade, and discovers that Taki wrote \"I love you\" on her hand instead of his name. The comet piece crashes to Earth, destroying the town. Taki wakes up in his own time, only to remember nothing.\n\nFive years later, Taki has graduated from university and is searching for a job. He senses he is missing something important, and learns that the inhabitants of the town survived by following the mayor's order. One day, Taki and Mitsuha see each other when their trains draw parallel, and are compelled to disembark and search for one another, finally meeting on a staircase. They initially walk past each other, before Taki uneasily asks Mitsuha if he had met her before, and she replies that she felt the same way: their connection reestablishing, they shed tears of happiness, and simultaneously ask for each other's names.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n!

Customs such as child marriage and dowry were becoming entrenched; and a young women\u2019s purpose in life was to provide sons for the male lineage into which she married. To quote the Arthash\u0101stra: \u2018wives are there for having sons\u2019. Practices such as female infanticide and the neglect of young girls were possibly also developing at this time, especially among higher caste people. Further, due to the increasingly hierarchical nature of the society, marriage was possibly becoming an even more crucial institution for childbearing and the formalization of relationships between groups. In turn, this may have contributed to the growth of increasingly instrumental attitudes towards women and girls (who moved home at marriage). It is important to note that, in all likelihood, these developments did not affect people living in large parts of the subcontinent\u2014such as those in the south, and tribal communities inhabiting the forested hill and plateau areas of central and eastern India. That said, these deleterious features have continued to blight Indo-Aryan speaking areas of the subcontinent until the present day.<ref name=\"Dyson2018-20\"/>\"}}<ref name=\"Dyson2018-20\">{{citation|last=Dyson|first=Tim|title=A Population History of India: From the First Modern People to the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TRtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA20|year=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-882905-8|pages=20}}</ref>{{efn|\"Darkness can be said to have pervaded one aspect of society during the inter-imperial centuries: the degradation of women. ...

The Laws of Manu, compiled from about 200 to 400 C.E., came to be the most prominent evidence that this era was not necessarily a golden age for women. Through a combination of legal injunctions and moral prescriptions, women were firmly tied to the patriarchal family, ... Thus the Laws of Manu severely reduced the property rights of women, recommended a significant difference in ages between husband and wife and the relatively early marriage of women, and banned widow remarriage. Manu's preoccupation with chastity reflected possibly a growing concern for the maintenance of inheritance rights in the male line, a fear of women undermining the increasingly rigid caste divisions, and a growing emphasis on male asceticism as a higher spiritual calling.\"<ref name=\"RamusackSievers1999\"/>}}<ref name=\"RamusackSievers1999\">{{citation|last=Ramusack|first=Barbara N.|editor=Barbara N.

Women typically marry in or near their natal village. Marriage to kin is preferred. Female seclusion (pardah) is rare and rates of female participation in higher education and wage labour are normal. Women commonly work in public in fields, in shops, and in offices. Unmarried women often walk the streets and use public transport alone or with friends, both male and female. By contrast, in regions ruled by great warrior clans \u2013 in the heartlands of Mughal power across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and east across Bangladesh \u2013 extensive marriage networks are typical and the regional rank of families is critical. Marriage is normally forbidden within villages and to close kin. Families prefer women to marry at some distance from the natal village, and more so in high-status families. Pardah is widely practised, and as a result, women\u2019s participation in education and wage labour is low. A woman\u2019s place is definitely at home, where her virtue is the family honour.

[[Peary Charan Sarkar]], a former student of Hindu College, Calcutta and a member of \"Young Bengal\", set up the first free school for girls in India in 1847 in Barasat, a suburb of Calcutta (later the school was named Kalikrishna Girls' High School). While this might suggest that there was no positive British contribution during the Raj era, that is not entirely the case. Missionaries' wives such as Martha Mault n\u00e9e Mead and her daughter Eliza Caldwell n\u00e9e Mault are rightly remembered for pioneering the education and training of girls in south India. This practice was initially met with local resistance, as it flew in the face of tradition. Raja Rammohan Roy's efforts led to the abolition of Sati under [[Governor-General]] [[Lord William Bentinck|William Cavendish-Bentinck]] in 1829.

Customs such as child marriage and dowry were becoming entrenched; and a young women\u2019s purpose in life was to provide sons for the male lineage into which she married. To quote the Arthash\u0101stra: \u2018wives are there for having sons\u2019. Practices such as female infanticide and the neglect of young girls were possibly also developing at this time, especially among higher caste people. Further, due to the increasingly hierarchical nature of the society, marriage was possibly becoming an even more crucial institution for childbearing and the formalization of relationships between groups. In turn, this may have contributed to the growth of increasingly instrumental attitudes towards women and girls (who moved home at marriage). It is important to note that, in all likelihood, these developments did not affect people living in large parts of the subcontinent\u2014such as those in the south, and tribal communities inhabiting the forested hill and plateau areas of central and eastern India.

The Laws of Manu, compiled from about 200 to 400 C.E., came to be the most prominent evidence that this era was not necessarily a golden age for women. Through a combination of legal injunctions and moral prescriptions, women were firmly tied to the patriarchal family, ... Thus the Laws of Manu severely reduced the property rights of women, recommended a significant difference in ages between husband and wife and the relatively early marriage of women, and banned widow remarriage. Manu's preoccupation with chastity reflected possibly a growing concern for the maintenance of inheritance rights in the male line, a fear of women undermining the increasingly rigid caste divisions, and a growing emphasis on male asceticism as a higher spiritual calling.\"<ref name=\"RamusackSievers1999\"/>}}<ref name=\"RamusackSievers1999\">{{citation|last=Ramusack|first=Barbara N.|editor=Barbara N.

Women typically marry in or near their natal village. Marriage to kin is preferred. Female seclusion (pardah) is rare and rates of female participation in higher education and wage labour are normal. Women commonly work in public in fields, in shops, and in offices. Unmarried women often walk the streets and use public transport alone or with friends, both male and female. By contrast, in regions ruled by great warrior clans \u2013 in the heartlands of Mughal power across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and east across Bangladesh \u2013 extensive marriage networks are typical and the regional rank of families is critical. Marriage is normally forbidden within villages and to close kin. Families prefer women to marry at some distance from the natal village, and more so in high-status families. Pardah is widely practised, and as a result, women\u2019s participation in education and wage labour is low. A woman\u2019s place is definitely at home, where her virtue is the family honour.

[[Peary Charan Sarkar]], a former student of Hindu College, Calcutta and a member of \"Young Bengal\", set up the first free school for girls in India in 1847 in Barasat, a suburb of Calcutta (later the school was named Kalikrishna Girls' High School). While this might suggest that there was no positive British contribution during the Raj era, that is not entirely the case. Missionaries' wives such as Martha Mault n\u00e9e Mead and her daughter Eliza Caldwell n\u00e9e Mault are rightly remembered for pioneering the education and training of girls in south India. This practice was initially met with local resistance, as it flew in the face of tradition. Raja Rammohan Roy's efforts led to the abolition of Sati under [[Governor-General]] [[Lord William Bentinck|William Cavendish-Bentinck]] in 1829. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's crusade for improvement in the situation of widows led to the [[Widow Remarriage Act]] of 1856.

New features have been added to some trim levels throughout the Passat lineup and an all new diesel engine with 10 more horsepower than its predecessor is now offered. Diesel models also see a slight uptick in EPA estimated fuel economy with the manual transmission TDI models scoring up to 44MPG highway. For 2015, the SE with Sun and Nav package adds curve-illuminating foglights that had been previously available only on the SEL trim level. Later in 2015, Volkswagen has announced new trim level packages that will be released that bundle more features into the Passat for less money.\n\n*2016: For 2016, the Passat receives a mid-cycle restyling, with revised front and rear end styling, a more upscale interior design, fewer trim levels, and the latest-generation [[Volkswagen]] Composition and Discover infotainment systems (most were also with [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]]). Due to the [[Volkswagen emissions scandal]], [[Turbocharged direct injection|TDI]] models were permanently discontinued after the 2015 [[model year]]. \n\n*2018: For 2018, a new trim level for the Passat, the '''Passat GT''', is positioned below the top-of-the-line '''Passat V6 SEL Premium''', and includes [[Volkswagen GTI]]-inspired styling elements (specifically, a [[body kit]] and red-lined front grille, as well as black trim strips on the front and rear bumpers and side skirts), a two-tone '''Moonrock Gray''' and '''Titan Black''' [[VW]] V-Tex [[leatherette]]-trimmed interior, nineteen-inch (19\") \"Tornado\" aluminum-alloy wheels, and a black roof and side mirrors for most exterior color options. Exterior color options are '''Reflex Silver Metallic''', '''Platinum Gray Metallic''', '''Pure White''', and '''Deep Black Pearl'''.

The Passat NMS interior borrows design elements from the European Passat, e.g., the traditional clock.\n\n===Engines===\n\nIn Canada and the United States, the Passat NMS was initially released with a 2.5L 5-Cylinder engine, 2.0 TDI engine and 3.6L VR6 engine. The 2.5L 5-Cylinder engine was mated to either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. The 2.0TDI was offered with a 6-speed manual or optional DSG (automated dual clutch transmission). The 3.6L VR6 was only mated with an automatic transmission\n\nThe 2.0 TDI engine is not offered in Mexico or China.\n\nIn China, the NMS is offered with a base 1.4L TSI available with a 5-speed manual or 7-speed DSG. The 1.8L variant was available with the 6 speed automatic or 7 speed DSG gearbox and the 2.0L TSI and 3.0L VR6 come standard with 6- and 7-speed DSG gearboxes.\n\nFor the 2014 model year, a new 1.8L TSI four cylinder engine replaced the 2.5L inline-5 in North America.\n\nFor the 2015 model year, a new 2.0L EA288 TDI with increased power replaced the previous EA189 2.0L TDI in North America.\n\nFor the 2015 model year the 3.6L VR6 remained the same in North America.\n\nModels with the 3.6 VR6 engine were discontinued after the 2018 model year in the US.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 88%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=7| North America\n|-\n!

The second generation is still powered by a 174-horsepower, 2.0L TSI Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine and six-speed automatic transmission from the first generation, the new Passat is available in four distinct trim levels: base '''S''', midlevel '''SE''', sporty '''R-Line''', and range-topping '''SEL'''. Only the '''SEL''' offers full leather-trimmed seating surfaces (versus either cloth or \"V-Tex\" leatherette seating surfaces in all other trims), a [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] premium audio system with amplifier and subwoofer, and Park Distance Control (PDC). The '''R-Line''' sports a unique front fascia, as well as larger alloy wheels and tires. '''S''' and '''SE''' includes many modern technology features such as [[LED]] front headlamps, driver assistance technologies, and remote start ('''SE''' only). The 2020 Passat went on sale at [[Volkswagen]] dealerships nationwide in the fall of 2019. Due to the decreasing popularity of sedans in [[North America]], [[Volkswagen]] decided not to design the second generation Passat NMS on the [[Volkswagen Group MQB platform]] that underpins most new [[Audi]] and [[Volkswagen]] products. This means that the new Passat NMS does not offer some features such as a fully digital [[LCD]] instrument cluster or an eight-speed automatic transmission that are otherwise offered on other vehicles

For 2015, the SE with Sun and Nav package adds curve-illuminating foglights that had been previously available only on the SEL trim level. Later in 2015, Volkswagen has announced new trim level packages that will be released that bundle more features into the Passat for less money.\n\n*2016: For 2016, the Passat receives a mid-cycle restyling, with revised front and rear end styling, a more upscale interior design, fewer trim levels, and the latest-generation [[Volkswagen]] Composition and Discover infotainment systems (most were also with [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]]). Due to the [[Volkswagen emissions scandal]], [[Turbocharged direct injection|TDI]] models were permanently discontinued after the 2015 [[model year]]. \n\n*2018: For 2018, a new trim level for the Passat, the '''Passat GT''', is positioned below the top-of-the-line '''Passat V6 SEL Premium''', and includes [[Volkswagen GTI]]-inspired styling elements (specifically, a [[body kit]] and red-lined front grille, as well as black trim strips on the front and rear bumpers and side skirts), a two-tone '''Moonrock Gray''' and '''Titan Black''' [[VW]] V-Tex [[leatherette]]-trimmed interior, nineteen-inch (19\") \"Tornado\" aluminum-alloy wheels, and a black roof and side mirrors for most exterior color options. Exterior color options are '''Reflex Silver Metallic''', '''Platinum Gray Metallic''', '''Pure White''', and '''Deep Black Pearl'''. Base pricing for the 2018 Volkswagen Passat GT V6 begins at '''$29,145''' [[MSRP]], without options, excluding taxes and destination charges.<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 VW Passat Performance Midsize Sedan {{!}} Volkswagen |url=http://www.vw.com/models/passat/section/trims/ |website=www.vw.com}}</ref> The previous 170-horsepower, 1.8L Turbocharged TSI Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine for base Passat models has been replaced by a 174-horsepower, 2.0L Turbocharged TSI Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine, sourced from the second-generation [[Volkswagen Tiguan]]. The 280-horsepower, 3.6L [[VR6]] V6 gasoline engine remains an option for '''GT''' and '''SEL Premium''' trim levels.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n* 2019: For 2019, trim levels are reduced to base '''Wolfsburg Edition''' and  up-level '''SE R-Line'''. All V6-powered Passat models are discontinued.\n\n* 2020: For 2020, the Passat NMS receives a second generation (see below).\n{{clear}}\n\n==Design==\nVolkswagen released a sketch of the NMS in February 2009<ref name=PaulTan.org>{{cite web|title=First Sketch of the Volkswagen New Midsize Sedan|work=PaulTan.org|date=13 February 2009|url=http://paultan.org/archives/2009/02/13/first-sketch-of-the-volkswagen-new-midsize-sedan/|accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref> and a more detailed, second sketch on 28 October 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|title=PHOTO ADVISORY|work=Volkswagen of America, Inc.|date=28 October 2009|url=http://media.vw.com/index.php?s=43&item=519|accessdate=5 November 2009}}</ref> The Passat NMS reflects a design language developed by Walter de Silva, the Italian design chief for the Volkswagen Group, and Klaus Bischoff, the German design leader for the Volkswagen Brand. The Passat NMS interior borrows design elements from the European Passat, e.g., the traditional clock.\n\n\n\n===Engines===\n\nIn Canada and the United States, the Passat NMS was initially released with a 2.5L 5-Cylinder engine, 2.0 TDI engine and 3.6L VR6 engine. The 2.5L 5-Cylinder engine was mated to either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic. The 2.0TDI was offered with a 6-speed manual or optional DSG (automated dual clutch transmission). The 3.6L VR6 was only mated with an automatic transmission\n\nThe 2.0 TDI engine is not offered in Mexico or China.\n\nIn China, the NMS is offered with a base 1.4L TSI available with a 5-speed manual or 7-speed DSG. The 1.8L variant was available with the 6 speed automatic or 7 speed DSG gearbox and the 2.0L TSI and 3.0L VR6 come standard with 6- and 7-speed DSG gearboxes.\n\nFor the 2014 model year, a new 1.8L TSI four cylinder engine replaced the 2.5L inline-5 in North America.\n\nFor the 2015 model year, a new 2.0L EA288 TDI with increased power replaced the previous EA189 2.0L TDI in North America.\n\nFor the 2015 model year the 3.6L VR6 remained the same in North America.\n\nModels with the 3.6 VR6 engine were discontinued after the 2018 model year in the US.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 88%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=7| North America\n|-\n!

The second generation is still powered by a 174-horsepower, 2.0L TSI Turbocharged Inline Four-Cylinder (I4) gasoline engine and six-speed automatic transmission from the first generation, the new Passat is available in four distinct trim levels: base '''S''', midlevel '''SE''', sporty '''R-Line''', and range-topping '''SEL'''. Only the '''SEL''' offers full leather-trimmed seating surfaces (versus either cloth or \"V-Tex\" leatherette seating surfaces in all other trims), a [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] premium audio system with amplifier and subwoofer, and Park Distance Control (PDC). The '''R-Line''' sports a unique front fascia, as well as larger alloy wheels and tires. '''S''' and '''SE''' includes many modern technology features such as [[LED]] front headlamps, driver assistance technologies, and remote start ('''SE''' only). The 2020 Passat went on sale at [[Volkswagen]] dealerships nationwide in the fall of 2019. Due to the decreasing popularity of sedans in [[North America]], [[Volkswagen]] decided not to design the second generation Passat NMS on the [[Volkswagen Group MQB platform]] that underpins most new [[Audi]] and [[Volkswagen]] products. This means that the new Passat NMS does not offer some features such as a fully digital [[LCD]] instrument cluster or an eight-speed automatic transmission that are otherwise offered on other vehicles in the Volkswagen lineup.\n\nIts exclusive to North America  as China gets its own Passat and Passat was dropped from Korean market  entirely\n\n==Reception==\nThe Volkswagen Passat NMS won the 2012 [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]].\n\nIn a March 2012 comparison test by ''Car and Driver'', the Volkswagen Passat NMS came in first place out of six cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2013-chevrolet-malibu-eco-vs-2012-honda-accord-ex-l-2012-hyundai-sonata-se-2012-kia-optima-ex-2012-toyota-camry-se-2012-volkswagen-passat-25-se-comparison-tests |title=2013 Chevrolet Malibu Eco vs. 2012 Honda Accord EX-L, 2012 Hyundai Sonata SE, 2012 Kia Optima EX, 2012 Toyota Camry SE, 2012 Volkswagen Passat 2.5 SE }}</ref> In a November 2012 comparison by the same magazine with three since-redesigned competitors, the Passat placed last.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2013-ford-fusion-se-ecoboost-vs-2013-honda-accord-ex-2013-nissan-altima-25-sv-2012-volkswagen-passat-25-se-comparison-test|title=2013 Ford Fusion SE EcoBoost vs. 2013 Honda Accord EX, 2013 Nissan Altima 2.5 SV, 2012 Volkswagen Passat 2.5 SE|publisher=|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2012 comparison test by ''Motor Trend'', the Volkswagen Passat NMS came in first place out of six cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/1212_2012_2013_midsize_sedan_comparison/viewall.html?ti=v2 |title=Comparison: 2012\u20132013 Midsize Sedan, Battle of the Best-Sellers }}</ref>\n\n==Yearly American sales==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Sales\n|-\n|2011\n|22,779<ref name=\"2011 sales\">{{cite web |url=http://www.volkswagengroupamerica.com/newsroom/2012/01/04_vw_sales.htm |title=VOLKSWAGEN reports 26.3 percent inease in 2011 U.S. sales |publisher=[[Volkswagen Group of America]] |date=2012-01-04 |accessdate=2013-02-23}}</ref>\n|-\n|2012\n|117,023<ref name=\"2012 sales\">{{cite web |url=http://www.volkswagengroupamerica.com/newsroom/2013/01/03_VOLKSWAGEN_REPORTS_35_1_PERCENT_INCREASE_IN_2012.html |title=VOLKSWAGEN REPORTS 35.1 PERCENT INCREASE IN 2012 U.S. SALES |publisher=[[Volkswagen Group of America]] |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2013-02-23}}</ref>\n|-\n|2013\n|109,652<ref name=\"2013 sales\">{{cite web |url=http://www.volkswagengroupamerica.com/newsrelease.php?sitebase=media.vw.com&feedid=1542 |title=Volkswagen reports december 2013 and year-end results |publisher=[[Volkswagen Group of America]] |date=2014-01-03 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref>\n|-\n|2014\n|96,649<ref name=\"2014 sales\">{{cite web |url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/info_center/en/news/2015/01/VWUS.html |title=Volkswagen reports december 2014 sales and 2014 year-end results |publisher=[[Volkswagen Group of America]] |date=2015-01-05 |accessdate=2015-01-06}}</ref>\n|-\n|2015\n|78,207<ref name=\"2015 sales\">{{cite web |url=http://media.vw.com/release/1121/ |title=Volkswagen Reports December 2015 Sales and 2015 Year-End Results |publisher=[[Volkswagen Group of America]] |date=2016-01-05 |accessdate=2016-01-06}}</ref>\n|-\n|2016\n|73,002<ref name=\"2017 sales\">{{cite web |url=https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/966 |title=Volkswagen Reports December and 2017 Year-End Sales Results |publisher=[[Volkswagen Group of America]] |date=2018-01-03 |accessdate=2018-01-25}}</ref>\n|-\n|2017\n|60,722<ref name=\"2017 sales\" />\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Volkswagen Jetta#A6|Volkswagen New Compact Sedan]]\n* [[Volkswagen emissions scandal]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Volkswagen Passat NMS}}\n* [http://web.vw.com/all-new-passat-experience/ Volkswagen of America Passat page]\n* [http://www.vw.ca/en/models/passat_2012.html/ Volkswagen Canada Passat Page]\n* [http://www.vw.com.mx/es/models/nuevo-passat/galeria.html/  Volkswagen Mexico Passat Page]\n* [http://www.vw.com.cn/zh/models/newpassat.html/ Volkswagen China New Passat Page]\n* [http://brand.vw.com.cn/brandworld/#/reveal/?carName=passat/ Volkswagen China Passat Interactive Page]\n* [http://vw.csvw.com/zh/models/newpassat_v6.html/ Shanghai Volkswagen Passat Site]\n* [http://www.volkswagen.co.kr/ko/models/Passat/coming.html/ South Korean Volkswagen Passat Site]\n{{VW}}\n{{Volkswagen (North America) timeline 1980 to date}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[Category:Volkswagen vehicles|Passat NMS]]\n[[Category:2010s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 2011]]\n[[Category:Euro NCAP executive cars]]\n[[Category:Mid-size cars]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Cars powered by VR engines]]\n", "name_user": "MB", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix infobox image syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Passat_(NMS)"}
