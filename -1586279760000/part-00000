Historically, reforms have taken different forms because the motivations of reformers have differed. However, since the 1980s, education reform has been focused on changing the existing system from one focused on inputs to one focused on outputs (i.e., student achievement). In the United States, education reform acknowledges and encourages public education as the primary source of K-12 education for American youth. {{clarify span|Education reformers desire to make public education into a market (in the form of an input-output system), where accountability creates high-stakes from curriculum standards tied to standardized tests.<ref>http://parentreolution.org/who-we-are/{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfer.org/about/principles/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026044818/http://www.dfer.org/about/principles/ |archivedate=2014-10-26 }}</ref> As a result of this input-output system, equality has been conceptualized as an end point, which is often evidenced by an achievement gap among diverse populations.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.edtrust.org/issues/pre-k-12/closing-the-gaps |title = Closing Gaps Across the Achievement Spectrum}}</ref> This conceptualization of education reform is based on the market-logic of competition. As a consequence, competition creates inequality which has continued to drive the market-logic of equality at an end point by reproduce the achievement gap among diverse youth.|date=October 2018}} The one constant for all forms of education reform includes the idea that small changes in education will have large social returns in citizen health, wealth and well-being. For example, a stated motivation has been to reduce cost to students and society. From ancient times until the 1800s, one goal was to reduce the expense of a [[Liberal arts education|classical education]]. Ideally, classical education is undertaken with a highly educated full-time (extremely expensive) personal tutor. Historically, this was available only to the most wealthy. [[Encyclopedia]]s, [[Public Library|public libraries]] and [[grammar school]]s are examples of innovations intended to lower the cost of a classical education.\n\nRelated reforms attempted to develop similar classical results by concentrating on \"why\", and \"which\" questions neglected by classical education. Abstract, introspective answers to these questions can theoretically compress large numbers of facts into relatively few principles. This path was taken by some [[Transcendentalist]] educators, such as [[Amos Bronson Alcott]]. In the early modern age, [[grammar school#Victorian grammar schools|Victorian schools]] were reformed to teach commercially useful topics, such as modern languages and mathematics, rather than classical subjects, such as [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].\n\nMany reformers focused on reforming society by reforming education on more scientific, humanistic, pragmatic or democratic principles. [[John Dewey#On education|John Dewey]] and [[Anton Makarenko]] are prominent examples of such reformers. Some reformers incorporated several motivations, e.g. [[Maria Montessori]], who both \"educated for peace\" (a social goal), and to \"meet the needs of the child\" (A humanistic goal). In historic Prussia, an important motivation for the invention of [[Kindergarten]] was to foster national unity by teaching a national language while children were young enough that learning a language was easy. Proponents of [[evidence-based education]] call for the use of evidence in guiding education reform.\n\nReform has taken many forms and directions. Throughout history and the present day, the meaning and methods of education have changed through debates over what content or experiences result in an educated individual or an educated society. Changes may be implemented by individual educators and/or by broad-based school organization and/or by [[curriculum development|curriculum changes]] with performance evaluations.\n\n==History==\n\n===Classical times===\n\n[[Plato]] believed that children would never learn unless they wanted to learn. In ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', he said, \" ... compulsory learning never sticks in the mind.\" An educational debate in the time of the [[Roman Empire]] arose after Christianity had achieved broad acceptance. The question concerned the educational value of pre-Christian classical thought: \"Given that the body of knowledge of the pre-Christian Romans was heathen in origin, was it safe to teach it to Christian children?\" {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n===Modern reforms===\n\nThough educational reform occurred on a local level at various points throughout history, the modern notion of education reform is tied with the spread of [[compulsory education]].  Education reforms did not become widespread until after organized schooling was sufficiently systematized to be 'reformed.'\n\nIn the modern world, economic growth and the spread of democracy have raised the value of education and increased the importance of ensuring that all children and adults have access to high-quality, effective education. Modern education reforms are increasingly driven by a growing understanding of what works in education and how to go about successfully improving teaching and learning in schools.<ref>Whelan, Lessons Learned (2009)</ref>  However, in some cases, the reformers' goals of \"high-quality education\" has meant \"high-intensity education\", with a narrow emphasis on teaching individual, test-friendly subskills quickly, regardless of long-term outcomes, developmental appropriateness, or broader educational goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/02/01/the-trouble-with-calls-for-universal-high-quality-pre-k/|title=The trouble with calls for universal 'high-quality' pre-K|last=Kohn|first=Alfie|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-05-26}}</ref>\n\n===Reforms of classical education===\n\nWestern [[Classical education movement|classical education]] as taught from the 18th to the 19th century has missing features that inspired reformers. Classical education is most concerned with answering the who, what, where, and when? questions that concern a majority of students. Unless carefully taught, group instruction naturally neglects the theoretical \"why\" and \"which\" questions that strongly concern fewer students.\n\nClassical education in this period also did not teach local ([[vernacular]]) languages and cultures. Instead it taught high-status ancient languages (Greek and Latin) and their cultures. This produced odd social effects in which an intellectual class might be more loyal to ancient cultures and institutions than to their native vernacular languages and their actual governing authorities.\n\n===England in the 19th century===\nBefore there were government-funded public schools, education of the lower classes was by the [[charity school]], pioneered in the 19th century by [[Protestant]] organizations and adapted by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and governments. Because these schools operated on very small budgets and attempted to serve as many needy children as possible, they were designed to be inexpensive.\n\n\n\nThe basic program was to develop \"grammar\" schools. These taught only grammar and [[bookkeeping]]. This program permitted people to start businesses to make money, and gave them the skills to continue their education inexpensively from books. \"Grammar\" was the first third of the then-prevalent system of [[Classical education movement|classical education]].\n\n[[File:Joseph Lancaster by John Hazlitt.jpg|thumb|190px|Joseph Lancaster]]\nThe ultimate development of the grammar school was by [[Joseph Lancaster]] and [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] who developed the [[monitorial system]]. Lancaster started as a poor [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] in early 19th century London. Bell started the Madras School of India. The monitorial system uses slightly more-advanced students to teach less-advanced students, achieving student-teacher ratios as small as 2, while educating more than a thousand students per adult. Lancaster promoted his system in a piece called [http://www.constitution.org/lanc/improv-1803.htm Improvements in Education] that spread widely throughout the English-speaking world.\n\nDiscipline and labor in a Lancaster school were provided by an economic system. Scrip, a form of money meaningless outside the school, was created at a fixed exchange rate from a student's tuition. Every job of the school was bid-for by students in scrip, with the largest bid winning. However, ''any'' student tutor could auction positions in his or her classes. Besides tutoring, students could use scrip to buy food, school supplies, books, and childish luxuries in a school store. The adult supervisors were paid from the bids on jobs.\n\nWith fully developed internal economies, Lancaster schools provided a grammar-school education for a cost per student near $40 per year in 1999 U.S. dollars. The students were very clever at reducing their costs, and once invented, improvements were widely adopted in a school. For example, Lancaster students, motivated to save scrip, ultimately rented individual pages of textbooks from the school library, and read them in groups around music stands to reduce textbook costs. Students commonly exchanged tutoring, and paid for items and services with receipts from \"down tutoring.\"\n\nLancaster schools usually lacked sufficient adult supervision. As a result, the older children acting as disciplinary monitors tended to become brutal task masters. Also, the schools did not teach submission to orthodox Christian beliefs or government authorities. As a result, most English-speaking countries developed mandatory publicly paid education explicitly to keep public education in \"responsible\" hands. These elites said that Lancaster schools might become dishonest, provide poor education and were not accountable to established authorities.\n\nLancaster's supporters responded that any schoolchild could avoid cheats, given the opportunity, and that the government was not paying for the education, and thus deserved no say in their composition.\n\nLancaster, though motivated by charity, claimed in his pamphlets to be surprised to find that he lived well on the income of his school, even while the low costs made it available to the poorest street-children. Ironically, Lancaster lived on the charity of friends in his later life.<ref>[http://www.k12academics.com/education-reform/educational-economies-1800s Educational Economies in the 1800s \u2013 K12 Academics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019110524/http://www.k12academics.com/education-reform/educational-economies-1800s |date=2012-10-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Progressive reforms in Europe and the United States===\nThe term ''progressive'' in education has been used somewhat indiscriminately; there are a number of kinds of [[educational progressivism]], most of the historically significant kinds peaking in the period between the late 19th and the middle of the 20th centuries.\n\n====Child-study====\n[[Image:Rousseau.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]\n[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] has been called the father of the child-study movement. It has been said that Rousseau \"discovered\" the child (as an object of study).\n\nRousseau's principal work on education is ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'', in which he lays out an [[educational program]] for a hypothetical newborn's education to adulthood. Rousseau provided a dual critique of both the vision of education set forth in [[Plato's Republic]] and also of the society of his contemporary Europe and the educational methods he regarded as contributing to it; he held that a person can either be a man or a [[citizen]], and that while Plato's plan could have brought the latter at the expense of the former, contemporary education failed at both tasks. He advocated a radical withdrawal of the child from society and an educational process that utilized the natural potential of the child and its curiosity, teaching it by confronting it with simulated real-life obstacles and conditioning it by experience rather than teaching it intellectually. His ideas were rarely implemented directly, but were influential on later thinkers, particularly [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr\u00f6bel]], the inventor of the [[kindergarten]].\n\n====Horace Mann====\nIn the United States, [[Horace Mann]] (1796 \u2013 1859) of Massachusetts used his political base and role as Secretary of the [[Massachusetts State Board of Education]] to promote public education in his home state and nationwide.<ref>Jonathan Messerli, ''Horace Mann: A Biography'' (1972)</ref>  His crusading style attracted wide middle class support. Historian [[Ellwood P. Cubberley]] asserts:\n: No one did more than he to establish in the minds of the American people the conception that education should be universal, non-sectarian, free, and that its aims should be social efficiency, civic virtue, and character, rather than mere learning or the advancement of sectarian ends.<ref>Ellwood P. Cubberley, ''Public Education in the United States'' (1919)  p.  167</ref>\n\n====National identity====\nEducation is often seen in Europe and Asia as an important system to maintain national, cultural and linguistic unity. [[Prussia]] instituted primary school reforms expressly to teach a unified version of the national language, \"Hochdeutsch\". One significant reform was [[kindergarten]], whose purpose was to have the children spend time in supervised activities in the national language, when the children were young enough that they could easily learn new language skills.\n\nSince most modern schools copy the [[Prussia]]n models, children start school at an age when their language skills remain plastic, and they find it easy to learn the national language. This was an intentional design on the part of the Prussians.\n\nIn the U.S. over the last twenty years, more than 70% of non-English-speaking school-age immigrants have arrived in the U.S. before they were 6 years old. At this age, they could have been taught English in school, and achieved a proficiency indistinguishable from a [[native speaker]]. In other countries, such as the [[Soviet Union]], [[France]], [[Spain]], and [[Germany]] this approach has dramatically improved reading and math test scores for [[linguistic minorities]].\n\n====Dewey====\n[[File:Eva Watson Sch\u00fctze John Dewey.jpg|thumb|200px|John Dewey]]\n[[John Dewey]], a philosopher and educator based in Chicago and New York, helped conceptualize the role of American and international education during the first four decades of the 20th century. An important member of the American [[Pragmatism|Pragmatist]] movement, he carried the subordination of knowledge to action into the educational world by arguing for [[experiential education]] that would enable children to learn theory and practice simultaneously; a well-known example is the practice of teaching elementary physics and biology to students while preparing a meal. He was a harsh critic of \"dead\" knowledge disconnected from practical human life.<ref>Alan Ryan, ''John Dewey and the high tide of American liberalism'' (1997).</ref>\n\nDewey criticized the rigidity and volume of humanistic education, and the emotional idealizations of education based on the child-study movement that had been inspired by Rousseau and those who followed him. He presented his educational theories as a synthesis of the two views. His slogan was that schools should encourage children to \"Learn by doing.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} He wanted people to realize that children are naturally active and curious. Dewey's understanding of logic is best presented in his \"Logic, the Theory of Inquiry\" (1938). His educational theories were presented in \"My Pedagogic Creed\", ''The School and Society'', ''The Child and Curriculum'', and ''[[Democracy and Education]]'' (1916). [[Bertrand Russell]] criticized Dewey's conception of logic, saying \"What he calls \"logic\" does not seem to me to be part of logic at all; I should call it part of psychology.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand|title=Professor Dewey's \"Essays in Experimental Logic\"|journal=The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods|date=January 2, 1919|volume=16|issue=1|pages=5\u201326|jstor=2940531|doi=10.2307/2940531}}</ref>\n\nThe question of the history of Deweyan educational practice is a difficult one. He was a widely known and influential thinker, but his views and suggestions were often misunderstood by those who sought to apply them, leading some historians to suggest that there was never an actual implementation on any considerable scale of Deweyan [[progressive education]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The schools with which Dewey himself was most closely associated (though the most famous, the \"Laboratory School\", was really run by his wife) had considerable ups and downs, and Dewey left the [[University of Chicago]] in 1904 over issues relating to the Dewey School.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/projects/centcat/fac/facch08_01.html |title = John Dewey, Philosophy and Education}}</ref>\n\nDewey's influence began to decline in the time after the [[World War II|Second World War]] and particularly in the [[Cold War]] era, as more conservative educational policies came to the fore.\n\n====The administrative progressives====\n[[File:Horace Mann.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Horace Mann]], regarded as the father of American public education]]\nThe form of [[educational progressivism]] which was most successful in having its [[policies]] implemented has been dubbed \"administrative progressivism\" by historians. This began to be implemented in the early 20th century. While influenced particularly in its [[rhetoric]] by Dewey and even more by his popularizers, administrative progressivism was in its practice much more influenced by the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the concept [[economies of scale]].\n\nThe administrative progressives are responsible for many features of modern American education, especially American high schools: counseling programs, the move from many small local high schools to large centralized high schools, curricular differentiation in the form of electives and tracking, curricular, professional, and other forms of standardization, and an increase in state and federal regulation and bureaucracy, with a corresponding reduction of local control at the school board level. (Cf. \"State, federal, and local control of education in the United States\", below) (Tyack and Cuban, pp.&nbsp;17\u201326)\n\nThese reforms have since become heavily entrenched, and many today who identify themselves as progressives are opposed to many of them, while conservative education reform during the Cold War embraced them as a framework for strengthening traditional curriculum and standards.\n\nIn more recent times, groups such as the think tank [[Reform (think tank)|Reform]]'s education division, and [[S.E.R.]] have attempted to pressure the government of the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] into more [[modernism|modernist]] educational reform, though this has met with limited success.\n\n===Late-20th and early 21st century (United states)===\n{{Split section |Education reform in the United States |discuss={{TALKPAGENAME}}#Split proposed |date=July 2016}}\n{{see also|History of education in the United States}}\n\n==== Reforms arising from the civil rights era ====\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, many of the proposed and implemented reforms in U.S. education stemmed from the [[civil rights movement]] and related trends; examples include [[desegregation|ending racial segregation]], and [[Desegregation busing in the United States|busing for the purpose of desegregation]], [[affirmative action]], and banning of [[school prayer]].<ref>Tyack and Cuban, p. 29</ref>\n\n====1980s====\nIn the 1980s, some of the momentum of education reform moved from the left to the right, with the release of ''[[A Nation at Risk]]'', [[Ronald Reagan]]'s efforts to reduce or eliminate the [[United States Department of Education]]. <blockquote> \"[T]he federal government and virtually all state governments, teacher training institutions, teachers' unions, major foundations, and the mass media have all pushed strenuously for higher standards, greater accountability, more \"time on task,\" and more impressive academic results\".<ref name=\"Miller2002\">{{cite book|author=Ron Miller|title=Free Schools, Free People: Education and Democracy After the Nineteen Sixties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VFdO7nX5NOsC|accessdate=5 June 2013|year=2002|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8824-9|page=110}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis shift to the right caused many families to seek alternatives, including \"charter schools, progressive schools, Montessori schools, Waldorf schools, Afrocentric schools, religious schools - or teaching them at home and in their communities.\"<ref name=\"Miller2002\"/>\n\nIn the latter half of the decade, [[E.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Hirsch]] put forth an influential attack on one or more versions of progressive education, advocating an emphasis on \"cultural literacy\"\u2014the facts, phrases, and texts that Hirsch asserted every American had once known and that now only some knew, but was still essential for decoding basic texts and maintaining communication. Hirsch's ideas remain significant through the 1990s and into the 21st century, and are incorporated into classroom practice through textbooks and curricula published under his own imprint.\n\n====1990s and 2000s====\n{{see also|Standards-based education reform}}\n\nMost states and districts in the 1990s adopted [[outcome-based education|Outcome-Based Education]] (OBE) in some form or another. A state would create a committee to adopt standards, and choose a quantitative instrument to assess whether the students knew the required content or could perform the required tasks. The standards-based National Education Goals ([[Goals 2000]]) were set by the U.S. Congress in the 1990s. Many of these goals were based on the principles of [[outcomes-based education]], and not all of the goals were attained by the year 2000 as was intended. The standards-based reform movement culminated in the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001, which {{as of|2016|lc=y}} is still an active nationwide mandate in the United States.\n\nOBE reforms usually had other disputed methods, such as [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] mathematics and [[whole language]], added onto them.{{Dubious|date=October 2009}} Some proponents{{Who|date=October 2009}} advocated replacing the traditional high school diploma with a [[Certificate of Initial Mastery]]. Other reform movements were [[school-to-work transition|school-to-work]], which would require all students except those in a university track to spend substantial class time on a job site.

Public [[School voucher|education vouchers]] permit guardians to select and pay any school, public or private, with public funds currently allocated to local public schools. The theory is that children's guardians will naturally shop for the best schools, much as is already done at college level.\n\nThough appealing in theory, many reforms based on school choice have led to slight to moderate improvements\u2014which some teachers' union members see as insufficient to offset the decreased teacher pay and job security.<ref>Whelan, Lessons Learned: How good policies produce better schools (2009)</ref> For instance, [[New Zealand]]'s landmark reform in 1989, during which schools were granted substantial autonomy, funding was devolved to schools, and parents were given a free choice of which school their children would attend, led to moderate improvements in most schools.  It was argued that the associated increases in inequity and greater racial stratification in schools nullified the educational gains. Others, however, argued that the original system created more inequity (due to lower income students being required to attend poorer performing inner city schools and not being allowed school choice or better educations that are available to higher income inhabitants of suburbs). Instead, it was argued that the school choice promoted social mobility and increased test scores especially in the cases of low income students. Similar results have been found in other jurisdictions. Though discouraging, the merely slight improvements of some school choice policies often seems to reflect weaknesses in the way that choice is implemented rather than a failure of the basic principle itself.<ref>Whelan, Lessons Learned: How good policies produce better schools (2009).

Current education trends in the United States represent multiple achievement gaps across ethnicities, income levels, and geographies.  As McKinsey and Company reported in a 2009 analysis, \u201cThese educational gaps impose on the United States the economic equivalent of a permanent national recession.\u201d<ref>McKinsey and Company, \u201cThe Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap on America\u2019s Schools.\u201d April 2009.</ref> Reforms are usually proposed by thinkers who aim to redress societal ills or institute societal changes, most often through a change in the education of the members of a class of people\u2014the preparation of a ruling class to rule or a working class to work, the social hygiene of a lower or immigrant class, the preparation of citizens in a democracy or republic, etc. The idea that all children should be provided with a high level of education is a relatively recent idea, and has arisen largely in the context of Western [[democracy]] in the 20th century.\n\nThe \"beliefs\" of school districts are optimistic that quite literally \"all students will succeed\", which in the context of [[high school graduation examination in the United States]], all students in all groups, regardless of heritage or income will pass tests that in the introduction typically fall beyond the ability of all but the top 20 to 30 percent of students. The claims clearly renounce historical research that shows that all ethnic and income groups score differently on all [[standardized test]]s and [[standards based assessment]]s and that students will achieve on a [[Normal distribution|bell curve]]. Instead, education officials across the world believe that by setting clear, achievable, higher standards, aligning the curriculum, and assessing outcomes, learning can be increased for all students, and more students can succeed than the 50 percent who are defined to be above or below grade level by norm referenced standards.\n\n[[Sovereign state|States]] have tried to use [[state school]]s to increase state power, especially to make better [[soldier]]s and workers. This strategy was first adopted to unify related linguistic groups in [[Europe]], including [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. Exact mechanisms are unclear, but it often fails in areas where populations are culturally segregated, as when the U.S. Indian school service failed to suppress [[Lakota language|Lakota]] and [[Navajo people|Navaho]], or when a culture has widely respected autonomous cultural institutions, as when the [[Spain|Spanish]] failed to suppress [[Catalonia|Catalan]].\n\nMany students of [[democracy]] have desired to improve education in order to improve the quality of governance in democratic societies; the necessity of good public education follows logically if one believes that the quality of democratic governance depends on the ability of citizens to make informed, intelligent choices, and that education can improve these abilities.\n\nPolitically motivated educational reforms of the democratic type are recorded as far back as [[Plato]] in ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]''. In the United States, this lineage of democratic education reform was continued by [[Thomas Jefferson]], who advocated ambitious reforms partly along Platonic lines for [[public education|public schooling]] in [[Virginia]].\n\nAnother motivation for reform is the desire to address socio-economic problems, which many people see as having significant roots in lack of education. Starting in the 20th century, people have attempted to argue that small improvements in education can have large returns in such areas as health, wealth and well-being. For example, in [[Kerala]], India in the 1950s, increases in women's health were correlated with increases in female literacy rates. In [[Iran]], increased primary education was correlated with increased farming efficiencies and income. In both cases some researchers have concluded these correlations as representing an underlying causal relationship: education causes socio-economic benefits. In the case of Iran, researchers concluded that the improvements were due to farmers gaining reliable access to national crop prices and scientific farming information.\n\n==Strategies==\nReforms can be based on bringing education into alignment with a society's core values.<ref name=\"School1970\">{{cite book|author=Sudbury Valley School|title=The crisis in American education: an analysis and a proposal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MAqxzEss8k4C|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=1 January 1970|publisher=The Sudbury Valley School|isbn=978-1-888947-05-2|chapter=The American Dream}}</ref><ref name=\"Gutmann1999\">{{cite book|author=Amy Gutmann|title=Democratic Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZf7R6k4WHAC|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=29 March 1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2291-1}}</ref> Reforms that attempt to change a society's core values can connect alternative education initiatives with a network of other alternative institutions.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paula Polk Lillard|title=Montessori Today: A Comprehensive Approach to Education from Birth to Adulthood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHo6zlV1j8MC|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=7 September 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-76132-3|page=22}}, quoted in {{cite book|author=Mitchell Stevens|title=Kingdom of Children: Culture and Controversy in the Homeschooling Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOOH21vRQRgC|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=9 February 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2480-9|page=183}}</ref>\n\n===Evidence-based education===\nProponents of the [[evidence-based education]] movement call for the use of evidence in guiding education reform. Evidence-based education is the use of well designed scientific studies to determine which [[education]] methods work best. Evidence-based learning techniques such as [[spaced repetition]] have been shown to increase the rate at which students learn. The evidence-based education movement has its roots in the larger movement towards [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based-practices]].\n\n==Digital education==\n{{Main|Electronic learning}}\nThe movement to use computers more in education naturally includes many unrelated ideas, methods, and pedagogies since there are many uses for digital computers. For example, the fact that computers are naturally good at math leads to the question of the use of calculators in math education. The Internet's communication capabilities make it potentially useful for collaboration, and foreign language learning. The computer's ability to simulate physical systems makes it potentially useful in teaching science. More often, however, debate of digital education reform centers around more general applications of computers to education, such as electronic test-taking and online classes.\n\nThe idea of creating [[artificial intelligence]] led some computer scientists to believe that teachers could be replaced by computers, through something like an [[expert system]]; however, attempts to accomplish this have predictably proved inflexible. The computer is now more understood to be a tool or assistant for the teacher and students.\n\nHarnessing the richness of the Internet is another goal. In some cases classrooms have been moved entirely online, while in other instances the goal is more to learn how the Internet can be more than a classroom.\n\nWeb-based international educational software is under development by students at New York University, based on the belief that current educational institutions are too rigid: effective teaching is not routine, students are not passive, and questions of practice are not predictable or standardized. The software allows for courses tailored to an individual's abilities through frequent and automatic [[multiple intelligences]] assessments. Ultimate goals include assisting students to be intrinsically motivated to educate themselves, and aiding the student in self-actualization. Courses typically taught only in college are being reformatted so that they can be taught to any level of student, whereby elementary school students may learn the foundations of any topic they desire. Such a program has the potential to remove the bureaucratic inefficiencies of education in modern countries, and with the decreasing digital divide, help developing nations rapidly achieve a similar quality of education. With an open format similar to Wikipedia, any teacher may upload their courses online and a feedback system will help students choose relevant courses of the highest quality. Teachers can provide links in their digital courses to webcast videos of their lectures. Students will have personal academic profiles and a forum will allow students to pose complex questions, while simpler questions will be automatically answered by the software, which will bring you to a solution by searching through the knowledge database, which includes all available courses and topics.\n\nThe 21st century ushered in the acceptance and encouragement of internet research conducted on college and university campuses, in homes, and even in gathering areas of shopping centers. Addition of cyber cafes on campuses and coffee shops, loaning of communication devices from libraries, and availability of more portable technology devices, opened up a world of educational resources.  Availability of knowledge to the elite had always been obvious, yet provision of networking devices, even wireless gadget sign-outs from libraries, made availability of information an expectation of most persons. [[Cassandra B. Whyte]] researched the future of computer use on higher education campuses focusing on student affairs. Though at first seen as a data collection and outcome reporting tool, the use of computer technology in the classrooms, meeting areas, and homes continued to unfold.  The sole dependence on paper resources for subject information diminished and e-books and articles, as well as on-line courses, were anticipated to become increasingly staple and affordable choices provided by higher education institutions according to Whyte in a 2002 presentation.<ref>Whyte, Cassandra Bolyard.

[[Will Richardson]], author and visionary for the digital education realm, points to the not-so-distant future and the seemingly infinite possibilities for digital communication linked to improved education.  Education on the whole, as a stand-alone entity, has been slow to embrace these changes. The use of web tools such as wikis, blogs, and social networking sites is tied to increasing overall effectiveness of digital education in schools.  Examples exist of teacher and student success stories where learning has transcended the classroom and has reached far out into society.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Richardson, Will. 2010. Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms 3rd ed.,155, Corwin Press</ref>\n\nCreativity is of the utmost importance when improving education.  The \"creative teachers\" must have the confidence through training and availability of support and resources.  These creative teachers are strongly encouraged to embrace a person-centered approach that develops the psychology of the educator ahead or in conjunction with the deployment of machines.<ref>Song, H.-D., Wang, W.-T., & Liu, C.-Y.

Media is in direct competition with formal educational institutions in shaping the minds of today and those of tomorrow. [Buchanan, Rachel footnote] The media has been instrumental in pushing formal educational institutions to become savvier in their methods.  Additionally, advertising has been (and continues to be) a vital force in shaping students and parents thought patterns.<ref>Buchanan, Rachel.\"Paradox, Promise and Public Pedagogy: Implications of the Federal Government\u2019s Digital Education Revolution\". Vol. 36, Issue 2, Article 6, P. 73, March 2011.</ref>\n\nTechnology is a dynamic entity that is constantly in flux.  As time presses on, new technologies will continue to break paradigms that will reshape human thinking regarding technological innovation.  This concept stresses a certain disconnect between teachers and learners and the growing chasm that started some time ago.  Richardson asserts that traditional classroom's will essentially enter entropy unless teachers increase their comfort and proficiency with technology.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nAdministrators are not exempt from the technological disconnect.  They must recognize the existence of a younger generation of teachers who were born during the Digital Age and are very comfortable with technology.  However, when old meets new, especially in a mentoring situation, conflict seems inevitable.  Ironically, the answer to the outdated mentor may be digital collaboration with worldwide mentor webs; composed of individuals with creative ideas for the classroom.<ref>Gibson, S. (2009).

In 2009, over 3 million K-12 students took an online course, compared to 2000 when 45,000 took an online course. Blended learning examples include pure online, blended, and traditional education.  Research results show that the most effective learning takes place in a blended format.<ref>Horn, M., Stacker, H. \"The Rise of K-12 Blended Learning\" Innosight Institute. January 2011.

Historically, reforms have taken different forms because the motivations of reformers have differed. However, since the 1980s, education reform has been focused on changing the existing system from one focused on inputs to one focused on outputs (i.e., student achievement). In the United States, education reform acknowledges and encourages public education as the primary source of K-12 education for American youth. {{clarify span|Education reformers desire to make public education into a market (in the form of an input-output system), where accountability creates high-stakes from curriculum standards tied to standardized tests.<ref>http://parentreolution.org/who-we-are/{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfer.org/about/principles/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026044818/http://www.dfer.org/about/principles/ |archivedate=2014-10-26 }}</ref> As a result of this input-output system, equality has been conceptualized as an end point, which is often evidenced by an achievement gap among diverse populations.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.edtrust.org/issues/pre-k-12/closing-the-gaps |title = Closing Gaps Across the Achievement Spectrum}}</ref> This conceptualization of education reform is based on the market-logic of competition. As a consequence, competition creates inequality which has continued to drive the market-logic of equality at an end point by reproduce the achievement gap among diverse youth.|date=October 2018}} The one constant for all forms of education reform includes the idea that small changes in education will have large social returns in citizen health, wealth and well-being. For example, a stated motivation has been to reduce cost to students and society. From ancient times until the 1800s, one goal was to reduce the expense of a [[Liberal arts education|classical education]]. Ideally, classical education is undertaken with a highly educated full-time (extremely expensive) personal tutor. Historically, this was available only to the most wealthy. [[Encyclopedia]]s, [[Public Library|public libraries]] and [[grammar school]]s are examples of innovations intended to lower the cost of a classical education.\n\nRelated reforms attempted to develop similar classical results by concentrating on \"why\", and \"which\" questions neglected by classical education. Abstract, introspective answers to these questions can theoretically compress large numbers of facts into relatively few principles. This path was taken by some [[Transcendentalist]] educators, such as [[Amos Bronson Alcott]]. In the early modern age, [[grammar school#Victorian grammar schools|Victorian schools]] were reformed to teach commercially useful topics, such as modern languages and mathematics, rather than classical subjects, such as [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].\n\nMany reformers focused on reforming society by reforming education on more scientific, humanistic, pragmatic or democratic principles. [[John Dewey#On education|John Dewey]] and [[Anton Makarenko]] are prominent examples of such reformers. Some reformers incorporated several motivations, e.g. [[Maria Montessori]], who both \"educated for peace\" (a social goal), and to \"meet the needs of the child\" (A humanistic goal). In historic Prussia, an important motivation for the invention of [[Kindergarten]] was to foster national unity by teaching a national language while children were young enough that learning a language was easy. Proponents of [[evidence-based education]] call for the use of evidence in guiding education reform.\n\nReform has taken many forms and directions. Throughout history and the present day, the meaning and methods of education have changed through debates over what content or experiences result in an educated individual or an educated society. Changes may be implemented by individual educators and/or by broad-based school organization and/or by [[curriculum development|curriculum changes]] with performance evaluations.\n\n==History==\n\n===Classical times===\n\n[[Plato]] believed that children would never learn unless they wanted to learn. In ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', he said, \" ... compulsory learning never sticks in the mind.\" An educational debate in the time of the [[Roman Empire]] arose after Christianity had achieved broad acceptance. The question concerned the educational value of pre-Christian classical thought: \"Given that the body of knowledge of the pre-Christian Romans was heathen in origin, was it safe to teach it to Christian children?\" {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n===Modern reforms===\n\nThough educational reform occurred on a local level at various points throughout history, the modern notion of education reform is tied with the spread of [[compulsory education]].  Education reforms did not become widespread until after organized schooling was sufficiently systematized to be 'reformed.'\n\nIn the modern world, economic growth and the spread of democracy have raised the value of education and increased the importance of ensuring that all children and adults have access to high-quality, effective education. Modern education reforms are increasingly driven by a growing understanding of what works in education and how to go about successfully improving teaching and learning in schools.<ref>Whelan, Lessons Learned (2009)</ref>  However, in some cases, the reformers' goals of \"high-quality education\" has meant \"high-intensity education\", with a narrow emphasis on teaching individual, test-friendly subskills quickly, regardless of long-term outcomes, developmental appropriateness, or broader educational goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/02/01/the-trouble-with-calls-for-universal-high-quality-pre-k/|title=The trouble with calls for universal 'high-quality' pre-K|last=Kohn|first=Alfie|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-05-26}}</ref>\n\n===Reforms of classical education===\n\nWestern [[Classical education movement|classical education]] as taught from the 18th to the 19th century has missing features that inspired reformers. Classical education is most concerned with answering the who, what, where, and when? questions that concern a majority of students. Unless carefully taught, group instruction naturally neglects the theoretical \"why\" and \"which\" questions that strongly concern fewer students.\n\nClassical education in this period also did not teach local ([[vernacular]]) languages and cultures. Instead it taught high-status ancient languages (Greek and Latin) and their cultures. This produced odd social effects in which an intellectual class might be more loyal to ancient cultures and institutions than to their native vernacular languages and their actual governing authorities.\n\n===England in the 19th century===\nBefore there were government-funded public schools, education of the lower classes was by the [[charity school]], pioneered in the 19th century by [[Protestant]] organizations and adapted by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and governments. Because these schools operated on very small budgets and attempted to serve as many needy children as possible, they were designed to be inexpensive.\n\n\n\nThe basic program was to develop \"grammar\" schools. These taught only grammar and [[bookkeeping]]. This program permitted people to start businesses to make money, and gave them the skills to continue their education inexpensively from books. \"Grammar\" was the first third of the then-prevalent system of [[Classical education movement|classical education]].\n\n[[File:Joseph Lancaster by John Hazlitt.jpg|thumb|190px|Joseph Lancaster]]\nThe ultimate development of the grammar school was by [[Joseph Lancaster]] and [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] who developed the [[monitorial system]]. Lancaster started as a poor [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] in early 19th century London. Bell started the Madras School of India. The monitorial system uses slightly more-advanced students to teach less-advanced students, achieving student-teacher ratios as small as 2, while educating more than a thousand students per adult. Lancaster promoted his system in a piece called [http://www.constitution.org/lanc/improv-1803.htm Improvements in Education] that spread widely throughout the English-speaking world.\n\nDiscipline and labor in a Lancaster school were provided by an economic system. Scrip, a form of money meaningless outside the school, was created at a fixed exchange rate from a student's tuition. Every job of the school was bid-for by students in scrip, with the largest bid winning. However, ''any'' student tutor could auction positions in his or her classes. Besides tutoring, students could use scrip to buy food, school supplies, books, and childish luxuries in a school store. The adult supervisors were paid from the bids on jobs.\n\nWith fully developed internal economies, Lancaster schools provided a grammar-school education for a cost per student near $40 per year in 1999 U.S. dollars. The students were very clever at reducing their costs, and once invented, improvements were widely adopted in a school. For example, Lancaster students, motivated to save scrip, ultimately rented individual pages of textbooks from the school library, and read them in groups around music stands to reduce textbook costs. Students commonly exchanged tutoring, and paid for items and services with receipts from \"down tutoring.\"\n\nLancaster schools usually lacked sufficient adult supervision. As a result, the older children acting as disciplinary monitors tended to become brutal task masters. Also, the schools did not teach submission to orthodox Christian beliefs or government authorities. As a result, most English-speaking countries developed mandatory publicly paid education explicitly to keep public education in \"responsible\" hands. These elites said that Lancaster schools might become dishonest, provide poor education and were not accountable to established authorities.\n\nLancaster's supporters responded that any schoolchild could avoid cheats, given the opportunity, and that the government was not paying for the education, and thus deserved no say in their composition.\n\nLancaster, though motivated by charity, claimed in his pamphlets to be surprised to find that he lived well on the income of his school, even while the low costs made it available to the poorest street-children. Ironically, Lancaster lived on the charity of friends in his later life.<ref>[http://www.k12academics.com/education-reform/educational-economies-1800s Educational Economies in the 1800s \u2013 K12 Academics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019110524/http://www.k12academics.com/education-reform/educational-economies-1800s |date=2012-10-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Progressive reforms in Europe and the United States===\nThe term ''progressive'' in education has been used somewhat indiscriminately; there are a number of kinds of [[educational progressivism]], most of the historically significant kinds peaking in the period between the late 19th and the middle of the 20th centuries.\n\n====Child-study====\n[[Image:Rousseau.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]\n[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] has been called the father of the child-study movement. It has been said that Rousseau \"discovered\" the child (as an object of study).\n\nRousseau's principal work on education is ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'', in which he lays out an [[educational program]] for a hypothetical newborn's education to adulthood. Rousseau provided a dual critique of both the vision of education set forth in [[Plato's Republic]] and also of the society of his contemporary Europe and the educational methods he regarded as contributing to it; he held that a person can either be a man or a [[citizen]], and that while Plato's plan could have brought the latter at the expense of the former, contemporary education failed at both tasks. He advocated a radical withdrawal of the child from society and an educational process that utilized the natural potential of the child and its curiosity, teaching it by confronting it with simulated real-life obstacles and conditioning it by experience rather than teaching it intellectually. His ideas were rarely implemented directly, but were influential on later thinkers, particularly [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr\u00f6bel]], the inventor of the [[kindergarten]].\n\n====Horace Mann====\nIn the United States, [[Horace Mann]] (1796 \u2013 1859) of Massachusetts used his political base and role as Secretary of the [[Massachusetts State Board of Education]] to promote public education in his home state and nationwide.<ref>Jonathan Messerli, ''Horace Mann: A Biography'' (1972)</ref>  His crusading style attracted wide middle class support. Historian [[Ellwood P. Cubberley]] asserts:\n: No one did more than he to establish in the minds of the American people the conception that education should be universal, non-sectarian, free, and that its aims should be social efficiency, civic virtue, and character, rather than mere learning or the advancement of sectarian ends.<ref>Ellwood P. Cubberley, ''Public Education in the United States'' (1919)  p.  167</ref>\n\n====National identity====\nEducation is often seen in Europe and Asia as an important system to maintain national, cultural and linguistic unity. [[Prussia]] instituted primary school reforms expressly to teach a unified version of the national language, \"Hochdeutsch\". One significant reform was [[kindergarten]], whose purpose was to have the children spend time in supervised activities in the national language, when the children were young enough that they could easily learn new language skills.\n\nSince most modern schools copy the [[Prussia]]n models, children start school at an age when their language skills remain plastic, and they find it easy to learn the national language. This was an intentional design on the part of the Prussians.\n\nIn the U.S. over the last twenty years, more than 70% of non-English-speaking school-age immigrants have arrived in the U.S. before they were 6 years old. At this age, they could have been taught English in school, and achieved a proficiency indistinguishable from a [[native speaker]]. In other countries, such as the [[Soviet Union]], [[France]], [[Spain]], and [[Germany]] this approach has dramatically improved reading and math test scores for [[linguistic minorities]].\n\n====Dewey====\n[[File:Eva Watson Sch\u00fctze John Dewey.jpg|thumb|200px|John Dewey]]\n[[John Dewey]], a philosopher and educator based in Chicago and New York, helped conceptualize the role of American and international education during the first four decades of the 20th century. An important member of the American [[Pragmatism|Pragmatist]] movement, he carried the subordination of knowledge to action into the educational world by arguing for [[experiential education]] that would enable children to learn theory and practice simultaneously; a well-known example is the practice of teaching elementary physics and biology to students while preparing a meal. He was a harsh critic of \"dead\" knowledge disconnected from practical human life.<ref>Alan Ryan, ''John Dewey and the high tide of American liberalism'' (1997).</ref>\n\nDewey criticized the rigidity and volume of humanistic education, and the emotional idealizations of education based on the child-study movement that had been inspired by Rousseau and those who followed him. He presented his educational theories as a synthesis of the two views. His slogan was that schools should encourage children to \"Learn by doing.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} He wanted people to realize that children are naturally active and curious. Dewey's understanding of logic is best presented in his \"Logic, the Theory of Inquiry\" (1938). His educational theories were presented in \"My Pedagogic Creed\", ''The School and Society'', ''The Child and Curriculum'', and ''[[Democracy and Education]]'' (1916). [[Bertrand Russell]] criticized Dewey's conception of logic, saying \"What he calls \"logic\" does not seem to me to be part of logic at all; I should call it part of psychology.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand|title=Professor Dewey's \"Essays in Experimental Logic\"|journal=The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods|date=January 2, 1919|volume=16|issue=1|pages=5\u201326|jstor=2940531|doi=10.2307/2940531}}</ref>\n\nThe question of the history of Deweyan educational practice is a difficult one. He was a widely known and influential thinker, but his views and suggestions were often misunderstood by those who sought to apply them, leading some historians to suggest that there was never an actual implementation on any considerable scale of Deweyan [[progressive education]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The schools with which Dewey himself was most closely associated (though the most famous, the \"Laboratory School\", was really run by his wife) had considerable ups and downs, and Dewey left the [[University of Chicago]] in 1904 over issues relating to the Dewey School.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/projects/centcat/fac/facch08_01.html |title = John Dewey, Philosophy and Education}}</ref>\n\nDewey's influence began to decline in the time after the [[World War II|Second World War]] and particularly in the [[Cold War]] era, as more conservative educational policies came to the fore.\n\n====The administrative progressives====\n[[File:Horace Mann.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Horace Mann]], regarded as the father of American public education]]\nThe form of [[educational progressivism]] which was most successful in having its [[policies]] implemented has been dubbed \"administrative progressivism\" by historians. This began to be implemented in the early 20th century. While influenced particularly in its [[rhetoric]] by Dewey and even more by his popularizers, administrative progressivism was in its practice much more influenced by the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the concept [[economies of scale]].\n\nThe administrative progressives are responsible for many features of modern American education, especially American high schools: counseling programs, the move from many small local high schools to large centralized high schools, curricular differentiation in the form of electives and tracking, curricular, professional, and other forms of standardization, and an increase in state and federal regulation and bureaucracy, with a corresponding reduction of local control at the school board level. (Cf. \"State, federal, and local control of education in the United States\", below) (Tyack and Cuban, pp.&nbsp;17\u201326)\n\nThese reforms have since become heavily entrenched, and many today who identify themselves as progressives are opposed to many of them, while conservative education reform during the Cold War embraced them as a framework for strengthening traditional curriculum and standards.\n\nIn more recent times, groups such as the think tank [[Reform (think tank)|Reform]]'s education division, and [[S.E.R.]] have attempted to pressure the government of the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] into more [[modernism|modernist]] educational reform, though this has met with limited success.\n\n===Late-20th and early 21st century (United states)===\n{{Split section |Education reform in the United States |discuss={{TALKPAGENAME}}#Split proposed |date=July 2016}}\n{{see also|History of education in the United States}}\n\n==== Reforms arising from the civil rights era ====\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, many of the proposed and implemented reforms in U.S. education stemmed from the [[civil rights movement]] and related trends; examples include [[desegregation|ending racial segregation]], and [[Desegregation busing in the United States|busing for the purpose of desegregation]], [[affirmative action]], and banning of [[school prayer]].<ref>Tyack and Cuban, p. 29</ref>\n\n====1980s====\nIn the 1980s, some of the momentum of education reform moved from the left to the right, with the release of ''[[A Nation at Risk]]'', [[Ronald Reagan]]'s efforts to reduce or eliminate the [[United States Department of Education]]. <blockquote> \"[T]he federal government and virtually all state governments, teacher training institutions, teachers' unions, major foundations, and the mass media have all pushed strenuously for higher standards, greater accountability, more \"time on task,\" and more impressive academic results\".<ref name=\"Miller2002\">{{cite book|author=Ron Miller|title=Free Schools, Free People: Education and Democracy After the Nineteen Sixties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VFdO7nX5NOsC|accessdate=5 June 2013|year=2002|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8824-9|page=110}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis shift to the right caused many families to seek alternatives, including \"charter schools, progressive schools, Montessori schools, Waldorf schools, Afrocentric schools, religious schools - or teaching them at home and in their communities.\"<ref name=\"Miller2002\"/>\n\nIn the latter half of the decade, [[E.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Hirsch]] put forth an influential attack on one or more versions of progressive education, advocating an emphasis on \"cultural literacy\"\u2014the facts, phrases, and texts that Hirsch asserted every American had once known and that now only some knew, but was still essential for decoding basic texts and maintaining communication. Hirsch's ideas remain significant through the 1990s and into the 21st century, and are incorporated into classroom practice through textbooks and curricula published under his own imprint.\n\n====1990s and 2000s====\n{{see also|Standards-based education reform}}\n\nMost states and districts in the 1990s adopted [[outcome-based education|Outcome-Based Education]] (OBE) in some form or another. A state would create a committee to adopt standards, and choose a quantitative instrument to assess whether the students knew the required content or could perform the required tasks. The standards-based National Education Goals ([[Goals 2000]]) were set by the U.S. Congress in the 1990s. Many of these goals were based on the principles of [[outcomes-based education]], and not all of the goals were attained by the year 2000 as was intended. The standards-based reform movement culminated in the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001, which {{as of|2016|lc=y}} is still an active nationwide mandate in the United States.\n\nOBE reforms usually had other disputed methods, such as [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] mathematics and [[whole language]], added onto them.{{Dubious|date=October 2009}} Some proponents{{Who|date=October 2009}} advocated replacing the traditional high school diploma with a [[Certificate of Initial Mastery]]. Other reform movements were [[school-to-work transition|school-to-work]], which would require all students except those in a university track to spend substantial class time on a job site.

This is the third highest level of funding per student out of the 100 biggest school districts in the United States.

Public [[School voucher|education vouchers]] permit guardians to select and pay any school, public or private, with public funds currently allocated to local public schools. The theory is that children's guardians will naturally shop for the best schools, much as is already done at college level.\n\nThough appealing in theory, many reforms based on school choice have led to slight to moderate improvements\u2014which some teachers' union members see as insufficient to offset the decreased teacher pay and job security.<ref>Whelan, Lessons Learned: How good policies produce better schools (2009)</ref> For instance, [[New Zealand]]'s landmark reform in 1989, during which schools were granted substantial autonomy, funding was devolved to schools, and parents were given a free choice of which school their children would attend, led to moderate improvements in most schools.  It was argued that the associated increases in inequity and greater racial stratification in schools nullified the educational gains. Others, however, argued that the original system created more inequity (due to lower income students being required to attend poorer performing inner city schools and not being allowed school choice or better educations that are available to higher income inhabitants of suburbs). Instead, it was argued that the school choice promoted social mobility and increased test scores especially in the cases of low income students. Similar results have been found in other jurisdictions. Though discouraging, the merely slight improvements of some school choice policies often seems to reflect weaknesses in the way that choice is implemented rather than a failure of the basic principle itself.<ref>Whelan, Lessons Learned: How good policies produce better schools (2009).

Current education trends in the United States represent multiple achievement gaps across ethnicities, income levels, and geographies.  As McKinsey and Company reported in a 2009 analysis, \u201cThese educational gaps impose on the United States the economic equivalent of a permanent national recession.\u201d<ref>McKinsey and Company, \u201cThe Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap on America\u2019s Schools.\u201d April 2009.</ref> Reforms are usually proposed by thinkers who aim to redress societal ills or institute societal changes, most often through a change in the education of the members of a class of people\u2014the preparation of a ruling class to rule or a working class to work, the social hygiene of a lower or immigrant class, the preparation of citizens in a democracy or republic, etc. The idea that all children should be provided with a high level of education is a relatively recent idea, and has arisen largely in the context of Western [[democracy]] in the 20th century.\n\nThe \"beliefs\" of school districts are optimistic that quite literally \"all students will succeed\", which in the context of [[high school graduation examination in the United States]], all students in all groups, regardless of heritage or income will pass tests that in the introduction typically fall beyond the ability of all but the top 20 to 30 percent of students. The claims clearly renounce historical research that shows that all ethnic and income groups score differently on all [[standardized test]]s and [[standards based assessment]]s and that students will achieve on a [[Normal distribution|bell curve]]. Instead, education officials across the world believe that by setting clear, achievable, higher standards, aligning the curriculum, and assessing outcomes, learning can be increased for all students, and more students can succeed than the 50 percent who are defined to be above or below grade level by norm referenced standards.\n\n[[Sovereign state|States]] have tried to use [[state school]]s to increase state power, especially to make better [[soldier]]s and workers. This strategy was first adopted to unify related linguistic groups in [[Europe]], including [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. Exact mechanisms are unclear, but it often fails in areas where populations are culturally segregated, as when the U.S. Indian school service failed to suppress [[Lakota language|Lakota]] and [[Navajo people|Navaho]], or when a culture has widely respected autonomous cultural institutions, as when the [[Spain|Spanish]] failed to suppress [[Catalonia|Catalan]].\n\nMany students of [[democracy]] have desired to improve education in order to improve the quality of governance in democratic societies; the necessity of good public education follows logically if one believes that the quality of democratic governance depends on the ability of citizens to make informed, intelligent choices, and that education can improve these abilities.\n\nPolitically motivated educational reforms of the democratic type are recorded as far back as [[Plato]] in ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]''. In the United States, this lineage of democratic education reform was continued by [[Thomas Jefferson]], who advocated ambitious reforms partly along Platonic lines for [[public education|public schooling]] in [[Virginia]].\n\nAnother motivation for reform is the desire to address socio-economic problems, which many people see as having significant roots in lack of education. Starting in the 20th century, people have attempted to argue that small improvements in education can have large returns in such areas as health, wealth and well-being. For example, in [[Kerala]], India in the 1950s, increases in women's health were correlated with increases in female literacy rates. In [[Iran]], increased primary education was correlated with increased farming efficiencies and income. In both cases some researchers have concluded these correlations as representing an underlying causal relationship: education causes socio-economic benefits. In the case of Iran, researchers concluded that the improvements were due to farmers gaining reliable access to national crop prices and scientific farming information.\n\n==Strategies==\nReforms can be based on bringing education into alignment with a society's core values.<ref name=\"School1970\">{{cite book|author=Sudbury Valley School|title=The crisis in American education: an analysis and a proposal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MAqxzEss8k4C|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=1 January 1970|publisher=The Sudbury Valley School|isbn=978-1-888947-05-2|chapter=The American Dream}}</ref><ref name=\"Gutmann1999\">{{cite book|author=Amy Gutmann|title=Democratic Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZf7R6k4WHAC|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=29 March 1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2291-1}}</ref> Reforms that attempt to change a society's core values can connect alternative education initiatives with a network of other alternative institutions.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paula Polk Lillard|title=Montessori Today: A Comprehensive Approach to Education from Birth to Adulthood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHo6zlV1j8MC|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=7 September 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-76132-3|page=22}}, quoted in {{cite book|author=Mitchell Stevens|title=Kingdom of Children: Culture and Controversy in the Homeschooling Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOOH21vRQRgC|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=9 February 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2480-9|page=183}}</ref>\n\n===Evidence-based education===\nProponents of the [[evidence-based education]] movement call for the use of evidence in guiding education reform. Evidence-based education is the use of well designed scientific studies to determine which [[education]] methods work best. Evidence-based learning techniques such as [[spaced repetition]] have been shown to increase the rate at which students learn. The evidence-based education movement has its roots in the larger movement towards [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based-practices]].\n\n==Digital education==\n{{Main|Electronic learning}}\nThe movement to use computers more in education naturally includes many unrelated ideas, methods, and pedagogies since there are many uses for digital computers. For example, the fact that computers are naturally good at math leads to the question of the use of calculators in math education. The Internet's communication capabilities make it potentially useful for collaboration, and foreign language learning. The computer's ability to simulate physical systems makes it potentially useful in teaching science. More often, however, debate of digital education reform centers around more general applications of computers to education, such as electronic test-taking and online classes.\n\nThe idea of creating [[artificial intelligence]] led some computer scientists to believe that teachers could be replaced by computers, through something like an [[expert system]]; however, attempts to accomplish this have predictably proved inflexible. The computer is now more understood to be a tool or assistant for the teacher and students.\n\nHarnessing the richness of the Internet is another goal. In some cases classrooms have been moved entirely online, while in other instances the goal is more to learn how the Internet can be more than a classroom.\n\nWeb-based international educational software is under development by students at New York University, based on the belief that current educational institutions are too rigid: effective teaching is not routine, students are not passive, and questions of practice are not predictable or standardized. The software allows for courses tailored to an individual's abilities through frequent and automatic [[multiple intelligences]] assessments. Ultimate goals include assisting students to be intrinsically motivated to educate themselves, and aiding the student in self-actualization. Courses typically taught only in college are being reformatted so that they can be taught to any level of student, whereby elementary school students may learn the foundations of any topic they desire. Such a program has the potential to remove the bureaucratic inefficiencies of education in modern countries, and with the decreasing digital divide, help developing nations rapidly achieve a similar quality of education. With an open format similar to Wikipedia, any teacher may upload their courses online and a feedback system will help students choose relevant courses of the highest quality. Teachers can provide links in their digital courses to webcast videos of their lectures. Students will have personal academic profiles and a forum will allow students to pose complex questions, while simpler questions will be automatically answered by the software, which will bring you to a solution by searching through the knowledge database, which includes all available courses and topics.\n\nThe 21st century ushered in the acceptance and encouragement of internet research conducted on college and university campuses, in homes, and even in gathering areas of shopping centers. Addition of cyber cafes on campuses and coffee shops, loaning of communication devices from libraries, and availability of more portable technology devices, opened up a world of educational resources.  Availability of knowledge to the elite had always been obvious, yet provision of networking devices, even wireless gadget sign-outs from libraries, made availability of information an expectation of most persons. [[Cassandra B. Whyte]] researched the future of computer use on higher education campuses focusing on student affairs. Though at first seen as a data collection and outcome reporting tool, the use of computer technology in the classrooms, meeting areas, and homes continued to unfold.  The sole dependence on paper resources for subject information diminished and e-books and articles, as well as on-line courses, were anticipated to become increasingly staple and affordable choices provided by higher education institutions according to Whyte in a 2002 presentation.<ref>Whyte, Cassandra Bolyard.

(1). 86-89.</ref><ref>Whyte, Cassandra Bolyard (2002) Presentation at a Round Table Forum on Higher Education Topics.Oxford, England.</ref>\n\n[[Flip teaching|Digitally \"flipping\" classrooms]] is a trend in digital education that has gained significant momentum. [[Will Richardson]], author and visionary for the digital education realm, points to the not-so-distant future and the seemingly infinite possibilities for digital communication linked to improved education.  Education on the whole, as a stand-alone entity, has been slow to embrace these changes. The use of web tools such as wikis, blogs, and social networking sites is tied to increasing overall effectiveness of digital education in schools.  Examples exist of teacher and student success stories where learning has transcended the classroom and has reached far out into society.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Richardson, Will. 2010.

As time presses on, new technologies will continue to break paradigms that will reshape human thinking regarding technological innovation.  This concept stresses a certain disconnect between teachers and learners and the growing chasm that started some time ago.  Richardson asserts that traditional classroom's will essentially enter entropy unless teachers increase their comfort and proficiency with technology.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nAdministrators are not exempt from the technological disconnect.  They must recognize the existence of a younger generation of teachers who were born during the Digital Age and are very comfortable with technology.  However, when old meets new, especially in a mentoring situation, conflict seems inevitable.  Ironically, the answer to the outdated mentor may be digital collaboration with worldwide mentor webs; composed of individuals with creative ideas for the classroom.<ref>Gibson, S. (2009). Are our pre-service teachers prepared to teach in a digital age? In T. Bastiaens et al.(Eds.), Proceedings of World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education 200(pp. 2609-2617).</ref>\n\nAnother viable addition to digital education has been blended learning.  In 2009, over 3 million K-12 students took an online course, compared to 2000 when 45,000 took an online course. Blended learning examples include pure online, blended, and traditional education.  Research results show that the most effective learning takes place in a blended format.<ref>Horn, M., Stacker, H. \"The Rise of K-12 Blended Learning\" Innosight Institute. January 2011. Retrieved from www.innosightinstitute.org</ref> This allows children to view the lecture ahead of time and then spend class time practicing, refining, and applying what they have previously learned.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal | Education | Politics }}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Anti-schooling activism]]\n* [[Blab school]]\n* [[Block scheduling]]\n* [[Certificate of Initial Mastery]]\n* [[Criterion-referenced test]]\n* [[Educational philosophies]]\n* [[Female education]]\n* [[High school graduation examination]]\n* [[Higher-order thinking]]\n* [[Inquiry-based Science]]\n* [[Learning environment]]\n* [[Learning space]]\n* [[Merit pay]]\n* [[Multiculturalism]]\n* [[Political correctness]]\n* [[Project-based learning]]\n* [[Special Assistance Program]]\n* [[Student-centered learning]]\n* [[Sudbury model of education|Sudbury model democratic schools]]\n* [[Sudbury Valley School]]\n* [[Teaching for social justice]]\n* [[University reform]]\n* [[Web literacy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Education Transforms Lives\n| author = UNESCO\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 6, 8-9\n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002472/247234e.pdf\n| license statement URL = http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=247234&set=00590077D4_0_95&gp=1&lin=1&ll=1\n| license = CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0\n| Editors = \n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=July 2016}}\n* Comer, J.P.

Saanvi compares scans of her brain to those of an institutionalized patient and seeks him out. He turns out to be Thomas. When Michaela's partner is unavailable due to a \"busted pipe,\" Jared reluctantly follows Michaela's instincts and they interrupt the [[BATF|ATF]]'s undercover operation. Jared takes responsibility for his decision and is suspended. Grace learns the life insurance company intends to recollect the $500K which they paid her after Ben's disappearance and presumed death. Ben meets Grace's ex-boyfriend Danny after Olive was detained for attempting to shoplift a lipstick from a cosmetic store. Thomas escaped from the institution and the NSA is searching for him.

The fifth bus contained eleven passengers who were foreign nationals, had no next of kin, or were otherwise individuals no one would report as missing. The buses were contracted by Unified Dynamic Systems (UDS), a large corporation involved in many industries. After getting some information from a translator, Michaela locates a farm where UDS is experimenting on the eleven passengers, but she and Jared are chased away by armed men. Ben confronts Vance about the missing passengers, believing the NSA is behind their disappearance and threatens to tell the press. Although Vance has dossiers on the eleven passengers showing they are accounted for, he leads a team to investigate the farm location. UDS has moved locations, but Vance finds a bloody bandage that was left behind by accident.

Logan believes it will save his life too, and he gives it to Michaela for safekeeping while he is incarcerated. Having learned about the death date, TJ is upset and Olive takes him to the Church of the Returned for hope. Following the incident at the bank, Jared meets Tamara for a date. Meanwhile, the Major realizes she's been exposed and has Saanvi's research stolen from her lab and home.

Meanwhile, Grace's car is forced off the road by other Xers. In both instances, police dismiss the seriousness of the events because the victims are passengers and the attacks appear random. While being treated at the hospital, Ben and Grace learn their baby is a girl and assume the calling was about her. Ben and TJ review events and realize the Xer attacks have been carefully planned to divert police manpower. Olive tells Michaela what she saw and identifies a suspect, who directs the police to a meeting place for Xers.
