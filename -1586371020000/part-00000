During the March 7, 2018, tapings of ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'' ([[Broadcast delay|aired]] March 28), NXT General Manager [[William Regal]] announced a [[ladder match]] for [[NXT TakeOver: New Orleans|TakeOver: New Orleans]] to determine the inaugural NXT North American Champion.

During the war years, Webber moved to the office of [[Vincent Harris]], a prolific designer of public buildings, and from whom he drew much inspiration.

The plans never went ahead, but it brought him much attention from his peers. His first major municipal design was the [[Southampton Civic Centre|Guildhall Civic Centre]] in Southampton, which was built over a ten-year period.  Other civic centres followed, including the Civic Centres at [[Civic Centre, Dagenham|Dagenham]] (1936\u201337), and [[Hammersmith Town Hall|Hammersmith]] (1939\u201340).

Other gameplay modifiers (or often called mods) add additional gameplay features or change the difficulty by raising it (Double Time/Nightcore, Hidden, Flashlight, Hard Rock, Sudden Death/Perfect), or lowering it (Easy, Half Time, No Fail, Spun Out). Inspiration for this mode was taken from ''[[Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan]]'' and ''[[Elite Beat Agents]]''.\n\n=== osu!taiko ===\nosu!taiko is a game mode which consists of clicking notes to the beat on a drum-like interface, inspired by the ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin]]'' series.\n\n=== osu!catch ===\nosu!catch, formerly known as osu!ctb (catch the beat), is a game mode which consists of catching fruit to the beat by controlling a mini-character holding a plate.\n\n=== osu!mania ===\nosu!mania is a game mode which consists of a piano-like style of clicking notes to the beat, similar to the ''[[Beatmania IIDX]]'' series. The number of keys ranges from 1 to 9, with 4 keys and 7 keys being more popular among players.\n\n=== Beatmaps ===\n''Osu!'' has five different beatmap categories:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Beatmaps|title=Beatmaps|website=osu.ppy.sh|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref>\n\n*\"Ranked & Approved\" \u2013 community-made beatmaps that are approved to be playable by Beatmap Nominators, or BNs.

Ranked maps always feature a global top 50 leaderboard.\n\n*\"Qualified\" \u2013 beatmaps which are on their way to becoming ranked. Beatmaps will remain in \"Qualified\" for 1 week, after which they will be ranked. Beatmaps in \"Qualified\" will be disqualified and have the beatmap status reset to \"Pending\" if any issues that do not pertain to ''osu!'s'' ranking criteria are found. They do not award performance points.\n\n*\"Loved\" \u2013 beatmaps that have received a significant reception from the community and were approved to be playable. They only feature a beatmap leaderboard. This leaderboard can be reset by the beatmap author. Loved beatmaps do not award performance points.\n\n*\"Pending\" and \"WIP\" \u2013 beatmaps which are either not fully done or waiting to be ranked. They do not have a leaderboard and do not award performance points.\n\n*\"Graveyard\" \u2013 beatmaps which have not received an update in over 28 days. Just like pending beatmaps, they do not have a leaderboard and do not award performance points.\n\n== Subscription Service (osu!supporter) ==\n\nThe game offers a subscription-based service, osu!supporter, that allows players to download beatmaps directly from inside the game through a service called osu!direct, a heart icon beside the username on the official ''Osu!'' website, additional pending beatmap slots, faster download speeds, access to multiplayer on cutting edge build, friend and country-specific leaderboards, one free [[User (computing)|username]] change, more customization in-game, a yellow name in the in-game chat, and more customization on one's user page (the \"me\" tab).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://osu.ppy.sh/home/support|title=Support the game|website=osu.ppy.sh|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref> osu!supporter does not affect ranking at all and all funds are directed to maintaining ''osu!''.\n\n== osu!lazer ==\n''osu!lazer''<ref>{{Citation|title=GitHub - ppy/osu: rhythm is just a *click* away!|date=2019-09-06|url=https://github.com/ppy/osu|publisher=ppy|access-date=2019-09-06}}</ref> is an upcoming [[Free and open-source software|free and open-source]] remake of the original game client that features a graphics framework built from the ground up with rhythm games in mind.

Beatmaps will remain in \"Qualified\" for 1 week, after which they will be ranked. Beatmaps in \"Qualified\" will be disqualified and have the beatmap status reset to \"Pending\" if any issues that do not pertain to ''osu!'s'' ranking criteria are found. They do not award performance points.\n\n*\"Loved\" \u2013 beatmaps that have received a significant reception from the community and were approved to be playable. They only feature a beatmap leaderboard. This leaderboard can be reset by the beatmap author. Loved beatmaps do not award performance points.\n\n*\"Pending\" and \"WIP\" \u2013 beatmaps which are either not fully done or waiting to be ranked. They do not have a leaderboard and do not award performance points.\n\n*\"Graveyard\" \u2013 beatmaps which have not received an update in over 28 days.

The biggest unofficial event held in the community is \"''cavoe's osu! event\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cavoeboy.com/|title=COE2020|last=cavoeboy|website=cavoeboy.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref> (usually referred to as \"osu! event\" or \"COE\"), held at The [[Brabanthallen]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brabanthallen.nl/evenement/cavoes-osu-event-2020/|title=cavoe's osu! event 2020|website=Brabanthallen|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref> in [['s Hertogenbosch]], [[The Netherlands]]. The event has been arranged three times since 2017 yearly.\n\n== Mobile clients ==\n\n=== iOS ===\n''osu!stream'' is an adaptation of ''Osu!'' for [[iOS]] devices running iOS 6 and later, also developed by Dean Herbert. The main difference between O''su!'' and ''osu!stream'' is that ''osu!stream'' beatmaps are not user-created and are instead made by the developers of ''osu!stream''. The version also includes some new gameplay elements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/osu!stream|title=osu!stream|website=osu.ppy.sh|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>  On 26 February 2020, Herbert announced that he released the source code and plans to halt development of the game, releasing one final update that made all the levels free to download.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.ppy.sh/osu-stream-2020-release/|title=osu!stream 2020 release|last=blog|first=ppy|website=blog.ppy.sh|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible to play the beta of osu!lazer on iOS via [[TestFlight]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://osu.ppy.sh/home/testflight|title=testflight|website=osu.ppy.sh|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Android ===\n''osu!droid'' is a fan client of O''su!'' for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. The official ''osu!droid'' was released through the Play Store, though many players complained of problems. Since then, an unofficial release, titled ''osu!evolution'', has been used as a substitute for ''osu!droid''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ops.dgsrz.com/|title=osu!Evolution - Rhythm is just a Tap away!|website=ops.dgsrz.com|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref>\n\n''opsu!'' is a client available on Android devices and contains a port to be played on a PC, but is no longer being serviced as of 2019. However, the servers for this service are still online, so this game is still available to play. Its main feature was an osu!direct-like system for downloading beatmaps from within the game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://itdelatrisu.github.io/opsu/|title=opsu!|website=itdelatrisu.github.io|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible to play the beta of osu!lazer on Android devices using an [[APK (file format)|APK]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://osu.ppy.sh}}\n* [https://www.github.com/ppy/osu osu!lazer GitHub page ]\n* {{Twitch|ppy|Dean Herbert}}\n* [http://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/osu!stream osu!stream]\n\n[[Category:2007 video games]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Music video games]]\n[[Category:Open-source video games]]\n[[Category:Creative Commons-licensed video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Australia]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows Phone games]]\n[[Category:Software using the MIT license]]\n", "name_user": "Notparker", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!"}

Other members of the group at this time were Fred de Wilde, Klaasje van der Wal (1 February 1949 \u2013 12 February 2018)<ref name= haagmedia/> and Cor van der Beek. The group had a minor hit in 1968 with \"Lucy Brown is Back in Town\". De Wilde left in 1968 after joining the Dutch army and van Leeuwen was introduced to [[Mariska Veres]], singing at that time with a club band. He persuaded her to take over the vocals and the group charted a worldwide hit with the song \"[[Venus (Shocking Blue song)|Venus]]\", which peaked at No. 3 in the Netherlands in autumn 1969. The song was released in America and Great Britain at the end of the year and reached No. 1 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in February 1970. It subsequently sold 350,000 copies in Germany and topped the U.S. chart for three weeks, the first song from the Netherlands to do so. It sold over one million copies there by January 1970 and received a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] awarded by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Global sales exceeded five million copies.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\" />\n\nOther hits include \"[[Send Me a Postcard]]\" in 1968/69 and \"Long and Lonesome Road\" (often mistakenly named as \"Long Lonesome Road\") in 1969.<ref name=\"ag\">{{cite web|title=Shocking Blue|publisher=Alex Gitlin|url=http://www.alexgitlin.com/shocking.htm|accessdate=2010-07-21}}</ref>\n\n\"Venus\" was followed by \"Mighty Joe\" (flip-side \"Wild Wind\") in 1969 and \"Never Marry a Railroad Man\" (flip-side \"Roll Engine Roll\") in 1970, both of which sold over a million records. The latter became a top-ten hit in several countries around the world.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\" /><ref name=\"Billboard Shocking Blue\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9AgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=never+marry+with+a+railroad+man+billboard#v=onepage&q=never%20marry%20with%20a%20railroad%20man%20billboard&f=false|date=1971-01-09|title=Hits of The World|first=|last=|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref> Later songs \u2013 including \"Hello Darkness\", \"Demon Lover\" (1970), \"Shocking You\", \"Blossom Lady\" and \"Out of Sight, Out of Mind\" (1971), \"Inkpot\", \"Rock in the Sea\" and \"Eve and the Apple\" (1972) and \"Oh Lord\" (1973) were successful in Europe, Latin America and Asia, but failed to chart in the U.S or U.K.\n\nKlaasje van der Wal left towards the end of 1971, following their first trip to Japan (which spawned a live album). In 1974 Robbie Van Leeuwen quit and, later that year, Mariska Veres left, leading to the band's split. Veres enjoyed a [[solo (music)|solo]] career until 1982. Her singles \"Take Me High\" (1975) and \"Lovin' You\" (1976) were popular mainly in the Netherlands, [[Belgium]] and Germany. She also released the singles \"Tell It Like It Is\" (1975), a [[cover version]] of Dusty Springfield's \"Little By Little\" (1976), and \"Too Young\" (1978).\n\nShocking Blue reformed with its most famous line-up in 1979 and recorded \"Louise\" as their first single since their break-up in 1974. The song was never released, for reasons unknown. They did, however, perform live in 1980 with earlier songs such as \"Venus\" and \"Never Marry a Railroad Man\". They attempted another comeback in 1984 and recorded \"The Jury and the Judge\" with \"I Am Hanging on to Love\" as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] in 1986. That same year, they recorded another unreleased song, \"Time Is a Jetplane\".\n\nDrummer Cor van der Beek died on 2 April 1998, at the age of 49, in Rotterdam, Netherlands.

The band had a number of [[psychedelic rock]] hits throughout the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture movements era during the 1960s and early 1970s]], including \"[[Send Me a Postcard]]\", \"[[Love Buzz]]\", and \"[[Venus (Shocking Blue song)|Venus]],\" the last of which became their biggest hit, and reached No. 1 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and many other countries during 1969 and 1970.\n\nThe band had sold 13.5 million records by 1973 but disbanded in 1974.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/267 267 and 285]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/267\n}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nShocking Blue was founded in 1967 by [[Robbie van Leeuwen]]. Other members of the group at this time were Fred de Wilde, Klaasje van der Wal (1 February 1949 \u2013 12 February 2018)<ref name= haagmedia/> and Cor van der Beek. The group had a minor hit in 1968 with \"Lucy Brown is Back in Town\". De Wilde left in 1968 after joining the Dutch army and van Leeuwen was introduced to [[Mariska Veres]], singing at that time with a club band. He persuaded her to take over the vocals and the group charted a worldwide hit with the song \"[[Venus (Shocking Blue song)|Venus]]\", which peaked at No. 3 in the Netherlands in autumn 1969. The song was released in America and Great Britain at the end of the year and reached No. 1 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in February 1970. It subsequently sold 350,000 copies in Germany and topped the U.S. chart for three weeks, the first song from the Netherlands to do so. It sold over one million copies there by January 1970 and received a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] awarded by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Global sales exceeded five million copies.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\" />\n\nOther hits include \"[[Send Me a Postcard]]\" in 1968/69 and \"Long and Lonesome Road\" (often mistakenly named as \"Long Lonesome Road\") in 1969.<ref name=\"ag\">{{cite web|title=Shocking Blue|publisher=Alex Gitlin|url=http://www.alexgitlin.com/shocking.htm|accessdate=2010-07-21}}</ref>\n\n\"Venus\" was followed by \"Mighty Joe\" (flip-side \"Wild Wind\") in 1969 and \"Never Marry a Railroad Man\" (flip-side \"Roll Engine Roll\") in 1970, both of which sold over a million records. The latter became a top-ten hit in several countries around the world.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\" /><ref name=\"Billboard Shocking Blue\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9AgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=never+marry+with+a+railroad+man+billboard#v=onepage&q=never%20marry%20with%20a%20railroad%20man%20billboard&f=false|date=1971-01-09|title=Hits of The World|first=|last=|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref> Later songs \u2013 including \"Hello Darkness\", \"Demon Lover\" (1970), \"Shocking You\", \"Blossom Lady\" and \"Out of Sight, Out of Mind\" (1971), \"Inkpot\", \"Rock in the Sea\" and \"Eve and the Apple\" (1972) and \"Oh Lord\" (1973) were successful in Europe, Latin America and Asia, but failed to chart in the U.S or U.K.\n\nKlaasje van der Wal left towards the end of 1971, following their first trip to Japan (which spawned a live album). In 1974 Robbie Van Leeuwen quit and, later that year, Mariska Veres left, leading to the band's split. Veres enjoyed a [[solo (music)|solo]] career until 1982. Her singles \"Take Me High\" (1975) and \"Lovin' You\" (1976) were popular mainly in the Netherlands, [[Belgium]] and Germany. She also released the singles \"Tell It Like It Is\" (1975), a [[cover version]] of Dusty Springfield's \"Little By Little\" (1976), and \"Too Young\" (1978).\n\nShocking Blue reformed with its most famous line-up in 1979 and recorded \"Louise\" as their first single since their break-up in 1974. The song was never released, for reasons unknown. They did, however, perform live in 1980 with earlier songs such as \"Venus\" and \"Never Marry a Railroad Man\". They attempted another comeback in 1984 and recorded \"The Jury and the Judge\" with \"I Am Hanging on to Love\" as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] in 1986. That same year, they recorded another unreleased song, \"Time Is a Jetplane\".\n\nDrummer Cor van der Beek died on 2 April 1998, at the age of 49, in Rotterdam, Netherlands.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n=Squadron History=\n\n==1950s==\n\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\n===Roots===\n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach. The aircraft crashed at at 22 St. and E. Ocean Ave., Norfolk, killing four crew and injuring three civilians.<ref name=\"Anderson\">\"Four Missing In Air Crash\", ''The Anderson Independent'', 7 January 1958</ref> Two aircrew were injured and one was uninjured.\n# On 16 October 1958, returning to Incirlik, A3D-1Q (BUNO 130356)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\">{{Cite web|title = All A-3 Skywarriors Produced by Douglas|url =https://www.a3skywarrior.com/ready-room/a-3-dispositions/a-3-production.html|website = www.a3skywarrior.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> crashed near the airfield. All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />. All sixteen aircrew were killed.\n# On 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

The aircraft iced up, the engines flamed out, and it stalled into a spin. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed. Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]].

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n=Squadron History=\n\n==1950s==\n\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\n===Roots===\n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

The first of these, the {{convert|1928|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[First Transcontinental Railroad|\"Pacific Railroad\"]], was built by the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] and [[Union Pacific Railroad]] to link the San Francisco Bay at [[Alameda, California]], with the nation's existing eastern railroad network at [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]/[[Omaha, Nebraska]], thereby creating the world's first transcontinental railroad when it opened in 1869. Its construction was made possible by the US government under [[Pacific Railroad Acts|Pacific Railroad Acts of 1862, 1864, and 1867]].\n\n====Transcontinental railroad====\n{{main|First Transcontinental Railroad}}\n\nThe world's [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was built between 1863 and 1869 to join the eastern and western halves of the United States. Begun just before the [[American Civil War]], its construction was considered to be one of the greatest American technological feats of the 19th century. Known as the \"Pacific Railroad\" when it opened, this served as a vital link for trade, commerce, and travel and opened up vast regions of the south American heartland for settlement. Shipping and commerce could thrive away from navigable watercourses for the first time since the beginning of the nation. Much of this route, especially on the Sierra grade west of Reno, Nevada, is currently used by Amtrak's ''[[California Zephyr]]'', although many parts have been rerouted.<ref>{{cite book| title=Riding the Transcontinental Rails: Overland Travel on the Pacific Railroad 1865\u20131881| author=Cooper, Bruce Clement| year=2005| publisher=Philadelphia: Polyglot Press, 445 pages| isbn=1411599934}} p. 1-15</ref>\n\nThe transcontinental railroad provided fast, safe, and cheap travel. The fare for a one-week trip from Omaha to San Francisco on an emigrant sleeping car was about $65 for an adult. It replaced most of the far slower and more hazardous [[stagecoach]] lines and [[wagon train]]s. The number of emigrants taking the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon and California Trail]]s declined dramatically.  The sale of the railroad land grant lands and the transport provided for timber and crops led to the rapid settling of the \"Great American Desert\".<ref>Richard White, '' Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe Union Pacific recruited laborers from Army veterans and [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, while most of the engineers were ex-Army men who had learned their trade keeping the trains running during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=R.M.|title=Irish Gandy Dancer: A tale of building the Transcontinental Railroad|year=2010|publisher=Create Space|location=Seattle|isbn=978-1-4528-2631-8|pages=198}}</ref>\n\nThe Central Pacific Railroad faced a labor shortage in the more sparsely settled West. It recruited [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] laborers in China, who did prodigious work building the line over and through the Sierra Nevada mountains and then across [[Nevada]] to their meeting in northern Utah.\n* One motive for the [[Gadsden Purchase]] of land from Mexico in 1853 was to obtain suitable terrain for a southern transcontinental railroad, as the southern portion of the [[Mexican Cession]] was too mountainous. The [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] was completed in 1881.\n* The [[Pacific Railway Act|Pacific Railroad Act of 1862]] (based on an earlier bill in 1856) authorized land grants for new lines that would \"aid in the construction of a railroad and [[telegraph]] line from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean\".<ref>[http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Railroad_Acts.html \"An Act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes] 12 Stat. 489, July 1, 1862</ref>\n* The rails of the \"[[First Transcontinental Railroad]]\" were joined on May 10, 1869, with the ceremonial driving of the [[golden spike|\"Last Spike\"]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], after track was laid over a {{convert|1,756|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} gap between [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Omaha, Nebraska]]/[[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]<ref>[http://cprr.org/Museum/Lincoln_1864.html Executive Order of Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, Fixing the Point of Commencement of the Pacific Railroad at Council Bluffs, Iowa, March 7, 1864] 38th Congress, 1st Session SENATE Ex.

In central [[Utah]], the D&RG acquired a number of independent [[narrow gauge]] companies, which were incorporated into the first (1881-1889) [[Utah Division (D&RGW)|Denver and Rio Grande Western Railway]] (D&RGW). Tracks were extended north through [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], while simultaneously building south and eastward toward Grand Junction. The D&RG and the D&RGW were linked on March 30, 1883, the extension to [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] (where it met the Central Pacific) was completed on May 14, 1883, and through traffic between Denver and Ogden began a few days later. The [[break of gauge]] made direct interchange of [[rolling stock]] with [[standard gauge]] railroads at both ends of this [[bridge line]] impossible for several years. The D&RG in 1887 began rebuilding its mainline in standard gauge, including a new route and tunnel at [[Tennessee Pass (Colorado)|Tennessee Pass]]. The first D&RGW was reincorporated as the [[Utah Division (D&RGW)|Rio Grande Western]] (RGW) in June 1889 and immediately began the conversion of track gauge. Standard gauge operations linking Ogden and Denver were completed on November 15, 1890.<ref name=\"Beebe_1963\">[[Lucius Beebe|Beebe, Lucius]] and [[Charles Clegg|Clegg, Charles]], \u201cRio Grande, Mainline of the Rockies\u201d, Howell-North Books 1962.</ref>\n* The [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] completed its route connecting the AT&SF at [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], via [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], to the Southern Pacific at [[Needles, California]], on August 9, 1883. The SP line into Los Angeles was leased by the A&P in 1884 (and purchased in 1911); this gave the AT&SF (the A&P's parent company) a direct route into [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"Myrick_1990\" /> This route now forms the western portion of [[BNSF]]'s [[Southern Transcon]].\n* The [[Northern Pacific Railway]] (NP) completed the fifth independent transcontinental railroad on August 22, 1883, linking [[Chicago]] with [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]. The [[Northern Pacific Railroad Completion Site, 1883|Completion Ceremony]] was held on September 8, 1883, with former [[U.S. President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] contributing to driving the Final Spike.\n* The [[California Southern Railroad]] (chartered January 10, 1882) was completed from National City on San Diego Bay via Temecula Ca\u00f1on to Colton and San Bernardino in September, 1883, and extended through the Cajon Pass to Barstow, a junction of the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]], in November, 1885. In September, 1885, the line of the Southern Pacific from Colton to Los Angeles, a distance of 58 miles, had been leased by the California Central with equal rights and privileges thus allowing the Santa Fe's Transcontinental route to be completed by the connection with the California Southern and A&PRR. The SP grade was used until the completion of the California Central's own line between San Bernardino and Los Angeles in June, 1887, a distance of 62.84 miles, which was part of the old Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad, which had been acquired by purchase. In August, 1888, the California Central completed its Coast Division south from Los Angeles to a junction with the California Southern Railroad near Oceanside, a distance of 80.90 miles, and these two divisions comprised the main line of the California Central, forming, in connection with the California Southern, a direct line between Southern California and the East by way of the Atlantic and Pacific and Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroads.<ref>\"Eleventh Annual Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners of the State of California for the year ending December 31, 1890\" Sacramento: California State Office, J.D.

Hill]] in 1893; it stretched from [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] to [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]].\n* The [[Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific]] reached [[Santa Rosa, New Mexico]], from the east in late 1901, shortly before the [[El Paso and Northeastern Railway|El Paso & Northeastern]] arrived from the southwest. The two were connected on February 1, 1902, thus forming an additional link between the Midwest and southern California.<ref name=\"Myrick_1990\" /> Through passenger service was provided by the ''[[Golden State Limited]]'' (Chicago\u2014Kansas City\u2014Tucumcari\u2014El Paso\u2014Los Angeles) jointly operated by the Rock Island and the Southern Pacific (EP&NE's successor) from 1902 to 1968.\n* The [[San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad]] completed its line connecting Los Angeles through [[Las Vegas]] to Salt Lake City on May 1, 1905. Through passenger service from Chicago to Los Angeles was provided by Union Pacific's ''[[Los Angeles Limited]]'' from 1905 to 1954, and the ''[[City of Los Angeles (train)|City of Los Angeles]]'' from 1936 to 1971.\n* The [[Western Pacific Railway]] (WP), financed by the Denver & Rio Grande on behalf of the [[Gould transcontinental system|Gould System]], completed its new line from Oakland to Ogden in 1909, in direct competition with the Southern Pacific\u2019s existing route. Through passenger service (Oakland-Salt Lake City-Denver-Chicago) was provided by the ''[[Exposition Flyer]]'' 1939 to 1949 and its successor, the ''[[California Zephyr]]'' 1949 to 1970, both jointly operated by the WP, the [[D&RGW]] and the [[Chicago, Burlington & Quincy]].\n* In 1909, the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul (or [[Milwaukee Road]]) completed a privately built Pacific extension to Seattle. On completion, the line was renamed the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific]]. Although the Pacific Extension was privately funded, predecessor roads did benefit from the [[Pacific Railway Acts|federal land grant]] act, so it cannot be said to have been built without federal aid.\n* [[John D. Spreckels]] completed his privately funded [[San Diego and Arizona Railway]] in 1919, thereby creating a direct link (via connection with the Southern Pacific lines) between [[San Diego, California]] and the [[Eastern United States]]. The railroad stretched {{convert|148|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} from San Diego to [[Calexico, California]], of which {{convert|44|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} were south of the border in [[Mexico]].\n* In 1993, [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' daily railroad train was extended eastward to [[Miami, Florida]], later rerouted to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], making it the first regularly-scheduled transcontinental [[passenger train]] route in the United States to be operated by a single company. [[Hurricane Katrina]] cut this rail route in [[Louisiana]] in 2005. The train now runs from Los Angeles to New Orleans.\n\n====The Gould System====\n{{main|Gould transcontinental system}}\n\n[[George k. Gould]] attempted to assemble a truly transcontinental system in the 1900s. The line from [[San Francisco, California]], to [[Toledo, Ohio]], was completed in 1909, consisting of the [[Western Pacific Railway]], [[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad]], [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]], and [[Wabash Railroad]]. Beyond Toledo, the planned route would have used the [[Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad (1899-1916)|Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad (1900)]], [[Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway]], [[Little Kanawha Railroad]], [[West Virginia Central and Pittsburgh Railway]], [[Western Maryland Railroad]], and [[Philadelphia and Western Railway]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} but the [[Panic of 1907]] strangled the plans before the Little Kanawha section in [[West Virginia]] could be finished. The [[Alphabet Route]] was completed in 1931, providing the portion of this line east of the [[Mississippi River]]. With the merging of the railroads, only the Union Pacific Railroad and the [[BNSF Railway]] remain to carry the entire route.\n\n===Canada===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Culture of Saskatchewan]] -->\n[[Image:LastSpike Craigellachie BC Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Lord Strathcona]] driving the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|\"Last Spike\"]] of [[Canada]]'s first transcontinental railroad, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], in 1885]]\n\nThe completion of Canada's first transcontinental railway with the driving of the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]] at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia]], on November 7, 1885, is an important milestone in [[History of Canada|Canadian history]]. Between 1881 and 1885, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) completed a line that spanned from the port of Montreal to the Pacific coast, fulfilling a condition of [[British Columbia]]'s 1871 entry into the [[Canadian Confederation]]. The City of [[Vancouver]], incorporated in 1886, was designated the western terminus of the line. The CPR became the first transcontinental railway company in North America in 1889 after its [[International Railway of Maine]] opened, connecting CPR to the Atlantic coast.\n\nThe construction of a transcontinental railway strengthened the connection of British Columbia and the [[Northwest Territories]] to [[Canada]] they had recently joined, and acted as a bulwark against potential incursions by the United States.\n\nSubsequently, two other transcontinental lines were built in Canada: the [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (CNoR) opened another line to the Pacific in 1912, and the combined [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] (GTPR)/[[National Transcontinental Railway]] (NTR) system opened in 1917 following the completion of the [[Quebec Bridge]], although its line to the Pacific opened in 1914. The CNoR, GTPR, and NTR were [[nationalized]] to form the [[Canadian National Railway]], which currently is now Canada's largest transcontinental railway, with lines running all the way from the Pacific Coast to the Antarctica Coast.\n\n==Central America (inter-oceanic lines)==\n\n===meow===\n{{Main|Panama Canal Railway}}\n[[File:Panama Canal Railway.svg|thumb|<center>Current Panama Canal Railway line {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/Panama Canal Railway|interactive version]])}}</center>]]\nThe first railroad to directly connect two oceans (although not by crossing a broad \"continental\" land mass<ref>Otis, F.N.,''\"Illustrated History of the Panama Railroad\"'' (Harper & Bros., New York, 1861), p. 12</ref>) was the [[Panama Railway|Panama Rail Road]]. Opened in 1855, this {{convert|48|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} line was designated instead as an \"inter-oceanic\"<ref>''\"A Great Enterprise\"'' The Portland (Maine) ''Transcript'' [Newspaper], February 17, 1855.</ref> railroad crossing [[Central America]] at its narrowest point, the [[Isthmus of Panama]], when that area was still part of [[Colombia]]. (Panama [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|split off from Colombia]] in 1903 and became the independent nation of [[Panama]]). By spanning the isthmus, the line thus became the first railroad to completely cross any part of the Americas and physically connect ports on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s. Given the tropical [[rain forest]] environment, the terrain, and diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[cholera]], its completion was a considerable engineering challenge. The construction took five years after ground was first broken for the line in May, 1850, cost eight million dollars, and required more than seven thousand workers drawn from \"every quarter of the globe.\"<ref>Otis, p. 35</ref>\n\nThis railway was built to provide a shorter and more secure path between the United States' [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West]] Coasts. This need was mainly triggered by the [[California Gold Rush]]. Over the years the railway played a key role in the construction and the subsequent operation of the [[Panama Canal]], due to its proximity to the canal. Currently, the railway operates under the private administration of the Panama Canal Railroad Company, and its upgraded capacity complements the cargo traffic through the Panama Canal.\n\n===Guatemala===\n[[File:Guatemala railways.svg|thumb|<center>Guatemala railway (defunct) {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/Guatemala railways|interactive version]])}}</center>]]\n{{Main|Rail transport in Guatemala}}\nA second Central American inter-oceanic railroad began operation in 1908 as a connection between [[Puerto San Jos\u00e9]] and [[Puerto Barrios]] in Guatemala, but ceased passenger service to Puerto San Jos\u00e9 in 1989.\n\n===Costa Rica===\n[[File:Costarice railway.svg|thumb|<center>Costa Rica railway network {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/Costarica railways|interactive version]])}}</center>]]\n{{Main|Rail transport in Costa Rica}}\nA third Central American inter-oceanic railroad began operation in 1910 as a connection between [[Puntarenas]] and [[Lim\u00f3n]] in {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge.

Mendoza has an active connection to [[Buenos Aires]]. The old Transandino began in 1910 and ceased passenger service in 1978 and freight 4 years later. Technically a complete transcontinental link exists from [[Arica, Chile]], to [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], to Buenos Aires, but this trans-Andean crossing is for freight only.\n\nOn December 6, 2017 the Brazilian President Michel Temer and his Bolivian counterpart Morales signed an agreement for an Atlantic - Pacific railway. The construction will start in 2019 and will be finished in 2024. The new railway is planned to be 3750&nbsp;km in length. There are two possible tracks in discussion: Both have an Atlantic end in [[Santos, Brazil]] but the Pacific ends are in [[Ilo, Peru]] and [[Matarani, Peru]].<ref>http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/transkontinentale-bahnstrecke-brasilien-und-bolivien-gehen-jahrhundertprojekt-an-15327521.html</ref>\n\nAnother longer Transcontinental freight-only railroad linking [[Lima]], [[Peru]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] is under development.\n\n==Eurasia==\n{{Details|Eurasian Land Bridge}}\n* The first transcontinental railroad in Europe, that connected the [[North Sea]] or the [[English Channel]] with the [[Mediterranean Sea]], was a series of lines that included the [[Paris\u2013Marseille railway]], in service 1856. Multiple railways north of Paris were in operation at that time, such as [[Paris\u2013Lille railway]] and [[Paris\u2013Le Havre railway]].\n* The second connection between the seas of Northern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, was a series of lines finalized in 1857 with the [[Austrian Southern Railway]], [[Vienna]]\u2013[[Trieste]]. There were before that railroad connections [[Hamburg]]\u2013[[Berlin]]\u2013[[Wroclaw]]\u2013[[Vienna]] (including [[Berlin\u2013Hamburg Railway]], [[Berlin\u2013Wroc\u0142aw railway]], [[Upper Silesian Railway]] and [[Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway]]). The Baltic Sea was also connected through the [[L\u00fcbeck\u2013L\u00fcneburg railway]].\n* The first [[Eurasia]]n transcontinental railroad was the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] (with connecting lines in Europe), completed in 1905 which connects [[Moscow]] with [[Vladivostok]] on the [[Pacific]] coast. There are two connections from this line to [[China]]. It is the world's longest rail line at {{convert|9,289|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. This line connects the European railroad system with China, [[Mongolia]] and [[Korea]]. Since the former Soviet countries and Mongolia use a [[Russian gauge|broader gauge]], a [[break of gauge]] is necessary either at the eastern frontiers of [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]] or the Chinese border. In spite of this there are through services of passenger trains between Moscow and Beijing or through coaches from Berlin to Novosibirsk. Almost every major town along the Trans-Siberian railway has its own return service to Moscow.\n* A second rail line connects Istanbul in Turkey with [[China]] via [[Iran]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. This route imposes a [[break of gauge]] at the Iranian border with Turkmenistan and at the Chinese border. En route there is a [[train ferry]] in eastern Turkey across [[Lake Van]]. The European and Asian parts of Istanbul was linked 2019 linked by the [[Marmaray Tunnel|Marmaray]] [[undersea tunnel]], before that by train ferry. There is no through service of passenger trains on the entire line. A uniform gauge connection was proposed in 2006, commencing with new construction in [[Qazaqstan Temir Zholy|Kazakhstan]]. A decision to make the internal railways of Afghanistan {{RailGauge|1435mm}} gauge potentially opens up a new standard gauge route to China, since China abuts this country.<ref>[[Railway Gazette International]] | month=October | year=2010 | page=63 (with map)</ref>\n\n==Asia==\n* The [[Trans-Asian Railway]] is a project to link [[Singapore]] to [[Istanbul]] and is to a large degree complete with missing pieces primarily in [[Myanmar]]. The project has also linking corridors to [[China]], the central Asian states, and [[Russia]]. This transcontinental line unfortunately uses a number of different gauges, {{RailGauge|1435mm}}, {{RailGauge|1676mm}}, {{RailGauge|1520mm}} and {{RailGauge|1000mm}}, though this problem may be lessened with the use of [[variable gauge axle]] systems such as the [[SUW 2000]].\n* The TransKazakhstan Trunk Railways project by [[Kazakhstan Temir Zholy]] will connect [[China]] and Europe with standard gauge {{RailGauge|1435mm}}. Construction is set to start in 2006. Initially the line will go to western [[Kazakhstan]], south through [[Turkmenistan]] to [[Iran]], then to [[Turkey]] and Europe. A shorter to-be-constructed {{RailGauge|1435mm}} link from Kazakhstan is considered going through Russia and either [[Belarus]] or [[Ukraine]].\n* The [[Baghdad Railway]] connects Istanbul with Baghdad and finally Basra, a sea port at the Persian Gulf. When its construction started in the 1880s it was in those times a Transcontinental Railroad.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} {{clarify|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Australia==\n\n===East-West===\n* The first [[Trans-Australian Railway]] was completed in 1917, between [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]] and [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]], and crosses the [[Nullarbor Plain]]. This line completed the link between the mainland state capitals of [[Brisbane]] then [[Sydney]] via [[Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide]] to the western state capital of [[Perth]]. This route suffered from a number of [[break of gauge|breaks-of-gauge]], using {{RailGauge|1435mm}} twice, {{RailGauge|1600mm}} once, and {{RailGauge|1067mm}} thrice, with five breaks-of-gauge in all.\n\nThe Trans-Australian Railway was the first route operated by the Federal Government.\n\nIn the 1940s, 1970s, and 2000s steps were taken to rationalise the gauge chaos and connect the mainland capital cities mentioned above with standard gauge {{RailGauge|1435mm}}. Since 1970, when the direct standard gauge line across the country was completed, the passenger train on the [[Sydney]] to [[Perth]] line has been called the ''[[Indian Pacific]]''.\n\nThe proposed [[Iron Boomerang]] would connect iron in the [[Pilbara]] with coal in [[Queensland]], so achieving loaded operations in both directions.\n\n===North-South===\n* A {{convert|820|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} land grant railway from [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]] to [[Point Parker]] on the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], with branches, was proposed in the 1880s.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11563661?searchTerm=Charleville+Point+Parker#pstart265733 28 Dec 1882 \u2013 THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY.

The [[Adelaide-Darwin railway]] is standard or {{RailGauge|1435mm}} gauge, though the original line to Alice Springs (never fully completed line) was {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge.\n* In 2006, proposals for new lines in Queensland that would carry both intrastate coal traffic and interstate freight traffic would see [[standard gauge]] penetrate the state in considerable stretches for the first time. (ARHS Digest September 2006). The standard gauge [[Inland Railway]] would ultimately extend from [[Melbourne]] to [[Cairns]].\n* Starting in 1867, Queensland built several railways going inland from several ports in a westerly direction. From the 1920s, steps were taken to connect these lines by the North-South [[North Coast railway line, Queensland|North Coast line]] from [[Brisbane]] to [[Cairns]].\n\n==Africa==\n\n===East-West===\n* There are several ways to cross [[Africa]] transcontinentally by connecting west-east railroads. One is the [[Benguela railway]] that was completed in 1929. It starts in [[Lobito]], [[Angola]] and connects through [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] to the [[Zambia railways]] system. From Zambia several ports are accessible on the Indian Ocean: [[Dar es Salaam]] in Tanzania through the [[TAZARA]], and, through Zimbabwe, [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] and [[Maputo]] in Mozambique. The Angolan Civil War has made the Benguela line largely inoperative, but efforts are being taken to restore it. Another west-east corridor leads from the Atlantic harbours in [[Namibia]], either [[Walvis Bay]] or [[Luderitz]] to the [[South Africa]]n rail system that, in turn, links to ports on the [[Indian Ocean]] ( i.e. [[Durban]], [[Maputo]]).\n* A 1015&nbsp;km gap in the east-west line between [[Kinshasa]] and [[Ilebo]] filled by riverboats could be plugged with a new railway.<ref>[http://www.afdb.org/en/news-events/article/afdb-grants-us-7-45-million-to-drc-and-congo-for-transport-system-improvement-project-study-3384/ Afdb.org]</ref>\n* There are two proposals for a line from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Guinea, including [[TransAfricaRail]].\n* In 2010 a [[Dakar-Port Sudan Railway|proposal]] surfaced to link [[Dakar]] to [[Port Sudan]]. Thirteen countries are on the main route, while another six would be served by branches.\n\n===North-South===\n* A North-South transcontinental railroad had been proposed by [[Cecil Rhodes]]: the [[Cape-Cairo railway]]. This system was seen as the backbone for the African possessions of the [[British Empire]], and was not completed. During its development, a competing French colonial project for a competing line from [[Algiers]] or [[Dakar]] to [[Abidjan]] was abandoned after the [[Fashoda incident]]. This line would have had four gauge islands in three gauges.\n* An extension of Namibian Railways is being built in 2006 with the possible connection to Angolan Railways.\n* [[Transport in Libya#Railways|Libya]] has proposed a Trans-Saharan Railway connecting possibly to [[Transport in Nigeria#Railways|Nigeria]] which would connect with the proposed [[AfricaRail]] network.\n\n===African Union of Railways===\n* The [[African Union of Railways]] has plans to connect the various railways of Africa including the [[Dakar-Port Sudan Railway]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Railways}}\n* [[Cosmopolitan Railway]]\n* [[Transmountain railroad]]\n* [[Intercontinental and transoceanic fixed links]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Glenn Williamson, ''Iron Muse: Photographing the Transcontinental Railroad.''

The first of these, the {{convert|1928|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[First Transcontinental Railroad|\"Pacific Railroad\"]], was built by the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] and [[Union Pacific Railroad]] to link the San Francisco Bay at [[Alameda, California]], with the nation's existing eastern railroad network at [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]/[[Omaha, Nebraska]], thereby creating the world's first transcontinental railroad when it opened in 1869. Its construction was made possible by the US government under [[Pacific Railroad Acts|Pacific Railroad Acts of 1862, 1864, and 1867]].\n\n====Transcontinental railroad====\n{{main|First Transcontinental Railroad}}\n\nThe world's [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was built between 1863 and 1869 to join the eastern and western halves of the United States. Begun just before the [[American Civil War]], its construction was considered to be one of the greatest American technological feats of the 19th century. Known as the \"Pacific Railroad\" when it opened, this served as a vital link for trade, commerce, and travel and opened up vast regions of the south American heartland for settlement. Shipping and commerce could thrive away from navigable watercourses for the first time since the beginning of the nation. Much of this route, especially on the Sierra grade west of Reno, Nevada, is currently used by Amtrak's ''[[California Zephyr]]'', although many parts have been rerouted.<ref>{{cite book| title=Riding the Transcontinental Rails: Overland Travel on the Pacific Railroad 1865\u20131881| author=Cooper, Bruce Clement| year=2005| publisher=Philadelphia: Polyglot Press, 445 pages| isbn=1411599934}} p. 1-15</ref>\n\nThe transcontinental railroad provided fast, safe, and cheap travel. The fare for a one-week trip from Omaha to San Francisco on an emigrant sleeping car was about $65 for an adult. It replaced most of the far slower and more hazardous [[stagecoach]] lines and [[wagon train]]s. The number of emigrants taking the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon and California Trail]]s declined dramatically.  The sale of the railroad land grant lands and the transport provided for timber and crops led to the rapid settling of the \"Great American Desert\".<ref>Richard White, '' Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe Union Pacific recruited laborers from Army veterans and [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, while most of the engineers were ex-Army men who had learned their trade keeping the trains running during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=R.M.|title=Irish Gandy Dancer: A tale of building the Transcontinental Railroad|year=2010|publisher=Create Space|location=Seattle|isbn=978-1-4528-2631-8|pages=198}}</ref>\n\nThe Central Pacific Railroad faced a labor shortage in the more sparsely settled West. It recruited [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] laborers in China, who did prodigious work building the line over and through the Sierra Nevada mountains and then across [[Nevada]] to their meeting in northern Utah.\n* One motive for the [[Gadsden Purchase]] of land from Mexico in 1853 was to obtain suitable terrain for a southern transcontinental railroad, as the southern portion of the [[Mexican Cession]] was too mountainous.

In September, 1885, the line of the Southern Pacific from Colton to Los Angeles, a distance of 58 miles, had been leased by the California Central with equal rights and privileges thus allowing the Santa Fe's Transcontinental route to be completed by the connection with the California Southern and A&PRR. The SP grade was used until the completion of the California Central's own line between San Bernardino and Los Angeles in June, 1887, a distance of 62.84 miles, which was part of the old Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad, which had been acquired by purchase. In August, 1888, the California Central completed its Coast Division south from Los Angeles to a junction with the California Southern Railroad near Oceanside, a distance of 80.90 miles, and these two divisions comprised the main line of the California Central, forming, in connection with the California Southern, a direct line between Southern California and the East by way of the Atlantic and Pacific and Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroads.<ref>\"Eleventh Annual Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners of the State of California for the year ending December 31, 1890\" Sacramento: California State Office, J.D.

Through passenger service from Chicago to Los Angeles was provided by Union Pacific's ''[[Los Angeles Limited]]'' from 1905 to 1954, and the ''[[City of Los Angeles (train)|City of Los Angeles]]'' from 1936 to 1971.\n* The [[Western Pacific Railway]] (WP), financed by the Denver & Rio Grande on behalf of the [[Gould transcontinental system|Gould System]], completed its new line from Oakland to Ogden in 1909, in direct competition with the Southern Pacific\u2019s existing route. Through passenger service (Oakland-Salt Lake City-Denver-Chicago) was provided by the ''[[Exposition Flyer]]'' 1939 to 1949 and its successor, the ''[[California Zephyr]]'' 1949 to 1970, both jointly operated by the WP, the [[D&RGW]] and the [[Chicago, Burlington & Quincy]].\n* In 1909, the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul (or [[Milwaukee Road]]) completed a privately built Pacific extension to Seattle. On completion, the line was renamed the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific]]. Although the Pacific Extension was privately funded, predecessor roads did benefit from the [[Pacific Railway Acts|federal land grant]] act, so it cannot be said to have been built without federal aid.\n* [[John D. Spreckels]] completed his privately funded [[San Diego and Arizona Railway]] in 1919, thereby creating a direct link (via connection with the Southern Pacific lines) between [[San Diego, California]] and the [[Eastern United States]]. The railroad stretched {{convert|148|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} from San Diego to [[Calexico, California]], of which {{convert|44|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} were south of the border in [[Mexico]].\n* In 1993, [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' daily railroad train was extended eastward to [[Miami, Florida]], later rerouted to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], making it the first regularly-scheduled transcontinental [[passenger train]] route in the United States to be operated by a single company. [[Hurricane Katrina]] cut this rail route in [[Louisiana]] in 2005. The train now runs from Los Angeles to New Orleans.\n\n====The Gould System====\n{{main|Gould transcontinental system}}\n\n[[George k. Gould]] attempted to assemble a truly transcontinental system in the 1900s. The line from [[San Francisco, California]], to [[Toledo, Ohio]], was completed in 1909, consisting of the [[Western Pacific Railway]], [[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad]], [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]], and [[Wabash Railroad]]. Beyond Toledo, the planned route would have used the [[Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad (1899-1916)|Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad (1900)]], [[Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway]], [[Little Kanawha Railroad]], [[West Virginia Central and Pittsburgh Railway]], [[Western Maryland Railroad]], and [[Philadelphia and Western Railway]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} but the [[Panic of 1907]] strangled the plans before the Little Kanawha section in [[West Virginia]] could be finished. The [[Alphabet Route]] was completed in 1931, providing the portion of this line east of the [[Mississippi River]]. With the merging of the railroads, only the Union Pacific Railroad and the [[BNSF Railway]] remain to carry the entire route.\n\n===Canada===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Culture of Saskatchewan]] -->\n[[Image:LastSpike Craigellachie BC Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Lord Strathcona]] driving the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|\"Last Spike\"]] of [[Canada]]'s first transcontinental railroad, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], in 1885]]\n\nThe completion of Canada's first transcontinental railway with the driving of the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]] at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia]], on November 7, 1885, is an important milestone in [[History of Canada|Canadian history]]. Between 1881 and 1885, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) completed a line that spanned from the port of Montreal to the Pacific coast, fulfilling a condition of [[British Columbia]]'s 1871 entry into the [[Canadian Confederation]]. The City of [[Vancouver]], incorporated in 1886, was designated the western terminus of the line. The CPR became the first transcontinental railway company in North America in 1889 after its [[International Railway of Maine]] opened, connecting CPR to the Atlantic coast.\n\nThe construction of a transcontinental railway strengthened the connection of British Columbia and the [[Northwest Territories]] to [[Canada]] they had recently joined, and acted as a bulwark against potential incursions by the United States.\n\nSubsequently, two other transcontinental lines were built in Canada: the [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (CNoR) opened another line to the Pacific in 1912, and the combined [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] (GTPR)/[[National Transcontinental Railway]] (NTR) system opened in 1917 following the completion of the [[Quebec Bridge]], although its line to the Pacific opened in 1914. The CNoR, GTPR, and NTR were [[nationalized]] to form the [[Canadian National Railway]], which currently is now Canada's largest transcontinental railway, with lines running all the way from the Pacific Coast to the Antarctica Coast.\n\n==Central America (inter-oceanic lines)==\n\n===Panama===\n{{Main|Panama Canal Railway}}\n[[File:Panama Canal Railway.svg|thumb|<center>Current Panama Canal Railway line {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/Panama Canal Railway|interactive version]])}}</center>]]\nThe first railroad to directly connect two oceans (although not by crossing a broad \"continental\" land mass<ref>Otis, F.N.,''\"Illustrated History of the Panama Railroad\"'' (Harper & Bros., New York, 1861), p. 12</ref>) was the [[Panama Railway|Panama Rail Road]]. Opened in 1855, this {{convert|48|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} line was designated instead as an \"inter-oceanic\"<ref>''\"A Great Enterprise\"'' The Portland (Maine) ''Transcript'' [Newspaper], February 17, 1855.</ref> railroad crossing [[Central America]] at its narrowest point, the [[Isthmus of Panama]], when that area was still part of [[Colombia]]. (Panama [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|split off from Colombia]] in 1903 and became the independent nation of [[Panama]]). By spanning the isthmus, the line thus became the first railroad to completely cross any part of the Americas and physically connect ports on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s. Given the tropical [[rain forest]] environment, the terrain, and diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[cholera]], its completion was a considerable engineering challenge. The construction took five years after ground was first broken for the line in May, 1850, cost eight million dollars, and required more than seven thousand workers drawn from \"every quarter of the globe.\"<ref>Otis, p. 35</ref>\n\nThis railway was built to provide a shorter and more secure path between the United States' [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West]] Coasts. This need was mainly triggered by the [[California Gold Rush]]. Over the years the railway played a key role in the construction and the subsequent operation of the [[Panama Canal]], due to its proximity to the canal. Currently, the railway operates under the private administration of the Panama Canal Railroad Company, and its upgraded capacity complements the cargo traffic through the Panama Canal.\n\n===Guatemala===\n[[File:Guatemala railways.svg|thumb|<center>Guatemala railway (defunct) {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/Guatemala railways|interactive version]])}}</center>]]\n{{Main|Rail transport in Guatemala}}\nA second Central American inter-oceanic railroad began operation in 1908 as a connection between [[Puerto San Jos\u00e9]] and [[Puerto Barrios]] in Guatemala, but ceased passenger service to Puerto San Jos\u00e9 in 1989.\n\n===Costa Rica===\n[[File:Costarice railway.svg|thumb|<center>Costa Rica railway network {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/Costarica railways|interactive version]])}}</center>]]\n{{Main|Rail transport in Costa Rica}}\nA third Central American inter-oceanic railroad began operation in 1910 as a connection between [[Puntarenas]] and [[Lim\u00f3n]] in {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge.

Mendoza has an active connection to [[Buenos Aires]]. The old Transandino began in 1910 and ceased passenger service in 1978 and freight 4 years later. Technically a complete transcontinental link exists from [[Arica, Chile]], to [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], to Buenos Aires, but this trans-Andean crossing is for freight only.\n\nOn December 6, 2017 the Brazilian President Michel Temer and his Bolivian counterpart Morales signed an agreement for an Atlantic - Pacific railway. The construction will start in 2019 and will be finished in 2024. The new railway is planned to be 3750&nbsp;km in length. There are two possible tracks in discussion: Both have an Atlantic end in [[Santos, Brazil]] but the Pacific ends are in [[Ilo, Peru]] and [[Matarani, Peru]].<ref>http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/transkontinentale-bahnstrecke-brasilien-und-bolivien-gehen-jahrhundertprojekt-an-15327521.html</ref>\n\nAnother longer Transcontinental freight-only railroad linking [[Lima]], [[Peru]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] is under development.\n\n==Eurasia==\n{{Details|Eurasian Land Bridge}}\n* The first transcontinental railroad in Europe, that connected the [[North Sea]] or the [[English Channel]] with the [[Mediterranean Sea]], was a series of lines that included the [[Paris\u2013Marseille railway]], in service 1856. Multiple railways north of Paris were in operation at that time, such as [[Paris\u2013Lille railway]] and [[Paris\u2013Le Havre railway]].\n* The second connection between the seas of Northern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, was a series of lines finalized in 1857 with the [[Austrian Southern Railway]], [[Vienna]]\u2013[[Trieste]]. There were before that railroad connections [[Hamburg]]\u2013[[Berlin]]\u2013[[Wroclaw]]\u2013[[Vienna]] (including [[Berlin\u2013Hamburg Railway]], [[Berlin\u2013Wroc\u0142aw railway]], [[Upper Silesian Railway]] and [[Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway]]). The Baltic Sea was also connected through the [[L\u00fcbeck\u2013L\u00fcneburg railway]].\n* The first [[Eurasia]]n transcontinental railroad was the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] (with connecting lines in Europe), completed in 1905 which connects [[Moscow]] with [[Vladivostok]] on the [[Pacific]] coast. There are two connections from this line to [[China]]. It is the world's longest rail line at {{convert|9,289|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. This line connects the European railroad system with China, [[Mongolia]] and [[Korea]]. Since the former Soviet countries and Mongolia use a [[Russian gauge|broader gauge]], a [[break of gauge]] is necessary either at the eastern frontiers of [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]] or the Chinese border. In spite of this there are through services of passenger trains between Moscow and Beijing or through coaches from Berlin to Novosibirsk. Almost every major town along the Trans-Siberian railway has its own return service to Moscow.\n* A second rail line connects Istanbul in Turkey with [[China]] via [[Iran]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. This route imposes a [[break of gauge]] at the Iranian border with Turkmenistan and at the Chinese border. En route there is a [[train ferry]] in eastern Turkey across [[Lake Van]]. The European and Asian parts of Istanbul was linked 2019 linked by the [[Marmaray Tunnel|Marmaray]] [[undersea tunnel]], before that by train ferry. There is no through service of passenger trains on the entire line. A uniform gauge connection was proposed in 2006, commencing with new construction in [[Qazaqstan Temir Zholy|Kazakhstan]]. A decision to make the internal railways of Afghanistan {{RailGauge|1435mm}} gauge potentially opens up a new standard gauge route to China, since China abuts this country.<ref>[[Railway Gazette International]] | month=October | year=2010 | page=63 (with map)</ref>\n\n==Asia==\n* The [[Trans-Asian Railway]] is a project to link [[Singapore]] to [[Istanbul]] and is to a large degree complete with missing pieces primarily in [[Myanmar]]. The project has also linking corridors to [[China]], the central Asian states, and [[Russia]]. This transcontinental line unfortunately uses a number of different gauges, {{RailGauge|1435mm}}, {{RailGauge|1676mm}}, {{RailGauge|1520mm}} and {{RailGauge|1000mm}}, though this problem may be lessened with the use of [[variable gauge axle]] systems such as the [[SUW 2000]].\n* The TransKazakhstan Trunk Railways project by [[Kazakhstan Temir Zholy]] will connect [[China]] and Europe with standard gauge {{RailGauge|1435mm}}. Construction is set to start in 2006. Initially the line will go to western [[Kazakhstan]], south through [[Turkmenistan]] to [[Iran]], then to [[Turkey]] and Europe. A shorter to-be-constructed {{RailGauge|1435mm}} link from Kazakhstan is considered going through Russia and either [[Belarus]] or [[Ukraine]].\n* The [[Baghdad Railway]] connects Istanbul with Baghdad and finally Basra, a sea port at the Persian Gulf. When its construction started in the 1880s it was in those times a Transcontinental Railroad.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} {{clarify|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Australia==\n\n===East-West===\n* The first [[Trans-Australian Railway]] was completed in 1917, between [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]] and [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]], and crosses the [[Nullarbor Plain]]. This line completed the link between the mainland state capitals of [[Brisbane]] then [[Sydney]] via [[Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide]] to the western state capital of [[Perth]]. This route suffered from a number of [[break of gauge|breaks-of-gauge]], using {{RailGauge|1435mm}} twice, {{RailGauge|1600mm}} once, and {{RailGauge|1067mm}} thrice, with five breaks-of-gauge in all.\n\nThe Trans-Australian Railway was the first route operated by the Federal Government.\n\nIn the 1940s, 1970s, and 2000s steps were taken to rationalise the gauge chaos and connect the mainland capital cities mentioned above with standard gauge {{RailGauge|1435mm}}. Since 1970, when the direct standard gauge line across the country was completed, the passenger train on the [[Sydney]] to [[Perth]] line has been called the ''[[Indian Pacific]]''.\n\nThe proposed [[Iron Boomerang]] would connect iron in the [[Pilbara]] with coal in [[Queensland]], so achieving loaded operations in both directions.\n\n===North-South===\n* A {{convert|820|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} land grant railway from [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]] to [[Point Parker]] on the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], with branches, was proposed in the 1880s.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11563661?searchTerm=Charleville+Point+Parker#pstart265733 28 Dec 1882 \u2013 THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY. (BY TELEGRAPH.&#93; (F<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* The first north-south trans-Australia railway opened in January 2004 and links [[Port Darwin|Darwin]] to [[Adelaide]] with [[the Ghan]] passenger train. The [[Adelaide-Darwin railway]] is standard or {{RailGauge|1435mm}} gauge, though the original line to Alice Springs (never fully completed line) was {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge.\n* In 2006, proposals for new lines in Queensland that would carry both intrastate coal traffic and interstate freight traffic would see [[standard gauge]] penetrate the state in considerable stretches for the first time. (ARHS Digest September 2006). The standard gauge [[Inland Railway]] would ultimately extend from [[Melbourne]] to [[Cairns]].\n* Starting in 1867, Queensland built several railways going inland from several ports in a westerly direction. From the 1920s, steps were taken to connect these lines by the North-South [[North Coast railway line, Queensland|North Coast line]] from [[Brisbane]] to [[Cairns]].\n\n==Africa==\n\n===East-West===\n* There are several ways to cross [[Africa]] transcontinentally by connecting west-east railroads. One is the [[Benguela railway]] that was completed in 1929. It starts in [[Lobito]], [[Angola]] and connects through [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] to the [[Zambia railways]] system. From Zambia several ports are accessible on the Indian Ocean: [[Dar es Salaam]] in Tanzania through the [[TAZARA]], and, through Zimbabwe, [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] and [[Maputo]] in Mozambique. The Angolan Civil War has made the Benguela line largely inoperative, but efforts are being taken to restore it. Another west-east corridor leads from the Atlantic harbours in [[Namibia]], either [[Walvis Bay]] or [[Luderitz]] to the [[South Africa]]n rail system that, in turn, links to ports on the [[Indian Ocean]] ( i.e. [[Durban]], [[Maputo]]).\n* A 1015&nbsp;km gap in the east-west line between [[Kinshasa]] and [[Ilebo]] filled by riverboats could be plugged with a new railway.<ref>[http://www.afdb.org/en/news-events/article/afdb-grants-us-7-45-million-to-drc-and-congo-for-transport-system-improvement-project-study-3384/ Afdb.org]</ref>\n* There are two proposals for a line from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Guinea, including [[TransAfricaRail]].\n* In 2010 a [[Dakar-Port Sudan Railway|proposal]] surfaced to link [[Dakar]] to [[Port Sudan]]. Thirteen countries are on the main route, while another six would be served by branches.\n\n===North-South===\n* A North-South transcontinental railroad had been proposed by [[Cecil Rhodes]]: the [[Cape-Cairo railway]]. This system was seen as the backbone for the African possessions of the [[British Empire]], and was not completed. During its development, a competing French colonial project for a competing line from [[Algiers]] or [[Dakar]] to [[Abidjan]] was abandoned after the [[Fashoda incident]]. This line would have had four gauge islands in three gauges.\n* An extension of Namibian Railways is being built in 2006 with the possible connection to Angolan Railways.\n* [[Transport in Libya#Railways|Libya]] has proposed a Trans-Saharan Railway connecting possibly to [[Transport in Nigeria#Railways|Nigeria]] which would connect with the proposed [[AfricaRail]] network.\n\n===African Union of Railways===\n* The [[African Union of Railways]] has plans to connect the various railways of Africa including the [[Dakar-Port Sudan Railway]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Railways}}\n* [[Cosmopolitan Railway]]\n* [[Transmountain railroad]]\n* [[Intercontinental and transoceanic fixed links]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Glenn Williamson, ''Iron Muse: Photographing the Transcontinental Railroad.''
