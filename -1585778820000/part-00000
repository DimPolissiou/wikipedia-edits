At first, the gunmen were widely believed to be Russian [[Islamism|Islamist]] insurgents from Dagestan, however several other theories suggest that they may be local Islamist militants within the [[Pankisi Gorge crisis|Pankisi Gorge.]] To this day, there is no definitive answer to the paramilitary group's identity, and the likelihood of their identity has remained classified by Georgian officials.\n\nDuring the operation, which began on August 28, 2012, at least 14 people were killed and at least six wounded in a firefight on August 29. Among the victims were 11 members of the unknown armed group (including at least two Georgian citizens as well as at least five Russian citizens, all of the latter born in the former [[Chechen\u2013Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Chechen\u2013Ingush ASSR]]). Three Georgian special service personnel were killed and five were injured. On September 8, an injured suspected militant, [[Akhmed Chatayev]], a Russian citizen of [[Chechen people|Chechen]] ethnicity holding a [[refugee]] status in Austria, was arrested. Chatayev was put on trial for illegal [[Criminal possession of a weapon|weapon possession]] but protests his innocence, saying he was actually a negotiator for the government and that he was carrying no arms; he was later acquitted. The operation was officially concluded on October 30.\n\nMany details of the clash, the most deadly in Georgia since the [[2008 South Ossetia war]], still remain unclear. The governments of both Georgia and Russia, as well as Russia's Islamic insurgents of the [[Caucasus Emirate]] that abortively claimed that the unidentified armed group belonged to their main forces in Dagestan, accused each other of a provocation. The incident was also lambasted by Georgian then-opposition (winner of the [[2012 Georgian parliamentary election|October 2012 election]]) coalition [[Georgian Dream]], who accused [[Mikheil Saakashvili|Saakashvili]]'s [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] government of lying about it and promised that those responsible for the deaths would be punished.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Georgia\u2013Russia relations|Insurgency in the North Caucasus}}\n\nThe incident saw the worst loss of life in Georgia since the brief [[2008 South Ossetia war|territorial war with Russia]], in which hundreds of people were killed during five days in 2008.

In an 800-page report, Nanuashvili alleged that the Interior Ministry's counter-terrorist department itself had recruited 120 local Kists, Chechens (including veterans living abroad) and other North Caucasian refugees. The recruits would be then armed and trained by Georgian personnel and Chechen veterans at the [[Vaziani Military Base]] and at [[Shavnabada]] in early 2012. In August, a group of 16 [[Nakh peoples|Vainakhs]] decided to cross the Russian border on their own initiative, but were refused a passage and intercepted by Georgian Interior Ministry special forces deployed there by helicopter. After the negotiations through prominent Chechen mediators did not bring a breakthrough in the standoff, as the militants responded to the demands they would disarm by insisting they would surrender their weapons only after they reached Pankisi, seven (not 11) of them and three Georgians (including two handlers of the gunmen) were killed, and the rest of them were then escorted to Turkey.<ref name=probe/><ref name=denies>[http://www.rferl.org/content/georgia-chechen-militants-allegations-saakashvili-denial/24970927.html President Again Denies Georgia Co-Opted Chechen Fighters], RFE/RL, April 28, 2013</ref> The parliament declined Nanuashvili's proposal on the grounds that an investigation by prosecutor's office is under way.<ref name=denies/>\n\nMerabishvili, who was the Interior Minister in early 2012, dismissed the story as \"idiotic\" and in line with Russia's anti-Georgian propaganda.

At first, the gunmen were widely believed to be Russian [[Islamism|Islamist]] insurgents from Dagestan, however several other theories suggest that they may be local Islamist militants within the Pankisi Gorge. To this day, there is no definitive answer to the paramilitary group's identity.\n\nDuring the operation, which began on August 28, 2012, at least 14 people were killed and at least six wounded in a firefight on August 29. Among the victims were 11 members of the mysterious armed group (including at least two Georgian citizens as well as at least five Russian citizens, all of the latter born in the former [[Chechen\u2013Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Chechen\u2013Ingush ASSR]]). Three Georgian special service personnel were killed and five were injured. On September 8, an injured suspected militant, [[Akhmed Chatayev]], a Russian citizen of [[Chechen people|Chechen]] ethnicity holding a [[refugee]] status in Austria, was arrested. Chatayev was put on trial for illegal [[Criminal possession of a weapon|weapon possession]] but protests his innocence, saying he was actually a negotiator for the government and that he was carrying no arms; he was later acquitted. The operation was officially concluded on October 30.\n\nMany details of the clash, the most deadly in Georgia since the [[2008 South Ossetia war]], still remain unclear. The governments of Georgia and Russia, as well as Russia's Islamic insurgents of the [[Caucasus Emirate]] that abortively claimed that the shadowy armed group belonged to their main forces in Dagestan, accused each other of a provocation. The incident was also lambasted by Georgian then-opposition (winner of the [[2012 Georgian parliamentary election|October 2012 election]]) coalition [[Georgian Dream]], who accused [[Mikheil Saakashvili|Saakashvili]]'s [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] government of lying about it and promised that those responsible for the deaths would be punished.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Georgia\u2013Russia relations|Insurgency in the North Caucasus}}\n\nThe incident saw the worst loss of life in Georgia since the brief [[2008 South Ossetia war|territorial war with Russia]], in which hundreds of people were killed during five days in 2008. Tensions between the two countries have remained strong since the ceasefire, with the Russian military continuing to occupy Georgia's breakaway territories of [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]] and the two countries having not resumed diplomatic relations.<ref name=clashes/><ref name=gunmen>[http://gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=528323&version=1&template_id=39&parent_id=21_id=21 Georgia hunting gunmen after clash at border]{{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, AFP / Gulf Times / 30/8/2012 (archived from [http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=528323&version=1&template_id=39&parent the original] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426045225/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2 |date=2012-04-26 }} on 2012-09-01)</ref>\n\nThe deadly clash in Georgia took place against the backdrop of the continued Islamic insurgency in Russia's [[North Caucasus]] region, including the Republic of [[Dagestan]], where the situation was reported to be worsening for Russia.<ref name=special/> In the months preceding the incident, the mounting violence in Dagestan had reached the point of practically daily reports of attacks and armed clashes, with scores of fatalities each month.

The gunmen agreed to an offer by a senior border guard officer to keep just him as a hostage and to let go the civilians and the other border guards. Later, an official from the Georgian Interior Ministry arrived to negotiate and demanded their surrender, which was rejected. The group then decided to swap the last captive border guard for the official, telling him that he is now their hostage. Two of the gunmen then accompanied the official to a location where he could talk with his superiors to update them about the new developments, but instead they were led to an ambush site, where one of them was shot dead by a government sniper.

Its findings repeat many of the allegations contained in Nanuashvili's report. According to the report by the State Commission of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, the main organizer of the armed group was Akhmed Umarov, working closely with the special services of the Interior Ministry of Georgia. He had been released from the FSB prison and allowed to leave the country for Georgia, where the Russian side might hoped he would organize a large-scale international provocation and create a ''[[casus belli]]'' for occupation of all of Georgia by Russia. Main insitigators from the Vainakh side were also to include Gabriel (Jabrail) Khashiev, an ethnic Ingush wanted for murdering Chechens in Turkey, as well as Chatayev, described as Dokka Umarov's representative in Turkey and a relative of Dushuev. Most of the 200 recruits had left peacefully before the crisis in Lapota began, returning to their homes (in Georgia, the European Union, Turkey and Egypt) after the group's Georgian handlers refused to allow them to cross into Russia. The report names Georgia's Deputy Interior Minister Givi Lordkipanidze as the direct head of the operation in Lopota, which it says was coordinated by and approved by Saakashvili.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} Usman Ferzauli, [http://chechenpress.org/news/3903-doklad-goskomissii-chri-o-rezultatakh-rassledovaniya-intsidenta-v-ushchele-lopota.html \u0414\u043e\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0427\u0420\u0418 \u043e \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0432 \u0443\u0449\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0435 \u041b\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0430] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609183831/http://www.chechenpress.org/news/3903-doklad-goskomissii-chri-o-rezultatakh-rassledovaniya-intsidenta-v-ushchele-lopota.html |date=2013-06-09 }}, Chechenpress, 01.06.2013</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pankisi Gorge crisis]]\n*[[2008 Georgia\u2013Russia crisis]]\n*[[2017 Isani flat siege]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n[[Category:2012 in Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 2012]]\n[[Category:Hostage taking]]\n[[Category:Caucasus Emirate]]\n[[Category:Operations involving Georgian special forces]]\n[[Category:Kakheti]]\n", "name_user": "Balkanite", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lopota_incident"}
