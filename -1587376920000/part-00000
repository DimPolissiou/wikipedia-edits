Following the album's overall theme of radio are the songs \"Airwaves\", \"Commercial Breakup\", and \"Radio Silence,\" along with songs about the modern world (\"Windpower\", \"Flying North\", \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\").\n\n==Compositions==\nThe music of \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\" is a deliberate merging of past and present, combining modern synthesizers with blues harmonica playing and [[electronic percussion]] with [[handclap]]s.<ref name=\"Record8\">{{cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Stuart |title=Donald Fagen: A Techno-Geek Aims for 'An Emotional Event'|journal=Record|date=June 1983|volume=2|issue=8|page=4}}</ref> The central character in \"Radio Silence\" is a [[personification]] of [[Radio Caroline]], a 1960s [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|British pirate radio station]].<ref name=\"Record8\"/>\n\n==Release history==\nThe album was released a total of five separate times. All five releases appeared on vinyl and cassette (though the cassette release for the fifth version is unconfirmed), but only the third and fifth resequencings appeared on CD, with each changing the order of the songs, replacing the album mixes with extended or single mixes and even adding and removing entire songs. In the case of \"Radio Silence\", a completely different recording with prominent guitars was the version used on the early US incarnations.\n\nThe first US version, issued by [[Columbia Records|Columbia-CBS]]'s CBS/Sony imprint, excised the instrumental \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" (loosely based on the [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|1972 Uruguayan plane crash]]) and added the two sides of Fagen's first single, \"Leipzig\" and \"Urges\". Additionally, Columbia swapped the original synthpop version of \"Radio Silence\" for a much more rock-oriented version that had previously only been available as a single B-side in the UK. Columbia also opted for the single edit of \"Airwaves\" and abandoned the original UK \"comic book\" cover in favour of a shot of Fagen on a stage during the production of [[Bertholt Brecht]]'s \"Galileo\". This image had previously been used as the cover of the \"Europa and the Pirate Twins\" single in the UK.\n\nWhen Fagen released the single \"She Blinded Me with Science\" backed by \"[[One of our Submarines]]\" in late 1982\u2014complete with a music video for the A-side\u2014Columbia saw a golden opportunity. They removed \"Urges\" and \"Leipzig\", added the extended version of \"Science\" (also known as the \"U.S. Mix\") and \"Submarines\", and changed the album's cover art back to its original \"comic book\" design. Columbia also swapped the full-length version of \"Windpower\" for the single version (with an edited intro and outro). The strategy worked, as ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' sold better and \"She Blinded Me with Science\" became a major hit, with constant radio and MTV airplay.\n\nIn 1983, the UK record label, Venice in Peril, followed suit and reissued the album with a similar track listing to the second US version. They opted for the short single version of \"Science\" but retained the full-length versions of \"Airwaves\" and \"Windpower\" and the original synthesizer-driven version of \"Radio Silence\", just as all three had appeared on the first UK edition. This is the edition that is widely available on CD to this day, on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe successive resequencings occurred largely because different territories preferred different mixes of songs to others; for example, the extended mix of \"Science\" was the version that became a hit in [[United States|America]] and thus the American cut of the album was swiftly resequenced to accommodate the tastes of that particular territory.\n\nA remastered \"Collector's Edition\" of ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' was released on 13 July 2009, complete with bonus tracks, personal sleeve notes and a DVD of the ''Live Wireless'' music video.\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===1982 First UK release: Venice in Peril CBS/Sony VIP 1001===\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side A\n| all_writing     = [[Thomas Dolby]], except where noted\n| title1          = Flying North\n| length1         = 3:50\n| title2          = Commercial Breakup\n| note2           = [[Thomas Dolby]], Tim Kerr\n| length2         = 4:15\n| title3          = Weightless\n| length3         = 3:45\n| title4          = [[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\n| length4         = 3:18\n| title5          = Windpower\n| length5         = 4:20\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side B\n| title1          = The Wreck of The Fairchild\n| length1         = 3:30\n| title2         = Airwaves\n| length2        = 5:12\n| title3         = Radio Silence\n| length3        = 3:43\n| title4         = Cloudburst at Shingle Street\n| length4        = 5:45\n}}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The original UK track listing (including its reappearance on the 2009 ''Collector's Edition'' CD) is the only place one can hear the progression of \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" into \"Airwaves\" and then into the synth version of \"Radio Silence.\" \"Fairchild\" concludes with the sound of various electronics, including a wave computer, which segues into the intro of \"Airwaves\" with no break.

Released in 1982, the album contains the pop hit \"[[She Blinded Me with Science]]\" in its later resequencings (see below). Following the album's overall theme of radio are the songs \"Airwaves\", \"Commercial Breakup\", and \"Radio Silence,\" along with songs about the modern world (\"Windpower\", \"Flying North\", \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\").\n\n==Compositions==\nThe music of \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\" is a deliberate merging of past and present, combining modern synthesizers with blues harmonica playing and [[electronic percussion]] with [[handclap]]s.<ref name=\"Record8\">{{cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Stuart |title=Thomas Dolby: A Techno-Geek Aims for 'An Emotional Event'|journal=Record|date=June 1983|volume=2|issue=8|page=4}}</ref> The central character in \"Radio Silence\" is a [[personification]] of [[Radio Caroline]], a 1960s [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|British pirate radio station]].<ref name=\"Record8\"/>\n\n==Release history==\nThe album was released a total of five separate times. All five releases appeared on vinyl and cassette (though the cassette release for the fifth version is unconfirmed), but only the third and fifth resequencings appeared on CD, with each changing the order of the songs, replacing the album mixes with extended or single mixes and even adding and removing entire songs. In the case of \"Radio Silence\", a completely different recording with prominent guitars was the version used on the early US incarnations.\n\nThe first US version, issued by [[Columbia Records|Columbia-CBS]]'s CBS/Sony imprint, excised the instrumental \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" (loosely based on the [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|1972 Uruguayan plane crash]]) and added the two sides of Fagen's first single, \"Leipzig\" and \"Urges\". Additionally, Columbia swapped the original synthpop version of \"Radio Silence\" for a much more rock-oriented version that had previously only been available as a single B-side in the UK. Columbia also opted for the single edit of \"Airwaves\" and abandoned the original UK \"comic book\" cover in favour of a shot of Fagen on a stage during the production of [[Bertholt Brecht]]'s \"Galileo\". This image had previously been used as the cover of the \"Europa and the Pirate Twins\" single in the UK.\n\nWhen Fagen released the single \"She Blinded Me with Science\" backed by \"[[One of our Submarines]]\" in late 1982\u2014complete with a music video for the A-side\u2014Columbia saw a golden opportunity. They removed \"Urges\" and \"Leipzig\", added the extended version of \"Science\" (also known as the \"U.S. Mix\") and \"Submarines\", and changed the album's cover art back to its original \"comic book\" design. Columbia also swapped the full-length version of \"Windpower\" for the single version (with an edited intro and outro). The strategy worked, as ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' sold better and \"She Blinded Me with Science\" became a major hit, with constant radio and MTV airplay.\n\nIn 1983, the UK record label, Venice in Peril, followed suit and reissued the album with a similar track listing to the second US version. They opted for the short single version of \"Science\" but retained the full-length versions of \"Airwaves\" and \"Windpower\" and the original synthesizer-driven version of \"Radio Silence\", just as all three had appeared on the first UK edition. This is the edition that is widely available on CD to this day, on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe successive resequencings occurred largely because different territories preferred different mixes of songs to others; for example, the extended mix of \"Science\" was the version that became a hit in [[United States|America]] and thus the American cut of the album was swiftly resequenced to accommodate the tastes of that particular territory.\n\nA remastered \"Collector's Edition\" of ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' was released on 13 July 2009, complete with bonus tracks, personal sleeve notes and a DVD of the ''Live Wireless'' music video.\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===1982 First UK release: Venice in Peril CBS/Sony VIP 1001===\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side A\n| all_writing     = [[Thomas Dolby]], except where noted\n| title1          = Flying North\n| length1         = 3:50\n| title2          = Commercial Breakup\n| note2           = [[Thomas Dolby]], Tim Kerr\n| length2         = 4:15\n| title3          = Weightless\n| length3         = 3:45\n| title4          = [[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\n| length4         = 3:18\n| title5          = Windpower\n| length5         = 4:20\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side B\n| title1          = The Wreck of The Fairchild\n| length1         = 3:30\n| title2         = Airwaves\n| length2        = 5:12\n| title3         = Radio Silence\n| length3        = 3:43\n| title4         = Cloudburst at Shingle Street\n| length4        = 5:45\n}}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The original UK track listing (including its reappearance on the 2009 ''Collector's Edition'' CD) is the only place one can hear the progression of \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" into \"Airwaves\" and then into the synth version of \"Radio Silence.\" \"Fairchild\" concludes with the sound of various electronics, including a wave computer, which segues into the intro of \"Airwaves\" with no break.

A Southern England [[new town]] seat with volatile voting patterns, it was Conservative held between 1983 and 1997 until Labour easily gained it, but their winning margin in 2005 was small and the Conservatives gained the seat at the 2010 election.\n\nIts main predecessor, named first, was also a [[bellwether]] of the national result.  [[Shirley Williams]] has been the most prominent member, in fact the second [[frontbencher]] since 1974. She held it when she was a Secretary of State in government from 1974 until 1979, [[Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection]] and then [[Paymaster General]].  [[Barbara Follett (politician)|Barbara Follett]] achieved two ministerial roles from 2007 until 2010.\n\n== Constituency profile ==\nThe main town is known for its fast rail links to London and proximity to [[Luton Airport]] which accompanies a few headquarters of global businesses based in the seat.

McPartland]], a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]].{{#tag:ref|As with all constituencies, the constituency elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election at least every five years.|group= n}}\n\n==History==\nThe constituency was created in 1983 from parts of the seats of [[Hertford and Stevenage (UK Parliament constituency)|Hertford and Stevenage]], [[Hitchin (UK Parliament constituency)|Hitchin]], and [[East Hertfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Hertfordshire]]. A Southern England [[new town]] seat with volatile voting patterns, it was Conservative held between 1983 and 1997 until Labour easily gained it, but their winning margin in 2005 was small and the Conservatives gained the seat at the 2010 election.\n\nIts main predecessor, named first, was also a [[bellwether]] of the national result.  [[Shirley Williams]] has been the most prominent member, in fact the second [[frontbencher]] since 1974.

Represented in the [[United States]] and one of several branches across the world, they believe they follow biblical precedent for their doctrine and practices and only use examples from [[Early Christianity|the early Christian church]] as described in the [[New Testament]].\n\nMore broadly, the Restoration Movement was an evangelistic and Bible-based effort launched in various places around the world as several people sought a return to the original teachings and practices of the New Testament. Christian leaders including [[Robert Sandeman (theologian)|Robert Sandeman]], [[James O'Kelly]], [[Abner Jones]], [[Elias Smith]], Rice Haggard, [[Thomas Campbell (clergyman)|Thomas Campbell]], [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], [[Walter Scott (clergyman)|Walter Scott]], and [[Barton W. Stone]] were trailblazers of similar movements that impacted the eventual phenomenon known as the [[American Restoration Movement]].\n\nThe Restoration ideal was also similar and somewhat connected to earlier restoration efforts in Europe (such as those of [[John Glas]], Robert Haldane, and James Haldane), as well as Puritan movements in colonial America. Though differing somewhat in details, each group consisted of like-minded Christians who, although often independent of one another, had declared independence from their various denominations and the traditional [[creed]]s, seeking a fresh start to return to the doctrines and practices of the New Testament church. They did not see themselves as establishing a new church but rather sought \"the unification of all Christians in a single body patterned after the original church of the New Testament.\"<ref name=\"I Just Want to Be a Christian\">[[Rubel Shelly]], ''I Just Want to Be a Christian'', 20th Century Christian, Nashville, Tennessee 1984, {{ISBN|0-89098-021-7}}</ref>{{rp|54}} The names \"Church of Christ,\" \"Christian Church,\" and \"Disciples of Christ\" were adopted by the movement because they are biblically used, rather than denominational.\n\nPrior to the U.S. Religious Census of 1906, all congregations associated with the Restoration Movement had been reported together by the Census Bureau. But as the movement developed, tensions grew between those who emphasized unity and those who emphasized restoration, highlighting differences in the groups' underlying approaches to biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible in the church. In contrast, the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Christian Church]] may consider any practice not expressly forbidden.<ref name=\"McAlister & Tucker, 1975\" />{{rp|242\u2013247}}\n\nFor example, the Christian Church uses [[musical instrument]]s in [[Christian worship|worship]] (known as the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Christian Church]]), whereas the Churches of Christ believe ''[[a cappella|a&nbsp;cappella]]'' singing to be proper, although some Church of Christ congregations do use instruments. In addition, there was also disagreement over the appropriateness of organizational structures above the congregational level, such as those of missionary societies and funding orphanages.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Missionary Societies Controversy\" />\n\nThough not officially recognized as distinct movements until 1906, the separation of the Churches of Christ and the Christian Churches had been taking place gradually for decades.\n\nThe Restoration Movement was not a purely [[North America]]n phenomenon, and active [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]] efforts began in the 18th century.<ref>In a sense the Restoration Movement began in the [[United Kingdom]] before getting traction in America. See, ''e.g.'', [[Robert Haldane#Church and ministry|Robert Haldane's influence in Scotland]].</ref> There are now Churches of Christ in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Australia]], [[South America]], [[Central America]], and [[Churches of Christ in Europe|Europe]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{quote|Members of the church of Christ do not conceive of themselves as a new church started near the beginning of the 19th century.

[[Autonomy|autonomous]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Local church|congregations]] associated with one another through distinct beliefs and practices based on biblical examples. Represented in the [[United States]] and one of several branches across the world, they believe they follow biblical precedent for their doctrine and practices and only use examples from [[Early Christianity|the early Christian church]] as described in the [[New Testament]].\n\nMore broadly, the Restoration Movement was an evangelistic and Bible-based effort launched in various places around the world as several people sought a return to the original teachings and practices of the New Testament. Christian leaders including [[Robert Sandeman (theologian)|Robert Sandeman]], [[James O'Kelly]], [[Abner Jones]], [[Elias Smith]], Rice Haggard, [[Thomas Campbell (clergyman)|Thomas Campbell]], [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], [[Walter Scott (clergyman)|Walter Scott]], and [[Barton W. Stone]] were trailblazers of similar movements that impacted the eventual phenomenon known as the [[American Restoration Movement]].\n\nThe Restoration ideal was also similar and somewhat connected to earlier restoration efforts in Europe (such as those of [[John Glas]], Robert Haldane, and James Haldane), as well as Puritan movements in colonial America. Though differing somewhat in details, each group consisted of like-minded Christians who, although often independent of one another, had declared independence from their various denominations and the traditional [[creed]]s, seeking a fresh start to return to the doctrines and practices of the New Testament church. They did not see themselves as establishing a new church but rather sought \"the unification of all Christians in a single body patterned after the original church of the New Testament.\"<ref name=\"I Just Want to Be a Christian\">[[Rubel Shelly]], ''I Just Want to Be a Christian'', 20th Century Christian, Nashville, Tennessee 1984, {{ISBN|0-89098-021-7}}</ref>{{rp|54}} The names \"Church of Christ,\" \"Christian Church,\" and \"Disciples of Christ\" were adopted by the movement because they are biblically used, rather than denominational.\n\nPrior to the U.S. Religious Census of 1906, all congregations associated with the Restoration Movement had been reported together by the Census Bureau. But as the movement developed, tensions grew between those who emphasized unity and those who emphasized restoration, highlighting differences in the groups' underlying approaches to biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible in the church. In contrast, the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Christian Church]] may consider any practice not expressly forbidden.<ref name=\"McAlister & Tucker, 1975\" />{{rp|242\u2013247}}\n\nFor example, the Christian Church uses [[musical instrument]]s in [[Christian worship|worship]] (known as the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Christian Church]]), whereas the Churches of Christ believe ''[[a cappella|a&nbsp;cappella]]'' singing to be proper, although some Church of Christ congregations do use instruments. In addition, there was also disagreement over the appropriateness of organizational structures above the congregational level, such as those of missionary societies and funding orphanages.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Missionary Societies Controversy\" />\n\nThough not officially recognized as distinct movements until 1906, the separation of the Churches of Christ and the Christian Churches had been taking place gradually for decades.\n\nThe Restoration Movement was not a purely [[North America]]n phenomenon, and active [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]] efforts began in the 18th century.<ref>In a sense the Restoration Movement began in the [[United Kingdom]] before getting traction in America. See, ''e.g.'', [[Robert Haldane#Church and ministry|Robert Haldane's influence in Scotland]].</ref> There are now Churches of Christ in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Australia]], [[South America]], [[Central America]], and [[Churches of Christ in Europe|Europe]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{quote|Members of the church of Christ do not conceive of themselves as a new church started near the beginning of the 19th century.

Soul talks'' were held in student residences and involved prayer and sharing overseen by a leader who delegated authority over group members.

In the original script, the character of John Wick was written with \"a man in his mid-sixties\" to play the role, given the title character's fabled reputation as a revered and respected assassin.

{"title_page": "1928 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1928 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was its 19th. It was a very busy season, with ten representative fixtures including matches against the touring [[England national rugby league team|England]] team. The senior club season featured over 110 matches through various competitions and did not finish until late October when suburban cricket competitions had already begun.\n\n[[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] won the Senior A Championship for the first time under the [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] name, though they had won it twice before as [[North Shore Albions]], prior to the merger with Sunnyside. [[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the Roope Rooster Trophy for the first time. This was their first major rugby league trophy and they also went on to defeat Devonport to win the Stormont Shield. [[Grafton Athletic rugby league team|Grafton]] won the Senior B Grade competition with an undefeated season, though they were beaten in the promotion relegation match with [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] defeated [[Grafton Athletic rugby league team|Grafton]] in the Stallard Cup final which was the Senior B knockout competition. The season was notable for the number of teams which played sides from other areas. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]], [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]], [[Parnell rugby league club|Parnell]], and the [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote and Birkenhead Ramblers]] all played sides from north Auckland and the [[Waikato]].\n\nAt the annual general meeting of [[Auckland Rugby League]] it was noted that out of the 28 playing days during the 1927 season thirteen of them were played in wet weather however crowds were still good and they were happy with the growth of the game. It was also planned for further developments at [[Carlaw Park]] consisting of \u201cconveniences for ladies\u2026extra accommodation\u2026 for players, and three more dressing rooms\u201d at a cost of \u00a360. There was a lengthy discussion about [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie's]] application to join the A Grade. They had won the B Grade competition and defeated the last placed Grafton from A Grade.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Governing Body/Report on the Past Season\n| page = 17\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19907\n| date = 1928-03-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280328.2.154\n| accessdate = 2019-09-29}}</ref> The annual general meeting was held at the [[Auckland Chamber of Commerce]] on Swanson Street.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Activities/Mew Officers Elected/Plans for Coming Season\n| page = 15\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19920\n| date = 1928-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280413.2.165.5\n| accessdate = 2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\nThe Management Committee announced at the midway mark of the senior club season that the Thistle Cup would be awarded to the A or B grade team that had scored the most points in the second round of competition.

During the season [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] opened a new field at Stafford Park which is still in existence adjacent to State Highway 1 just north of the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]]. Devonport also had a deputation present at the [[Devonport Borough Council]] meeting on 10 May to ask about the shortage of grounds in the area. The club asked for permission to use some of the spare cricket grounds for matches. The Mayor, Mr. E. Aldridge said there would be a ground available at Stanley Bay.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Devonport Borough/Shortage of Sports Areas\n| page = 12\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19943\n| date = 1928-05-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280511.2.133\n| accessdate = 2019-10-01}}</ref>\n\n===Rule Changes===\nAfter Round 5 the issue of time keeping in matches at [[Carlaw Park]] was raised at the weekly Management Committee meeting. The bell had been rung in the match between [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and Devonport at [[Carlaw Park]] before the ball was dead which was against previously arranged rules. Agreement could not be reached on whether the timekeeper or referee should be responsible for calling time. In the end it was decided that official timekeepers should attend the Referees\u2019 Association meeting for instructions.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Management Committee/The Calling of Time/Proposed Match for June 4\n| page = 13\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIX| issue=121\n| date = 1928-05-24\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19280524.2.126.3\n| accessdate = 2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nIt was noted that the dead ball area on both fields at [[Carlaw Park]] had been reduced from 12 yards to 8yards in accordance with the laws of Rugby League.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Senior Matches/Individual Scorers\u2019 List/Taylor Leads the Way\n| page = 16\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19971\n| date = 1928-06-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280613.2.177.2\n| accessdate = 2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nA rule change came into effect during the season after the annual meeting of the [[Rugby Football League|English Rugby League]]. They decided that no forward at any time in the scrum could have both feet off the ground. Also forwards could not drop to one knee to attempt to hook the ball. The game in New Zealand would adhere to these rules.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Amendments to Scrum Laws\n| page = 15\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19983\n| date = 1928-06-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280627.2.148.4\n| accessdate = 2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1927 Auckland Rugby League season|1927]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=19th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1928}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1929 Auckland Rugby League season|1929]]}}\n    {{end}}\n\n==Monteith Shield (First Grade Championship)==\n===Final A Grade Standings===\n{|\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]]\n|12||9||0||3||224||149||'''18'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond Rovers]]\n|12||7||1||4||143||132||'''15'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|12||7||0||5||143||138||'''14'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]]\n|12||5||2||5||154||144||'''12'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]\n|12||5||1||6||154||170||'''11'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|12||4||0||8||144||164||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]\n|12||3||0||9||102||162||'''6'''\n|-\n|}\n\n===First Grade A Division Fixtures===\nThe opening weekend of the season saw 4 first grade matches played at [[Carlaw Park]], though these matches were not part of the competition. The round was dedicated to Richard Stack (commonly known as Dick Stack) of the [[Newton Rangers]] who had suffered a broken leg in the Stormont Shield final the previous season and the injury was so bad [[Auckland Hospital]] staff were forced to amputate it. This mean that he was unable to continue in his career and so the league fundraised for him to start him in his own business. \u00a3500 was taken at the gates for him. The day also featured a program of boxing matches with the prizes donated back to Stack. After all the accounts were balanced it was worked out that the fund for Stack totalled \u00a3610 12/3.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Stack Benefit/Sum of \u00a3610 for League Football Player/A Pleasing Effort\n| page = 3\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIX| issue=152\n| date = 1928-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19280629.2.15\n| accessdate = 2019-09-10}}</ref>\n\nRound 1 saw the newly promoted [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] upset [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]]. The season was ceremonially kicked off by Miss Peggy Rhodes, daughter of George Rhodes, the chairman of [[Auckland Rugby League]] Management Committee.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the first ground of Senior A Grade matches ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' published for the first time the individual points tallies of all the point scorers. This was the first time this had been done. Taylor of [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] led the standings with 46 points, L. Scott of [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] had 33, while [[Craddock Dufty|Dufty]] of [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] was third with 26 points.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Senior Matches/Individual Scorers\u2019 List/Taylor Leads the Way\n| page = 16\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19971\n| date = 1928-06-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280613.2.177.2\n| accessdate = 2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nIt was decided by [[Auckland Rugby League]] after the 3rd round that they would no longer play curtain-raiser matches by Senior A Grade teams at 1:30pm. This was due to players having difficulty getting to the ground on time as they often worked on Saturdays and had to travel from the outer suburbs. A recent example had been the [[Newton Rangers]] v [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] match where several [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] players had arrived late and the match was so late kicking off that the second half lasted only 25 minutes instead of 40.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Stack Benefit Fund/Next Saturday\u2019s Attraction/Devonport and Richmond\n| page = 16\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXV| issue=19947\n| date = 1928-05-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19280516.2.171.2\n| accessdate = 2019-10-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Round 6 match between [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] was played on the Kings Birthday holiday as part of the celebrations.\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | 1928 First Grade Results\n|-\n|\n!

It was a very busy season, with ten representative fixtures including matches against the touring [[England national rugby league team|England]] team. The senior club season featured over 110 matches through various competitions and did not finish until late October when suburban cricket competitions had already begun.\n\n[[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] won the Senior A Championship for the first time under the [[North Shore Albions|Devonport]] name, though they had won it twice before as [[North Shore Albions]], prior to the merger with Sunnyside. [[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the Roope Rooster Trophy for the first time. This was their first major rugby league trophy and they also went on to defeat Devonport to win the Stormont Shield. [[Grafton Athletic rugby league team|Grafton]] won the Senior B Grade competition with an undefeated season, though they were beaten in the promotion relegation match with [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. [[Point Chevalier Pirates|Point Chevalier]] defeated [[Grafton Athletic rugby league team|Grafton]] in the Stallard Cup final which was the Senior B knockout competition. The season was notable for the number of teams which played sides from other areas. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]], [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]], [[Parnell rugby league club|Parnell]], and the [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote and Birkenhead Ramblers]] all played sides from north Auckland and the [[Waikato]].\n\nAt the annual general meeting of [[Auckland Rugby League]] it was noted that out of the 28 playing days during the 1927 season thirteen of them were played in wet weather however crowds were still good and they were happy with the growth of the game. It was also planned for further developments at [[Carlaw Park]] consisting of \u201cconveniences for ladies\u2026extra accommodation\u2026 for players, and three more dressing rooms\u201d at a cost of \u00a360. There was a lengthy discussion about [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie's]] application to join the A Grade.

During the season [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] opened a new field at Stafford Park which is still in existence adjacent to State Highway 1 just north of the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]]. Devonport also had a deputation present at the [[Devonport Borough Council]] meeting on 10 May to ask about the shortage of grounds in the area. The club asked for permission to use some of the spare cricket grounds for matches. The Mayor, Mr. E.

This mean that he was unable to continue in his career and so the league fundraised for him to start him in his own business. \u00a3500 was taken at the gates for him. The day also featured a program of boxing matches with the prizes donated back to Stack.

It has approximately 3,000 students, from [[preschool]] to ''[[CPGE|classes pr\u00e9paratoires]]'' (classes to prepare students for entrance to the [[elite]] [[Grandes \u00e9coles]] such as Ecole Polytechnique, [[Centrale Paris]], [[ESSEC Business school]] or HEC Paris), and is the largest private school in France.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Stanislas is considered like one of the most prestigious and elitist French schools <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/article/les-lycees-d-elite-les-plus-primes-au-concours-general_5e9787d6-85b4-11e8-a149-d730e388780e/|title=Les 10 lyc\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9lite les plus prim\u00e9s au Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral 2018|last=Figaro|first=le|date=|website=Le Figaro Etudiant|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>.

Under contract with the French government, it offers curricula identical to those of public education, also offering religious education on specific days - originally Wednesdays, since the [[Jules Ferry Laws]] of 1882, but now Saturdays.\nIn 1822, its formal name was declared, after the Polish King [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski]], the great-grandfather of the King of France [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], whose second forename was \"Stanislas\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stanislas.fr/quelques-mots-dhistoire|title=Quelques mots d\u2019histoire|date=2018-02-06|website=Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas Paris - Ecole maternelle - coll\u00e8ge - lyc\u00e9e - pr\u00e9pa|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\nSince 1903 Coll\u00e8ge has been the property of a [[S.A. (corporation)|S.A.]] corporation founded by former alumni. As of 2002, the school's director is Daniel Chapellier.\n\nPrivate education in France was indirectly, yet deeply, affected by the strong [[anti-clerical]] movement that inspired French politicians throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beginning with the [[Concordat of 1801]]. As a result, the Coll\u00e8ge almost disappeared but ultimately was kept open by the efforts of former alumni. Even today, it remains isolated from [[Paris]]' foremost public [[Lyc\u00e9es]], although Stanislas' \"[[Classes Pr\u00e9paratoires]]\" ultimately leads its students to the same [[Grandes \u00c9coles]] as its rivals.\n\n== Famous alumni ==\nThe following are notable people associated with Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas de Paris.

It has approximately 3,000 students, from [[preschool]] to ''[[CPGE|classes pr\u00e9paratoires]]'' (classes to prepare students for entrance to the [[elite]] [[Grandes \u00e9coles]] such as Ecole Polytechnique, [[Centrale Paris]], [[ESSEC Business school]] or HEC Paris), and is the largest private school in France.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Stanislas is considered like one of the most prestigious and elitist French schools <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/article/les-lycees-d-elite-les-plus-primes-au-concours-general_5e9787d6-85b4-11e8-a149-d730e388780e/|title=Les 10 lyc\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9lite les plus prim\u00e9s au Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral 2018|last=Figaro|first=le|date=|website=Le Figaro Etudiant|language=fr|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>.

Under contract with the French government, it offers curricula identical to those of public education, also offering religious education on specific days - originally Wednesdays, since the [[Jules Ferry Laws]] of 1882, but now Saturdays.\nIn 1822, its formal name was declared, after the Polish King [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski]], the great-grandfather of the King of France [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], whose second forename was \"Stanislas\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stanislas.fr/quelques-mots-dhistoire|title=Quelques mots d\u2019histoire|date=2018-02-06|website=Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas Paris - Ecole maternelle - coll\u00e8ge - lyc\u00e9e - pr\u00e9pa|language=fr|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\nSince 1903 Coll\u00e8ge has been the property of a [[S.A. (corporation)|S.A.]] corporation founded by former alumni. As of 2002, the school's director is Daniel Chapellier.\n\nPrivate education in France was indirectly, yet deeply, affected by the strong [[anti-clerical]] movement that inspired French politicians throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beginning with the [[Concordat of 1801]]. As a result, the Coll\u00e8ge almost disappeared but ultimately was kept open by the efforts of former alumni.
