These are the localities of Kale above Vranjska Banja and Gradi\u0161te in Korbevac (\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b, \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0447\u0438\u045b et al. 2004). Judging by surface findings, the case is the same with Gradi\u0161te in Prvonek east of Vranjska Banja. The general impression is that all these forts are single-layered \u2013 that they were built and demolished at the same time. The same roofing tiles on all three sites, the thinness of the cultural layer and the similarity of pottery show this. The absence of animal bones is notable. Kale was destroyed in a fire, whereas Gradi\u0161te conveys the impression of having been abandoned. The found pottery fragments are similar to others from North Illyricum, dated to the second and third quarter of the 6th century; there is no such pottery in the strata of the time of the reconstruction of Emperor Mauritius (\u0408\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b 1981: 141-147; Bjelajac 1990: 163-168). There are no data for the duration of other forts around Vranje, except for Kale at Klinovac, where a hoard was found with the latest coins from 544 (\u0413aj \u2013 \u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b 1973: 25-32). According to the inventory of the National Museum in Vranje, Markovo Kale was used in the 6th century, and later finds are not known. Kale at Veliki Trnovac to the South of Vranje (\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0432 1986) seems to have been the centre of this area in the early Byzantine period, judging by the basilica, undoubtedly episcopal, with rich marble decoration, which is also in Vranje; there are no data suggesting its usage in the late 6th or early 7th century.-->}}</ref>\n\nThe first written mention of Vranje comes from [[Byzantine]] chronicle ''[[Alexiad]]'' by [[Anna Comnena]] (1083\u20131153), in which it is mentioned how Serbian ruler [[Vukan, Grand Prince of Serbia|Vukan]] in 1093, as part of his conquests, reached Vranje and conquered it, however only shortly, as he was forced to retreat from the powerful Byzantines.{{sfn|Bazi\u0107|2008|p=254}} The city name stems from the Old Serbian word ''vran'' (\"black\").<!----> The second mention is from 1193, when Vranje was temporarily taken by Serbian Grand Prince [[Stefan Nemanja]] from the Byzantines.{{sfn|Bazi\u0107|2008|p=254}} Vranje definitely entered the Serbian state in 1207 when it was conquered by Grand Prince [[Stefan the First-Crowned|Stefan Nemanji\u0107]].{{sfn|Bazi\u0107|2008|p=254}}\n\nSome time before 1306, ''[[tep\u010dija]]'' [[Kuzma (tep\u010dija)|Kuzma]] was given the governorship of Vranje (a ''[[\u017eupa]]'', \"county\", including the town and neighbouring villages), serving King [[Stefan Milutin]].{{sfn|Blagojevi\u0107|2001|p=26}} At the same time, ''[[kaznac]]'' [[Miroslav (kaznac)|Miroslav]] held the surroundings of Vranje.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0448\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0448\u0438\u045b|title=\u041b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u045a\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0459\u0430: \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkRSAQAAIAAJ|year=2010|publisher=\u0417\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u045f\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435|isbn=978-86-17-16604-3|page=76}}</ref> Next, ''[[kaznac]]'' [[Baldovin]] (fl. 1325\u201345) received the province around Vranje, serving King [[Stefan De\u010danski]].<ref>Starinar 1936, p. 72: \"... \u0441\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u043b\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u041a\u043d\u0435\u0437 \u0411\u0430\u043b\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d je \u0438\u0437 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0430 \u0421\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0423\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430 III \u0414\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 (1321 \u2014 1331). \u041f\u0440\u0435 \u045a\u0435\u0433\u0430 je, \u0438\u0437\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u0431\u0438\u043e y \u0412\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043f\u0447\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u0437\u043c\u0430, a \u043f\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0446 \u041c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 (\u0441\u0432\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430\u0458 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0438 ce \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u045a\u0435 y ...\"</ref> Next, ''[[\u017eupan]]'' Malju\u0161at, Baldovin's son, held the ''\u017eupa'' of Vranje.{{sfn|Blagojevi\u0107|2001|pp=41, 52}} By the time of the proclamation of the [[Serbian Empire]], holders with the title ''[[kefalija]]'' are present in Vranje, among other cities.{{sfn|Blagojevi\u0107|2001|p=252}} During the [[fall of the Serbian Empire]], Vranje was part of [[Uglje\u0161a Vlatkovi\u0107]]'s possessions, which also included [[Pre\u0161evo]] and [[Kumanovo]].

The [[White Bridge]] is a symbol of the city and is called \"most ljubavi\" (lovers' bridge) after the tale of the forbidden love between the Muslim girl Aj\u0161a and Christian Stojan that resulted in the father killing the couple. After that, he built the bridge where he had killed her and had the story inscribed in Ottoman Arabic. The 11th-century [[Markovo Kale]] fortress is in the north of the city.

The best known music is from the theater piece with music, ''Ko\u0161tana'', by Bora Stankovi\u0107. This original music style has been renewed recently by taking different, specific, and more oriental form, with the contribution of rich brass instruments. It is played particularly by the Vranje [[Romani people]].\n\nVranje is the seat of [[P\u010dinja District]] and, as such, is a major center for cultural events in the district.

The Roman fortresses in the Vranje region were abandoned during the [[Huns|Hun]] attacks in 539\u2013544 AD; these include the localities of Kale at [[Vranjska Banja]], Gradi\u0161te in [[Korbevac]] and Gradi\u0161te in [[Prvonek]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Jankovi\u0107|first=\u0110or\u0111e|title=The Slavs in the 6th century North Illyricum|url=http://www.rastko.rs/arheologija/delo/13047|work=Projekat Rastko|accessdate=29 September 2013|location=Belgrade|language=Serbian|quote=<!--Trial excavations of early Byzantine forts, conducted around Vranje in 2003, show that they were abandoned as early as in the course of the 6th century. These are the localities of Kale above Vranjska Banja and Gradi\u0161te in Korbevac (\u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b, \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0447\u0438\u045b et al. 2004). Judging by surface findings, the case is the same with Gradi\u0161te in Prvonek east of Vranjska Banja. The general impression is that all these forts are single-layered \u2013 that they were built and demolished at the same time. The same roofing tiles on all three sites, the thinness of the cultural layer and the similarity of pottery show this. The absence of animal bones is notable. Kale was destroyed in a fire, whereas Gradi\u0161te conveys the impression of having been abandoned. The found pottery fragments are similar to others from North Illyricum, dated to the second and third quarter of the 6th century; there is no such pottery in the strata of the time of the reconstruction of Emperor Mauritius (\u0408\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b 1981: 141-147; Bjelajac 1990: 163-168).

According to the inventory of the National Museum in Vranje, Markovo Kale was used in the 6th century, and later finds are not known. Kale at Veliki Trnovac to the South of Vranje (\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0432 1986) seems to have been the centre of this area in the early Byzantine period, judging by the basilica, undoubtedly episcopal, with rich marble decoration, which is also in Vranje; there are no data suggesting its usage in the late 6th or early 7th century.-->}}</ref>\n\nThe first written mention of Vranje comes from [[Byzantine]] chronicle ''[[Alexiad]]'' by [[Anna Comnena]] (1083\u20131153), in which it is mentioned how Serbian ruler [[Vukan, Grand Prince of Serbia|Vukan]] in 1093, as part of his conquests, reached Vranje and conquered it, however only shortly, as he was forced to retreat from the powerful Byzantines.{{sfn|Bazi\u0107|2008|p=254}} The city name stems from the Old Serbian word ''vran'' (\"black\").<!----> The second mention is from 1193, when Vranje was temporarily taken by Serbian Grand Prince [[Stefan Nemanja]] from the Byzantines.{{sfn|Bazi\u0107|2008|p=254}} Vranje definitely entered the Serbian state in 1207 when it was conquered by Grand Prince [[Stefan the First-Crowned|Stefan Nemanji\u0107]].{{sfn|Bazi\u0107|2008|p=254}}\n\nSome time before 1306, ''[[tep\u010dija]]'' [[Kuzma (tep\u010dija)|Kuzma]] was given the governorship of Vranje (a ''[[\u017eupa]]'', \"county\", including the town and neighbouring villages), serving King [[Stefan Milutin]].{{sfn|Blagojevi\u0107|2001|p=26}} At the same time, ''[[kaznac]]'' [[Miroslav (kaznac)|Miroslav]] held the surroundings of Vranje.<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0448\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0448\u0438\u045b|title=\u041b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u045a\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0459\u0430: \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkRSAQAAIAAJ|year=2010|publisher=\u0417\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u045f\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435|isbn=978-86-17-16604-3|page=76}}</ref> Next, ''[[kaznac]]'' [[Baldovin]] (fl. 1325\u201345) received the province around Vranje, serving King [[Stefan De\u010danski]].<ref>Starinar 1936, p. 72: \"... \u0441\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u043b\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u041a\u043d\u0435\u0437 \u0411\u0430\u043b\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d je \u0438\u0437 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0430 \u0421\u0442\u0435\u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0423\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430 III \u0414\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 (1321 \u2014 1331). \u041f\u0440\u0435 \u045a\u0435\u0433\u0430 je, \u0438\u0437\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430, \u0431\u0438\u043e y \u0412\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043f\u0447\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u0437\u043c\u0430, a \u043f\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0446 \u041c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 (\u0441\u0432\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430\u0458 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0438 ce \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u045a\u0435 y ...\"</ref> Next, ''[[\u017eupan]]'' Malju\u0161at, Baldovin's son, held the ''\u017eupa'' of Vranje.{{sfn|Blagojevi\u0107|2001|pp=41, 52}} By the time of the proclamation of the [[Serbian Empire]], holders with the title ''[[kefalija]]'' are present in Vranje, among other cities.{{sfn|Blagojevi\u0107|2001|p=252}} During the [[fall of the Serbian Empire]], Vranje was part of [[Uglje\u0161a Vlatkovi\u0107]]'s possessions, which also included [[Pre\u0161evo]] and [[Kumanovo]].

The [[White Bridge]] is a symbol of the city and is called \"most ljubavi\" (lovers' bridge) after the tale of the forbidden love between the Muslim girl Aj\u0161a and Christian Stojan that resulted in the father killing the couple. After that, he built the bridge where he had killed her and had the story inscribed in Ottoman Arabic. The 11th-century [[Markovo Kale]] fortress is in the north of the city. The city has traditional Balkan and Ottoman architecture.\n\nThe well-known theater play ''[[Ko\u0161tana]]'' by [[Borisav Stankovi\u0107|Bora Stankovi\u0107]] is set in Vranje.\n\nVranje is famous for its popular, old music, lively and melancholic at the same time. The best known music is from the theater piece with music, ''Ko\u0161tana'', by Bora Stankovi\u0107. This original music style has been renewed recently by taking different, specific, and more oriental form, with the contribution of rich brass instruments. It is played particularly by the Vranje [[Romani people]].\n\nVranje is the seat of [[P\u010dinja District]] and, as such, is a major center for cultural events in the district. Most notable annual events are Borina nedelja, Stari dani, Dani karanfila (in [[Vranjska Banja]]), etc.\n\nVranje lies close to [[Besna Kobila]] mountain and Vranjska Banja, locations with high potential that are underdeveloped.

Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled ''Bush'') to Pearson's right-hand man, Raymond, for \u00a320,000,000.\n\nBorn in poverty in the United States, Pearson won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Oxford University]], where he began selling marijuana to fellow students before dropping out and building up his criminal enterprise by violence. He plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger for $400,000,000 so he can retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind. Pearson shows Berger one of the labs where he grows his cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords, who need cash for the upkeep of their [[English country house|stately homes]]. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye, an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is then raided by amateur [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] fighters and aspiring YouTubers \"The Toddlers\" who overpower the lab's guards, steal a van-load of marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters' trainer, known only as Coach, orders them to delete the video and is horrified when he discovers that the cannabis belongs to Pearson.\n\nPearson begins transferring his cannabis plants out of the estates. He also agrees to bring home Pressfield's wayward daughter Laura. Raymond retrieves Laura from a [[council estate]] where she is living with several other addicts. However, in a brawl with her flatmates one of Raymond's men accidentally pushes Aslan, a young Russian man, out of the window to his death. Laura later dies of a heroin overdose. Coach visits Raymond, apologises for his students' actions, and offers his services as penance. Coach has captured Phuc, a henchman of Dry Eye's who had informed Coach's crew about the lab location, although Phuc is accidentally killed during a botched escape attempt when he jumps off a balcony but lands into the path of an oncoming train. Pearson threatens Lord George for going after his lab, and destroys one of his heroin labs in retaliation. George chastises Dry Eye for his insubordination in attacking Pearson and offering to buy him out; George nods to a henchman to execute Dry Eye, but the man executes George instead.\n\nUnknown to Pearson, Dry Eye is in league with Berger, who had wanted Pearson's business disrupted to reduce the price. Dry Eye has taken Lord George's place and still hopes to take Pearson's empire for himself. Dry Eye tries to kidnap Rosalind, who kills Dry Eye's men before she runs out of bullets in her two-shot [[derringer]]. Raymond kills an assassin sent to kill Pearson; the two rush to Rosalind and Pearson kills Dry Eye as he is about to rape her. Fletcher ends his story and Raymond orders him to leave his house.\n\nFletcher has merely confirmed Pearson's suspicions about the link between Dry Eye and Berger. Raymond orders Coach's students to capture Big Dave. They drug him and film him [[Zoophilia|having sex with a pig]], threatening to post it online unless he drops his investigation. Pearson and Berger meet up again in a frozen fish plant, actually a cover for Pearson's European distribution operation. Berger drops his offer to $130,000,000, on account of the recent disruptions it has experienced, but Pearson reveals his knowledge of Berger's plan, shows him Dry Eye's frozen body and tells him he is keeping his business. Pearson forces Berger inside a refrigerator, where he will freeze to death unless he transfers $270,000,000 compensation and, for the assault on Rosalind, cuts \"a [[pound of flesh]]\" from his own body.\n\nFletcher approaches Raymond again for his payment, but Raymond reveals that he was tailing Fletcher all along. The fighters have stolen his stashes of evidence after Raymond placed a tracker on him during their last encounter. Fletcher reveals that he has also sold info to Aslan's father, a [[Russian oligarch]] and former KGB agent. The assassin that Raymond earlier killed was one of the Russians. Coach kills two Russian hitmen sent to kill Raymond, while Fletcher escapes in the chaos. Pearson is kidnapped by two other Russians, but they are quickly ambushed by Coach's students who want to \"solve Coach's problem\". They assault the car with bullets, killing the Russians and allowing Pearson to escape. Later, Fletcher decides to pitch the story as a film to [[Miramax]].

Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled ''Bush'') to Pearson's right-hand man, Raymond, for \u00a320,000,000.\n\nBorn in poverty in the United States, Pearson won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Oxford University]], where he began selling marijuana to fellow students before dropping out and building up his criminal enterprise by violence. He plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger for $400,000,000 so he can retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind. Pearson shows Berger one of the labs where he grows his cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords, who need cash for the upkeep of their [[English country house|stately homes]]. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye, an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is then raided by amateur [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] fighters and aspiring YouTubers \"The Toddlers\" who overpower the lab's guards, steal a van-load of marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters' trainer, known only as Coach, orders them to delete the video and is horrified when he discovers that the cannabis belongs to Pearson.\n\nPearson begins transferring his cannabis plants out of the estates. He also agrees to bring home Pressfield's wayward daughter Laura. Raymond retrieves Laura from a [[council estate]] where she is living with several other addicts. However, in a brawl with her flatmates one of Raymond's men accidentally pushes Aslan, a young Russian man, out of the window to his death. Laura later dies of a heroin overdose. Coach visits Raymond, apologises for his students' actions, and offers his services as penance. Coach has captured Phuc, a henchman of Dry Eye's who had informed Coach's crew about the lab location, although Phuc is accidentally killed during a botched escape attempt when he jumps off a balcony but lands into the path of an oncoming train. Pearson threatens Lord George for going after his lab, and destroys one of his heroin labs in retaliation. George chastises Dry Eye for his insubordination in attacking Pearson and offering to buy him out; George nods to a henchman to execute Dry Eye, but the man executes George instead.\n\nUnknown to Pearson, Dry Eye is in league with Berger, who had wanted Pearson's business disrupted to reduce the price. Dry Eye has taken Lord George's place and still hopes to take Pearson's empire for himself. Dry Eye tries to kidnap Rosalind, who kills Dry Eye's men before she runs out of bullets in her two-shot [[derringer]]. Raymond kills an assassin sent to kill Pearson; the two rush to Rosalind and Pearson kills Dry Eye as he is about to rape her. Fletcher ends his story and Raymond orders him to leave his house.\n\nFletcher has merely confirmed Pearson's suspicions about the link between Dry Eye and Berger. Raymond orders Coach's students to capture Big Dave. They drug him and film him [[Zoophilia|having sex with a pig]], threatening to post it online unless he drops his investigation. Pearson and Berger meet up again in a frozen fish plant, actually a cover for Pearson's European distribution operation. Berger drops his offer to $130,000,000, on account of the recent disruptions it has experienced, but Pearson reveals his knowledge of Berger's plan, shows him Dry Eye's frozen body and tells him he is keeping his business. Pearson forces Berger inside a refrigerator, where he will freeze to death unless he transfers $270,000,000 compensation and, for the assault on Rosalind, cuts \"a [[pound of flesh]]\" from his own body.\n\nFletcher approaches Raymond again for his payment, but Raymond reveals that he was tailing Fletcher all along. The fighters have stolen his stashes of evidence after Raymond placed a tracker on him during their last encounter. Fletcher reveals that he has also sold info to Aslan's father, a [[Russian oligarch]] and former KGB agent. The assassin that Raymond earlier killed was one of the Russians. Coach kills two Russian hitmen sent to kill Raymond, while Fletcher escapes in the chaos. Pearson is kidnapped by two other Russians, but they are quickly ambushed by Coach's students who want to \"solve Coach's problem\". They assault the car with bullets, killing the Russians and allowing Pearson to escape. Later, Fletcher decides to pitch the story as a film to [[Miramax]]. After his meeting, he gets into a cab only to realise that Raymond is the driver. Upon learning of Fletcher's capture, Pearson and Rosalind return to their cannabis empire and celebrate in each other's company.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Michael 'Mickey' Pearson\n* [[Charlie Hunnam]] as Raymond Smith\n* [[Henry Golding]] as Dry Eye\n* [[Michelle Dockery]] as Rosalind Pearson\n* [[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]] as Matthew Berger\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Coach\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Fletcher\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Big Dave\n* Chidi Ajufo as Bunny\n* [[Jason Wong]] as Phuc\n* Brittany Ashworth as Ruby\n* [[Samuel West]] as Lord Pressfield\n* [[Eliot Sumner]] as Laura Pressfield\n* [[Lyne Ren\u00e9e]] as Jackie\n* [[Chris Evangelou]] as Primetime\n* [[Franz Drameh]] as Benny\n* [[Bugzy Malone]] as Ernie\n* [[Tom Wu]] as Lord George\n* [[John Dagleish]] as Hammy\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIt was announced in May 2018 that [[Guy Ritchie]] would write and direct ''The Gentlemen'', a film that would be in the same spirit as his earlier ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' and ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]''.
