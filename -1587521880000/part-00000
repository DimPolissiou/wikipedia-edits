The sixth was the Uxbridge Agricultural Society (1859\u20131864). Most of these small libraries were subscription libraries that required dues and assessments.\n\nNone of these were free to the public so in 1873 voters of the town passed 4 articles and six trustees were elected in 1874. They met April 18, 1874 to organize themselves and the Uxbridge Free Public Library. It opened in the FW Barnes jewellery store on South Main Street on January 20, 1875. After five crowded years they moved into the Town Hall. Fourteen years later it again outgrew itself. On June 20, 1894 in the Town Hall came the Proceedings and  Dedication of the Thayer Memorial building. Edward Carrington Thayer, a local business man and banker, built it in memory of his parents, Joseph and Chloe Taft Thayer, and as a gift to the town of Uxbridge. It became home to the Uxbridge Free Public Library.\n[[File:Edward Carrington Thayer.JPG|thumb|Edward Carrington Thayer]]\n\nThe building was designed by [[Fuller & Delano]] of Worcester as architects and the building contract to Urgel Jacques of Worcester. Thayer spent $28,000 for the building, $4,000 for the land and $1,500 for furnishings, for a total of $33,500.

The sixth was the Uxbridge Agricultural Society (1859\u20131864). Most of these small libraries were subscription libraries that required dues and assessments.\n\nNone of these were free to the public so in 1873 voters of the town passed 4 articles and six trustees were elected in 1874. They met April 18, 1874 to organize themselves and the Uxbridge Free Public Library. It opened in the FW Barnes jewellery store on South Main Street on January 20, 1875. After five crowded years they moved into the Town Hall. Fourteen years later it again outgrew itself. On June 20, 1894 in the Town Hall came the Proceedings and  Dedication of the Thayer Memorial building. Edward Carrington Thayer, a local business man and banker, built it in memory of his parents, Joseph and Chloe Taft Thayer, and as a gift to the town of Uxbridge. It became home to the Uxbridge Free Public Library.\n[[File:Edward Carrington Thayer.JPG|thumb|Edward Carrington Thayer]]\n\nThe building was designed by [[Fuller & Delano]] of Worcester as architects and the building contract to Urgel Jacques of Worcester. Thayer spent $28,000 for the building, $4,000 for the land and $1,500 for furnishings, for a total of $33,500.

After moving to [[San Diego]] in 1992, Hoppus's sister introduced him to [[Tom DeLonge]], and together with drummer [[Scott Raynor]], they formed the band Blink-182.

Completed in 1905, it is one of the small town's few buildings exhibiting architectural sophistication, in this case the Arts and Crafts style.  The building currently houses both the library and the town post office.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2018.<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==Description and history==\nThe Tyringham Library occupies a prominent position in the small town center, at the western corner of Main and Jerusalem Roads.  It is a single-story masonry structure, built out of rough-cut fieldstone and covered by a hip roof finished in terra cotta tiles.  A large square fieldstone chimney rises from the roof peak.  The main entrances are set in corner recesses, a stone post supporting the roof corners.  A wooden entablature encircles the building below the roof line.  The building interior is functionally divided so that one third now houses the post office, and the other two thirds house the library.  The library retains many original finishes and furnishings, including a large fireplace, window seats, handmade oak shelving, and Mission style seating.<ref name=MACRIS>{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=TYR.42|title=MACRIS inventory record for Tyringham Library|accessdate=2018-01-18}}</ref>\n\nPrior to construction of this building, Tyringham's library was essentially transitory in nature, although the town did pay its librarian a small stipend.

Completed in 1905, it is one of the small town's few buildings exhibiting architectural sophistication, in this case the Arts and Crafts style.  The building currently houses both the library and the town post office.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2018.<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==Description and history==\nThe Tyringham Library occupies a prominent position in the small town center, at the western corner of Main and Jerusalem Roads.  It is a single-story masonry structure, built out of rough-cut fieldstone and covered by a hip roof finished in terra cotta tiles.  A large square fieldstone chimney rises from the roof peak.  The main entrances are set in corner recesses, a stone post supporting the roof corners.  A wooden entablature encircles the building below the roof line.  The building interior is functionally divided so that one third now houses the post office, and the other two thirds house the library.  The library retains many original finishes and furnishings, including a large fireplace, window seats, handmade oak shelving, and Mission style seating.<ref name=MACRIS>{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=TYR.42|title=MACRIS inventory record for Tyringham Library|accessdate=2018-01-18}}</ref>\n\nPrior to construction of this building, Tyringham's library was essentially transitory in nature, although the town did pay its librarian a small stipend.
