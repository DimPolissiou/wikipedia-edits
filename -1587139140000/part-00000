Announced on April 15, 2020, the iPhone SE serves as a successor to both the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone SE]] and the [[iPhone 8]].\n\nSimilar to the first-generation SE (which shared the dimensions and form factor of the [[iPhone 5S]] but used the processor and camera of the newer [[iPhone 6S]]), the second-generation SE is a new model of a previous iPhone form factor (specifically, the iPhone 8) with hardware components from the iPhone 11 lineup (including the [[Apple A13]] processor), retaining a physical home button with [[Touch ID]] rather than the [[iPhone X]] form factor (with an edge-to-edge display, gesture navigation, and [[Face ID]]).\n\nWith a starting price of $399 in the United States, the iPhone SE is the cheapest iPhone Apple makes, significantly undercutting the iPhone 11 models. Pre-orders of the SE began on April 17, 2020, while deliveries are due to commence on April 24.\n\n== History ==\nA successor to the first-generation iPhone SE has been rumored since 2017, a year after the device was released.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/22/iphone-se-2-release-date-first-half-2018/ |title = iPhone SE 2 Again Rumored to Launch in First Half of 2018 |website = MacRumors |language = en |access-date = April 15, 2020 }}</ref> The phone also has other rumored names: '''iPhone SE 2 / iPhone SE2''', '''iPhone''', '''iPhone SE (2020)''', and closer to its launch, '''iPhone 9''', due to design similarities with the iPhone 8.\n\nIn March 2020, cases for the phone were reportedly being shipped to [[Best Buy]],<ref name=\"9to5mac\">{{Cite web |url = https://9to5mac.com/2020/03/30/iphone-9-case-inventory-best-buy/ |title = iPhone 9 case inventory arriving at Best Buy, other retailers with April 5 merchandising date |last = Miller |first = Chance |date = March 30, 2020 |accessdate = April 3, 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200403181051/https://9to5mac.com/2020/03/30/iphone-9-case-inventory-best-buy/ |archive-date = April 3, 2020 |url-status = live }}</ref> showing an iPhone with an [[iPhone 8]]-sized body and a single camera lens.<ref name=\"9to5mac\" /> [[Belkin]] screen protectors for the iPhone SE were also listed on the online [[Apple Store]], cross-compatible with the iPhone 8 and iPhone 7.

The phone's dimensions are identical to that of the iPhone 8, and the external design is the same except for a centered Apple logo and no iPhone branding. It features bezels on the top and bottom of the front and a home button integrated with second-generation [[Touch ID]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/ |title = iPhone SE 2020: Everything We Know |website = MacRumors |language = en |access-date = April 15, 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180805112853/https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/ |archive-date = August 5, 2018 |url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nThe iPhone SE is available in three colors \u2014 white, black,<!-- colors are not proper nouns --> and a [[Product Red]] edition.<ref name=\"Official website: specifications /> Where this iPhone does deviate from the iPhone 8's design is with respect to the white model. Unlike the silver iPhone 8 (and all prior silver iPhones since the [[iPhone 5]]), the white iPhone SE features black bezels like the black models and red models, in line with the color schemes of the [[iPhone 11]] and [[iPhone XR]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Color !!Name      <!-- hex codes from product selection page -->\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#1F2020\"| ||Black \n|-\n|bgcolor=\"F9F6EF\" |  ||White \n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#BA0C2E\"  |  ||[[Product Red]]\n|}\n\n== Specifications ==\n\n===Hardware===\nThe iPhone SE incorporates the Apple A13 Bionic system-on-chip (SoC) with an [[Apple motion coprocessors|M13 motion coprocessor]] and a third-generation neural engine.

It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content. [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] has been replaced with Haptic Touch.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera similar to the wide camera of iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash. It is capable of recording 4K video at 24&nbsp;fps, 30&nbsp;fps, or 60&nbsp;fps, 1080p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps or 60&nbsp;fps, or 720p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps.

They offered from the pre-school level until finishing high school to Cuban children and youth, as part of the mission of the church on the island.\n\nAlthough they were administered by different dependencies of the Methodist Church of Florida (United States), these two schools developed all their activities in coordination. Candler College offered elementary education only to boys while Colegio Buenavista provided primary education for girls. Young girls enrolled in Buenavista attended secondary education programs at Candler College; they only received religion and physical education classes at the Buenavista facilities. Some of Candler's boys did the seventh and eighth grades in English at Colegio Buenavista to be able to follow the United States High School curriculum. The younger boys also went to Kindergarten along with the girls. Candler College had a boarding school for boys only. Similarly, Buenavista provided the boarding for young girls and ladies. The two schools had separate lunch services for students who did not live a short distance away from them.\n\nIn order to give its graduates and other students, the opportunity to continue university studies, at Candler College Candler University was organized in 1956, opening the Faculties of Pedagogy, Languages, Philosophy, and Letters, Pharmacy and Commercial Sciences to begin in 1957.\n\nThese institutions grew in number of students and in prestige over the years until their educational work was interrupted in 1961 when the Castro regime nationalized all the private educational establishments (religious and lay).<ref name=Evolution/> During the years in which Candler College and Colegio Buenavista existed, both schools provided a successful service to Cuban youth preparing their students for civic life by providing, in addition to official instruction, an integral formation based on Christian, moral and patriotic values.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Students. Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe first Methodist school in Cuba was founded in 1899 by the American missionary Thad E. Leland on Calle Virtudes de [[La Habana]]. This was founded when the Bishop of the Methodist Church of Florida, the Rev. Warren Akin Candler, proposed to give a new impetus to the missionary work begun in Cuba in 1883, through educational projects. In 1903 this school was named Candler College in honor of Bishop Candler.<ref>Tamayo P\u00e9rez, Marbelito y Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez, Belkis. Iglesia Metodista de Cuba.

Gilbert as director of the College in 1909. Aware of the need to expand, the Mission Board of the Florida Conference acquired a vast tract of land in La Ceiba, Marianao, where the first building for the new headquarters was built in 1912 of the school, inaugurated in January 1913.<ref>Bardwell, Harry B.

The headquarters of Havana was called Central Methodist College and that of Marianao retained the name Candler College. In addition to offering elementary and secondary education, between 1924 and 1946 at Candler College, a theological seminary was held, the School of Pastors, which was under the direction of the Reverend B. F. Gilbert followed by the Reverend E.E, Clements.<ref>P\u00e9rez Ramos, Carlos. ''Un resumen de los setenta a\u00f1os de labor de la iglesia metodista en Cuba.''  Libro publicado en 1983.

He was replaced in 1949 by the Reverend Carlos P\u00e9rez Ramos, who had been assistant director since 1946. Under his direction, the school continued to grow and other buildings and facilities were built to meet new requirements.\n\nColegio Buenavista was founded in 1920 by the Women's Missionary Board of the Methodist Church to provide a Christian education for girls and young women and to respond to the request of the parents of Candler College students who demanded an education for their daughters. quality similar to that of his brothers.

Under his direction the school grew at the same pace as Candler College. Miss Belle Markey, the first director, was followed by Miss Junia Jones and then by Miss Ione Clay, who held the position for more than 25 years, until her retirement in 1956, and was replaced by Miss Juanita Kelly, who was succeeded by Miss Lorraine Buck.

Candler College and Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left]]\n[[File:Edifcios de Candler College.jpg|thumb|rightEdifcios de Candler College]]\nCandler College was located in the southeastern corner of the intersection of Miramar (Calle 54) and Guti\u00e9rrez (Ave. 43) in La Ceiba, Marianao. Candler's main entrance was down Guti\u00e9rrez Street (Ave.43) and gave access to the gardens in the front part of the main building, where the offices were on the ground floor and the bedrooms for the pupils in the second and third floors. Through this entrance, taking to the left, were the Martian Corner and the two-story building where the High School classes were held. At the back of this building, which opened onto Calle Lanuza (Calle 52), an entrance was opened for the students of Candler University. There were three other entrances on Calle Miramar (Ave. 54): one that was used to enter the Chapel, the next allowed the entrance of cars to the esplanade and parking place; this entrance had on the right the two-story building of the School of Commerce, with its well-equipped classrooms and spacious corridors, and to the left was the Library building, which also had two floors. Surrounding the esplanade were the back of the main building with its long corridors, the front of the High School building, the dining room and kitchen with the apartment for the director on the second floor and the three-story building that occupied the School of Baccalaureate, with its laboratories and the Museum of Natural Sciences, in addition to classrooms. Separated by a fence, was the field for sports, the squash court and beyond the ground and the ballpark. The third entrance was the building of the Elementary School, in front of Font Street (Ave. 45). On the opposite side of the street, there was another sports field on the corner of 54th Street and 45th Ave. The Gymnasium, with its modern wooden plank for playing basketball and indoor volleyball and a stage at the back, was It was located in the southwest corner of 56th Street and 45th Ave.\n[[File:Buenavista a color.jpg|thumb|right|El edificio principal de Buenavista on 54th Street]]\nColegio Buenavista was located in front of the entrances on the side of Candler, on the southwestern corner of 54th Street and 43rd Avenue.<ref name=Recuerdos/>\nThe main Buenavista building had three entrances on Calle Miramar (Calle 54): the first was a gate to enter the main building, the beautiful mansion that was adapted to the initial needs of the school. On the ground floor were: the materials room, the kitchen, the dining room, and two classrooms. On the facade there were two converging stairs on a large terrace that gave access to the offices, the library, and the hall, from where a corridor led to the infirmary, the bedrooms and bathrooms for the pupils and the director, on the second floor.<ref name=Recuerdos/> On the third floor, there were more bedrooms for the older pupils and the missionaries. To the left of this building, there was an entrance for cars, gardens, a garage, and a small room. A hallway to the left led to the classrooms, lined along 54th Street and 45th Ave, which limited the large courtyard with its gardens. This included recreational areas, the platform for cultural activities, the Martian Corner and, on the other side, the tennis and volleyball court. A third entrance to the gardens of Calle Miramar led to a vestibule that separated a small religious meditation room and a classroom and the long corridor that gave access to classrooms. There was also an entrance through the back of the patio, on Calle Primelles (Calle 56). Crossing this street, a small door allowed to enter the sports ground for the students of Buenavista. The Auditorium of both schools was built next to this land, located in the south-western corner of 56th Street and 43rd Ave. Diagonal to this, in the northeast corner, with the entrance by Ave. 43, was the building of two stories with a smaller playground for students from pre-school to third grade.\n\nBoth schools in total occupied a vast lot whose area of more than 32,000 square meters was bounded by 45th Ave to the south, 52nd Street to the east, 58th Street to the west and 43rd Ave to the north. This large area was crossed by three streets: Calle 54, Ave. 45 and Calle 56, which separated the buildings of the schools and the sports grounds, the gymnasium, and the auditorium.\n\n==Basics==\nCandler College and Buenavista College were grounded in the creed and discipline of the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist church]]. They were opened to prepare students for their future life outside of school on the basis of Christian faith and practice as well as moral, civic and patriotic values. Its purposes were to provide a comprehensive education that would contribute to the personal development of students as individuals and members of society and raise the educational level of the newly founded republic.\n\n===Methodist approach===\n[[File:Candler College Chapel. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Candler College Chapel. Corner of 54th Street and 43rd Avenue]]\nAccording to the thought of John Wesley, a good education was considered \"one of the best ways to transform individuals, communities and societies as a whole\" for their betterment and the glory of God. Education was not only the acquisition of academic knowledge but also wisdom and humility, which was founded on the teachings of Christ, in order to grow intellectually, personally and spiritually. The search for truth was encouraged through reason, research and debate, based on freedom of thought and expression. High academic standards were promoted as well as the development of talents through varied activities. As a result, challenges were posed to students, they were inspired and supported to achieve their best through self-discipline and a strong work ethic.\n\nCandler and Buenavista maintained a distinctive approach to education that incorporated Christian ethical values. The Methodist Social Creed emphasizes interest in social welfare and justice as well as the need to combat prejudice and intolerance in whatever form they take by strengthening mutual respect and understanding.<ref name=\"P\u00e9rez Ramos_1\" /> So tolerant attitudes and behaviors were reinforced, respectful and non-discriminatory.\n\nIt was hoped that students would learn to differentiate good and evil based on Christian and moral values. Family values based on love and mutual understanding and support were an important part of the formation of students.\n\nHigh ideals of patriotism were present in the education of the students: love their homeland and be loyal to it, respect and honor the national emblems and recognize the merits of the main forgers of the nation, know its history, culture and traditions as well as the achievements of the newly created republic and interested in the needs and problems of its people and their efforts to solve them.\n\nThe civic values of freedom and democracy and the norms of coexistence related to rights and duties had a central place in the task of preparing future citizens as well as inculcating good manners and the appropriate habits required to live in society.\n\nThe strong ties with the Florida Methodist Church Conference, which partially supported both colleges, were evident in the influence of American culture and traditions in schools. The flag of the United States was present in all the parties and ceremonies along with the Cuban flag and the national anthems of the two countries were sung.\n\n==Hymns and emblems==\nThe principle adopted by Candler College as a guide was Consilio et Prudentia (Wisdom and Prudence). The motto of Colegio Buenavista, which appears on his seal, was Esse quam Videri (Ser instead of appearing). The pennants of Candler College bore the distinctive colors of the school, red and black. Those of Buenavista the orange and the black. The hymns of the schools were the following:\n[[File:Sello de Candler.jpg|thumb|left|Logo Candler College]]\nLogo Candler College\n\n1 Hail Candler! Emblem for always of nobility and virtue Holy Mother of the soul you teach us the truth and rectitude.

Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|Candler College Faculty]]\n[[File:Alumnos de Candler.jpg|thumb|right|Students at Candler College ca. 1955]]\nCandler College consisted of four schools, each coordinated by a sub-director:\n\n* Elementary School, which included a pre-primary education degree and seven primary education grades (the latter was called preparatory). At the end of the sixth grade students could enter the Baccalaureate if they passed in any of the public secondary schools the official entrance exam that was required.\n* Baccalaureate school, high school in Spanish, which comprised five years. In the latter, students could choose between two branches: Science and Letters. The students left prepared to continue studies of higher education in the different careers that were offered in the country at the university level.\n* School of Commerce, consisting of two different branches: Accountant and Secretariat, which initially were programs of three years each. But from the course of 1957\u201358 Contador was extended to four years. Upon completion of studies in these programs, students were prepared to enter the world of work in commercial enterprises or where office work would be required.\n* High School in English, which consisted of four years of secondary education that prepared the student to continue studies of higher education in the United States.\n[[File:Alumnas de Buenavista.jpg|thumb|left]]\nColegio Buenavista offered preschool (Kindergarten and Pre-primary) and primary education in Spanish and English from first to eighth grades. Her students continued secondary education at Candler College.\n\nThe curriculum corresponded to the graduate school model adopted in Cuba at the beginning of the twentieth century, which implies the progressive nature of the teaching-learning process so that the contents of the [[Course (education)|subjects]] were sequenced progressively from pre-school to secondary education.\n\nCandler College and Buenavista followed the official programs for the Primary School and the Bachillerato proposed by the Cuban Ministry of Education, which determined in a precise way the contents for the subjects of each grade in the Study Plans, as well as the time required for each one. The teachers selected the [[textbooks]] and the materials among those prepared by authors Cubans. Primary Education in Spanish and the Baccalaureate had official recognition, as there were supervisors from the Ministry of Education who periodically visited the primary school classes. The Baccalaureate School was incorporated the Secondary Education Institute of Marianao, so that the students had to present exams of each subject before professors of this institute twice a year to obtain the [[accreditation]] of their results, and at the end, the [[diploma]] official that would allow them to enter the university. In the School of Commerce the professors prepared the study plans. The textbooks and materials were selected by them among those offered by the publishing houses and were available in the [[bookstores]]. The curricula for the High School followed the curriculum of the United States and the texts were brought from there. The schedules, the spaces and the didactic resources were conceived and managed in coordination by the sub-directors and teachers. They were autonomous to conduct the teaching-learning process. Each teacher was free to choose the teaching methods and teaching materials he or she considered most convenient for each subject and was responsible for the [[evaluation]] of the students, including the [[observation]] of their difficulties and needs in order to improve their performance. Grades or grades were reported monthly to the parents of the students.\n\nReligious education was important in both schools. The Bible classes were part of the curriculum in all grades. The students not only read the history and teachings of Jesus and the [[apostles]] in the [[New Testament]], they also learned about the history of the [[Hebrew people]], their leaders, [[prophets]], and other characters; they also learned the [[Ten Commandments]] and read the [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] in the [[Old Testament]]. Worshiping God and [[praying]] were part of the student's formation. Twice a week the students of Buenavista and the boys of Candler in the Chapel met separately, where the word of God was preached and topics related to spiritual, moral, civic and patriotic values were discussed.\n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\nStudents at both schools had opportunities to supplement their academic instruction through a number of sports and various extracurricular activities:\n\n=== Sports ===\n[[File:Deportes en Candler.jpg|thumb|left]]Athletics and sports were always practiced in Candler. In the beginning, the favorite sports were tennis and field and track. Later, students also practiced [[softball]], basketball, volleyball,judo. Some students could participate in teams that were specially trained to compete in the intercollegiate championships. Candler College won various trophies in baseball and basketball.\n\nThey also played sports in Buenavista: softball, kickball, volleyball, and basketball. Teams were trained with the best players to also participate in intercollegiate competitions.\n\n=== Music ===\nIn Buenavista there was a Music Department that, in addition to the regular music classes included in the curricula, offered piano and [[solfeggio]] and [[music theory]] lessons. The students could take these classes in their [[free time]] or at the end of the school day each day. The annual [[Recital]] was a tradition of many years, in which the students who took piano lessons played a piece of classical music. In this one also participated the Rhythmic Band.\n\nIn the decades of 1940 and 1950, there was also a school band that participated in parades or patriotic celebrations and played the National Anthem during the salute to the flag.\n\nIn addition, [[choirs]] were specially prepared to participate in [[festivals]] and other celebrations.\n\nSince 1958 a choir was organized with students from both schools.\n\n=== Other extracurricular activities ===\n[[File:Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Evening extracurricular activity at Colegio Buenavista. ca 1955]]\nAt different times, some groups of students interested in literature, musical appreciation, theater, [[Rhetoric|oratory]], or the publication of a newspaper were organized, guided by a teacher or counselor.\n\nThe [[excursions]] were traditional opportunities to visit places near the school or historical or recreational places in different parts of the country.\n\nAt Candler College, there was also a troop of [[Asociaci\u00f3n de Scouts de Cuba|Boy Scouts]].\n\nIn addition, festivals, bazaars, theatrical performances, Christmas celebrations and others that were part of the annual planning of school activities were organized.\n\n== Student body ==\nCandler College and Colegio Buenavista were open to all children and young people without further requirements, who, apart from paying the monthly fee, committed to respecting their standards. Some students were scholarship two for the church and some parents got a reduction in the tuition for their children's education.\n\nThe two schools did not admit exclusively Methodist or Protestant students. The majority of the students were [[Catholic]] and there were also some students [[Jews]]. Due to the good level in the teaching of the English language, Candler and Buenavista were chosen by many parents of students [[Alien (law)|foreigners]]{{clarify|date=November 2018}} who lived in Cuba.\n\nIn the sixty-two years of existence of Candler College and forty-one of Buenavista, many thousands of students left the schools prepared to continue their studies or enter the world of work and become good citizens. They were equipped with solid foundations of religious faith and moral values to cope with life after school.\n\n=== Alumni Associations ===\nThe Candler Fraternity was the association of graduates and alumni of Candler College. The former students of Buenavista belonged to the Association of Former Students of Colegio Buenavista.\n\nMany alumni and teachers of Candler and Buenavista left their country in the early 1960s when the revolution that took power in 1959 turned to [[socialism]]. Others emigrated later. The majority went to live in the United States, concentrating on the largest number in Florida. Some of those who have been in contact have met on different occasions to remember the old times and reaffirm the spirit of the schools that they all share.\n\nThe former students of Candler and Buenavista who remained in Cuba have formed the Candler-Buenavista Fraternity and meet annually since 1999.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Galery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Terrenos de Candler y Buenavista.jpg\nFile:Alumnas de Buenavista.jpg|Students of Colegio Buenavista\n\nFile:Deportes en Candler.jpg\n\nFile:1959 paseo.jpg|Bus trip in 1959\n</gallery>\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120410190109/http://candlercollege.org/ Official school page]\n* [http://wikimapia.org/15295609/Candler-College Wikimap]\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Havana landmarks}}\n\n{{Portal|Cuba}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Candler College and Colegio Buenavista}}\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Havana]]\n[[Category:Education in Havana]]\n[[Category:Schools in Havana]]\n[[Category:Schools in Cuba]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in Cuba]]\n[[Category:Universities in Cuba]]\n[[Category:1960s in Cuba]]\n[[Category:1961 in Cuba]]\n[[Category:Arts in Cuba]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2018}}\n{{Infobox building\n| name                = Candler College and Colegio Buenavista\n| native_name         = \n| native_name_lang    = \n| logo                = Candler College Logo.jpg\n| logo_size           = 100px\n| logo_alt            = Sello de Buenavista.jpg\n| logo_caption        = \n| image               =  Terrenos de Candler y Buenavista.jpg\n| image_size          = 220px\n| image_alt           = \n| image_caption       =\n| map_type            = \n| map_alt             = \n| map_caption         = \n| map_size = |mapframe-zoom=13\n| map_dot_label       = \n| map_dot_mark        = \n| relief              = \n| former_names        = \n| alternate_names     = \n| etymology           = \n| status              = \n| cancelled           = \n| topped_out          = \n| building_type       = Educational\n| architectural_style = Art deco-eclectic\n| classification      = \n| location            = Marianao\n| address             =  (Calle 54) y Guti\u00e9rrez (Ave. 43)\n| location_city       = [[File:Coat_of_arms_of_La_Habana.svg|20px]] [[Havana|Ciudad de La Habana]]\n| location_country    = {{Flagicon|CUB}} [[Cuba]]  \n| coordinates         = {{Coord|23|06|15.768|N|82|24|56.232|W|display=inline,title}}\n| altitude            = \n| current_tenants     = Empty\n| namesake            = \n| groundbreaking_date = \n| start_date          = 1899 Candler C.\n| stop_date           = \n| est_completion      = \n| topped_out_date     = \n| completion_date     = \n| opened_date         = 1920 C.

They offered from the pre-school level until finishing high school to Cuban children and youth, as part of the mission of the church on the island.\n\nAlthough they were administered by different dependencies of the Methodist Church of Florida (United States), these two schools developed all their activities in coordination. Candler College offered elementary education only to boys while Colegio Buenavista provided primary education for girls. Young girls enrolled in Buenavista attended secondary education programs at Candler College; they only received religion and physical education classes at the Buenavista facilities. Some of Candler's boys did the seventh and eighth grades in English at Colegio Buenavista to be able to follow the United States High School curriculum. The younger boys also went to Kindergarten along with the girls. Candler College had a boarding school for boys only. Similarly, Buenavista provided the boarding for young girls and ladies. The two schools had separate lunch services for students who did not live a short distance away from them.\n\nIn order to give its graduates and other students, the opportunity to continue university studies, at Candler College Candler University was organized in 1956, opening the Faculties of Pedagogy, Languages, Philosophy, and Letters, Pharmacy and Commercial Sciences to begin in 1957.\n\nThese institutions grew in number of students and in prestige over the years until their educational work was interrupted in 1961 when the Castro regime nationalized all the private educational establishments (religious and lay).<ref name=Evolution/> During the years in which Candler College and Colegio Buenavista existed, both schools provided a successful service to Cuban youth preparing their students for civic life by providing, in addition to official instruction, an integral formation based on Christian, moral and patriotic values.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Students. Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe first Methodist school in Cuba was founded in 1899 by the American missionary Thad E. Leland on Calle Virtudes de [[La Habana]]. This was founded when the Bishop of the Methodist Church of Florida, the Rev. Warren Akin Candler, proposed to give a new impetus to the missionary work begun in Cuba in 1883, through educational projects. In 1903 this school was named Candler College in honor of Bishop Candler.<ref>Tamayo P\u00e9rez, Marbelito y Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez, Belkis. Iglesia Metodista de Cuba.

Gilbert as director of the College in 1909. Aware of the need to expand, the Mission Board of the Florida Conference acquired a vast tract of land in La Ceiba, Marianao, where the first building for the new headquarters was built in 1912 of the school, inaugurated in January 1913.<ref>Bardwell, Harry B.

The headquarters of Havana was called Central Methodist College and that of Marianao retained the name Candler College. In addition to offering elementary and secondary education, between 1924 and 1946 at Candler College, a theological seminary was held, the School of Pastors, which was under the direction of the Reverend B. F. Gilbert followed by the Reverend E.E, Clements.<ref>P\u00e9rez Ramos, Carlos. ''Un resumen de los setenta a\u00f1os de labor de la iglesia metodista en Cuba.''  Libro publicado en 1983.

He was replaced in 1949 by the Reverend Carlos P\u00e9rez Ramos, who had been assistant director since 1946. Under his direction, the school continued to grow and other buildings and facilities were built to meet new requirements.\n\nColegio Buenavista was founded in 1920 by the Women's Missionary Board of the Methodist Church to provide a Christian education for girls and young women and to respond to the request of the parents of Candler College students who demanded an education for their daughters. quality similar to that of his brothers.

Under his direction the school grew at the same pace as Candler College. Miss Belle Markey, the first director, was followed by Miss Junia Jones and then by Miss Ione Clay, who held the position for more than 25 years, until her retirement in 1956, and was replaced by Miss Juanita Kelly, who was succeeded by Miss Lorraine Buck.

Candler College and Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left]]\n[[File:Edifcios de Candler College.jpg|thumb|rightEdifcios de Candler College]]\nCandler College was located in the southeastern corner of the intersection of Miramar (Calle 54) and Guti\u00e9rrez (Ave. 43) in La Ceiba, Marianao. Candler's main entrance was down Guti\u00e9rrez Street (Ave.43) and gave access to the gardens in the front part of the main building, where the offices were on the ground floor and the bedrooms for the pupils in the second and third floors. Through this entrance, taking to the left, were the Martian Corner and the two-story building where the High School classes were held. At the back of this building, which opened onto Calle Lanuza (Calle 52), an entrance was opened for the students of Candler University. There were three other entrances on Calle Miramar (Ave. 54): one that was used to enter the Chapel, the next allowed the entrance of cars to the esplanade and parking place; this entrance had on the right the two-story building of the School of Commerce, with its well-equipped classrooms and spacious corridors, and to the left was the Library building, which also had two floors. Surrounding the esplanade were the back of the main building with its long corridors, the front of the High School building, the dining room and kitchen with the apartment for the director on the second floor and the three-story building that occupied the School of Baccalaureate, with its laboratories and the Museum of Natural Sciences, in addition to classrooms. Separated by a fence, was the field for sports, the squash court and beyond the ground and the ballpark. The third entrance was the building of the Elementary School, in front of Font Street (Ave. 45). On the opposite side of the street, there was another sports field on the corner of 54th Street and 45th Ave. The Gymnasium, with its modern wooden plank for playing basketball and indoor volleyball and a stage at the back, was It was located in the southwest corner of 56th Street and 45th Ave.\n[[File:Buenavista a color.jpg|thumb|right|El edificio principal de Buenavista on 54th Street]]\nColegio Buenavista was located in front of the entrances on the side of Candler, on the southwestern corner of 54th Street and 43rd Avenue.<ref name=Recuerdos/>\nThe main Buenavista building had three entrances on Calle Miramar (Calle 54): the first was a gate to enter the main building, the beautiful mansion that was adapted to the initial needs of the school. On the ground floor were: the materials room, the kitchen, the dining room, and two classrooms. On the facade there were two converging stairs on a large terrace that gave access to the offices, the library, and the hall, from where a corridor led to the infirmary, the bedrooms and bathrooms for the pupils and the director, on the second floor.<ref name=Recuerdos/> On the third floor, there were more bedrooms for the older pupils and the missionaries. To the left of this building, there was an entrance for cars, gardens, a garage, and a small room. A hallway to the left led to the classrooms, lined along 54th Street and 45th Ave, which limited the large courtyard with its gardens. This included recreational areas, the platform for cultural activities, the Martian Corner and, on the other side, the tennis and volleyball court. A third entrance to the gardens of Calle Miramar led to a vestibule that separated a small religious meditation room and a classroom and the long corridor that gave access to classrooms. There was also an entrance through the back of the patio, on Calle Primelles (Calle 56). Crossing this street, a small door allowed to enter the sports ground for the students of Buenavista. The Auditorium of both schools was built next to this land, located in the south-western corner of 56th Street and 43rd Ave. Diagonal to this, in the northeast corner, with the entrance by Ave. 43, was the building of two stories with a smaller playground for students from pre-school to third grade.\n\nBoth schools in total occupied a vast lot whose area of more than 32,000 square meters was bounded by 45th Ave to the south, 52nd Street to the east, 58th Street to the west and 43rd Ave to the north. This large area was crossed by three streets: Calle 54, Ave. 45 and Calle 56, which separated the buildings of the schools and the sports grounds, the gymnasium, and the auditorium.\n\n==Basics==\nCandler College and Buenavista College were grounded in the creed and discipline of the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist church]]. They were opened to prepare students for their future life outside of school on the basis of Christian faith and practice as well as moral, civic and patriotic values. Its purposes were to provide a comprehensive education that would contribute to the personal development of students as individuals and members of society and raise the educational level of the newly founded republic.\n\n===Methodist approach===\n[[File:Candler College Chapel. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Candler College Chapel. Corner of 54th Street and 43rd Avenue]]\nAccording to the thought of John Wesley, a good education was considered \"one of the best ways to transform individuals, communities and societies as a whole\" for their betterment and the glory of God. Education was not only the acquisition of academic knowledge but also wisdom and humility, which was founded on the teachings of Christ, in order to grow intellectually, personally and spiritually. The search for truth was encouraged through reason, research and debate, based on freedom of thought and expression. High academic standards were promoted as well as the development of talents through varied activities. As a result, challenges were posed to students, they were inspired and supported to achieve their best through self-discipline and a strong work ethic.\n\nCandler and Buenavista maintained a distinctive approach to education that incorporated Christian ethical values. The Methodist Social Creed emphasizes interest in social welfare and justice as well as the need to combat prejudice and intolerance in whatever form they take by strengthening mutual respect and understanding.<ref name=\"P\u00e9rez Ramos_1\" /> So tolerant attitudes and behaviors were reinforced, respectful and non-discriminatory.\n\nIt was hoped that students would learn to differentiate good and evil based on Christian and moral values. Family values based on love and mutual understanding and support were an important part of the formation of students.\n\nHigh ideals of patriotism were present in the education of the students: love their homeland and be loyal to it, respect and honor the national emblems and recognize the merits of the main forgers of the nation, know its history, culture and traditions as well as the achievements of the newly created republic and interested in the needs and problems of its people and their efforts to solve them.\n\nThe civic values of freedom and democracy and the norms of coexistence related to rights and duties had a central place in the task of preparing future citizens as well as inculcating good manners and the appropriate habits required to live in society.\n\nThe strong ties with the Florida Methodist Church Conference, which partially supported both colleges, were evident in the influence of American culture and traditions in schools. The flag of the United States was present in all the parties and ceremonies along with the Cuban flag and the national anthems of the two countries were sung.\n\n==Hymns and emblems==\nThe principle adopted by Candler College as a guide was Consilio et Prudentia (Wisdom and Prudence). The motto of Colegio Buenavista, which appears on his seal, was Esse quam Videri (Ser instead of appearing). The pennants of Candler College bore the distinctive colors of the school, red and black. Those of Buenavista the orange and the black. The hymns of the schools were the following:\n[[File:Sello de Candler.jpg|thumb|left|Logo Candler College]]\nLogo Candler College\n\n1 Hail Candler! Emblem for always of nobility and virtue Holy Mother of the soul you teach us the truth and rectitude.

Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|Candler College Faculty]]\n[[File:Alumnos de Candler.jpg|thumb|right|Students at Candler College ca. 1955]]\nCandler College consisted of four schools, each coordinated by a sub-director:\n\n* Elementary School, which included a pre-primary education degree and seven primary education grades (the latter was called preparatory). At the end of the sixth grade students could enter the Baccalaureate if they passed in any of the public secondary schools the official entrance exam that was required.\n* Baccalaureate school, high school in Spanish, which comprised five years. In the latter, students could choose between two branches: Science and Letters. The students left prepared to continue studies of higher education in the different careers that were offered in the country at the university level.\n* School of Commerce, consisting of two different branches: Accountant and Secretariat, which initially were programs of three years each. But from the course of 1957\u201358 Contador was extended to four years. Upon completion of studies in these programs, students were prepared to enter the world of work in commercial enterprises or where office work would be required.\n* High School in English, which consisted of four years of secondary education that prepared the student to continue studies of higher education in the United States.\n[[File:Alumnas de Buenavista.jpg|thumb|left]]\nColegio Buenavista offered preschool (Kindergarten and Pre-primary) and primary education in Spanish and English from first to eighth grades. Her students continued secondary education at Candler College.\n\nThe curriculum corresponded to the graduate school model adopted in Cuba at the beginning of the twentieth century, which implies the progressive nature of the teaching-learning process so that the contents of the [[Course (education)|subjects]] were sequenced progressively from pre-school to secondary education.\n\nCandler College and Buenavista followed the official programs for the Primary School and the Bachillerato proposed by the Cuban Ministry of Education, which determined in a precise way the contents for the subjects of each grade in the Study Plans, as well as the time required for each one. The teachers selected the [[textbooks]] and the materials among those prepared by authors Cubans. Primary Education in Spanish and the Baccalaureate had official recognition, as there were supervisors from the Ministry of Education who periodically visited the primary school classes. The Baccalaureate School was incorporated the Secondary Education Institute of Marianao, so that the students had to present exams of each subject before professors of this institute twice a year to obtain the [[accreditation]] of their results, and at the end, the [[diploma]] official that would allow them to enter the university. In the School of Commerce the professors prepared the study plans. The textbooks and materials were selected by them among those offered by the publishing houses and were available in the [[bookstores]]. The curricula for the High School followed the curriculum of the United States and the texts were brought from there. The schedules, the spaces and the didactic resources were conceived and managed in coordination by the sub-directors and teachers. They were autonomous to conduct the teaching-learning process. Each teacher was free to choose the teaching methods and teaching materials he or she considered most convenient for each subject and was responsible for the [[evaluation]] of the students, including the [[observation]] of their difficulties and needs in order to improve their performance. Grades or grades were reported monthly to the parents of the students.\n\nReligious education was important in both schools. The Bible classes were part of the curriculum in all grades. The students not only read the history and teachings of Jesus and the [[apostles]] in the [[New Testament]], they also learned about the history of the [[Hebrew people]], their leaders, [[prophets]], and other characters; they also learned the [[Ten Commandments]] and read the [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] in the [[Old Testament]]. Worshiping God and [[praying]] were part of the student's formation. Twice a week the students of Buenavista and the boys of Candler in the Chapel met separately, where the word of God was preached and topics related to spiritual, moral, civic and patriotic values were discussed.\n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\nStudents at both schools had opportunities to supplement their academic instruction through a number of sports and various extracurricular activities:\n\n=== Sports ===\n[[File:Deportes en Candler.jpg|thumb|left]]Athletics and sports were always practiced in Candler. In the beginning, the favorite sports were tennis and field and track. Later, students also practiced [[softball]], basketball, volleyball,judo. Some students could participate in teams that were specially trained to compete in the intercollegiate championships. Candler College won various trophies in baseball and basketball.\n\nThey also played sports in Buenavista: softball, kickball, volleyball, and basketball. Teams were trained with the best players to also participate in intercollegiate competitions.\n\n=== Music ===\nIn Buenavista there was a Music Department that, in addition to the regular music classes included in the curricula, offered piano and [[solfeggio]] and [[music theory]] lessons. The students could take these classes in their [[free time]] or at the end of the school day each day. The annual [[Recital]] was a tradition of many years, in which the students who took piano lessons played a piece of classical music. In this one also participated the Rhythmic Band.\n\nIn the decades of 1940 and 1950, there was also a school band that participated in parades or patriotic celebrations and played the National Anthem during the salute to the flag.\n\nIn addition, [[choirs]] were specially prepared to participate in [[festivals]] and other celebrations.\n\nSince 1958 a choir was organized with students from both schools.\n\n=== Other extracurricular activities ===\n[[File:Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Evening extracurricular activity at Colegio Buenavista. ca 1955]]\nAt different times, some groups of students interested in literature, musical appreciation, theater, [[Rhetoric|oratory]], or the publication of a newspaper were organized, guided by a teacher or counselor.\n\nThe [[excursions]] were traditional opportunities to visit places near the school or historical or recreational places in different parts of the country.\n\nAt Candler College, there was also a troop of [[Asociaci\u00f3n de Scouts de Cuba|Boy Scouts]].\n\nIn addition, festivals, bazaars, theatrical performances, Christmas celebrations and others that were part of the annual planning of school activities were organized.\n\n== Student body ==\nCandler College and Colegio Buenavista were open to all children and young people without further requirements, who, apart from paying the monthly fee, committed to respecting their standards. Some students were scholarship two for the church and some parents got a reduction in the tuition for their children's education.\n\nThe two schools did not admit exclusively Methodist or Protestant students. The majority of the students were [[Catholic]] and there were also some students [[Jews]]. Due to the good level in the teaching of the English language, Candler and Buenavista were chosen by many parents of students [[Alien (law)|foreigners]]{{clarify|date=November 2018}} who lived in Cuba.\n\nIn the sixty-two years of existence of Candler College and forty-one of Buenavista, many thousands of students left the schools prepared to continue their studies or enter the world of work and become good citizens. They were equipped with solid foundations of religious faith and moral values to cope with life after school.\n\n=== Alumni Associations ===\nThe Candler Fraternity was the association of graduates and alumni of Candler College. The former students of Buenavista belonged to the Association of Former Students of Colegio Buenavista.\n\nMany alumni and teachers of Candler and Buenavista left their country in the early 1960s when the revolution that took power in 1959 turned to [[socialism]]. Others emigrated later. The majority went to live in the United States, concentrating on the largest number in Florida. Some of those who have been in contact have met on different occasions to remember the old times and reaffirm the spirit of the schools that they all share.\n\nThe former students of Candler and Buenavista who remained in Cuba have formed the Candler-Buenavista Fraternity and meet annually since 1999.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n== Galery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Terrenos de Candler y Buenavista.jpg\nFile:Alumnas de Buenavista.jpg|Students of Colegio Buenavista\n\nFile:Deportes en Candler.jpg\n\nFile:1959 paseo.jpg|Bus trip in 1959\n</gallery>\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120410190109/http://candlercollege.org/ Official school page]\n* [http://wikimapia.org/15295609/Candler-College Wikimap]\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Havana landmarks}}\n\n{{Portal|Cuba}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Candler College and Colegio Buenavista}}\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Havana]]\n[[Category:Education in Havana]]\n[[Category:Schools in Havana]]\n[[Category:Schools in Cuba]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in Cuba]]\n[[Category:Universities in Cuba]]\n[[Category:1960s in Cuba]]\n[[Category:1961 in Cuba]]\n[[Category:Arts in Cuba]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candler_College_and_Colegio_Buenavista"}

CUSID debaters have gone on to notable careers in law, business, government and academia and the presidency of the organization is a highly sought-after position.\n\n==History==\nCUSID was officially founded in 1978, although it held its first annual tournament in 1977.<ref>Debaters find bit of arrogance can be benefit https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19771121&id=2dYyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Bu4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=2515,86433</ref>  The regular tournaments held under its auspices, such as those at the [[University of Toronto]], [[McGill University]], the [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]], and the [[University of Ottawa]] predate CUSID's formation by many decades.\n\nFounded as a national organization with strong central Canadian region roots, over the years, individual regional differences\u2014particularly the separate identities of \"CUSID East\" and \"CUSID West\"\u2014have become more pronounced. One of its primary functions is facilitating communications between its members institutions. Until the late 2000s, those communications have been primarily through their online forum, ''CUSIDnet'', first set up in 1994, as the first online student debating forum in the world. More recently, communications are conducted through social media platforms such as Facebook.\n\nAnnual intervarsity tournaments held in Canada include the [[McGill University]] Winter Carnival, the [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] Chancellor's Cup and Sutherland IV, the [[Carleton University]] Lord Dorchester Cup, the [[University of Toronto]] Hart House IV,<ref>[http://worlddebating.blogspot.com/2007/10/hart-house-university-of-toronto.html World Debating Website: Hart House BP Invitational]</ref> the [[University of Ottawa]] Father Guindon Cup, and the [[Wilfrid Laurier University]]/[[University of Waterloo]] Seagram Cup.\n\nIn 2020, for the first time in history, the society was forced to cancel its National Debating Championship due to the risk presented by [[COVID-19]]. Other tournaments affected included Carleton's Lord Dorchester Cup, the North American Womxn and Gender Minorities Debating Championship and numerous American tournaments.\n\n==Organization==\nCUSID is subdivided into three regional bodies, representing each region of Canada:\n* '''CUSID Central''', for [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], which sponsors the Central Canadian Debating Championship (''L\u00e9ger Cup'')\n* '''CUSID Atlantic''', for the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic Provinces]], which sponsors the Atlantic Canadian Debating Championship\n* '''CUSID West''', for the [[Western Canada|Western Provinces]], [[Northern Canada|Territories]], and the U.S. state of [[Alaska]], which sponsors the Western Canadian Debating Championship (''McGoun Cup'')\n\nCUSID nationally and internationally sanctions several official championship tournaments, including:\n* Canadian Parliamentary National Debating Championship<ref name=\"dal2008\"/>\n* British Parliamentary Debating Championship (typically called BP Champs)\n* Canadian National French Debating Championship (''Comp\u00e9titions Nationales Fran\u00e7aises SUCDI'')\n* Central Canadian Debating Championship (the L\u00e9ger Cup)\n* Western Canadian Debating Championship (the McGoun Cup)\n* Atlantic Canadian Debating Championship\n* [[North American Debating Championship]] (with the [[American Parliamentary Debate Association]])<ref>[http://www.apdaweb.org/about/history APDA Web - Home of the American Parliamentary Debate Association &#124; American College Debate Association - About]</ref><ref>[http://www.parlidebate.com/MoU.doc North American Debating Championship Memorandum of Understanding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715045434/http://www.parlidebate.com/MoU.doc |date=2011-07-15 }}</ref>\n* North American University Debating Championship\n* [[World Universities Debating Championship]] (with other national debate organizations)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flynn.debating.net/CountRep.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721114300/http://flynn.debating.net/CountRep.doc |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe president of CUSID is the head of the organization and leads an elected executive team of six national and regional officers.<ref>[http://www.cusid.ca/about/past-executive/ Past Executive &#124; CUSID]</ref> He or she also represents CUSID and Canadian debating interests inside and outside of Canada, and is the Canadian representative on the [[World Universities Debating Championship#World Universities Debating Council|World Universities Debating Council]]. He or she is elected annually by the member institutions at the National Championships.\n\nThere have been six CUSID Presidents who won the National Championships during their term as President: Jason Brent (1992), [[Gerald Butts]] (1993), Robert Silver (2000), Vinay Mysore (2010), Louis Tsilivis (2013), and Harar Hall (2019).\n\n===Notable Presidents of CUSID===\n* [[Matthew Mendelsohn]] (1986\u20131988)\n* [[Todd Swift]] (1988\u20131989) \n* [[Gerald Butts]] (1992\u20131993)\n* [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]] (1994\u20131995)\n\n==Formats==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nMany CUSID tournaments are held in the Canadian Parliamentary Style of debate. This style emphasizes argumentation and rhetoric, rather than research and detailed factual knowledge. Each round consists of two teams \u2013 the government team and the opposition team \u2013 each of which consists of two debaters. Teams alternate between government and opposition at tournaments. The speaking times in CUSID Central and East are:\n\n* Prime Minister (Constructive): 7 minutes\n* Member of Opposition: 7 minutes\n* Minister of the Crown: 7 minutes\n* Leader of Opposition: 10 minutes\n* Prime Minister (Rebuttal): 3 minutes\n\nA new modification to the above times was introduced at the 2003 McGill University Winter Carnival Invitational called the Prime Minister's Rebuttal Extension (PMRE). The PMRE allows the government team the option to take a 6-minute PMC and 4-minute PMR and was designed to help compensate for the alleged inherent advantage to the opposition side. In most rounds, the resolution is \"squirrelable\", meaning that the government team can propose any topic it wants for debate. The Prime Minister Constructive (PMC) lays out the topic for debate and presents arguments in favor of its position. The opposition team must then immediately present opposing arguments. New arguments can be presented in the first four speeches; they are prohibited in the rebuttal speeches. In the early 2010s the \"opposition choice\" option was introduced. Rather than presenting the motion as it stands, the Prime Minister lays out the topic and the opposite bench has the option of choosing which  side of the motion they would prefer.\n\n\"Points of Information\" are generally permitted and expected in the standard Canadian Parliamentary style. With POIs, debaters may rise and attempt to ask a question of an opposing debater, who can choose whether to accept or refuse the question. It is generally considered good form to accept at least a few questions during a speech.\n\nTournaments are otherwise held in [[British Parliamentary Style|British Parliamentary]], sometimes known as WUDC style. Presently, all tournaments for the first semester of the academic year, September\u2013December, use British Parliamentary as the format. This is for teams to prepare for the World University Debating Championship which occurs over New Year's each year. Since its introduction, British Parliamentary has become the more competitive of the two formats, largely because it is the format used for international competition.\n\n==National Championships==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

CUSID debaters have gone on to notable careers in law, business, government and academia and the presidency of the organization is a highly sought-after position.\n\n==History==\nCUSID was officially founded in 1978, although it held its first annual tournament in 1977.<ref>Debaters find bit of arrogance can be benefit https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19771121&id=2dYyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Bu4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=2515,86433</ref>  The regular tournaments held under its auspices, such as those at the [[University of Toronto]], [[McGill University]], the [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]], and the [[University of Ottawa]] predate CUSID's formation by many decades.\n\nFounded as a national organization with strong central Canadian region roots, over the years, individual regional differences\u2014particularly the separate identities of \"CUSID East\" and \"CUSID West\"\u2014have become more pronounced. One of its primary functions is facilitating communications between its members institutions. Until the late 2000s, those communications have been primarily through their online forum, ''CUSIDnet'', first set up in 1994, as the first online student debating forum in the world. More recently, communications are conducted through social media platforms such as Facebook.\n\nAnnual intervarsity tournaments held in Canada include the [[McGill University]] Winter Carnival, the [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] Chancellor's Cup and Sutherland IV, the [[Carleton University]] Lord Dorchester Cup, the [[University of Toronto]] Hart House IV,<ref>[http://worlddebating.blogspot.com/2007/10/hart-house-university-of-toronto.html World Debating Website: Hart House BP Invitational]</ref> the [[University of Ottawa]] Father Guindon Cup, and the [[Wilfrid Laurier University]]/[[University of Waterloo]] Seagram Cup.\n\nIn 2020, for the first time in history, the society was forced to cancel its National Debating Championship due to the risk presented by [[COVID-19]]. Other tournaments affected included Carleton's Lord Dorchester Cup, the North American Womxn and Gender Minorities Debating Championship and numerous American tournaments.\n\n==Organization==\nCUSID is subdivided into three regional bodies, representing each region of Canada:\n* '''CUSID Central''', for [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], which sponsors the Central Canadian Debating Championship (''L\u00e9ger Cup'')\n* '''CUSID Atlantic''', for the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic Provinces]], which sponsors the Atlantic Canadian Debating Championship\n* '''CUSID West''', for the [[Western Canada|Western Provinces]], [[Northern Canada|Territories]], and the U.S. state of [[Alaska]], which sponsors the Western Canadian Debating Championship (''McGoun Cup'')\n\nCUSID nationally and internationally sanctions several official championship tournaments, including:\n* Canadian Parliamentary National Debating Championship<ref name=\"dal2008\"/>\n* British Parliamentary Debating Championship (typically called BP Champs)\n* Canadian National French Debating Championship (''Comp\u00e9titions Nationales Fran\u00e7aises SUCDI'')\n* Central Canadian Debating Championship (the L\u00e9ger Cup)\n* Western Canadian Debating Championship (the McGoun Cup)\n* Atlantic Canadian Debating Championship\n* [[North American Debating Championship]] (with the [[American Parliamentary Debate Association]])<ref>[http://www.apdaweb.org/about/history APDA Web - Home of the American Parliamentary Debate Association &#124; American College Debate Association - About]</ref><ref>[http://www.parlidebate.com/MoU.doc North American Debating Championship Memorandum of Understanding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715045434/http://www.parlidebate.com/MoU.doc |date=2011-07-15 }}</ref>\n* North American University Debating Championship\n* [[World Universities Debating Championship]] (with other national debate organizations)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flynn.debating.net/CountRep.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721114300/http://flynn.debating.net/CountRep.doc |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref>\n\nThe president of CUSID is the head of the organization and leads an elected executive team of six national and regional officers.<ref>[http://www.cusid.ca/about/past-executive/ Past Executive &#124; CUSID]</ref> He or she also represents CUSID and Canadian debating interests inside and outside of Canada, and is the Canadian representative on the [[World Universities Debating Championship#World Universities Debating Council|World Universities Debating Council]]. He or she is elected annually by the member institutions at the National Championships.\n\nThere have been six CUSID Presidents who won the National Championships during their term as President: Jason Brent (1992), [[Gerald Butts]] (1993), Robert Silver (2000), Vinay Mysore (2010), Louis Tsilivis (2013), and Harar Hall (2019).\n\n===Notable Presidents of CUSID===\n* [[Matthew Mendelsohn]] (1986\u20131988)\n* [[Todd Swift]] (1988\u20131989) \n* [[Gerald Butts]] (1992\u20131993)\n* [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]] (1994\u20131995)\n\n==Formats==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nMany CUSID tournaments are held in the Canadian Parliamentary Style of debate. This style emphasizes argumentation and rhetoric, rather than research and detailed factual knowledge. Each round consists of two teams \u2013 the government team and the opposition team \u2013 each of which consists of two debaters. Teams alternate between government and opposition at tournaments. The speaking times in CUSID Central and East are:\n\n* Prime Minister (Constructive): 7 minutes\n* Member of Opposition: 7 minutes\n* Minister of the Crown: 7 minutes\n* Leader of Opposition: 10 minutes\n* Prime Minister (Rebuttal): 3 minutes\n\nA new modification to the above times was introduced at the 2003 McGill University Winter Carnival Invitational called the Prime Minister's Rebuttal Extension (PMRE). The PMRE allows the government team the option to take a 6-minute PMC and 4-minute PMR and was designed to help compensate for the alleged inherent advantage to the opposition side. In most rounds, the resolution is \"squirrelable\", meaning that the government team can propose any topic it wants for debate. The Prime Minister Constructive (PMC) lays out the topic for debate and presents arguments in favor of its position. The opposition team must then immediately present opposing arguments. New arguments can be presented in the first four speeches; they are prohibited in the rebuttal speeches. In the early 2010s the \"opposition choice\" option was introduced. Rather than presenting the motion as it stands, the Prime Minister lays out the topic and the opposite bench has the option of choosing which  side of the motion they would prefer.\n\n\"Points of Information\" are generally permitted and expected in the standard Canadian Parliamentary style. With POIs, debaters may rise and attempt to ask a question of an opposing debater, who can choose whether to accept or refuse the question. It is generally considered good form to accept at least a few questions during a speech.\n\nTournaments are otherwise held in [[British Parliamentary Style|British Parliamentary]], sometimes known as WUDC style. Presently, all tournaments for the first semester of the academic year, September-December, use British Parliamentary as the format. This is for teams to prepare for the World University Debating Championship which occurs over New Year's each year. Since its introduction, British Parliamentary has become the more competitive of the two formats, largely because it is the format used for international competition.\n\n==National Championships==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

His lyrics, which often expressed themes of [[racism]] and [[misogyny]], polarized listeners and created varied opinions of him within the highly politicized punk community.

Allin and his brother were from that time raised by their mother and stepfather, and settled in [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|East St. Johnsbury]], [[Vermont]], in 1966.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Arleta changed her younger son's legal name to Kevin Michael Allin on March 2, 1962, during his first year of schooling. Arleta had allowed his birth name to stand until this point and finally changed it to give her son a chance of a mockery-free childhood.\n\nAllin, a poor student, was placed in [[special education]] classes and required to repeat the third grade.

In his mid-teens, he and his older brother Merle, who plays [[bass guitar]], formed their first band, Little Sister's Date, which lasted a little over a year.<ref name=\"hated-merleinterview\" /> The group covered songs by [[Aerosmith]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and other popular [[Rock music|rock]] bands of the time period.<ref name=\"hated-merleinterview\" /> Both Allin and Merle gained a strong interest in [[punk rock]]. [[The Ramones]] and [[the Stooges]] were a strong influence on Allin.\n\nAllin graduated from Concord High School in [[Concord, Vermont]], in 1975, and shortly after formed the band Malpractice with his older brother, local musician Jeff Penny, and Brian Demurs (a high school friend). Allin played the drums for Malpractice until the band separated in 1977. He then became the drummer for the band Stripsearch, which released one 7\" single, containing the songs \"Galileo\" and \"Jesus Over New York\".\n\nFrom September 1977 to April 1984, Allin performed as front man for [[the Jabbers]], in which he played drums and performed vocals. Allin's 1980 debut album was ''[[Always Was, Is and Always Shall Be]]'' for Orange Records. It would be reissued for the first time on CD in 1995 by the Halycon imprint.  At one point, industry veteran and [[the Dead Boys]] producer [[Genya Ravan]] served as his manager. Tension within the Jabbers mounted as Allin grew uncontrollable, uncompromising and vicious. The Jabbers disbanded.\n\nAllin fronted many acts during the early to mid-1980s. This includes albums from the Cedar Street Sluts, the Scumfucs in 1982 and the Texas Nazis in 1985. Allin remained in the [[Underground music|underground]] [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] scene, yet was not part of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] hardcore scene. His performances in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], with the Cedar Street Sluts earned him the nickname of \"the Madman of Manchester\".\n\nAllin gained wider attention with the [[ROIR]] cassette-only release of ''[[Hated in the Nation (album)|Hated in the Nation]]'' (1987) containing tracks from Allin's out-of-print catalog with the Jabbers, the Scumfucs and the Cedar Street Sluts. The tape also featured several in-studio and in-concert recordings with an all-star band assembled by producer ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]'' and early Allin patron [[Mykel Board]]. This band featured [[J Mascis]] of [[Dinosaur Jr.]] on lead guitar and [[Bongwater (band)|Bongwater]] record producer/musician [[Kramer (musician)|Mark Kramer]] on bass.\n\n===Mid-era and more extreme live performances===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\nBy the mid- to late 1980s, Allin was addicted to heroin and alcohol and generally abused any intoxicants provided to him.\n\nAllin first defecated onstage in 1985 at a show in [[Peoria, Illinois]]. According to fellow performer Bloody Mess, \"I was with him when he bought the [[Ex-Lax]]. Unfortunately, he ate it hours before the show, so he constantly had to hold it in or he would've shit before he got onstage... After he shit onstage, complete chaos broke out in the hall... All of the old men in charge of the hall went fucking NUTS!.. Hundreds of confused punk kids were flipping out, running out the door, because the smell was INCREDIBLE.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/swedishscum/bloodymess/interview.html|title=Bloody Mess Interview}}</ref> [[Defecation]] became a regular part of his stage act.\n\nAllin idolized country music legend [[Hank Williams]] and saw himself as a kindred spirit. Both were relative loners and outsiders, both were habitual users of intoxicants, both lived with few (if any) possessions, and both traveled the country relentlessly. Allin's acoustic output, documented on the EP ''[[The Troubled Troubador]]'', was heavily influenced by Williams. He recorded his own rewrites of [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]'s \"Family Tradition\" and [[David Allan Coe]]'s \"Longhaired Redneck\", calling his own versions \"Scumfuc Tradition\" and \"Outlaw Scumfuc\", respectively. Later, Allin also released another country album, ''[[Carnival of Excess: Limited Edition|Carnival of Excess]]'', his most refined record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bajalibros.com/AR/Nosotros-los-normales-GG-Ailli-Marcelo-Pisarro-eBook-1744047|title=Nosotros, los normales. GG Aillin en el infierno punk|website=BajaLibros.com|language=es|access-date=2019-07-06}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, Allin collaborated with Bulge (also known as Psycho under a different name, on the album ''[[Freaks, Faggots, Drunks and Junkies]]''), the Aids Brigade (the 7\" EP ''Expose Yourself to Kids'') and the Holymen (''[[You Give Love a Bad Name (album)|You Give Love a Bad Name]]''). Allin also began performing many [[spoken word]] pieces. Video footage of these is available but rare. Unwilling to seek steady employment, Allin supported himself by selling his own records. Allin was also [[Murderabilia|fascinated with serial killers]]. He wrote to and visited [[John Wayne Gacy]] in prison a number of times and Gacy painted a portrait of Allin, which became the album cover to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]''.\n\nBy this point, Allin's performances, which often resulted in considerable damage to venues and sound equipment, were regularly stopped by police or venue owners after only a few songs. Allin was charged with assault and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] or indecent exposure a number of times. His constant touring was only stopped by jail time or by long hospital stays for broken bones, blood poisoning, and other physical trauma.\n\nAnother attraction to Allin performances was his continual threats of suicide. In 1989, Allin wrote to ''Maximum RocknRoll'' stating that he would die by suicide on stage on Halloween 1989. However, he was in jail when that day came. He continued his threat each following year but ended up imprisoned each following Halloween. When asked why he did not follow through with his threats, Allin stated, \"With GG, you don't get what you expect\u2014you get what you deserve.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killcreek.com/devolution/mykel/124.html |title=You're Wrong, No.&nbsp;124 |publisher=Killcreek.com |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref> He also stated that suicide should only be done when one had reached one's peak, meeting the afterlife at one's strongest point and not at one's weakest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/ekx001/MG/ANT1993MG.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050118083429/http://www.geocities.com/ekx001/MG/ANT1993MG.html |archivedate=January 18, 2005 |title=The GG Allin SuperSite Media Guide \u2013 Anthropomorphic No.&nbsp;1 \u2013 January 1993 |publisher=Geocities.com |date=March 26, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1993, Allin made an appearance on ''[[The Jane Whitney Show]]''. This interview is infamous for being his last interview and for Allin's aggression toward the audience. Allin openly stated that he would die by suicide and take his fans with him. When questioned by Jane, he clarified that he would make them die by suicide as well or he would kill them. Allin also stated that, at 35, he could sleep with 12-, 13- and 16-year-old girls, boys and animals and claimed that he raped both women and men at his concerts.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Jane Whitney Show - GG Allin 1993 FULL|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpEDdLgYDF8|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nov 1989 Letter..jpg|thumb|Letter from November 1989]]\n\n===1989 trial and imprisonment===\nIn late 1989, Allin was arrested and charged with \"assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder\" of a female acquaintance in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].\n\nIn a psychological evaluation made as part of the trial, Allin was judged as having at least average intelligence, and was described as \"courteous, cooperative and candid\". The unnamed evaluator noted that Allin did not appear [[psychotic]], and seemed comfortable with his unorthodox lifestyle. However, the evaluator asserted Allin was dependent on alcohol and had a [[mixed personality disorder]] with [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]] and [[self-defeating personality disorder|masochistic]] features.\n\nAllin initially denied the charges, claiming that the woman was a willing participant in their sexual activities. Allin admitted to cutting her, burning her, and drinking her blood, but insisted that she did the same thing to him. Allin also claimed that inconsistencies in the woman's statements to authorities supported his assertions. The judge in the case agreed there were substantial inconsistencies in the woman's account. Ultimately, however, Allin plea bargained to the reduced charge of felonious assault, and he was imprisoned from December 25, 1989 to March 26, 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecarouser.com/2014/08/31/he-was-your-enemy-part-ii/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919002052/http://thecarouser.com/2014/08/31/he-was-your-enemy-part-ii/ |archivedate=September 19, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt was during this time in prison that Allin began feeling re-energized about his life and \"mission\". He wrote ''The GG Allin Manifesto''<ref>{{cite web|author=GG Allin ggallinonline.com |url=http://ggallinonline.com/mission.php |title=Text of the manifesto |publisher=Ggallinonline.com |date=October 31, 1990 |accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref> during this period.\n\n===''Hated'' documentary and final days===\n{{main|Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies}}\nAfter his release from prison, Allin skipped parole to go on another tour, footage of which was shot for [[Todd Phillips]]'s documentary ''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]''. The film contained graphic scenes from a performance Allin gave at the rock club Space at Chase in [[Manhattan]]'s [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. A heavily intoxicated Allin stripped naked, defecated on the floor, wiped his feces on himself and threw feces into the audience. He also threw beer bottles, breaking a woman's nose, and assaulted several other people in the crowd. Clips were included from other Allin appearances, as well as interviews with Allin, his band, and their fans. The film was released in 1994 and later followed on DVD in 1997.\n\nIn 1991, GG recorded an album entitled ''[[Murder Junkies]]'', released by New Rose Records, featuring [[Antiseen]] as his backing band. This album contained 10 musical tracks and 10 spoken-word pieces. Other than ''Freaks, Faggots, Drunks and Junkies'', Allin considered this album to be that which most accurately captured his persona and stated philosophy on life. It was also during this period that Allin recorded the album ''War in My Head \u2013 I'm Your Enemy'', released on [[Awareness Records]] and featuring the band Shrinkwrap. This particular album consists of one 45-minute track that is a [[Sound collage|collage]] of spoken-word pieces which Shrinkwrap put to music.\n\nAllin's growing notoriety led to appearances on various television shows: ''[[Geraldo (TV series)|Geraldo]]'', ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' and ''The Jane Whitney Show''.

He revealed on ''[[Geraldo (TV series)|Geraldo]]'' that he believed his body to be a temple of rock and roll, and that his flesh, blood, and bodily fluids were a communion to the people. Another reason given for his onstage antics (by Dino, the drummer of his band) was that he wanted to draw a parallel between his actions and \"a society that's going crazy with violence\". He has also said that if he was not a performer, he would probably be a [[serial killer]] or a [[mass murderer]].<ref name=\"hated\" />\n\nRegarding Allin's views on death, he believed in some form of an [[afterlife]]. He planned to kill himself onstage on [[Halloween]] many times in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but was stopped due to prison sentences around every Halloween each year. He explained his views on death in the film ''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]'', stating: \"It's like I've got this wild soul that just wants to get out of this life. It's too confined in this life. I think that to take yourself out at your peak... if you could die at your peak, your strongest point, then your soul will be that much stronger in the next existence.\"<ref>{{cite news |title = GG Allin \u2013 Hated: Special Edition |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9AvIpoV0ps |publisher = MVDmusicvideo |date = June 15, 2011 |accessdate = September 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:GG Allin Grave.jpg|thumb|right|200px|GG Allin's grave in [[Littleton, New Hampshire]]]]\nGG Allin's last show was on June 27, 1993 at a small club called The Gas Station, a punk venue located inside a former gas station at 194 East 2nd Street in [[Manhattan]]. During the second song, the venue cut the power, after which he trashed the club, walked across the street naked, and then continued on, now wearing shorts, but still covered in blood and feces, through the neighborhood, followed by a large group of fans.\n\nAfter walking the streets for almost an hour, Allin eventually went to his friend Johnny Puke's apartment. There, he and others continued to party and use drugs. Sometime during the evening, Allin ingested large amounts of heroin, on which he [[accidental overdose|accidentally overdosed]] and slipped into an unconscious state. Sometime in the early morning of June 28, Allin died from the effects of his heroin overdose. Later that morning, someone noticed that Allin still lay motionless in the same place where they had left him and called for an ambulance. Allin was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Beatles, Greg Van Voorst, and The Rolling Stones, and The Dave Clark 5, and The Monkees, and all that kind of stuff, you know.\"</ref> In the early 70s, [[Alice Cooper]] became a large influence on Allin.<ref name=\"ytmom\">{{YouTube|eu8RRujy2RQ|Interview with GG Allin's mother part 1 }}</ref> Allin's earliest recorded musical endeavors were as a drummer, he also wrote most of his songs on an acoustic guitar. In his mid-teens, he and his older brother Merle, who plays [[bass guitar]], formed their first band, Little Sister's Date, which lasted a little over a year.<ref name=\"hated-merleinterview\" /> The group covered songs by [[Aerosmith]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and other popular [[Rock music|rock]] bands of the time period.<ref name=\"hated-merleinterview\" /> Both Allin and Merle gained a strong interest in [[punk rock]]. [[The Ramones]] and [[the Stooges]] were a strong influence on Allin.\n\nAllin graduated from Concord High School in [[Concord, Vermont]], in 1975, and shortly after formed the band Malpractice with his older brother, local musician Jeff Penny, and Brian Demurs (a high school friend). Allin played the drums for Malpractice until the band separated in 1977. He then became the drummer for the band Stripsearch, which released one 7\" single, containing the songs \"Galileo\" and \"Jesus Over New York\".\n\nFrom September 1977 to April 1984, Allin performed as front man for [[the Jabbers]], in which he played drums and performed vocals. Allin's 1980 debut album was ''[[Always Was, Is and Always Shall Be]]'' for Orange Records. It would be reissued for the first time on CD in 1995 by the Halycon imprint.  At one point, industry veteran and [[the Dead Boys]] producer [[Genya Ravan]] served as his manager. Tension within the Jabbers mounted as Allin grew uncontrollable, uncompromising and vicious. The Jabbers disbanded.\n\nAllin fronted many acts during the early to mid-1980s. This includes albums from the Cedar Street Sluts, the Scumfucs in 1982 and the Texas Nazis in 1985. Allin remained in the [[Underground music|underground]] [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] scene, yet was not part of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] hardcore scene. His performances in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], with the Cedar Street Sluts earned him the nickname of \"the Madman of Manchester\".\n\nAllin gained wider attention with the [[ROIR]] cassette-only release of ''[[Hated in the Nation (album)|Hated in the Nation]]'' (1987) containing tracks from Allin's out-of-print catalog with the Jabbers, the Scumfucs and the Cedar Street Sluts. The tape also featured several in-studio and in-concert recordings with an all-star band assembled by producer ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]'' and early Allin patron [[Mykel Board]]. This band featured [[J Mascis]] of [[Dinosaur Jr.]] on lead guitar and [[Bongwater (band)|Bongwater]] record producer/musician [[Kramer (musician)|Mark Kramer]] on bass.\n\n===Mid-era and more extreme live performances===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\nBy the mid- to late-1980s, Allin was addicted to heroin and alcohol and generally abused any intoxicants provided to him.\n\nAllin first defecated onstage in 1985 at a show in [[Peoria, Illinois]].  According to fellow performer Bloody Mess, \"I was with him when he bought the [[Ex-Lax]]. Unfortunately, he ate it hours before the show, so he constantly had to hold it in or he would've shit before he got onstage... After he shit onstage, complete chaos broke out in the hall... All of the old men in charge of the hall went fucking NUTS!.. Hundreds of confused punk kids were flipping out, running out the door, because the smell was INCREDIBLE.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/swedishscum/bloodymess/interview.html|title=Bloody Mess Interview}}</ref> [[Defecation]] became a regular part of his stage act.\n\nAllin idolized country music legend [[Hank Williams]] and saw himself as a kindred spirit. Both were relative loners and outsiders, both were habitual users of intoxicants, both lived with few, if any, possessions and both traveled the country relentlessly. Allin's acoustic output, documented on the EP ''[[The Troubled Troubador]]'', was heavily influenced by Williams. He recorded his own rewrites of [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]'s \"Family Tradition\" and [[David Allan Coe]]'s \"Longhaired Redneck\", calling his own versions \"Scumfuc Tradition\" and \"Outlaw Scumfuc\", respectively. Later, Allin also released another country album, ''[[Carnival of Excess: Limited Edition|Carnival of Excess]]'', his most refined record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bajalibros.com/AR/Nosotros-los-normales-GG-Ailli-Marcelo-Pisarro-eBook-1744047|title=Nosotros, los normales.

Allin also began performing many [[spoken word]] pieces. Video footage of these is available but rare. Unwilling to seek steady employment, Allin supported himself by selling his own records. Allin was also [[Murderabilia|fascinated with serial killers]]. He wrote to and visited [[John Wayne Gacy]] in prison a number of times and Gacy painted a portrait of Allin, which became the album cover to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]''.\n\nBy this point, Allin's performances, which often resulted in considerable damage to venues and sound equipment, were regularly stopped by police or venue owners after only a few songs. Allin was charged with assault and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] or indecent exposure a number of times. His constant touring was only stopped by jail time or by long hospital stays for broken bones, blood poisoning, and other physical trauma.\n\nAnother attraction to Allin performances was his continual threats of suicide. In 1989, Allin wrote to ''Maximum RocknRoll'' stating that he would die by suicide on stage on Halloween 1989. However, he was in jail when that day came. He continued his threat each following year but ended up imprisoned each following Halloween. When asked why he did not follow through with his threats, Allin stated, \"With GG, you don't get what you expect\u2014you get what you deserve.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killcreek.com/devolution/mykel/124.html |title=You're Wrong, No.&nbsp;124 |publisher=Killcreek.com |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref> He also stated that suicide should only be done when one had reached one's peak, meeting the afterlife at one's strongest point and not at one's weakest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/ekx001/MG/ANT1993MG.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050118083429/http://www.geocities.com/ekx001/MG/ANT1993MG.html |archivedate=January 18, 2005 |title=The GG Allin SuperSite Media Guide \u2013 Anthropomorphic No.&nbsp;1 \u2013 January 1993 |publisher=Geocities.com |date=March 26, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1993, Allin made an appearance on ''[[The Jane Whitney Show]]''. This interview is infamous for being his last interview and for Allin's aggression toward the audience. Allin openly stated that he would die by suicide and take his fans with him. When questioned by Jane, he clarified that he would make them die by suicide as well or he would kill them. Allin also stated that, at 35, he could sleep with 12, 13 and 16-year-old girls, boys and animals and claimed that he raped both women and men at his concerts.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Jane Whitney Show - GG Allin 1993 FULL|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpEDdLgYDF8|language=en|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nov 1989 Letter..jpg|thumb|Letter from November 1989]]\n\n===1989 trial and imprisonment===\nIn late 1989, Allin was arrested and charged with \"assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder\" of a female acquaintance in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].\n\nIn a psychological evaluation made as part of the trial, Allin was judged as having at least average intelligence, and was described as \"courteous, cooperative and candid\". The unnamed evaluator noted that Allin did not appear [[psychotic]], and seemed comfortable with his unorthodox lifestyle. However, the evaluator asserted Allin was dependent on alcohol and had a [[mixed personality disorder]] with [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]] and [[self-defeating personality disorder|masochistic]] features.\n\nAllin initially denied the charges, claiming that the woman was a willing participant in their sexual activities. Allin admitted to cutting her, burning her, and drinking her blood, but insisted that she did the same thing to him. Allin also claimed that inconsistencies in the woman's statements to authorities supported his assertions. The judge in the case agreed there were substantial inconsistencies in the woman's account. Ultimately, however, Allin plea bargained to the reduced charge of felonious assault, and he was imprisoned from December 25, 1989 to March 26, 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecarouser.com/2014/08/31/he-was-your-enemy-part-ii/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919002052/http://thecarouser.com/2014/08/31/he-was-your-enemy-part-ii/ |archivedate=September 19, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt was during this time in prison that Allin began feeling re-energized about his life and \"mission\". He wrote ''The GG Allin Manifesto''<ref>{{cite web|author=GG Allin ggallinonline.com |url=http://ggallinonline.com/mission.php |title=Text of the manifesto |publisher=Ggallinonline.com |date=October 31, 1990 |accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref> during this period.\n\n===''Hated'' documentary and final days===\n{{main|Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies}}\nAfter his release from prison, Allin skipped parole to go on another tour, footage of which was shot for [[Todd Phillips]]'s documentary ''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]''. The film contained graphic scenes from a performance Allin gave at the rock club Space at Chase in [[Manhattan]]'s [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. A heavily intoxicated Allin stripped naked, defecated on the floor, wiped his feces on himself and threw feces into the audience. He also threw beer bottles, breaking a woman's nose, and assaulted several other people in the crowd. Clips were included from other Allin appearances, as well as interviews with Allin, his band, and their fans. The film was released in 1994 and later followed on DVD in 1997.\n\nIn 1991, GG recorded an album entitled ''[[Murder Junkies]]'', released by New Rose Records, featuring [[Antiseen]] as his backing band. This album contained 10 musical tracks and 10 spoken-word pieces. Other than ''Freaks, Faggots, Drunks and Junkies'', Allin considered this album to be that which most accurately captured his persona and stated philosophy on life. It was also during this period that Allin recorded the album ''War in My Head \u2013 I'm Your Enemy'', released on [[Awareness Records]] and featuring the band Shrinkwrap. This particular album consists of one 45-minute track that is a [[Sound collage|collage]] of spoken-word pieces which Shrinkwrap put to music.\n\nAllin's growing notoriety led to appearances on various television shows: ''[[Geraldo (TV series)|Geraldo]]'', ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' and ''The Jane Whitney Show''. At the time of his death, Allin was making plans for a spoken-word album.<ref>{{cite web |author=Al Weisel |url=http://www.livefastdieyoungbook.com/spinggallin.htm |title=Al Weisel \u2013 Death of GG Allin |publisher=Livefastdieyoungbook.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127180133/http://www.livefastdieyoungbook.com/spinggallin.htm |archivedate=January 27, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> He also mentioned a somewhat unlikely European tour, enthusiastically talking about it in the hours before his death.<ref name=\"freakparade.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scumfuc.narod.ru/story6.html|title=A Last Day in the Life of GG Allin|publisher=Freak Parade bassist Mike Bowling|accessdate=March 14, 2012|date=August 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Family and relationships===\nGG Allin married Sandra Farrow on October 6, 1978.<ref name=\"arrest\">Jesus Christ Allin page: \"[http://jesus-christallin.tumblr.com/post/668299872/gg-allins-partial-arrest-record-on-his-death-report GG Allin's Partial Arrest Record on His Death Report]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.\"</ref> They divorced in 1985.<ref name=\"arrest\" />\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Allin became involved with a teenage girl from [[Garland, Texas]] named Tracy Deneault.<ref name=\"arrest\" /> She became pregnant, and their daughter, Nico Ann Deneault, was born March 13, 1986.<ref name=\"arrest\" /> Nico chose to distance herself from her family.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">interview with Arleta on ''The Best of the Murder Junkies'' DVD</ref> Allin and Tracey Deneault never married.<ref name=\"arrest\" /> At the time of his death, GG Allin's \"girlfriend\" was Liz Mankowski.

He revealed on ''[[Geraldo (TV series)|Geraldo]]'' that he believed his body to be a temple of rock and roll, and that his flesh, blood, and bodily fluids were a communion to the people. Another reason given for his onstage antics (by Dino, the drummer of his band) was that he wanted to draw a parallel between his actions and \"a society that's going crazy with violence\". He has also said that if he was not a performer, he would probably be a [[serial killer]] or a [[mass murderer]].<ref name=\"hated\" />\n\nRegarding Allin's views on death, he believed in some form of an [[afterlife]]. He planned to kill himself onstage on [[Halloween]] many times in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but was stopped due to prison sentences around every Halloween each year. He explained his views on death in the film ''[[Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies]]'', stating: \"It's like I've got this wild soul that just wants to get out of this life. It's too confined in this life. I think that to take yourself out at your peak... if you could die at your peak, your strongest point, then your soul will be that much stronger in the next existence.\"<ref>{{cite news |title = GG Allin \u2013 Hated: Special Edition |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9AvIpoV0ps |publisher = MVDmusicvideo |date = June 15, 2011 |accessdate = September 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:GG Allin Grave.jpg|thumb|right|200px|GG Allin's grave in [[Littleton, New Hampshire]]]]\nGG Allin's last show was on June 27, 1993 at a small club called The Gas Station, a punk venue located inside a former gas station at 194 East 2nd Street in [[Manhattan]]. During the second song, the venue cut the power, after which he trashed the club, walked across the street naked, and then continued on, now wearing shorts, but still covered in blood and feces, through the neighborhood, followed by a large group of fans.\n\nAfter walking the streets for almost an hour, Allin eventually went to his friend Johnny Puke's apartment. There, he and others continued to party and use drugs. Sometime during the evening, Allin ingested large amounts of heroin, on which he [[accidental overdose|accidentally overdosed]] and slipped into an unconscious state. Sometime in the early morning of June 28, Allin died from the effects of his heroin overdose. Later that morning, someone noticed that Allin still lay motionless in the same place where they had left him and called for an ambulance. Allin was pronounced dead at the scene.
