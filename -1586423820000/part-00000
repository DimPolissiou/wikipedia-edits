{"title_page": "Printer driver", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{essay-like|date=February 2013}}\n{{Refimprove|article|date=July 2009}}\n}}\n\nIn [[computers]], a '''printer driver''' or a '''print processor''' is a piece of [[software]] on a computer that converts the data to be printed to a format that a [[computer printer|printer]] can understand. The purpose of printer drivers is to allow applications to do printing without being aware of the technical details of each printer model.\n\nPrinter drivers should not be confused with [[print spooler]]s, which queue [[print job]]s and send them successively to a printer.\n\n== Printer drivers in different operating systems ==\n\n=== Unix and Unix-like ===\n[[Unix]] and other [[Unix-like]] systems such as [[Linux]] and [[OS X]] use [[CUPS]] (short for Common Unix Printing System), a modular printing system for Unix-like computer operating systems, which allows a computer to act as a [[print server]]. A computer running CUPS is a host that can accept print jobs from client computers, process them, and send them to the appropriate printer. Printer drivers are typically implemented as [[filter program|filters]]. They are usually named the ''front end'' of the printing system, while the printer spoolers constitute the ''back end''.\n\nBackends are also used to determine the available devices. On startup, each backend is asked for a list of devices it supports, and any information that is available.\n\n=== DOS === <!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[Epson emulation]] redirects here. -->\n[[DOS]] supports predefined character devices <code>[[PRN:]]</code>, <code>[[LPT1:]]</code>, <code>[[LPT2:]]</code> and <code>[[LPT3:]]</code> associated with parallel printers supported in the system. Similarly, serial printers can be used with <code>[[AUX:]]</code>, <code>[[COM1:]]</code>, <code>[[COM2:]]</code>, <code>[[COM3:]]</code> and <code>[[COM4:]]</code>.\n\nUsers can use commands like, for example, \"<code>COPY ''file1'' LPT1:</code>\" to print the content of a file to a printer. The contents is transferred to the printer without any interpretation. Therefore, this method of printing is either for files already stored in the corresponding printer's language or for generic [[text file]]s without more than simple line-oriented formatting.\n\nDOS also provides a dynamically loadable print spooler named [[PRINT (command)|PRINT]] as well as optional support to support screen captures also in graphics mode through [[GRAPHICS]]. If the optional character device driver [[PRINTER.SYS]] is loaded, DOS provides its [[code page]] switching support also for the associated printers&mdash;different types of [[dot matrix printer|dot matrix]] and [[ink jet printer]]s are supported by default.\n\nBeyond this, there are no system-wide printer-specific drivers for use at application level under MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS. Under DR-DOS, however, the [[SCRIPT (command)|SCRIPT]] command can be loaded to run in the background in order to intercept and convert printer output from applications into [[PostScript]] to support PS-capable printers also by applications not supporting them directly.\n\nIn order to support more complex printing for different models of printers, each application (e.g. a [[word processor]]) may be shipped with its own printer drivers, which were essentially descriptions of printer [[escape sequence]]s. Printers, too, have been supplied with drivers for the most popular applications. In addition, it's possible for applications to include tools for editing printer description, in case there was no ready driver. In the days when DOS was widely used, many printers had emulation modes for [[Epson]] FX-80<ref>[http://lprng.sourceforge.net/DISTRIB/RESOURCES/PPD/epson.htm list of Epson FX printer codes]</ref> and [[IBM]] [[List of IBM products|Proprinter]] commands. Many more recent [[laser printer]]s also have emulation modes for [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] [[Printer Command Language|PCL]] (HP LaserJet) or [[PostScript]] printers which will work in DOS. It appears that these are also compatible with Windows 3.x.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/69251 Citizen Printer Emulation Modes for Microsoft Windows 3.0]</ref>\n\n=== Windows ===\nOn [[Microsoft Windows]] systems, printer drivers make use of [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]] ([[Unidrv]] or [[PostScript|PScript]]-based) or [[XML Paper Specification|XPS]] (XPSDrv). Programs then use the same standard [[Application programming interface|APIs]] to draw text and pictures both on screen and on paper. Printers which use GDI natively are commonly referred to as [[Graphics Device Interface#GDI printers|Winprinters]] and are considered incompatible with other operating systems, although there is software (such as PrintFil) which will make these printers work in a DOS prompt within Windows.\n\n[[Win32]] APIs also allow applications to send data directly to the spooler, bypassing the printer driver; however, few applications actually use this option.\n\nThe printer driver is usually located on the C:\\Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository folder on a Windows machine.\n<ref>{{cite web |title=Which Folder Has the Printer Driver Files in Windows 7? |url=https://smallbusiness.chron.com/folder-printer-driver-files-windows-7-57687.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Amiga ===\nThe original AmigaOS up to 1.3 supported printers through a standard series of drivers stored at the required path \"DEVS:Printers\". All printer drivers were stored in that directory, and covered the standard printers in 1985-1989 circa, included [[Epson]] FX standard driver, [[Xerox]] 4020, HP, etcetera.\n\nAny Amiga  printer driver had to communicate though the standard Amiga printer.device (the default standard hardware device of Amiga dealing with printers), and the standard parallel.device (which controlled parallel port) and the driver would then control the printer on its own.\n\nAmiga printer drivers were an innovation for their time. They spared users from individually configuring each of their applications. They had the ability to print up to 4096 colors.\n\nThrough the use of the Printer Preferences program printers could be connected to the serial port as well.\n\nAmiga also had support for a virtual device \"PRT:\" to refer to printer.device so, for example the command \"COPY file TO PRT:\" caused the file to be printed directly bypassing parallel.device and the default printer driver.  \nAmiga used [[ANSI escape code]]s, not the special ones defined by the various printer manufacturers. This way every application on the Amiga could use the same standard set of control sequences and wouldn't need to know which printer is actually connected. The printer driver then translated these standard sequences into the special sequences a certain printer understands.\n\nAmiga internal function \"PWrite\" of printer.device writes 'length' bytes directly to the printer. This function is generally called on by printer drivers to send their buffer(s) to the printer. Number of buffers are decided by the persons who created the driver. Amiga lacked a standard Printer Spooler.\n\nSince AmigaOS 2.0 a standard printer.device was changed to control various printers at same time. The Printer preferences were divided in three main panels: ''Prefs:Printer'' which selects main printer and other basic elements such as \"Print Spacing\" and \"Paper Size\". ''PrinterGFX'' controlled features like Dithering and Scaling. ''PrinterPS'' controlled Postscript Printers. The printer drivers surprisingly remained almost same of Workbench 1.3, with 4096 limits.\n\nThis fact led Amiga users to prefer third party Printer Systems with their own drivers, like [[TurboPrint]] and [[PrintStudio]], which introduced not only recent drivers, but also featured a functioning Printer Spooler into Amiga, and featured 16 million colors printing. [[MorphOS]] uses a special version of TurboPrint to pilot recent printers.\n\nMany Amiga programs like DTP programs as [[PageStream]] featured in the past its own printer drivers.\n\nUSB printers are automatically recognized by the [[Poseidon (USB stack)|Poseidon]] USB Stack. This stack is capable of detecting any USB device by its class, but printers still require a driver to be controlled.\n\n== Types of drivers ==\n\nIn addition to being install-able on a computer, drivers could also be present in the embedded firmware of printers and made available through a networking protocol (e.g. IPP). The embedded firmware of a printer could thus eliminate the need to install any driver on a computer, by accepting print data in a general purpose format (e.g. PDF) via a networking protocol. Despite some efforts to standardize various stages of the printing pipeline, printer interfaces are largely still very proprietary and manufacturer-specific.  Hence, nature of functions performed by drivers can vary.  Nonetheless, based on the function performed, drivers can be classified as follows.\n\n=== Device-independent converters ===\n\nThese drivers can convert print data from one general purpose format (e.g. PDF, DVI etc) to another general purpose format (e.g. PS). Examples include Ghostscript, etc.\n\n=== Converters to device-specific format ===\n\nThese drivers convert print data from one format (e.g. PS) to a final device-specific format that the printer hardware can process and create a print. These drivers act as the last stage in delivering a print job to the printer. These drivers are more likely to be embedded in printer firmware.\n\nExamples of manufacturer specific formats include:\n\n* [[Printer Command Language]] (PCL) ([[Hewlett-Packard]])\n*PS:-(poscript) Adobe\n* Ink Jet Printer Data Stream ([[Kodak]])\n* Samsung Printer Language\n* Ultra Fast Rendering ([[Canon Inc.|Canon]])\n\n== Packaging formats ==\n\nInstall-able drivers can be packaged in various formats. PPD is a popular packaging format for drivers that accept Postscript data or PDF data as input. Due to dominance of select operating systems, the operating system\u2013driver interface is more standardized than driver\u2013printer interfaces. Hence there is more standardization in packaging formats of drivers than the actual functions performed by drivers.\n\n* '''PostScript Printer Description file''' Usually the operating system needs to know the characteristics of a printer. The [[PostScript Printer Description|PPD]] files are the normal way to supply this information. They have the advantage of being system independent, and there is a freely available large database of them, [[Foomatic]].\n\n* '''CUPS filter''' This format is used by [[CUPS]] on Linux systems.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[CUPS]]\n* [[ESC/P]]\n* [[HP Universal Print Driver]] (HP UPD)\n* [[List of emulators#Printers|List of emulators]]\n* [[Open-source hardware]]\n* [[PostScript Printer Description]] (PPD)\n* [[Print (command)]]\n* [[Printer Command Language]] (PCL)\n* [[Technical features new to Windows Vista#Print|Windows Vista printing technologies]]\n* [[Virtual printer]]\n* [[XML Paper Specification]] (XPS)\n* [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF)\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/openprinting/writingandpackagingprinterdrivers Writing and Packaging] (OpenPrinting Project)\n* [https://getassist.net/printer-driver-is-unavailable-how-to-fix/ printer driver is unavailable] (Diver Unavailable)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Printer Driver}}\n[[Category:Device drivers]]\n[[Category:Computer printers]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{essay-like|date=February 2013}}\n{{Refimprove|article|date=July 2009}}\n}}\n\nIn [[computers]], a '''printer driver''' or a '''print processor''' is a piece of [[software]] on a computer that converts the data to be printed to a format that a [[computer printer|printer]] can understand. The purpose of printer drivers is to allow applications to do printing without being aware of the technical details of each printer model.\n\nPrinter drivers should not be confused with [[print spooler]]s, which queue [[print job]]s and send them successively to a printer.\n\n== Printer drivers in different operating systems ==\n\n=== Unix and Unix-like ===\n[[Unix]] and other [[Unix-like]] systems such as [[Linux]] and [[OS X]] use [[CUPS]] (short for Common Unix Printing System), a modular printing system for Unix-like computer operating systems, which allows a computer to act as a [[print server]]. A computer running CUPS is a host that can accept print jobs from client computers, process them, and send them to the appropriate printer. Printer drivers are typically implemented as [[filter program|filters]]. They are usually named the ''front end'' of the printing system, while the printer spoolers constitute the ''back end''.\n\nBackends are also used to determine the available devices. On startup, each backend is asked for a list of devices it supports, and any information that is available.\n\n=== DOS === <!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[Epson emulation]] redirects here. -->\n[[DOS]] supports predefined character devices <code>[[PRN:]]</code>, <code>[[LPT1:]]</code>, <code>[[LPT2:]]</code> and <code>[[LPT3:]]</code> associated with parallel printers supported in the system. Similarly, serial printers can be used with <code>[[AUX:]]</code>, <code>[[COM1:]]</code>, <code>[[COM2:]]</code>, <code>[[COM3:]]</code> and <code>[[COM4:]]</code>.\n\nUsers can use commands like, for example, \"<code>COPY ''file1'' LPT1:</code>\" to print the content of a file to a printer. The contents is transferred to the printer without any interpretation. Therefore, this method of printing is either for files already stored in the corresponding printer's language or for generic [[text file]]s without more than simple line-oriented formatting.\n\nDOS also provides a dynamically loadable print spooler named [[PRINT (command)|PRINT]] as well as optional support to support screen captures also in graphics mode through [[GRAPHICS]]. If the optional character device driver [[PRINTER.SYS]] is loaded, DOS provides its [[code page]] switching support also for the associated printers&mdash;different types of [[dot matrix printer|dot matrix]] and [[ink jet printer]]s are supported by default.\n\nBeyond this, there are no system-wide printer-specific drivers for use at application level under MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS. Under DR-DOS, however, the [[SCRIPT (command)|SCRIPT]] command can be loaded to run in the background in order to intercept and convert printer output from applications into [[PostScript]] to support PS-capable printers also by applications not supporting them directly.\n\nIn order to support more complex printing for different models of printers, each application (e.g. a [[word processor]]) may be shipped with its own printer drivers, which were essentially descriptions of printer [[escape sequence]]s. Printers, too, have been supplied with drivers for the most popular applications. In addition, it's possible for applications to include tools for editing printer description, in case there was no ready driver. In the days when DOS was widely used, many printers had emulation modes for [[Epson]] FX-80<ref>[http://lprng.sourceforge.net/DISTRIB/RESOURCES/PPD/epson.htm list of Epson FX printer codes]</ref> and [[IBM]] [[List of IBM products|Proprinter]] commands.

Bradman's men went through their 34 matches without defeat; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''.\n\nAn experienced right-handed [[batting order (cricket)|opening]] batsman, Brown was on his third visit to England, having first toured in 1934 before [[World War II]]. However, Brown's best years were lost to the war and by 1948 [[Sid Barnes]] and [[Arthur Morris]] had superseded him in the pecking order to become Australia's first-choice opening pair. Brown was selected as a reserve opener; this decision generated controversy among critics who believed he was past his best.\n\nBradman rotated the three openers in the tour matches, but Morris and Barnes were preferred in the Tests. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the [[batting order (cricket)|middle order]] in the Tests. However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and was dropped after making 73 runs at a [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]] of 24.33 in the first two Tests.\n\nDespite his struggles in the Test arena, Brown had success in the tour matches as an opener. He scored 1,448 runs at 57.92 in all [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]], ranking fourth in both the aggregates and averages. He scored eight [[century (cricket)|centuries]], second only to Bradman, including 200 against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]]. However, Brown gained criticism for his slow batting. Following his omission from the Test team, Brown batted in a highly circumspect manner to increase the reliability and volume of his scoring. A very occasional [[off spin]] bowler, Brown took his career first-class best of 4/16 in his only stint with the ball, against the [[South of England cricket team|South of England]].\n\n==Background==\nBrown had been a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, and immediately after [[World War II]], he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]].<ref name=az/> However, he was sidelined by injury in 1946&ndash;47 and [[Sid Barnes]] and [[Arthur Morris]] opened in the Tests, averaging 73.83 and 71.85 respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |url-access=subscription  |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Marylebone_Cricket_Club_in_Australia_1946-47/t_Australia_Batting.html|title=Test Batting and Fielding for Australia Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1946/47 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2009-01-13}}</ref> Brown resumed his Test career in the following season, replacing Barnes, but he was dropped after scoring 29 runs in two Tests. Barnes then came in and made 139 runs in the next two Tests, including a 112 in the Fourth Test.

Bradman's men went through their 34 matches without defeat; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''.\n\nAn experienced right-handed [[batting order (cricket)|opening]] batsman, Brown was on his third visit to England, having first toured in 1934 before [[World War II]]. However, Brown's best years were lost to the war and by 1948 [[Sid Barnes]] and [[Arthur Morris]] had superseded him in the pecking order to become Australia's first-choice opening pair. Brown was selected as a reserve opener; this decision generated controversy among critics who believed he was past his best.\n\nBradman rotated the three openers in the tour matches, but Morris and Barnes were preferred in the Tests. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the [[batting order (cricket)|middle order]] in the Tests. However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and was dropped after making 73 runs at a [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]] of 24.33 in the first two Tests.\n\nDespite his struggles in the Test arena, Brown had success in the tour matches as an opener. He scored 1,448 runs at 57.92 in all [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]], ranking fourth in both the aggregates and averages. He scored eight [[century (cricket)|centuries]], second only to Bradman, including 200 against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]]. However, Brown gained criticism for his slow batting. Following his omission from the Test team, Brown batted in a highly circumspect manner to increase the reliability and volume of his scoring. A very occasional [[off spin]] bowler, Brown took his career first-class best of 4/16 in his only stint with the ball, against the [[South of England cricket team|South of England]].\n\n==Background==\nBrown had been a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, and immediately after [[World War II]], he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]].<ref name=az/> However, he was sidelined by injury in 1946&ndash;47 and [[Sid Barnes]] and [[Arthur Morris]] opened in the Tests, averaging 73.83 and 71.85 respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |url-access=subscription  |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Marylebone_Cricket_Club_in_Australia_1946-47/t_Australia_Batting.html|title=Test Batting and Fielding for Australia Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1946/47 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2009-01-13}}</ref> Brown resumed his Test career in the following season, replacing Barnes, but he was dropped after scoring 29 runs in two Tests. Barnes then came in and made 139 runs in the next two Tests, including a 112 in the Fourth Test. Morris was then rested for the Fifth Test to allow Brown another chance to show his ability and make a case for continued national selection, and he made 99.<ref name=az/> In the Tests against [[India national cricket team|India]] during the season, Barnes, Morris and Brown had shared the opening duties; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively.<ref>{{Cite web |url-access=subscription  |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/t_Australia_Batting.html |title=Test Batting and Fielding for Australia India in Australia 1947/48 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2009-01-13}}</ref> In any case, Brown had done enough to [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|tour England with ''The Invincibles'' in 1948]], his third trip there, although Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination.<ref name=\"az\"/>\n\n==Early tour==\nAustralia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].<ref name=haigh>{{Cite news| title=Gentrifying the game| first=Gideon | last=Haigh| authorlink=Gideon Haigh| url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295893.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=26 May 2007| accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> Brown gained selection, although Bradman batted him out of position in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened.

Spoken as a [[first language]] by around two million people, it serves as the official language of [[North Macedonia]]. Most speakers can be found in the country and [[Macedonian diaspora|its diaspora]], with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]]. Macedonian is also a recognized [[minority language]] in parts of [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Romania]], and [[Serbia]] and spoken by emigrant communities predominantly in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].\n\nMacedonian developed out of the western [[dialect]]s of the East South Slavic [[dialect continuum]], whose earliest recorded form is \"[[Old Church Slavonic]]\". During much of its history, this dialect continuum was called \"Bulgarian\", although in the 19th century, its western dialects came to be known separately as \"Macedonian\". [[Standard Macedonian]] was codified in 1945 and has developed [[Macedonian literature#Modern literature|modern literature]] since.<ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{Harvnb|Thornburg|Fuller|2006|page=213}}</ref> As it is part of a dialect continuum with other [[South Slavic language]]s, Macedonian has a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]].\n\nLinguists distinguish 29 [[dialects of Macedonian]], with linguistic differences separating Western and Eastern groups of dialects. Some features of [[Macedonian grammar]] are the use of a dynamic [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] that falls on the ante-penultimate syllable, three suffixed [[deixis|deictic articles]] that indicate noun position in reference to the speaker and several simple and complex verb tenses. [[Macedonian orthography]] is phonemic with a correspondence of one [[grapheme]] per [[phoneme]]. It is written using an adapted 31-letter version of the [[Cyrillic script]] with several original letters. Macedonian [[syntax]] is of the [[subject-object-verb]] (SOV) type and has flexible [[word order]].\n\nMacedonian vocabulary has been historically influenced by [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Somewhat less prominent vocabulary influences also came from neighboring and [[prestige (linguistics)|prestige languages]]. Since Macedonian and Bulgarian are mutually intelligible, share many common linguistic features and are socio-historically related, some [[political views on the Macedonian language|linguists are divided in their views]] of the two as separate languages or as a single [[pluricentric language]].\n\n==Classification and related languages==\n[[File:Slavic languages tree.svg|thumb|left|alt=Language-tree graph|300px|Classification of Macedonian within the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] branch of the Indo-European language family]]\nThe modern Macedonian language belongs to the [[East South Slavic languages|eastern group]] of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] branch of [[Slavic languages]] in the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, together with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and the extinct [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Some authors also classify the [[Torlakian dialects]] in this group. Macedonian's closest relative is Bulgarian followed by [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]], although the last is more distantly related.<ref name=\"periods435\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=435}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> Together, South Slavic languages form a [[dialect continuum]].<ref name=\"Dedaicpage\">{{Harvnb|Dedai\u0107|Mi\u0161kovi\u0107-Lukovi\u0107|2010|page=?}}</ref><ref name=\"kortmann\">{{Harvnb|Kortmann|van der Auwera|2011|page=420}}</ref> \n\nMacedonian, like the other Eastern South Slavic idioms has characteristics that make it part of the [[Balkan sprachbund]], a group of languages that share [[linguistic typology|typological]], grammatical and lexical features based on areal convergence, rather than genetic proximity.<ref name=\"Topolinjska6\" /> In that sense, Macedonian has experienced convergent evolution with other languages that belong to this group such as Greek, [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Romani language|Romani]] due to cultural and linguistic exchanges that occurred primarily through oral communication.<ref name=\"Topolinjska6\" />\n\nMacedonian and Bulgarian are divergent from the remaining South Slavic languages in that they do not use [[noun case]]s (except for the [[vocative]], and apart from some traces of once productive inflections still found scattered throughout these two) and have lost the [[infinitive]].<ref name=\"Fortson\">{{Harvnb|Fortson|2009|page=431}}</ref> They are also the only Slavic languages with any definite articles (unlike standard Bulgarian, which uses only one article, standard Macedonian as well as some south-eastern Bulgarian dialects<ref name=\"Comrie245\">{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=245}}</ref> have a set of three [[Deixis|deictic]] articles: unspecified, proximal and distal definite article).

Several words are taken as a single unit and thus follow the rules of the stress falling on the antepenultimate syllable.

The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] participle in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]]. Macedonian distinguishes at least 12 major [[part of speech|word classes]], five of which are modifiable and include nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numbers and verbs and seven of which are invariant and include [[adverb]]s, prepositions, [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s, [[interjection]]s, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and [[Linguistic modality|modal words]].<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe vocative of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns.

The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills).

As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three definite articles, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives accompany nouns and serve to provide additional information about their referents. Macedonian adjectives [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in form with the noun they modify and are thus are thus inflected for gender, number and definiteness and  ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432'' changes to ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'', a beautiful woman) when used to describe a feminine noun, ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e'' when used to describe a neuter noun (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', a beautiful child) and ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438'' when used to form the plural (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'').<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nAdjectives can be analytically inflected for degree of [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] with the prefix ''\u043f\u043e-'' marking the [[comparative]] and the prefix ''\u043d\u0430\u0458-'' marking the [[superlative]].

Case relations are marked in pronouns. Personal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant.\n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and past tense of the verb conjugated for the person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, Voice, Mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a grammatical aspect (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117\"/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long). In addition to its primary functions, the imperative is used to indicate actions in the past, eternal truths as is the case in sayings and a condition. The Macedonian conditional is conjugated in the same way for all three persons using the particle ''\u0431\u0438'' and the verbal l-form,  ''\u0431\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b'' (I/you/he would read).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n===Syntax===\nMacedonian syntax has a [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) [[word order]] which is nevertheless flexible and can be [[tropicalization|tropicalized]].<ref name=\"gramatika\" /> For instance, the sentence ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d'' (Marija loves Ivan) can become of the [[object\u2013verb\u2013subject]] (OVS) form as well, ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430''.<ref name=\"u116\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=116}}</ref> Tropicalization can also be achieved using a combination of word order and intonation; as an example all of the following sentences give a different point of emphasis:\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the subject)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on both the subject and the verb)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the verb and the object)<ref name=\"Friedman50\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=50}}</ref>\n\nMacedonian is a [[null-subject language]] which means that the subject pronoun can be omitted, for instance ''\u0428\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0448 (\u0442\u0438)?''

Spoken as a [[first language]] by around two million people, it serves as the official language of [[North Macedonia]]. Most speakers can be found in the country and [[Macedonian diaspora|its diaspora]], with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]]. Macedonian is also a recognized [[minority language]] in parts of [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Romania]], and [[Serbia]] and spoken by emigrant communities predominantly in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].\n\nMacedonian developed out of the western [[dialect]]s of the East South Slavic [[dialect continuum]], whose earliest recorded form is \"[[Old Church Slavonic]]\". During much of its history, this dialect continuum was called \"Bulgarian\", although in the 19th century, its western dialects came to be known separately as \"Macedonian\". [[Standard Macedonian]] was codified in 1945 and has developed [[Macedonian literature#Modern literature|modern literature]] since.<ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{Harvnb|Thornburg|Fuller|2006|page=213}}</ref> As it is part of a dialect continuum with other [[South Slavic language]]s, Macedonian has a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]].\n\nLinguists distinguish 29 [[dialects of Macedonian]], with linguistic differences separating Western and Eastern groups of dialects. Some features of [[Macedonian grammar]] are the use of a dynamic [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] that falls on the ante-penultimate syllable, three suffixed [[deixis|deictic articles]] that indicate noun position in reference to the speaker and several simple and complex verb tenses. [[Macedonian orthography]] is phonemic with a correspondence of one [[grapheme]] per [[phoneme]]. It is written using an adapted 31-letter version of the [[Cyrillic script]] with several original letters. Macedonian [[syntax]] is of the [[subject-object-verb]] (SOV) type and has flexible [[word order]].\n\nMacedonian vocabulary has been historically influenced by [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Somewhat less prominent vocabulary influences also came from neighboring and [[prestige (linguistics)|prestige languages]]. Since Macedonian and Bulgarian are mutually intelligible, share many common linguistic features and are socio-historically related, some [[political views on the Macedonian language|linguists are divided in their views]] of the two as separate languages or as a single [[pluricentric language]].\n\n==Classification and related languages==\n[[File:Slavic languages tree.svg|thumb|left|alt=Language-tree graph|300px|Classification of Macedonian within the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] branch of the Indo-European language family]]\nThe modern Macedonian language belongs to the [[East South Slavic languages|eastern group]] of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] branch of [[Slavic languages]] in the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, together with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and the extinct [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Some authors also classify the [[Torlakian dialects]] in this group.

[[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441}} {{IPA-mk|\u02c8v\u025b\u02d0l\u025bs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'.

This means that it falls on the third from last [[syllable]] in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source.<ref name=\"usikova109\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=109\u2013110}}</ref> To note which syllable of the word should be accented, Macedonian uses an apostrophe over its vowels.

Several words are taken as a single unit and thus follow the rules of the stress falling on the antepenultimate syllable. The rule applies when using [[clitics]] (either enclitics or proclitics) such as the negating particle ''\u043d\u0435'' with verbs (''\u0442\u043e\u0458 \u043d\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he did not come) and with short pronoun forms. The future particle ''\u045c\u0435'' can also be used in-between and falls under the same rules (''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u043c\u0443  \u035c  \u0458\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u0430\u0434\u0435'', did not give it to him; ''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u045c\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he will not come).<ref name=\"matura\" /> Other uses include the [[imperative form]] accompanied by short pronoun forms (''\u0434\u00e1\u0458  \u035c  \u043c\u0438'': give me), the expression of possessives (''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430  \u035c  \u043c\u0438''), prepositions followed by a noun (''\u0437\u00e1\u0434  \u035c  \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430''), question words followed by verbs (''\u043a\u043e\u0433\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'') and some compound nouns (''\u0441\u0443\u0432\u00f3  \u035c  \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0458\u0435'' - raisins, ''\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u00f3  \u035c  \u043c\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e'' - yoghurt) among others.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Macedonian grammar}}\n\nMacedonian grammar is markedly [[Analytic language|analytic]] in comparison with other Slavic languages, having lost the common Slavic [[case system]]. The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] participle in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]]. Macedonian distinguishes at least 12 major [[part of speech|word classes]], five of which are modifiable and include nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numbers and verbs and seven of which are invariant and include [[adverb]]s, prepositions, [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s, [[interjection]]s, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and [[Linguistic modality|modal words]].<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe vocative of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{Harvnb|Bogdanoska|2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills). Irregular plural forms also exist in the language: ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 - \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'' (child - children).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Definiteness====\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+The definite articles\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" |\n!colspan=\"3\" | Singular\n!colspan=\"3\" | Plural\n|-\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n|-\n!Unspecified\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0442''''' \n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0442\u0430''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' \n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0442\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0442\u0435''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0442\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Proximate\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0432'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0432o'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''\n|  ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Distal\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u043d'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u043do'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n|}\n\nA characteristic feature of the nominal system is the indication of [[definiteness]]. As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three definite articles, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives accompany nouns and serve to provide additional information about their referents. Macedonian adjectives [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in form with the noun they modify and are thus are thus inflected for gender, number and definiteness and  ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432'' changes to ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'', a beautiful woman) when used to describe a feminine noun, ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e'' when used to describe a neuter noun (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', a beautiful child) and ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438'' when used to form the plural (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'').<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nAdjectives can be analytically inflected for degree of [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] with the prefix ''\u043f\u043e-'' marking the [[comparative]] and the prefix ''\u043d\u0430\u0458-'' marking the [[superlative]].

Case relations are marked in pronouns. Personal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant.\n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and past tense of the verb conjugated for the person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, Voice, Mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a grammatical aspect (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117\"/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long). In addition to its primary functions, the imperative is used to indicate actions in the past, eternal truths as is the case in sayings and a condition. The Macedonian conditional is conjugated in the same way for all three persons using the particle ''\u0431\u0438'' and the verbal l-form,  ''\u0431\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b'' (I/you/he would read).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n===Syntax===\nMacedonian syntax has a [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) [[word order]] which is nevertheless flexible and can be [[tropicalization|tropicalized]].<ref name=\"gramatika\" /> For instance, the sentence ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d'' (Marija loves Ivan) can become of the [[object\u2013verb\u2013subject]] (OVS) form as well, ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430''.<ref name=\"u116\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=116}}</ref> Tropicalization can also be achieved using a combination of word order and intonation; as an example all of the following sentences give a different point of emphasis:\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the subject)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on both the subject and the verb)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the verb and the object)<ref name=\"Friedman50\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=50}}</ref>\n\nMacedonian is a [[null-subject language]] which means that the subject pronoun can be omitted, for instance ''\u0428\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0448 (\u0442\u0438)?''

The COSC gives the Navy and Marine Corps the best of the current NMCI IT environment while driving operations continuity, cost savings, network control, competition and contract management.  Under the COSC, the Navy retains the same scope of NMCI services with [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], but the network becomes a government-owned, contractor-supported, managed services environment.<ref>[http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2010/100708xa.html U.S. Department of the Navy Signs Enterprise Information Technology Services Contract with HP<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThis is a paradigm shift because under the original NMCI contract, the government managed the network at a distance and did not own any IT assets used in the program.<ref>[https://www.cnatra.navy.mil/pubs/folder2/5231.3A.pdf Department Of The Navy Letterhead<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Rather, they were owned by the prime contractor, and services are provided to the government on a per-seat basis. Pricing is primarily assessed on a per-machine basis that includes security services, help desk support, and periodic technology upgrades; however, fees for additional services (such as [[SIPRnet|classified]] connectivity, mission-critical service, additional user accounts, software installation, seat moves, remote access from mobile devices, etc.) did apply. Videophones that provide equal access for Deaf employees are not permissible under NMCI regulations. As of October 2007, the per-seat price for all of NMCI was reduced by 15 percent. Desktop PCs and laptops as well as other network components are being continually upgraded in order to enhance performance and security.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nNMCI is the first large-scale federal government IT centralization and outsourcing project. Its lessons have informed other government agency efforts to consolidate and outsource IT services.  According to industry analyst Warren Suss of Suss consulting, \"In the long run, government agencies will come to see the need for similar types of solutions, and I think they'll look to NMCI for lessons learned.\"<ref>[http://www.fcw.com/print/13_32/news/103696-1.html Love/hate relationship with NMCI<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe NMCI program is managed by the Navy's [[Project management office|Program Executive Office\u2013Enterprise Information Systems]] (PEO-EIS).\n\n==History==\n{{update|section|reason=Appears to have no discussion of developments since 2006|date=April 2018}}\nOn 6 October 2000, the NMCI contract was awarded to [[Electronic Data Systems]] (EDS), now [[HP Enterprise Services]] (HP).<ref>[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/051308-hp-buys-eds-for-139.html HP buys EDS for $13.9 billion<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Secretary of the Navy Gordon England summed up the Navy's IT Environment prior to the commencement of NMCI: \u201cWe basically had 28 separate commands budgeting, developing, licensing, and operating IT autonomously.  It was inefficient and from the larger Department perspective, produced results that were far from optimal.\u201d<ref>http://www.navy.mil/navydata/people/secnav/england/speeches/england040622.txt</ref>\n\nNMCI consolidated roughly 6,000 networks\u2014some of which could not e-mail, let alone collaborate with each other\u2014into a single integrated and secure IT environment. HP updated more than 100,000 desktop and laptop PCs in 2007.<ref>http://www.military-information-technology.com/article.cfm?DocID=2324 and http://www.ndu.edu/CTNSP/pubs/CaseStudy%2012%20-%20NMCI.pdf\n</ref>  The program also consolidated an ad hoc network of more than 8,000 applications to 500 in four years and 15,003 logistics and readiness systems to 2,759 over a two-year period.<ref>[http://www.softwaremag.com/L.cfm?Doc=1100-12/2007 Software Magazine \u2013 Gaining Visibility Into Applications<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSub-contractors to HP include:\n*[[Apple Inc.]], [[Cisco]], [[Dell]], [[DTech]], [[McAfee]], [[Microsoft]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[Sun Microsystems]], and [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]]<ref>(NMCI): Small Business Program \u2013 http://www.eds.com/sites/nmci/smallbusiness/</ref>\n*[[Harris Corporation]] (which acquired Multimax formerly known as Netco Government Services and WAM!NET), which provided enterprise [[network infrastructure]] design and support until its contract expired in 2014.<ref>http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/gao-throws-out-harris-corp-protest-ngen/2013-11-01</ref>\n*[[Verizon]], which provides [[wide area network]] (WAN) connectivity.\nHP also provides the security services once provided by [[Raytheon]].\n\nHP also has worked with more than 400 [[small businesses]], with 5 percent for small disadvantaged businesses, 5 percent for women-owned small businesses and 1.5 percent for [[HUBZone]] small businesses.

The tool helps provide enhanced situational awareness via increased information sharing and collaboration to commanders by giving them a common picture of network performance.  Commanders can see scheduled maintenance tasks and other issues impacting the network, giving them the option to defer work that might affect the flow of critical information from the battlefield.<ref>[http://www.c4isrjournal.com/story.php?F=4064703 U.S. Navy expands network alert effort \u2013 C4ISRJournal.com \u2013 Military Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nWork in 2008 has increased NMCI's ability to respond to security issues and the program was the first network to implement fully the Department of Defense information assurance standards in both classified and unclassified environments. Among the enhancements were the deployment of Websense content filtering, an information assurance tool designed to inspect and block inbound Web traffic containing malicious code with little impact to the user. According to NMCI public affairs, \"Websense allows the Network Operational Commands to set a tailored blocking policy by content such as gambling, hate speech or adult content, rather than blocking specific sites or URLs only. This allows the network operators to block sites much more efficiently and outsources the fight against the growing amount of inappropriate content.\"<ref name=\"navy.mil\">[http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=36432 Information Assurance is Top Priority at Kings Bay<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAccording to the Navy, Websense enables users to block or unblock sites, based on emerging and/or dynamic threats. The NMCI blocking policy is determined by various operational commands, such as the Naval Network Warfare Command, and enforced by the Global Network Operations Center, based in Norfolk.  Blocked sites are redirected to a notification page which then links to a page on NMCI's homeport Web site. On this site, a user can submit a request that a site be unblocked in order to support mission requirements.<ref name=\"navy.mil\"/>\n\nIn addition, NMCI is upgrading existing servers with Bluecoat proxy servers, which provides better capacity and traffic management functions. According to NMCI's own data, a few users account for the majority of NMCI's bandwidth usage, mostly attributed to streaming internet radio and video. New servers will allow bandwidth usage monitoring, down to a command or user level.<ref name=\"navy.mil\"/>\n\nThe security upgrades have been well received by the Navy. On 31 March 2009, Rear Admiral (Ret.) John A. Gauss, Acquisition Director for the NGEN System Program Office (SPO) said during a press conference that \"NMCI is the most secure network within the Navy.\"<ref>[http://thepacketrat.com/ The Packet Rat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Navy and HP measure end-user satisfaction through a series of quarterly satisfaction surveys.  End user satisfaction has steadily improved, reaching a high of nearly 86% in February 2008, as compared to 80% in December 2006. This is largely due to the upgrade of nearly 112,000 desktop and laptop computers in 2007, and a combination of network enhancements that are improving speed and reliability.  HP is on track to upgrade another 120,000 seats in 2008 at Navy and Marine Corps bases in the US and Asia.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nWorking in tandem with the technology refresh are the virtualization efforts on the network.  NMCI is on track to move from 2,700 servers down to roughly 300. The efforts are expected to save more than $1.6&nbsp;million per year in electricity costs.<ref>[http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/data_centers/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=211100206 U.S. Navy Intranet Realizes Big Savings Through Virtualization \u2013 InformationWeek<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Additionally, the decrease in the number of servers being refreshed will lower the cost of updating the equipment, leading to a potential savings of at least $1.5&nbsp;million over four years.<ref>http://www.fedtechmagazine.com/article.asp?item_id=592</ref>\n\nA highlight of the Navy's virtualization efforts was its win of InfoWorld's 2009 Green 15 Award, which honors 15 companies and/or organizations for their green IT projects.<ref>http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/green-it-leaders-2009-050</ref> Ted Samson, Senior Analyst for InfoWorld said of the honorees, \"This year's Green 15 winners demonstrate, once again, that green IT projects can be a win-win proposition. These organizations have not only helped the planet by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, preserving trees, and keeping e-waste out of landfills. They've also reaped measurable business benefits, such as significantly lower electricity bills, fewer hardware refreshes, and postponed datacenter-expansion projects \u2013 along with gains in efficiency and productivity.\"\n\nIn 2006, the NMCI program office was criticized for its annual customer-satisfaction surveys. Officials refuse to release the raw data, leading to accusations that their conclusions are overly sunny. One NMCI director, Rear Admiral [[James B. Godwin III]], said releasing the results would challenge the \"integrity of our data.\"\n\nThe Department of the Navy has shown no desire to scale back or cancel the program.  On 24 March 2006 the Navy exercised its three-year, $3&nbsp;billion option to extend the contract through September 2010.<ref name=\"EDS\" />\n\nIn April 2006, users began to log on with [[Common Access Card]]s (CACs), a smartcard-based logon system called the [[Cryptographic Log On]] (CLO). In October 2008, NMCI's prime contractor HP posted a set of procedures so Apple Mac users can access NMCI's public-facing Web services, such as the e-mail and calendar functions, using their CAC readers with their Macs. The workaround also works with other Defense Department CAC-enabled networks.<ref>EDS cooks up fix for NMCI's Mac users --http://mobile.gcn.com/articles/vol1_no1/47356-1.html</ref>  Alternatively, NMCI and all other CAC-authenticated DoD websites may be accessed using LPS-Public.\n\nAfter early challenges, the Navy is pleased with the performance and security of the NMCI network. According to [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] Tim Holland, program manager for the Navy's Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN), \"NMCI is very robust today{{when|date=April 2018}}\u2014we have good security with it, very good performance.\"<ref name=\"seapower-digital.com\"/> In an interview the DoN CIO Robert J. Carey stated, \"The plan is that NGEN <Next Generation Enterprise Network > will be in place before the NMCI contract expires because it is not a renewable contract. According to the Navy, NMCI will serve as the baseline from which it will transition to NGEN.<ref name=\"seapower-digital.com\"/>\n\nThe Navy's confidence in NMCI today{{when|date=April 2018}} marks a significant turnaround from the challenges cited in the GAO\u2019s report of December 2006.  The report states that \" NMCI has not met its two strategic goals\u2014to provide information superiority and to foster innovation via interoperability and shared services.\"  The document also goes on to evaluate HP's performance, \"GAO's analysis of available performance data, however, showed that the Navy had met only 3 of 20 performance targets (15 percent) associated with the program's goals and nine related performance categories.\"\n\nIn contrast are the more recent comments{{when|date=April 2018}} from [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Harry B. Harris Jr.]], deputy chief of naval operations for communication networks (OPNAV N-6) and deputy chief information officer, Department of the Navy. \"I believe that NMCI in 2008 is achieving much of what we had hoped NMCI would achieve. It's leveled the playing field for security. It's allowed us to do things like push security patches that go through the whole enterprise that's on NMCI. If you look at NMCI historically, it was probably the first step for the Navy to move into what was then called Joint Vision 2010 and now is Joint Vision 2020. It's actually done that, and it's moving the Navy toward the U.S. Defense Department's goal of information superiority. So, I see a lot of good things with NMCI.\"<ref name=Governance/>\n\nNMCI works today{{when|date=April 2018}} and it continues to improve as user needs evolve and technology opportunities arise. During the final two years{{when|date=April 2018}} of the contract, technology initiatives included new hardware, applications, and services to support the Navy and Marine Corps' advanced IT needs. HP will install more than 110,000 new laptops and desktops, and will push more upgrades to improve end-users' IT capabilities through upgraded machine capacity, new operating systems, and new service lines.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Today{{when|date=April 2018}}==\n{{update|section|reason=Appears to discuss 2011 as \"today\" without discussing what happened later|date=April 2018}}\nThe Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) program office, in collaboration with NMCI partner HP, which manages the CoSC program, is deploying a number of new Navy initiatives, including:\n \nTablet laptops for Navy recruiters\n* The NRC began rolling out Hewlett-Packard (HP) Elitebook 2740p Tablets to recruiters in early September 2011.\nHosted Virtual Desktop (HVD) capability\n* Thin-client HVDs using network storage will replace bulkier traditional workstations.\nExpanded support for smartcards\n* [[Two-factor authentication]] using a SIPRNET smartcard token will be used to confirm the identity of NMCI users.\nEnterprise-wide operating system upgrade and improved end-user hardware delivery times\n* New five-day seat deployment initiative aims to speed up the delivery time of new workstations.<ref>{{cite web|title=NMCI Continues to Provide Solutions for Sailors and Marines|url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/chips/ArticleDetails.aspx?ID=3572|work=CHIPS Magazine}}</ref>\n\n==Next Steps for NMCI==\n{{update|section|reason=Appears to discuss plans in 2009 without discussing what happened later.|date=April 2018}}\nOn 31 March 2009, the Department of the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare System Command announced its intention to negotiate a Continuity of Service Contract (COSC) that would allow HP to continue to provide IT services during the transition from the existing contract (NMCI) to the proposed next contract, known as Next Generation Enterprise Network Solution (NGEN).\n\nUnder the new contract, HP will continue NMCI services, support the transition to NGEN (which includes various engineering services), and give the Navy licenses for the network's operations and infrastructure.  A chief goal of the new contract is to ensure that the network remains up-and-running while the Navy pursues the goals of NGEN.\n\nAs Rear Admiral John Goodwin, assistant chief of naval operations of NGEN notes, \"My responsibilities are to synchronize the efforts of the operations, the policy, the programming, the resources and the acquisition piece,\" Goodwin said.<ref>http://fcw.com/Articles/2009/04/06/NMCI-NGEN.aspx</ref</ref>\n\n==Network Security, Functionality vs. Users\u2019 Permissions, Expectations==\n{{update|section|reason=Appears to discuss 2007 without discussing what happened later|date=April 2018}}\nIn November 2007, a quarterly user satisfaction rating between both the United States Marine Corps. and the United States Navy revealed that 83.8 percent of the military members who submitted the survey said that NMCI was satisfactory.

The COSC gives the Navy and Marine Corps the best of the current NMCI IT environment while driving operations continuity, cost savings, network control, competition and contract management.  Under the COSC, the Navy retains the same scope of NMCI services with [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], but the network becomes a government-owned, contractor-supported, managed services environment.<ref>[http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2010/100708xa.html U.S. Department of the Navy Signs Enterprise Information Technology Services Contract with HP<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThis is a paradigm shift because under the original NMCI contract, the government managed the network at a distance and did not own any IT assets used in the program.<ref>[https://www.cnatra.navy.mil/pubs/folder2/5231.3A.pdf Department Of The Navy Letterhead<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Rather, they were owned by the prime contractor, and services are provided to the government on a per-seat basis. Pricing is primarily assessed on a per-machine basis that includes security services, help desk support, and periodic technology upgrades; however, fees for additional services (such as [[SIPRnet|classified]] connectivity, mission-critical service, additional user accounts, software installation, seat moves, remote access from mobile devices, etc.) did apply. Videophones that provide equal access for Deaf employees are not permissible under NMCI regulations. As of October 2007, the per-seat price for all of NMCI was reduced by 15 percent. Desktop PCs and laptops as well as other network components are being continually upgraded in order to enhance performance and security.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nNMCI is the first large-scale federal government IT centralization and outsourcing project. Its lessons have informed other government agency efforts to consolidate and outsource IT services.  According to industry analyst Warren Suss of Suss consulting, \"In the long run, government agencies will come to see the need for similar types of solutions, and I think they'll look to NMCI for lessons learned.\"<ref>[http://www.fcw.com/print/13_32/news/103696-1.html Love/hate relationship with NMCI<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe NMCI program is managed by the Navy's [[Project management office|Program Executive Office\u2013Enterprise Information Systems]] (PEO-EIS).\n\n==History==\n{{update|section|reason=Appears to have no discussion of developments since 2006|date=April 2018}}\nOn 6 October 2000, the NMCI contract was awarded to [[Electronic Data Systems]] (EDS), now [[HP Enterprise Services]] (HP).<ref>[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/051308-hp-buys-eds-for-139.html HP buys EDS for $13.9 billion<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Secretary of the Navy Gordon England summed up the Navy's IT Environment prior to the commencement of NMCI: \u201cWe basically had 28 separate commands budgeting, developing, licensing, and operating IT autonomously.

The tool helps provide enhanced situational awareness via increased information sharing and collaboration to commanders by giving them a common picture of network performance.  Commanders can see scheduled maintenance tasks and other issues impacting the network, giving them the option to defer work that might affect the flow of critical information from the battlefield.<ref>[http://www.c4isrjournal.com/story.php?F=4064703 U.S. Navy expands network alert effort \u2013 C4ISRJournal.com \u2013 Military Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nWork in 2008 has increased NMCI's ability to respond to security issues and the program was the first network to implement fully the Department of Defense information assurance standards in both classified and unclassified environments. Among the enhancements were the deployment of Websense content filtering, an information assurance tool designed to inspect and block inbound Web traffic containing malicious code with little impact to the user. According to NMCI public affairs, \"Websense allows the Network Operational Commands to set a tailored blocking policy by content such as gambling, hate speech or adult content, rather than blocking specific sites or URLs only. This allows the network operators to block sites much more efficiently and outsources the fight against the growing amount of inappropriate content.\"<ref name=\"navy.mil\">[http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=36432 Information Assurance is Top Priority at Kings Bay<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAccording to the Navy, Websense enables users to block or unblock sites, based on emerging and/or dynamic threats. The NMCI blocking policy is determined by various operational commands, such as the Naval Network Warfare Command, and enforced by the Global Network Operations Center, based in Norfolk.  Blocked sites are redirected to a notification page which then links to a page on NMCI's homeport Web site. On this site, a user can submit a request that a site be unblocked in order to support mission requirements.<ref name=\"navy.mil\"/>\n\nIn addition, NMCI is upgrading existing servers with Bluecoat proxy servers, which provides better capacity and traffic management functions. According to NMCI's own data, a few users account for the majority of NMCI's bandwidth usage, mostly attributed to streaming internet radio and video. New servers will allow bandwidth usage monitoring, down to a command or user level.<ref name=\"navy.mil\"/>\n\nThe security upgrades have been well received by the Navy. On 31 March 2009, Rear Admiral (Ret.) John A. Gauss, Acquisition Director for the NGEN System Program Office (SPO) said during a press conference that \"NMCI is the most secure network within the Navy.\"<ref>[http://thepacketrat.com/ The Packet Rat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Navy and HP measure end-user satisfaction through a series of quarterly satisfaction surveys.  End user satisfaction has steadily improved, reaching a high of nearly 86% in February 2008, as compared to 80% in December 2006. This is largely due to the upgrade of nearly 112,000 desktop and laptop computers in 2007, and a combination of network enhancements that are improving speed and reliability.  HP is on track to upgrade another 120,000 seats in 2008 at Navy and Marine Corps bases in the US and Asia.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nWorking in tandem with the technology refresh are the virtualization efforts on the network.  NMCI is on track to move from 2,700 servers down to roughly 300. The efforts are expected to save more than $1.6&nbsp;million per year in electricity costs.<ref>[http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/data_centers/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=211100206 U.S. Navy Intranet Realizes Big Savings Through Virtualization \u2013 InformationWeek<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Additionally, the decrease in the number of servers being refreshed will lower the cost of updating the equipment, leading to a potential savings of at least $1.5&nbsp;million over four years.<ref>http://www.fedtechmagazine.com/article.asp?item_id=592</ref>\n\nA highlight of the Navy\u2019s virtualization efforts was its win of InfoWorld\u2019s 2009 Green 15 Award, which honors 15 companies and/or organizations for their green IT projects.<ref>http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/green-it-leaders-2009-050</ref> Ted Samson, Senior Analyst for InfoWorld said of the honorees, \"This year's Green 15 winners demonstrate, once again, that green IT projects can be a win-win proposition. These organizations have not only helped the planet by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, preserving trees, and keeping e-waste out of landfills. They've also reaped measurable business benefits, such as significantly lower electricity bills, fewer hardware refreshes, and postponed datacenter-expansion projects \u2013 along with gains in efficiency and productivity.\"\n\nIn 2006, the NMCI program office was criticized for its annual customer-satisfaction surveys. Officials refuse to release the raw data, leading to accusations that their conclusions are overly sunny. One NMCI director, Rear Admiral [[James B. Godwin III]], said releasing the results would challenge the \"integrity of our data.\"\n\nThe Department of the Navy has shown no desire to scale back or cancel the program.  On 24 March 2006 the Navy exercised its three-year, $3&nbsp;billion option to extend the contract through September 2010.<ref name=\"EDS\" />\n\nIn April 2006, users began to log on with [[Common Access Card]]s (CACs), a smartcard-based logon system called the [[Cryptographic Log On]] (CLO). In October 2008, NMCI's prime contractor HP posted a set of procedures so Apple Mac users can access NMCI's public-facing Web services, such as the e-mail and calendar functions, using their CAC readers with their Macs. The workaround also works with other Defense Department CAC-enabled networks.<ref>EDS cooks up fix for NMCI's Mac users --http://mobile.gcn.com/articles/vol1_no1/47356-1.html</ref>  Alternatively, NMCI and all other CAC-authenticated DoD websites may be accessed using LPS-Public.\n\nAfter early challenges, the Navy is pleased with the performance and security of the NMCI network. According to [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] Tim Holland, program manager for the Navy's Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN), \"NMCI is very robust today{{when|date=April 2018}}\u2014we have good security with it, very good performance.\"<ref name=\"seapower-digital.com\"/> In an interview the DoN CIO Robert J. Carey stated, \"The plan is that NGEN <Next Generation Enterprise Network > will be in place before the NMCI contract expires because it is not a renewable contract. According to the Navy, NMCI will serve as the baseline from which it will transition to NGEN.<ref name=\"seapower-digital.com\"/>\n\nThe Navy's confidence in NMCI today{{when|date=April 2018}} marks a significant turnaround from the challenges cited in the GAO\u2019s report of December 2006.  The report states that \" NMCI has not met its two strategic goals\u2014to provide information superiority and to foster innovation via interoperability and shared services.\"  The document also goes on to evaluate HP's performance, \"GAO's analysis of available performance data, however, showed that the Navy had met only 3 of 20 performance targets (15 percent) associated with the program's goals and nine related performance categories.\"\n\nIn contrast are the more recent comments{{when|date=April 2018}} from [[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Harry B. Harris Jr.]], deputy chief of naval operations for communication networks (OPNAV N-6) and deputy chief information officer, Department of the Navy. \"I believe that NMCI in 2008 is achieving much of what we had hoped NMCI would achieve. It's leveled the playing field for security. It's allowed us to do things like push security patches that go through the whole enterprise that's on NMCI. If you look at NMCI historically, it was probably the first step for the Navy to move into what was then called Joint Vision 2010 and now is Joint Vision 2020. It's actually done that, and it's moving the Navy toward the U.S. Defense Department's goal of information superiority. So, I see a lot of good things with NMCI.\"<ref name=Governance/>\n\nNMCI works today{{when|date=April 2018}} and it continues to improve as user needs evolve and technology opportunities arise. During the final two years{{when|date=April 2018}} of the contract, technology initiatives included new hardware, applications, and services to support the Navy and Marine Corps' advanced IT needs. HP will install more than 110,000 new laptops and desktops, and will push more upgrades to improve end-users' IT capabilities through upgraded machine capacity, new operating systems, and new service lines.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Today{{when|date=April 2018}}==\n{{update|section|reason=Appears to discuss 2011 as \"today\" without discussing what happened later|date=April 2018}}\nThe Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) program office, in collaboration with NMCI partner HP, which manages the CoSC program, is deploying a number of new Navy initiatives, including:\n \nTablet laptops for Navy recruiters\n* The NRC began rolling out Hewlett-Packard (HP) Elitebook 2740p Tablets to recruiters in early September 2011.\nHosted Virtual Desktop (HVD) capability\n* Thin-client HVDs using network storage will replace bulkier traditional workstations.\nExpanded support for smartcards\n* [[Two-factor authentication]] using a SIPRNET smartcard token will be used to confirm the identity of NMCI users.\nEnterprise-wide operating system upgrade and improved end-user hardware delivery times\n* New five-day seat deployment initiative aims to speed up the delivery time of new workstations.<ref>{{cite web|title=NMCI Continues to Provide Solutions for Sailors and Marines|url=http://www.doncio.navy.mil/chips/ArticleDetails.aspx?ID=3572|work=CHIPS Magazine}}</ref>\n\n==Next Steps for NMCI==\n{{update|section|reason=Appears to discuss plans in 2009 without discussing what happened later.|date=April 2018}}\nOn 31 March 2009, the Department of the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare System Command announced its intention to negotiate a Continuity of Service Contract (COSC) that would allow HP to continue to provide IT services during the transition from the existing contract (NMCI) to the proposed next contract, known as Next Generation Enterprise Network Solution (NGEN).\n\nUnder the new contract, HP will continue NMCI services, support the transition to NGEN (which includes various engineering services), and give the Navy licenses for the network's operations and infrastructure.  A chief goal of the new contract is to ensure that the network remains up-and-running while the Navy pursues the goals of NGEN.\n\nAs Rear Admiral John Goodwin, assistant chief of naval operations of NGEN notes, \"My responsibilities are to synchronize the efforts of the operations, the policy, the programming, the resources and the acquisition piece,\" Goodwin said.<ref>http://fcw.com/Articles/2009/04/06/NMCI-NGEN.aspx</ref</ref>\n\n==Network Security, Functionality vs. Users\u2019 Permissions, Expectations==\n{{update|section|reason=Appears to discuss 2007 without discussing what happened later|date=April 2018}}\nIn November 2007, a quarterly user satisfaction rating between both the United States Marine Corps. and the United States Navy revealed that 83.8 percent of the military members who submitted the survey said that NMCI was satisfactory.
